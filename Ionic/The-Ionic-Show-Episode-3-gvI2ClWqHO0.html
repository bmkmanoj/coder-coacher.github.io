another show of the ionic show my name
is Ben and I'm max and we have an
awesome lineup of things to talk about
today we're gonna switch things up a
little bit and talk we're gonna dive
into Creator today but before we do that
we're gonna talk about a cool new ionic
app called sworkit which is basically
like a personal fitness app helps you
get in better shape and then we're also
going to talk about ionic box which is a
new thing we just released to help you
get set up with everything you need to
build hybrid apps quickly so let's talk
about that in a second oh we didn't have
time to brew a homebrew this time so
we're drinking New Glarus Brewing
Company's beer spot a cow it's delicious
it's from Wisconsin and it's only in
response it's only in Wisconsin so feel
bad that you can't have any of it with
that sound let's get the show started
all right so first up is working so
sworkit is an ionic built app that kind
of came out of nowhere
left field some wait to say took us by
surprise specifically me being a design
minded a design oriented mind I think it
has a great design they basically they
took ionic and they redesigned it to fit
their brand it's beautiful and prior to
I think they said we got in touch with
their developer they were using jQuery
Mobile to build the app switch to ionic
and saw a huge increase in retention
their star rating went up I have 5 out
of 5 stars right now and they actually
just got featured in the iOS App Store
as one of the best new fitness apps so
basically what circuit does is it it
acts as though it's a personal trainer
has tutorials on how to do different
exercises that all only require like
your body weight so it does like heavy
lifting or you can do more like
stretches and yoga and stuff like that
but we were really blown away by the app
I don't know I've been using a little
bit I think it's pretty awesome yeah so
like they're doing some things that a
lot of people ask about like inline
videos and things like that so
definitely check it out there
the limits of what ionic can do I show
it to people and I'm like you know can
you tell that this is that this is a
hybrid app and no one could like it's a
great app we're really excited about it
great developer millions of installs
very popular app we're definitely proud
to have them using ionic yeah Congrats
to the team - forgetting feature it's a
it's not an easy feat so yeah check out
sore gets in the App Store it's also in
the Android Play Store - yeah so this
work it s work it calm I'm not sure if
we were even pronouncing it right maybe
it's called s work it yeah it might be I
call it's working I like it yeah okay so
moving on no it's it's working because
it's circuit training oh yeah all right
you got there not fair enough play on
words I like how we just figured that
out yeah just now okay all right it's
working so let's talk about ionic box so
ionic box is basically our attempt to
make it easier to install everything you
need to build apps on your computer
it's really initially targeted at
windows developers because if you've
ever installed anything on Windows like
let's be honest it's yeah it's awful
especially Android development and like
this is almost nothing to do with ionic
getting the Android SDK installed
getting Java installed getting ant
setting up all your environment
variables and then installing nodejs and
then PhoneGap or not PhoneGap but not
Cordova and ionic mmm is like it's just
so much work so what we've done with
ionic box is used a popular development
environment set up system called vagrant
it basically it's just a reusable
virtual machine that sets up a
development environment that runs Linux
but it's pretty seamless with your with
your Windows computer so you can kind of
do a little ssh into this virtual
machine to build your app but you can
edit all the code from your Windows
computer so it creates a really seamless
set up for you to build apps for Android
so unfortunately due to apples licensing
restrictions we can't do the same with
with OSX we would love to so what we're
doing instead there
is we've got a beta build service which
I think we talked about before it's
still like it's still in testing but
that will let you farm off an iOS build
on our servers that you that you'll get
back later and that's a way to get
around that but we were still testing
that it's not quite ready for public use
but the point is that we're working
really hard to make it easy to just get
a development environment set up and
start building apps with ionic yes yeah
so check out check out ionic box it's on
our github site it's just github calm
slash drift eco slash ionic - box yeah
people seem to like it so far which is
awesome cool well now that we have that
out of the way feel like we just need to
get to what we we need to talk about
which is creator yeah the elephant in
the room
it is so last time we talked about we
announced that we would be building it
and that you know we were going to get
it out soon we we still plan on getting
it out soon
unfortunately Ayanna Tron has been
giving some early predictions on when it
was coming out I mean he's kind of a
piece of yeah I own the Tron it's a
he's he's a little overly optimistic he
doesn't understand that like humans have
you know real-world problems he's a
robot still running on empathy yeah yes
yes so when I own a Tron said he would
be ready in 14 days like he was kind of
right but like not quite ready to send
out mass invites exactly don't blame us
yeah blame I am joined is that exactly
so let's talk about it because we're
getting really really close it's it's so
close so we're just putting some
finishing touches on it's like when
you're building something like that that
has like a user signup process you you
tend to it you tend to avoid the fact
that you're gonna have to deal with like
user signup settings like changing your
profile signing up logging in all these
things actually take up a lot of time
and so we didn't realize that until it
was like oh we're so close and oh like
we finally need to like let you log in
and actually like save your data so
that's what we've been working on and
it's pretty much that's pretty much
ready to go we haven't we have a few
beta testers using it and it's
it's sweet it's getting close let's talk
about high-level goals on day one when
the beta invites Dougal yeah so we just
want to set people's expectations about
what creator does because there's been a
little bit of confusion the point of
creator is not to be a replacement for
coding we've said this before and we
really really mean it so you're not
going to go in there and build an app
start to finish wire it up with a
back-end service and then getting it
totally totally ready to go project if
you're if your app needs logic you might
be able to do that if you're just doing
something simple like a content thing
but that's not our goal we want to make
it easy to build the UI so you can
export and get coding a lot faster so so
so crater is really a prototyping tool
for the UI it's more like the
storyboarding tool in iOS than it is
something like you know full-fledged IDE
that's not our goal we don't think
that's like a good thing to go after
because it's just it's so impossible to
replace coding through visual tools well
and we we have some cloud here movie if
we'd build these type of tools build
these episodes before and you've seen
the way that people use them and and
truly the best way to use them is is to
and the way to get the most out of them
is to treat them like a prototyping tool
a way to focus on the UX a way to focus
on building what the end user is going
to experience and making sure that's
drilled down perfectly before you then
take that and then tweak it and add all
of your you know brand specific designs
and customizations and things like that
so it's definitely it's definitely
important to point out that like this
tool is not meant for that it's meant
for like getting that user experience
down so you're gonna be able to do stuff
like you know drag in all of the
components that we offer an ionic
currently like buttons and header bars
and tabs and even some some more fun
stuff like maps but but once you have
that stuff in that then you can start
linking buttons to different pages and
adding different content on those
different pages and drilling down that
user experience so that perfect and it's
exactly the way you want it you don't
know so much need to think about the
coding because that stuff sometimes is
not as important in the beginning it's
just focusing on that experience then
you're gonna be able to do fun stuff
like previewing it
almost like we haven't built emulator
built-up emulator in the actual tool and
and like I said before linking pages
which is really really awesome and
that's the kind of stuff that I think
we're gonna focus on getting out on day
one but you'll be able to do and it's
really really rewarding and fun yeah so
on the on the topic of like templates
what we've done is we try to make make
it really easy to create pages based on
like a specific functionality of like so
you have a login template we have a
signup template we have a Maps page we
have tabs we have a slide box so
basically common pages that we see
people building in ionic we've trying to
make it really easy to kind of start a
page with that and then let you change
the content so a good analog is uh is
the key you know
keynote yeah like so basically a
slideshow editor that you can create
templated slides from and then change
the content yourself that's exactly what
we're going for and I think it I think
people love how fast it gets you up and
running the tool is really really fast
it's really simple I think you'll jump
right in and get it and then be able to
build a beautiful-looking UI in a
fraction of the time what I really like
is just how fun it is it's it's it's
enjoyable to drag in components and just
see them update live on your screen I
feel bad I'm playing with yeah we're
gonna get it out soon yeah we got our we
got beta advice before anyone else
that's right
so high level goals like where do we
plan on taking this tool yeah so when we
release this beta like it's going to be
the like bare-bones drag-and-drop get a
prototype to start a new project that
that's bles pretty much it but we have a
lot of other things that we want to do
with this over time number one is we
want to make it easy to theme your app
from the tools so we built the ionic
theme to be customizable like we we
never like wanted people to just take
the base colors and build the apps just
like that we wanted you to take your
brand you know change the header bar
color to match your brand add your logo
things like that so we are gonna have
those features in creator
they're gonna be really easy to use you
can change the base font like use a cool
web font you can change all the base
color it's really easy that's one thing
they're gonna have we're also going to
have the ability to live preview on your
phone yep so those of you who know about
the ionic view app that we've been
testing kind of privately that's gonna
make it really easy to automatically
pull up your phone with the view app and
test a creator prototype right from your
phone which is really really fun to do
yeah it works really really well and the
cool thing is you can share with anyone
else that you want so you can have a
client comments you know test your you
acts like imagine this workflow your
billing lee this like user experience
you haven't written code yet because you
don't have to you can just say imagine
there's some data here like i filled
this with like filler data they test it
on their phone like oh this is sweet
like I like the flow and then you start
to fill out the backend pretty simple
like a great great way to build an app I
think it's gonna be super easy for
people to get into it you're gonna love
it yeah so further down the road we want
to make it easier to integrate with all
the backend stuff out there that is
something that we want to make easier we
don't want to have like a tool that
replaces coding but we want to make it
easy to test data from a back-end
service and do it well do it in a way
that's that works for everyone
because everyone's using all that like a
different like a different set of
back-end services so it's kind of hard
to build like one solution for all of
them but we have some ideas and we're
working on that
no ETA on any of that but that's kind of
where we see creator going I like it so
a lot of great stuff in the pipeline
more components more page templates
components that you can create and
release the community templates that you
can create as well themes these are
things that we definitely want to have
so we hope that you'll love the first
version will be we'll be iterating on it
quickly so what you see when we release
will not be what's there a month later
so that's the goal of what we're trying
to do it's going to be beta so we hope
you'll submit issues and suggest
feedback and give us feedback so awesome
well that wraps it up for this time
I think that just about does it alright
so next time hopefully when we meet we
will have already sent out most of the
beta invites and we can go from there
and hopefully have some new stuff to
talk about yeah we have a million things
planned and and we can't quite talk
about them yet but they are gonna be
amazing mind-blowing alright we'll see
you guys next week bye or next month
next month next month thank you guys
next month we yeah hopefully yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
