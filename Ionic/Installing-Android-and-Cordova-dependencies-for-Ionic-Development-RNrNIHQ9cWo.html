the process of installing Android SDK
Cordova and ionic on Windows 8 so this
should apply to Windows 7 as well
basically just need to go and install
the Android dependency setup Java
download a few other things and after
you know playing with everything it
should be good to go so alright so I'm
just going to go first of all to start
and go download the Java SDK so go to
Chrome or whatever download Java SDK
okay someday that will finish
downloading okay so while we're waiting
let's go in and saw ant so just search
ant to go to Apache ant go to download
binary distributions and down here
you'll see a zip file of a pinching
apache ant just download that and it's a
ant finished downloading so we're just
going to go and extract that
while we're waiting we can also go
download the Android SDK
300 SEK just get the normal default one
with eclipse will do sixty four-bit we
did read the license so make sure you
read this I've read it many times so
download the SDK okay so Java downloaded
so let's go ahead and install that ok
Java downloaded and installed so just to
verify that everything installed open up
command prompt so to do this go to your
Start menu just type CMD and open the
first result that comes up and then just
type Java and you should see a print
something out here you can either type
Java - version to make sure that
installed if you don't see something as
Java is not found go to your environment
variables in the settings edit
environment variables for your account
and then you'll want to create a new
variable name called path and then
inside there put the put the path to
your Java installation the bin folder of
it there so we've got Java JDK 1.8 so
we'd put the bin folder here in the path
and then restart CMD and that path
variable would then be updated okay so
Joe's in Salta now let's go and install
the Android SDK which we've just
downloaded so we'll go and open that and
extract it so it's helpful when you're
installing especially on windows
installing all the dependencies for
doing java development with cordova it's
helpful to go in and read the platform
guides for cordova development so if you
just go to cordova at apache org slash
docs /en slash three point five point
zero you can find the platform guides
for android here and cordova so let's go
to the Android platform guide
okay and so a lot of things that I'm
talking about here can also be found
there but it's a little more obscure so
hopefully this me walking you through it
will be much more helpful but there's a
few things in here that are good for the
Android portion so now that we've
downloaded and extracted the Android
developer kit we just want to remember
where it is in the path because we're
going to need to add several folders
here to our system path variable so this
is what we're gonna have to add the ADT
bundle SDK platform tools and SDK tools
folder to our path so I'm just going to
go in here in the SDK folder where I
downloaded the Android kit
it's got platform tools here so I'm just
going to take this full path and open up
my environment variables again
just add that to the end of the path and
then we go back and find the tools
folder and then I might also add that to
the end of the path
great and then one more thing I just
forgot we're going to want to do the
same thing with Apache ant with the bin
folder here we're going to add that to
our path
great and then close out of a CMD and
then start up again so you might just
want to pin it to your starting your
taskbar make it easier you should be
able to type Android and have it do
something so if it says command not
found to make sure that you have these
two folders in your path but this
absolutely should work so you'll want to
open this and then install some of these
Android distributions so we're just
going to do the 1919 target which is
like Android 4.4 so you probably want to
go back to you know even 14 as the API
but it's going to take a long time to
download so for now we're just going to
do 19 and some of these 20 up here these
SDK tools so let's click install 13
packages you know read all the license
agreements if you want and then install
them and that'll take a little while so
okay so while it's installing let's go
ahead and download nodejs so nodejs is
becoming an incredibly popular tool for
building command-line utilities Cordova
uses it ionic uses it so we're going to
need it and if you have it go ahead and
download the latest release anyways
because there were several issues with
NPM that were fixed recently and if you
don't have a new version things just
might not work mysteriously so go ahead
and download the new version of node and
install that it's a pretty small
download so I'm just going to do that
real quick
okay so now that nodes installed you
might need to add the node JS folder to
your path because mine wasn't finding
the node command and I didn't bother to
restart because that's stupid so I'm not
going to restart my computer just to
install node so go to the end of path
and then just add program files enough
Jess to your path and then open up a new
CMD window
you should have node there you go so it
should also have NPM installed so let's
go ahead and install NPM listen saw
Cordova so type NPM and solve that
shitty Cordova and that should go ahead
and install Cordova for you
oh and you can test that by just typing
Cordova it should just work right so
let's also go ahead and install ionic so
just do NPM install that's G ionic
okay so all our Android images installed
so let's see if we can't start a ionic
project in build for Android so go to
your command prompt and we'll start new
ionic project so just type ionic start
and then my app and we'll go and
download the base image and the starting
tabs template for your project okay so
if you try to start a project and you
get this error here air command failed
fatal could not create work tree
directory this is an issue in Cordova
with git repositories for plugins so to
fix it just really quick that folder
that it's trying to create we're just
going to have to create it manually so
find your user
go into AppData so make sure you're
showing hidden folders local temp and
then we're going to make a new folder
here
plug man
then inside that we're going to make a
get to folder and then we should remove
the folder
okay so just go and if you get that
error just go and remove the folder that
you think I created my app folder and
then run ionic start again
great so that worked the plugin
installed hopefully that will get fixed
soon in Cordova until then just keep
that in mind okay so we can CD into my
app so if we show the directory we've
got a bunch of files here
it's a typical Cordova project so we're
going to do a on ik platform add Android
that's going to go ahead and download
the Cordova library for Android
great and that everything should just
work
if Android is installed if your images
are installed this should just work and
if it doesn't work make sure you go back
to the Apache Cordova platform guide
just go through step by step and make
sure you didn't miss something okay so
now that that's installed we can do
ionic build Android
okay so if you run a hummock build
Android and you get an error here unable
to build app and platform Android please
do consult for more info you'll notice
that it's saying that we don't have Java
homes that correctly so we're going to
go create another environment variable
here we're just going to call this Java
home and it's going to point to the full
path of Java in our program files for
the JDK so we're just going to take the
JDK path here not the bin folder just
the root pace added to Java home hit OK
we're going to close out a CMD again
we'll open that up
see you back into my app
take Bionic build Android I'll try that
again
okay great so I skipped ahead a little
bit aside to restart my computer but go
ahead in our launch genymotion device
and once that's up and running after we
did ionic build we can do ionic run
Android and we'll run our app right on
genymotion so genymotion is basically
just like I said a better emulator for
Android but really the best option when
you're when you're really testing
Android apps is that to have a device
connected and test on the device because
everything will be a little bit slower
than that but the Android emulator is
almost unusable so I just wouldn't even
I wouldn't run the ionic emulate command
at all when you're doing into
development works fine for iOS though so
that should have launched our app here
and we see our dashboard app and
everything is good to go
so that's how you install Cordova
Android Java ant nodejs
an ionic for building Android apps so
hopefully that was helpful this should
work on Windows 7 Windows 8 8.1 possibly
even XP I'm not sure
but hope you found the helpful thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
