edition of the ioniq show today we have
mr. Ayane Trond himself Adam Bradley
lead developer of the ionic framework
joining us and today we're gonna be
talking about the amazingly awesome very
special release of ionic to what it is
why we built it what are some of the
huge upgrades that you'll find in it and
where we're taking on Attock next so
with that out of the way let's get the
show started alright everyone so Before
we jump into all the nitty gritty
details of ionic 2 I think we should
just take a step back and look at the
great two and a half years that ionic
one has had since we released the pretty
rough version of addict 1 alpha at the
end of November 2013 so since then there
have been over 1.8 million mobile apps
built with ionic which is just crazy
these are being built by startups like
sworkit that had millions of installs 5
star ratings
they've been featured by Apple Google
and Amazon two big enterprise companies
that are tracking billions of dollars in
expensive inventory with
mission-critical apps in kind of their
own internal app stores and now we're
starting to see companies build very
popular mobile websites with ionic
because they're realizing it's not
enough to have you know responsive
websites or even to push people to the
App Store like they have to have a great
mobile web experience so there have been
a lot of apps builds and I haven't spin
out for you know two and a half years
and it's it's let us kind of learn how
to build a really great mobile web
framework that's right there's been a
lot of like technology change recently
such as es6 typescript angular 2 and so
with these changes we've been able to
kind of think about how can we take
ionic further and really improve its
performance take advantage of all these
new technologies and really see what we
can do with our lessons learned from
this stress test you know this you know
great framework and again take it to the
future so we've heard a lot of kind of
shock from the angular community when
they heard about angular 2 coming out at
ng-europe it was announced that things
like controllers were going away or
dying scope was dying directives were
dying so if you're an angular 1
developer
looking ahead to angular2 what about
angular 2 is gonna be different like
what am I gonna have to learn to like
build angular 2 apps right well what's
cool about angular 2 is really all these
these things that you haven't used a
thing they're one or it's kind of
getting removed it's no longer a concept
you need to remember need to this
boilerplate code you're now cutting out
the stuff that really is not necessary
anymore so with with angler 2 it really
simplifies things and it's using just
like standard classes are a standard es6
yes seven features from the standardized
process so rather than learning these
patterns that are made up by angular
back in 2009 you're now kind of just
learning JavaScript which is hard
standardized so that's like the coolest
thing I've seen so far with a thing or
two so if I'm like I know angular 1 I
know how to build controllers I know how
to build directives what do I do like if
I'm gonna build a component and Nega
there too like how does that all blend
together well what we've seen so far is
when we reporting angular 1 code anger 2
is that you're really just kind of
removing code because a lot of it's not
necessary like I was saying earlier so
what you see here is like a component
that is really just again just in es6
class javascript class something that
looks new to you right now but it's
really kind of what you're gonna be
start writing today and moving forward
as this is again a standardized just
JavaScript class but it looks new to you
so so but don't be afraid because this
is kind of JavaScript moving forward but
really um sorry I forgot the question
well that's ok
the question was what happens when I
need to build a components and so I've
got a class and you know I'd have my
directive kind of wrapped up in my
function call so how would I bring that
over into es6 land in angular 2 ok so
now that it's kind of just a component
and you just have a class instead of
using dollar scope controllers services
factories you're just really kind of
using member variables on that component
so just like instance data like object
oriented yeah exactly so if you're
familiar with object-oriented
programming you're really just going to
be like oh this makes complete sense to
me and really if you're just new to
programming new to angular in general
all of its going to be like really
simple concepts it's probably the
angular one developers that are being
kind of thrown off but you have a second
and I think people like forgot how
angular one was to learn right like I
had to take like a month off of work
just to actually learn it like okay
let's be honest it wasn't the easiest
thing to understand and like it didn't
seem like any of those concepts
translate over to JavaScript you know in
the broader because right and again is
those made-up patterns that they did in
2009 well before the stuff was kind of
standardized so so I've heard a lot
about typescript and it seems like some
people are using es6 some people are
using go7 some people maybe even think
they're using ES 8 so what is time
scripting like how does that play into
everything so typescript is pretty neat
where he allows you to add types to
variables and alright so big deal you're
making it sure that's a number it's not
a string it's gonna throw errors
that's where not what I'm like excited
about what I'm really excited about is
like when you're building a large
application you're quickly seen it
quickly shows you problems at your app
your application is gonna have it's not
showing you like oh this should have
been a number and that's not the stuff I
care about it's it's that when you have
a large team a large application you
really grow this this source code and
and just like with you know using Java
or C sharp or any sort of object
oriented language it's easier to kind of
refactor and make sense about all this
so it's kind of like a little bit of a
static analysis yeah exactly and also I
also want to make sure that people
understand this is not a required thing
this is something that if you want to
use it for your team or your application
from small to large it's entirely up to
you if you don't want to add types
please feel free not to use types
whatsoever so it seems like something
that enterprise developers who are maybe
more familiar with Java C sharp and big
teams would really benefit from yeah
absolutely and we ourselves you know
angler 2 is all developed in typescript
ionic 2 is all develop in typescript
which then adds types to all of our so
we provide the types of definitions so
that when you're using it in your IDE s
such as videos to decode sublime all the
the manager editors I use that the atom
atom okay all of the major editors
you're going to get the intellisense
that you're gonna get the
auto-completion is going to be able to
go straight to the definition so with
ionic 2 you have all this stuff already
built for you which is really cool
actually yeah so I think
people you know my first reaction from
typescript was it kind of let me harden
my code a little bit you know I could
optionally you know choose to use it
later or I could start right from the
beginning but either way it kind of I
suppose catching errors way before I
would catch them at runtime which is
nice right exactly and we kind of
started out not using typescript at
first and as we started adding it that's
for a lot of like stuff that would have
been thrown is undefined it's not a
function all these common areas you
would have missed normally without a
runtime they start to come come up and
so I'm glad that we started using
typescript for up ionic to itself yes so
the other thing that I've kind of you
know heard a little bit about are the
templating changes and how does that
impact ionic 2 how does that impact you
know people who are familiar with
angular 2 templating syntax because from
what I've seen maybe it's not quite as
drastic yeah it's actually again like it
looks different like you're like what
the heck is all ng whatever now I saw
these got prints ease and brackets
what's going on the asterisks okay just
trust me on this give it five minutes of
using it you're me like oh now I know
exactly what this does you don't have to
read the documentation of like oh it's
expecting an expression but this one
isn't expecting a string this one is
actually kind of method now when you
look directly at that code just right
within your HTML file you're like oh
this is calling off a method or this one
is adding a property down to the child
component it all just makes a lot more
sense now when you look at it what else
is really cool about it's because of the
syntax IDs are gonna be able to help you
out ID using be able to say give you
code completion of like what should go
there and also throw errors and
something doesn't make sense yeah and I
think my reaction was that ng-repeat
should have been called ng for a long
time ago right again another thing
that's just way back to the Stone Age
right yeah the sign age before
javascript was a thing and we kind of
made it work kind of so so on that note
the one last thing about templating is
what about two-way data-binding what's
going on with that two-way data-binding
so I think since angry one came kind of
came out is it's been realized that to a
day MIT isn't the grand all best thing
in the world for performance reasons but
it doesn't mean it's gone away so for
form inputs it's still there
with this syntax here you can see that
it allows the input to like the text to
go in and out using this this new syntax
that they have for so it's kind of like
an event with a binding code right
exactly
but without everything having to be to a
binding and that really increases
drastically increases the performance so
let's talk a little bit about time frame
because I've heard that you know angular
2 is is beta when is it coming out in a
more stable release does this mean I
shouldn't use it yet or I shouldn't use
ionic 2 yet how does that kind of get it
play out so yeah it's it just hit beta
just recently I believe they're on beta
1 right now and there's a lot of big
things coming yet so what you see in the
betas today is far from kind of where
they're going with the next release
which I don't have a direct line to know
when that date happens I don't think
anybody does include mieszko and Igor
but when that I probably know they have
no idea but but it's actually looking
really great you know we've been able to
we've been fortunate to help out angular
provide our feedback and really have
weekly meetings with them of like help
direct how angular 2 is being built and
kind of seen where we've seen weaknesses
so we've we've been fortunate to be a
large part of that process but as far as
what you're seeing today in the beta
versions is a large chunk of that code
is going to get removed entirely because
much of that code is going to move to
the build step
so like template compiling doesn't need
to happen on the fly in the browser
anymore it can actually happen static
analysis offline template compiling at
build time so that means all that chunk
of code that was doing it on a fly gets
moved out of it same thing for what's it
called provider dependency injection
same thing that stuff is gonna get moved
out to hopefully and it's also to meet
that that goal of 10 kilobyte payload
for their hello world app which is a
crazy goal but it's pretty awesome and
in talking with Igor he's explaining all
the ways that they're going to try to
pull this off and so it's a lofty goal
but even if they get it down to 30 K on
payload that's just amazing well and
those optimizations will dramatically
you know improve the bootstrapping time
right and it's all read the
bootstrapping time has drastically
improved from
one and with these happening where the
template compiling doesn't have to
happen at bootstrap and it's just kind
of hard coded into your output yeah blue
t-rex can be lightning fast nice nice so
I think the point is that angular 2 is
going to be a big improvement a lot of
angular developers are gonna feel like
they still understand the basic concepts
which I kind of made me realize like
angular is more of a in architectural
pattern it's a way to build mobile web
apps and it now has two different
implementations so really it's still
angular all the way down it's just like
you know one's using new JavaScript
techniques and one who is kind of built
in an era before standardized advanced
JavaScript so my impression was in is
that you know a couple days you'll feel
right at home it's gonna be a little bit
weird at first but you'll you'll
probably love it and not want to go back
yeah version and the stuff that you
liked about angular 1 is still there an
angler to the stuff you didn't like
about angular 1 has been cleaned up and
removed yeah so enough about angular 2
let's move on to some of the design
changes that ionic 2 is seen maybe why
don't we start with some of the
functional design changes that really
are going to impact developers and I
think navigation is probably the one
that's generated most right absolutely
so that's probably the biggest area for
improvement between from versions 1 to 2
really we used ui-router
in the in ionic 1 and it was great for
simple applications um you know a lot of
our demo apps that we built with it work
just fine but the second one is our gain
complex and second you start like really
wanting to build out a great navigation
that's where it breaks down and that's
where its complexity kind of hurts it
after a while right so I think I
remember a lot of people struggling with
things like how do I pop open a modal
and then have like another navigation
context inside the modal yeah and with
UI router you were so tied to the URL so
you mean like this little tiny string
needs to map to this complex navigation
and that's kind of where it broke down
so yeah that's that's it's it's
challenging because if you have a modal
and you're also having a navigation box
behind it you kind of have two URLs like
that would match like two URLs right so
it just kind of felt like it didn't
quite work for the
kinds of navigation that a mobile app
usually has yeah and with that so that's
why it's kind of giving us the
opportunity to like will study how i OS
android are doing things with their
navigation and they're kind of using
more of a push pop system mean that if
you think of your applications you're in
the App Store application as you
navigate between pages you push on a new
page and you can like infinite when you
push on new pages and us web developers
we're kind of hard-coded to think like
well I want to go into a certain file I
want to go to dot HTML file and that is
one page and we're not that's always
going to be the URL for this page so to
use kind of an analogy like you just
brought up with the App Store app on an
iPhone yeah I can view like the
Minecraft app I can view it on tap one
if it's like a featured app I can view
it in the browser tab because like I'm
going through like a category of top
games so it's like that page exists it
could exist in many different places and
be identified through boyfriend like
URLs we had that right exactly and a
page is very um it's very generic it's
just very dumb I can load anywhere it
could be inside of a mortal
it could be inside of a its standalone
page it could be inside of a tab a modal
inside of a tab inside a side menu it
really doesn't matter because the page
itself is a self-contained thing and
it's not tied to this structured URL so
okay so let's actually talk details with
ionic to so yeah kind of an ionic one we
had like the eye on that view and it
seems like we have something similar in
ionic 2 and it's just a little bit more
programmatic yes so we have ion nav
still and what you do with that is just
like with our pushpop system like you're
pushing on new pages and the ion nav
itself is very again standalone just
like how a page or a view is where you
could have a nav inside of a nav inside
of tabs inside of modal inside of a side
menu the nav itself does not know that
it's a parent or child and with that
power like with with being able to
decouple that from the hierarchy of how
the navigation works or that really the
application works it gives you the
developer a lot of power and how to
structure their app and how to say
alright I'm three levels deep but I want
the highest level to navigate navigate
back one they can programmatically do
that so ok so I have a page and it's
inside of 8
which is inside of you know something
else that has like so there's maybe like
three navigation stacks sure my page
will get injected the closest navigation
controller and right and then like I can
use that navigation controller to push
and you page us on and they'll stay in
that context or I could probably climb
up the tree and do something a little
bit crazier if I need it to like reset
like it right exactly it's like a common
use case would be an app starts at the
login page and the login page is just a
boring standalone page with no header
you log in and then it comes slide in
and the tabs page so the tabs container
is its own page itself but inside of
that has you know three different pages
or three different tabs and inside of
each tab is many different pages but
each one themselves is not aware that
any of that is happening yeah and
actually you bring up tabs which is
interesting because I think this shows a
fun way that ionic is actually superior
in some ways to the native API is
because Apple doesn't really let you
easily actually I don't think they let
you push tabs onto a navigation stack it
has to kind of be the route so a lot of
people struggle in native land like I
have a login page how do i navigate to a
taps page and so they usually use
modal's so ionic kind of lets you do the
nav the native navigation style but also
expand on what you could do natively
which i think is pretty cool
yeah and bets that the login tabs
example they can do you know a user can
be logged in and when they hit logout
that's where they would the developer
would climb up to the highest level of
nav stack and then pop that hold tabs
page to go back to the login page right
and so we've heard a lot about no push
pop what's happening with URLs so yeah
URLs all of this that we were talking
about makes it sound like you know we've
ditched the URL completely well that's
not the case
because we're so programmatic of how an
application is built by the developer it
still allows us to have kind of an
internal navigation stack of all these
different navigations and all the views
that are inside of them and from that
we're able to then inform the browser of
like okay we've the developer wanted us
to go to these you know go forward three
steps and when that's done and would
then notify the browser like okay we're
now at this URL so ionic itself does not
require a router and with that design
decision it allows us I like to really
be become very powerful but it still
could work with
like the new component router in English
exactly so it works um works great with
the new angular 2 router so the way we
see this the URL is kind of like the
it's the state manager of like it's for
the initial state so yeah like a
breadcrumb to get back there like a deep
link yes so we didn't we have not
ditched URLs URLs are a big part of the
web and I'm firmly from a firm believer
in the web the web thank you for using
the web and and how the URLs play and
play with that so with that again it
loads the initial State and then it
keeps track of where your ass like if
you were to hit refresh or you shared
that link with someone is gonna be able
to load the app at where you left it off
yeah so I think the the example that I
like to use is let's say we navigated to
your contact page right and we could be
in that contact page of million
different ways that we got there from
the app but if you reloaded that or like
sent a deep link it would always load
your contact page it just maybe wouldn't
have the crazy history that the user
took to get there yeah while they were
like using it that's only relevant like
during this session right exactly
but what's cool is you could actually
build out a developer could build out
like okay I want to go to this page and
you could you could have like well then
the back three pages would be you know
the about us yeah and the info page so
again like developers have a lot of
control like what is in every single
stack yeah and now that you bring that
up
Spotify actually kind of like a big
really popular app I'm a huge obsessive
fanboy of Spotify but what they did was
interesting where when you load up
loaded up the app they used to like just
throw you back into like your Allmusic
page but now they actually try to
reconstruct like your last three like
pages so if you were on like you know
your favorite playlist it would actually
bring you back there and refill the
history and if you paid attention you
notice that it's not how it used to work
so they're doing that because they think
it's a better user experience but it's
because they wanted to and it felt right
for the app and it might not feel right
for everyone's app so it just gives you
a lot more control yeah and so
developers could do the same thing with
ionic like if there was a certain URL
that users hit you could say well
because it came to this landing page
let's build out this navigation stack
for them sure sure so enough about
navigation let's maybe move on to some
of the new components in ionic 2 because
we want to give people new things new
fun things we want
solve problems for them and I think
there's a lot of examples of how ionic
to does solve it from a component
standpoint right so on that note before
we completely go into components I do
also want to mention how navigation and
side menus the side-mounted kind of
drastically vary things too because the
way ionic one worked was that a side
menu wrapped all the content and always
knew how to slide things back and forth
but that caused problems with complex
navigations if it had multiple left
menus or they had left menus that
changed out for different reasons or
they had side menus inside of tabs and
then that would have a side menu the
would the old structure of having a side
menu wrap things really caused a lot of
issues so we fixed that Nyack to by
making it a sibling and really can be
anywhere so you can have any number of
side menus that can any number of them
can be enabled or disabled so again a
lot more power and you don't have to the
side menus can be found from any
component yeah and that's probably I
think that's probably a better fit for
like the material design overlay style
yeah it feels more like it's not a
wrapper it's just like a extraneous kind
of menu yeah it's always a sibling kind
of to the content and also it also
switches per the platform you're on so
iOS has kind of iOS feel it's your
design feel for Android devices and also
that's configurable yep cool so side
menus can be awesome it's probably gonna
solve a million problems for you guys
navigation is better every time I talk
to people and I explain the changes to
them they're like oh yeah that's like I
had to hack around that yeah and so I
love hearing that it's like okay we're
actually solving a real problem people
have had and I think I think you're
gonna love it
so navigation huge improvement let's
talk about some of these new components
yeah so the biggest thing we did with
our components was we really kind of
brought mature design front and center
before we design an ionic one kind of an
iOS feel and they're like and then
afterwards mature design came out after
we had created ionic one so then we kind
of like implemented like it made a
couple of CSS changes here and there to
kind of give it a material design feel
but since then with ionic 2 we've been
able to really split apart the two
different themes entirely and so there's
not mature design built on top of iOS
it's two separate CSS files to separate
you look at the source code to separate
sass files for every
component completely modular which then
also allows us to really break apart to
allow a ten more styles and really make
it easy for users to customize yeah
because I think it was getting a little
bit challenging having to override some
of the you know deep class nesting yeah
get your own styles it was I know the
the feedback from ionic 1 users was it
was too hard to customize because like
our selectors were a little bit too
complicated
yeah so with two we've really reduced
its electors drastically and because
we're not trying to have them both run
at the exact same time there's not each
other having to step on each other and
having to override so if you take a look
at like the CSS now is so much easier to
to really override yourself you can use
sass and just use your classic CSS it
just makes a lot easier so awesome and I
hear that forms have gotten a really big
improvement in lists and and other
element yeah right so we've we've we
lotta lessons learned of how developers
were using forms and what they wanted to
do with them so we made sure that we
really structured them in this new sense
that allows it allows like toggles like
multiple select elements inside of a
ion-ion item multiple you can have a
text to text items in the same thing so
the control is a lot more controlling
what there was before and the probably
the biggest pain point was the the
native elements and how browsers reacted
to usually select yeah so the Select
element has always been kind of a
challenge with mobile browsers because
they all kind of act differently each
browser acts differently of how what
happens when you click that element
whether it's on touch start or Mouse
started like there was all different
especially the prevent default or how do
you manually focus it so these are all
challenges that ionic had to try to
solve so with ionic 2 we just kind of
avoided all those issues that just
already plagued us from the beginning
and really just kind of create our own
ion select component and it's
drastically helped yeah and I think if
you're the user on the mobile web
browser especially on iOS like the
select is not friendly like you kind of
open it and then you're stuck you're not
sure do I click the page so I you know
tap done and I think it's just the
native control didn't really give you
enough control like it would in a
native app and those rarely yeah rarely
something you'd see in a native app so
yeah we kind of wanted to avoid the the
native select element to begin with and
create one that we think is more natural
to to native apps right right
so the select elements got a major
overhaul what about things like pop-ups
and alerts and some of those kind of
presentational user interface yeah so
with ionic one we built them out over
time and they kind of kind of form their
own little api's over time so that's why
it's been great with ion 2 that we kind
of studied what people were actually
using with them and we ramped they're
really kind of simplified and have this
common API that all modal's action
sheets alerts prompts confirms all of
them share the same look and feel so
it's easy to understand how they work
how to close them dynamically how to
find them quickly how to find them like
program eclis and close them and even
like submitting the inputs are after
your like a prompt would submit inputs
and it confirms me what's it makes it
easier just with this new API that we
have and it sounds like along with form
inputs which are gonna be more natural
we're sticking with native scrolling
everywhere yep and fixing some of the
issues that ionic one had with it
because that's just the foundation here
doesn't have the same problems and I
think some of that seems to be related
it's like tap in my click event yeah
exactly so because we were using
JavaScript scrolling to begin with
because it kind of solved a lot of
problems we had with older browsers but
that's no longer really a problem that
we have with today's browsers and the
ones that we support so we're using just
native scrolling and because we're using
native scrolling and not working working
with touch start and mouse move and all
that we avoid many other tack like
issues that we had but also kind of cool
is just recently iOS Safari announced
that the that they're removing the 350
millisecond delay was also a huge
problem so that's another you know big
win for ionic and all like mobile web
app developers - yeah I know that's a
great one and it's just kind of
unfortunate that something artificial
like that gain a mobile web apps such a
bad name and apples done so many awesome
things for the mobile web and and Safari
is really showing that so this is kind
of like the the last big issue that I
think was holding back mobile web acts
and like we were able to get around it
but it wasn't quite a deal
now I think it's just gonna be a huge
improvement going for yep certain in iOS
9.3 I believe Google we won't have to
provide our you know touch start packs
to try to get a click to happen faster
right so let's move on a little bit and
talk about some of the awesome new
design and visual changes and material
design yeah what's going on there yeah
cool so when we built on ik 1 we
basically based it off of iOS iOS 6 and
then quickly iOS 7 came out and in all
that time frame then material design
came out so because we've been out for
two and a half years and new designs
that come out since then we've kind of
had a like keep updating to stay up with
the styles and because of that like the
original CSS has kind of formed some
Croft over time and it's made it
challenging to like override the CSS and
the selectors but because we've been
able to you know a lot of lessons
learned of how to write well written
sass and how to write you know a large
scale framework we've been able to
restructure all the staffs complete
completely separate so iOS design and
material even see SS files finalized
files and written if you look at the
source code you'll see that they're
completely different modular format that
allows us to really take advantage of
not having to override other styles and
with that materials I'm is like fully
supportive so we've got this cool
material design look and feel using the
exact same markup that you were writing
before something we try pulling off with
v1 and it works somewhat well but not
like with v2 it's some Vaughn you know
full-on with any looks awesome yeah it's
super awesome yeah it's just super
awesome all around pretty much yeah so
with material design we also get a few
new font components right yeah so
material I offer some really cool stuff
like the ripple effect the way the tabs
work and a highlight I kind of have that
highlight the fat button yeah the fat
button chips I love chips yeah we all
like chips that's great very candy we're
going today we're in Austin yeah that's
good so the candy oriented like a design
and then really the other one is like
the dialogues what materials i calls
dialogues what we call modal's
kind of has the same look and feel as
exactly what material design would have
yeah I mean if you if you look v1 and v2
kind of compare
side by side it's a pretty huge visual
improvement like it just looks a lot
more refined
yeah really check out our v2 Docs and
check out the components and you'll see
a big difference yeah I think people are
gonna you know add it to their app and
kind of upgrade their app and be really
impressed with just how much better they
look outside of the box but then they're
even easier to kind of customize for
your brand right yeah a lot less CSS
which is a good thing because it allows
you to customize it and I've said it a
million times I might have already said
it in this case I don't know but we want
a million we don't want people building
millions of ionic looking to ask you
want a lot of people billing millions of
apps with ionic and it's it's so far
with ionic one I feel like we did a good
job with that but I think it's gonna be
even easier yeah and I think that was
kind of the original goal with ionic is
we didn't want people just building a
million you know iOS 7 looking apps we
wanted to let you build really custom
ones like if you look at any major app
it looks custom it's built for the brand
it's built for their style so it's
really important that you can change one
variable and have you know your color
red as like the header bar red and you
can customize it to have like you know
maybe unique UI elements so these are
all the things that I think we really
liked making easier and I think they're
even easier now so yeah another thing I
wanted to mention was ionic ons
ionic runs 3.0 actually we've added over
our Ben has added over 900 icons that Fe
was busy that's been very busy over 900
icons but what's cool about it is that
they actually there's a one-for-one
reference between metier design and iOS
so you can write once that I want to use
the home or the star or the favorite
icon and it's gonna have that look and
feel for the platform it's on so again
your markup looks it's written one way
you only have to worry about it once but
I heard ionic is able to switch it out
depending on the brand right so you can
kind of just do like you know icon tag
and then the name maybe goes home it'll
figure out all like the complicated
class names and everything yes a blur
yeah it's pretty cool yeah so a lot of
new icons much simpler templates index
absolutely so let's let's wrap up the
design stuff there's there's a few other
things that have changed we'll let you
kind of figure them out and find them
and have a wonderful time discovering
all the cool new stuff but let's quickly
talk
native controls and native functionality
so as some of you may know and we did a
terrible job like kind of promoting this
but we had a project and we still have a
project for angular one called ng
Cordova and ng Cordova was a side
project that kind of grew out of the
community basically trying to make
Cordova plugins have you know things
like promise support things like
triggering angular digests and when we
started building this like simple
wrapper like here's how you can take a
photo with the camera plug-in and then
having you know trigger the digest and
update your app we realized it was such
a common pattern for all these different
other plugins that the community you
know rallied around it and submitted a
ton of new plugins so there were some
downsides with ng Cordova and I think
one of the biggest ones that you know
you guys have probably felt the most is
it required a lot of custom code so we
got into a situation where there were
problems with ng Cordova that were not
problems in the plugin and so kind of
created additional surface area that
added some maintenance overhead and like
with ionic we just you know it kind of
fell behind so what we're doing with
ionic 2 instead is we've we've created
this project called ionic native and it
basically wraps these native plugins
native functionality in a lightweight
way that doesn't really add code but
basically lets you interact with angular
lets you interact with any other
framework that you want you might want
to use and provides promised support
with native es6 promises and then
observables for things that are gonna
kind of stream data like geolocation
watch position and going forward I think
we want to add a ton more plugins and
this will be kind of a new project for
us we've been a little bit quiet about
it but expect that to be a default in
all of your starters as we kind of roll
it out so it's kind of more of a generic
way to get these applications or get
these Cordova plugins into ionic but
really does not specifically Franek yeah
exactly and I think one of the big
misconceptions with Cordova apps is what
they can do natively a lot of people
don't understand that you can do
anything you have direct access to the
native layer you can even do things like
show native views like a Google Maps
native view in your app so you really
can do anything and everything that a
native app can do and now it's up to us
to make it easy to integrate that but
but in a way that's not kind of a
creating additional maintenance work so
that'll be rolling out and I think
people will really like it'll be very
easy to make your own plugins yeah cool
and one more thing about that is it
comes with type script support so you'll
get auto completion so you'll be able to
say like you know camera get picture and
it'll give you the right arguments and
that I think will be really cool yeah
and some we haven't mentioned so far is
like everything is is modular in the
sense that it's on NPM so if we want to
add these new versions of like the
different plugins it's gonna be just up
upgrade the new version and so it's not
just kind of ad hoc way of updating
versions it's not kind of a standardized
MPM stuff yeah it'd be really nice so
let's move on a little bit and talk
about build tools because for those that
have kind of been turd in the es6 the
high script etc there's all these
different tools now there's all this
terminology people need to learn like a
bundler a module loader transpiler look
what does it all mean and what are we
doing it for yeah it's it's never-ending
and we could easily do multiple hours
show about this this last year year and
a half it really has been like there's
been a lot of churn in the whole
javascript community community of how to
figure this all out so we put a lot of
time into this to try to figure out
where's that sweet spot of making this
easy so that developers can worry about
writing their applications and not spend
hours and weeks trying to figure out
which tool that I use this tool is a
fraction better than this tool but this
now replaced with this one but it's not
compatible with this one it's really
never endings but I think what we've
kind of come up with now it is a great
combination of build tools that we're
continually trying to improve so when
they go in and someone starts an eye on
a to project what kind of build tools do
we give you the package like what do we
give you out of the box okay so as of
today we're using webpack
and sass together well web pack is
stand-alone and that's that's the this
new system that now like pulls pulls
together all these different imports and
bundles into one big file which was
really not really a thing that was
required with
anger one because angular one provide
its own modular system and but now let's
really work with anything else right it
worked with angular and that's all I
needed to work with and that just kind
of fell apart after a while but with the
new system and used in es6 modules we're
using webpack to kind of bring them all
together in a standard form and we
recommend using commonjs and that's how
all of our starters are set up and then
we use sass as still kind of a separate
build process because we realized
there's there's many different solutions
out there there's post CSS is another
kind of new one that we're keeping an
eye on it's really kind of cool but
really Nelson has showed us that
anything is better than sass we really
enjoy using sass the communities already
use and it's the most widely used
preprocessor hey yeah it's a kind of
feels like just better CSS I think
that's probably why it's been so
successful and what's cool it's like it
is just CSS so that means you don't have
to be a software developer to know how
to use it so web designers can easily
step in you know in-house developers can
easily come in and and design that for
you so as the web developer is working
on the application designers can be
working on the look and feel of things
so I just want to touch on one thing
that I love about the new module system
that's just kind of part of yeah yes
thanks future is that you know you
really can just go to NPM and find a
module that's been kind of exported in a
friendly way you can type NPM install
you know this thing like let's say you
have a calendar component and now you
can just go in your code and like import
that calendar component and the the
build tool will properly bring that in
so yeah there's no more like Bower
there's or you know Bower worked pretty
well compared to what we used to have to
do but you don't even have to go copy
and paste like scripts into your repo it
just kind of works so I think it's easy
to reproduce and like rebuild an
environment so really really cool what's
cool about this new modular system is
with ionic one kind of got it all but
now with you know specifically web pack
and picking apart like well I'm using
this one I'm using this one it
customizes this own bundle for you yeah
and so let's be clear about Bower
we're no longer you're gonna be using
that so if you're if you're relying on
up today we recommend you start you know
moving in NPM
we publish official ionic 1 &amp;amp; 2 NPM
modules for just the library so so
definitely recommend switching to those
and same thing for ionic on zest now NPM
module 2 cool so let's wrap everything
up I think as people start to look into
ionic 2 there's gonna be a lot of
questions a lot of cool apps being built
I think the initial reaction from our
early alpha has been really positive
it's been going great yeah I think
people get what we're trying to do they
get the improvements there's a probably
a little bit of overhead just switching
to angular 2 but it seems like once you
kind of get over that like one-day
hurdle it's like okay I get this and
make sense it's pretty straightforward
yeah exactly it's it's um again like
angular 1 the the stuff you love going
there one is still there but now it's
just easier to use yeah and looking
forward a little bit I think we are
really going to be pushing using ionic
not only for native apps but also for
mobile websites
google has been doing a lot of
interesting changes with their search
algorithms where great mobile web
experiences are being ranked more highly
in Google search Google search isn't
going anywhere a lot of mobile web
traffic is still out there
they just published in data that said
something on the order of 60 percent of
people who visited the mobile web kind
of interstitial that forced you to
download the app 60 percent of them just
completely abandoned it so if this is a
bigger macro trend where you know
retailer is pushing someone to download
the app and losing 60 percent of their
traffic all right yeah I think like the
future is really going to have a lot of
mobile web apps being built to kind of
make sure we're not losing these users
so ionic is gonna be ready for that
we're already ready for it and that's
gonna be something that we really push
hard on yeah ionic to really an ionic in
general it just has a huge advantage
being able to run great on the mobile
web you'll know run great in Cordova and
be pushed into the App Store it could
even be a desktop application so there's
a enormous opportunity with using ionic
right so I think it's gonna be really
exciting next few months we hope you
enjoy the beta if you have any issues
please let us know on the repo tryout
the demo apps let us know if you build
anything with it we'd love to blog about
it and payout it and I think you're
gonna love it and we hope that you have
a great time with it yeah and thank you
thank you so much for making you know
ionics success I mean we can't thank
community enough like we're blessed with
how many people selling much so yeah
yeah you guys Rock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
