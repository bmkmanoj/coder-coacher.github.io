I'm Ben and today we have another ionic
show where we'll be talking about some
really interesting things and those
things are song hop which is an ionic
built app that helps you finding music
syncs with your Spotify sure does and it
is very dandy and then we're going to be
talking about some new branding changes
that are going to be coming up for ionic
start to share some of our thoughts on
the change and why we think it's
important and then lastly we want to
talk a lot about the ionic IO platform
which we just kind of announced and
talked about kind of the stuff that
we're going to be building on top of the
open source project and why we think
it's important why we think you will
find it really interesting so let's just
get the darn show started oh that all
right so let's talk about song hop so
song hop is an ionic built app obviously
that just went live in the App Store
a couple weeks ago we wrote a blog post
about it featured it so maybe you've
already heard of it maybe you're already
using it we use it if you haven't though
you should download it it the way that
it works is it'll sync with your your
Spotify account and I mean you obviously
have to create your own account on song
hop but then it'll suggest a new music
for you in a really simple way where
it's basically uses like the you know so
it uses the tinder style card swiping
demo and we created and know why don't
you show it off because it's actually
really cool actually can you show it off
for me I don't know if we can capture
that we might have to fake that later
we're going to cut this right now and
I'm going to be showing it off here no
but basically so you swipe back and
forth you like music if you like it it
adds it to your collection of music and
then you can save it for later you can
add it to your Spotify basically it's a
great way to find in music and I know
that you specifically
have a thing where you are always
looking for new music yeah I like
perpetually sick of all my music you're
perpetually unsatisfied with your music
so for anyone else who's like Ben you
should definitely try to SAP out and see
if it doesn't help you find some new
awesome music right and like the really
cool thing about it is like no one would
know that this isn't like an amazing
native app it's it's so well done
they've done a great job they've done
like tinder style swiping everything you
could want in your app like it they've
done it what does this they like did the
puppets like a inverse pop over there
doing some really really cool cool stuff
no I'm gonna keep I'm gonna I'm gonna
interrupt BAM here keep going do my
thing
I know within the first second whether I
like it we're done
okay so download song up if you haven't
already it's an awesome app uh again
totally 100 percent ionic although you
probably wouldn't know if I hadn't told
you so let's talk about ionic
ionics future what we have planned right
so yes so a lot of people ask us what's
next after the framework you know where
are we going how are we going to make
money like you know how are you going to
become a big business and we've been
kind of quiet on that because we've been
working on the framework and we will
continue to work and and the framework
is probably the most important thing to
us in a lot of ways but what we've kind
of realized looking at what people have
been building with ionic and how the
problems I've been running into is while
there's an ecosystem for native
developers for all the different things
you need for your app like push
notifications you know a/b testing
analytics there really isn't any kind of
platform out there for hybrid developers
and in fact a lot of these companies
just purely don't care about hyper
development I think in large part just
because hybrid development is kind of
new it used to be kind of not very cool
it was kind of taboo to build apps that
weren't native because people thought
they sucked and I think we've all kind
of proven them wrong and so so we
blind-spot it's a blind spot and I think
what we've seen is if you give hybrid
developers better tools they will build
amazing apps like song hop is an app
that just kind of blew our minds and
what we want to do is build a set of
back-end services and tools that make it
really easy to build and scale hybrid
apps and give you like abilities that
native developers don't even have like
what what how does a native app change
like how does an app change when you can
update your app in real time like push
an a/b test in real time without
resubmitting the app or doing analytics
that understands the UI better than
anyone else I think what we're going to
be able to do with hybrid is
really interesting and we want to lead
that up yeah so so we've been talking a
little bit about it but ioniq dot IO is
is our new platform site we'll be
releasing a lot more information but if
you go to ionic do you'll see this
landing page that's basically a hint
about what we're doing and and what
we're doing is basically building a
back-end is a service focus on hybrid
apps we're not trying to like replace
coatings we're not going to be like a
code based one that kind of like parse
lets you have like backing code we're
agnostic on that part but we want to
have like services for you that are
really really easy to use push
notifications analytics live updating if
you test AV testing things like that and
and we're really close to actually
launching a lot of this stuff yeah it's
been really exciting to build you know
we have some internal apps that we're
testing our stuff on and we're making
progress on it and it's been we are like
super super pumped and it's brought on a
lot of internal discussions on like you
know where things headed obviously we
have 1.0 coming up and we're working
towards that and like we already said if
the framework itself the open source
project or SDKs we've been almost
calling it I think a lot of us recently
is always going to be like the number
one priority of ours is we will always
support that and it will always be free
and I think the way that we think about
that and how we can actually achieve
doing that is is by having these tools
and services to complement the framework
or to complement the open source project
such that we can continue working on it
right so the services let us build a
strong business around the framework
which we've kind of like we've given a
taste of that before where we've had
other dragon drop tools like kind of
like the Creator or actually built a
business around them oh there's going to
be a little bit different where we're
actually building it around services
rather than tools I think it's just a
stronger way to build a business so we
will be releasing a bunch of stuff in
the beginning of 2015
creators kind of the first taste of that
which you know basically it's out we've
had thousands of people using it they
love it
we'll be sending more invites but it's
pretty much it's pretty much usable so
and it's important to to make a note
that not that we are sending out
thousands of emails each week but there
is a lot of people on the
so we're just going through it in the
order of which people signed up and and
fixing bugs along the way and we promise
you we'll get your Creator invite in due
time but it's it's been it's a bitter
process setting sending out the invites
and all the upkeep with the servers and
everything so with its people get your
invite I know everyone has a lot of
questions about that so we want to make
sure that we answer that right so moving
forward one big change or small small
change to you but it's big to us is
we're probably going to stop referring
to ionic as a framework which is kind of
hard because our domain in our Twitter
both have framework in it but we realize
like as we built our onic we're more
than just like a framework we're not a
CSS framework we're not a JavaScript
framework we're like a collection of
mobile development tools we have that UI
framework if you will but everything
else kind of makes us much bigger than a
framework so as we move forward we're
going to start referring to a ionic as
an SDK ionic do will be the backend
service around the ionic sdk and we're
gonna have to figure out what the hell
we do with our domain names and things
like that yeah but it's not going to
change anything in terms of our focus on
development and our you know we gotta
get 1.0 and that will be coming out soon
yep
so so so really short term yeah short
term roadmap one point I was coming out
soon we're gonna have a ton of upgrades
a lot of like performance improvements
scrolling improvements things like that
transition yeah transitions everyone
will have access to creator and we'll be
pushing it really hard so you'll be able
to just like use it for everything
ionic dot IO the platform alpha will be
coming out soon so you'll have access to
our analytics build service live
updating that stuff's coming soon
probably early 2015 a lot of like small
little pieces are starting to come
together it's a really exciting time and
we appreciate you know all the support
yeah definitely we do so I think that
pretty much covers what we want to talk
about today yeah it's been a really busy
fall we want to keep this short
got tons of work to do yeah we want to
go heads down so lots of travel slowing
down now so we'll be focusing on getting
one point now out and these services so
cool that's all we got all right we'll
see you next time take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
