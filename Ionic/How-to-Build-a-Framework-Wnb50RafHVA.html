realization that was actually built
ionic which we'll talk about today
presentation for this chat yes so first
of all so and define what a framework is
before I get into this framework is
basically a set up period of tools and
code that you can use to build an
application without I'm going to worry
about it being meant to the wheels so
for example you're building one that
you'll use Django or rails you'll get
all the more validation
you'll get form processing database URL
routing some it would be a complete
waste of time to write under every kind
of go down new JavaScript just remember
the angular ember that gives you index
data binding structure your application
so that's the academic definition of
what is just my way of doing things
I think it's not your way it's not
everybody it's not your way to my way
exist
it's a few artistical manifestation of
the fact that me the metaphorical
developer I think I'm a better developer
I think I could design something better
than you I know the domain better we do
so we see all these people building
because they all think they can do
something better than everyone else so
frameworks are this egotistical like
desire to put your code and put into
someone else's code and make them use
your stuff to build their self so that's
like a very cynical way of looking at a
framework but it's been true but the way
the nice way to look at software to
become kind of rigorous mathematical
truths
it's very open-ended so going back to
the web app example like rails and they
kind of achieve the same goal but you'll
do by in with ones like set of values
and
so solve engineering since artistical
thing so we see a lot of grammars people
have different ideas of how software
should work for the developer it's very
creative process and on top of that
there's still a ton of uncharted
territory so every technological
advancement like the iPhone account and
they built a scoring on the bottles like
huge portion of this map that needed to
be discovered we needed tools for
development we needed frameworks and
skill sets to develop so we're
constantly finding ourselves like in my
chart in territory we need to create
tools we need to use the tools that
exist in order to get er done
so that's a that's what favorite is
that's that's why we will continue to
see man them out there so I want to talk
about that we don't so our area is :
it's an open source HTML 5 dollar
framework you would use it if you want
to build a quality mobile app that feels
ended but using only web technologies so
we built this thing because we thought
the weather was running on mobile but
needed tools to memory
when using mony web technologies and
things like into the desk so we built
framework a set of UI elements
JavaScript libraries CSS the website
documentation tutorials we build a brand
we build a company all these things just
to let our framework have left so this
is a this is a screenshot of github page
since we've archived at the end of 2015
so first of all I think the most
important thing kind of correcting
it's time to be loose and not just
stupid but you need to be crazy like you
need to actually believe that you can
pull this off and in frameworks are
becoming so intense that like the fog
early my cradle should be like it's
talking to you that's because so this is
like when we start building this we
looked at all the other frameworks we
had some serious competition and we
thought wow I don't know this makes
sense so much work like these products
have more contributors all this stuff
and you realize at the end of the day
and so you need to be a little bit so on
top of that you need to egomaniac
because you need to look at everything
that's out there and know that you could
do a better job so
I said we could design this better we
can make it faster we can use better
technologies and we actually believe
that and we start telling people that
that's what we're going to do so we have
to have an echo of our other words no
one would care so I'll save some of
things but we looked at some the popular
ones and we just didn't think they were
meeting you be able to take us into the
teacher so we had to be good like
everybody like there maybe be a dick but
just believe in yourself and know that
you could do better come to us you're
not
so assuming you're crazy not stupid you
believe in yourself you need to start so
building a framework building software
for other people to use is really
responsible and you can kind of get into
that we just plan like oh I need to
build this like perfect architecture
in practice so what what kind of sport
dynamic was I was playing with the hit
jet on my phone and I was like using the
side mimic now it's just like thinking
like you know we could really do this
with particularly just so many gestures
it doesn't like feel about enough so I
can see I could get a look at javascript
demo using gestures using css3
animations and css3 transforms and
builders like Emma that I felt really
really needed and we showed it to
everyone like that was kind of start so
if you're gonna build a framework start
building right away start telling people
why it's better start getting people on
board so why building this thing
building an audience is really really
crucial so with my onyx we have a new
job almost before we had so that's kind
of like I think so
particular malar essentia whatever and
then we have some like what would be
better
what would make a switch and we thought
that all these things that would
actually make them switching validated
what we're doing be this more excited
and got us through the next like four
months of just like so the other part of
this is we see so many products because
no one ever hears about we're no one
ever uses it and it proves it because
that first release is always going to
suck but we had there was this growing
movement of people who think that jQuery
so strong about jQuery it's not it's not
future the other one we had was we were
going to be
yes which wasn't the case when we
started so we're building basically a
CSS framework with JavaScript library to
make the interactive user interface you
could use it with backbone meteor ever
angular but we realized that we didn't
take one of them and we did get a single
community no one would care about so we
took the strong opinion that we think is
the best way to build applications with
JavaScript period we've been really get
on board we have my word
and it's a good thing we did that
because the thought of supporting every
framework under the Sun makes me like
get rid of scared because just so the
opinionated tell people why why I've
been hit one last little thing we have
that have loved getting to fight about
people it's like a building that's
stupid
I think it's idiotic time to play some
money it just doesn't make sense of the
future
I think developers would want to but
there were tools that were so that's
been finding that not everyone agrees
with you find these communities where
that that has more strength than others
and that helps us guide our marketing
efforts and of the sky like you know
sales in the future but it gets to know
so okay so then you're building this
thing first of all it has to be able to
source like the world does not provide
like what happened to be mobile
development on the web is he has like
two or three year gap right early yeah
they didn't use like all the sources
like a sales tactic but it wasn't
actually open source but all the source
comes in and destroys so make sure your
frame groupies fully open source like
permissive license but you have a
balance being on the smart
so with admin bus was we we released our
get that remote as like a pre-alpha just
to get some feedback for people and what
ended up happening was this like broken
like totally not ready version of the
project got submitted attackers which
was awesome the graphic but it was
typically a really bad first impression
we kind of lost control over launch
along the same lines we we wanted to
impress the other chess team so we're
kind of waiting before we release this
to show them and someone submitted like
this broken version to thank you they're
like a Google+ page on a Friday
afternoon
it was throw me into the bathroom
impression like this pendant like Friday
night working on it so that's how now
were they happy
but the point is that the open source
community will take your project and run
with it which is awesome but just be
aware that you lose the trouble if you
need to have a watch so building a
community project is probably the most
important thing you do so I was actually
just set a home to sort of summit a few
weeks ago and there was this contrast
between companies that just made
something up in source and released it
to ones that actually foster your
community they participated as if they
were just another community member those
products always succeeded and the other
ones fail you can't just pull this or
something release it say hey
everything's on the source to use it
because people use it like they need to
have so we started doing this with a
forum really ridiculous released the
forum got people or people communicated
we helped them out like we were married
adversity sometimes this was important
to kind of solidify authentic people in
the community and now the community
serving
this is so much work we're just getting
started here so building keys to succeed
but you need to make sure that you also
don't let community kind of destroy you
because people like you and then you
find out so it's important to make sure
that you're not letting the community
kind of take too much of your time
because they're better off if you work
on if you work on your phone so we've
kind of really be better about this
first but now we're place that support
with good documentation good tutorials
so practicing love is really the plus
side of this is if you're Stern and you
like push for your vision people really
respect it and it's almost Weibo I think
you just kind of need to do that so we
can definitely treat
and I think you want to build a
successful product it has to be that I
think communities we take popular
struggle to maintain them but they will
not gonna make them so a couple of be a
manipulative so just a few more slides
in front
Automation is really really important so
the supervisors video off the ground
people are using it they're building in
automation is the most important thing
to do that so we have for example the
Travis CI process that takes our every
commit to give up runs our test feeds
updates the CDN new nightly releases
updates the website when we ship before
these generates our documentation
sometimes it's for us that sound like
really like a lot of stuff but having to
do that manually for every release is so
much work it was taking us away from
working and folks in making us just
kinda make a bunch of mistakes and
having to edit places so we invested
several weeks just kind of thing so this
is really really so most of all the most
important thing for a successful open
source product is that there's a vision
like all these things add up to a vision
we're young so for us we think the web
and web technologies are the best way to
deliver class
yes it's early but we are going to be
leading that charge to make everyone
really like that mobile app spread of
the anomalies so that's our vision
it's we know things that don't make
sense that they we know things that kind
of don't believe in all these web
standards as the ultimate winner this is
hard to do like sometimes people get
upset repeating things that have
different visions and so people buy them
stuff that's just gonna happen
in this article to kind of prove that
we're going to be right over time so
have a vision for your framework be loud
about it be opinionated about it have
the rest of the marketing company on the
landing page get people excited piss
people off but be patient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
