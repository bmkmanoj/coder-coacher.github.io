team and today I want to talk a little
bit about learning ionic after you've
exported your Creator project so Creator
generates all the templates blank
controllers and stuff for you but maybe
you haven't used ionic before or you
want to know how to dig in deeper a
little bit and you're just getting
started out so App camp dot IO is one of
our websites where you can learn ionic
and it's super easy so we have the
basics section where we go through just
a little bit about how ionic works in
general various components that are
available to you we have an angular
section which goes through how to
actually use scope and controllers and
things like that in angular with ionic
now we move all the way to user
interface which goes through different
things like lists and how to do a lot of
the stuff that you're used to in
applications action sheets modal's
pop-ups all of this stuff so that you
can get in and add that additional
functionality to your app and then on
top of that fetching data from an API
posting JSON data other networking stuff
like that all you have to do is sign up
for free and this is going to walk you
through in browser so you don't have to
set up anything on your computer to use
an app camp in browser you're gonna be
able to edit ionic stuff play with it
and try it out as you go along
so check out app camp Daioh if you're
looking to learn ionic and you're just
getting started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
