of engineering and product at sworkit
we are a digital fitness platform that
helps people get workouts wherever they
are and however much time they have so
originally it started out as just a Ruby
script to kind of you know randomize
some exercises and taking that to the
next level okay this could be a good
website and then kind of instantly
thinking oh wait like this would be
really good on my phone and just kind of
thought okay it's really time for
sworkit to grow up become a bit more
than a side project you know the time
ioniq was still in beta but it was just
it just it was exactly what we needed I
mean you know just starting with even
like the templates that ionic was
providing you know work from there build
out the app and pretty quick it was just
a pretty dramatic change and we added a
little bit of design and it just really
felt it's really grown-up like really
professional at that point I think with
ionic once you got started there wasn't
a big learning curve to kind of go in
any direction you could just kind of
follow along the docks which were really
good look at the examples and just kind
of start to pull out what you want
you've got people who know HTML CSS
JavaScript you're gonna be fine just
diving right in and making progress
the ionic community is phenomenal I mean
you know having the forum there having
the actual ionic team involved with all
of that to you know answering questions
like you could tell how much they cared
about what they were doing and the
people who are using it and everyone's
kind of in that phase of wanting to help
you show they're wanting to learn
everyone's kind of learning at the same
time it was really great
being a startup we're continually
thinking about you know what can we
start to build and what can we improve
what can we experiment with so working
with ionic and hybrid in general just
really lets us move fast so we can you
know get things out there start to learn
from it go back to the drawing board
look at the analytics rebuild put it out
there again experiment you know so
everything we're doing just trying to
whether it's increasing revenue user
retention we could build those
experiments execute on them very fast
and just keep the business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
