team and you're watching our weekly
workshop today I'm pumped up because
we're gonna do something a little bit
differently we are actually going to
start breaking our project okay so I
want to show you guys how to debug a lot
of common errors by going through and
breaking a ton of stuff in this app and
fixing every piece so we're gonna go
through for instance CSS properties that
we don't think are working we're going
to go through not injecting things
properly maybe using some directive so
if we're gonna do a ton of stuff just to
try to break this app so as you can see
I've started out with a basic side menu
app and I wanted to start out by
debugging one of the most common things
which is not or having CSS that we don't
think is actually taking effect and
using our kind of CSS window over here
the debugger to figure out what is going
on with that actual CSS so the first
thing I want to note is we're going to
preview this okay well yeah okay so
we're gonna preview and I just want to
figure out what element this is so let's
look this is an eye on item right so
let's go to our theming and let's say
that I want to make an item so actually
let's make this custom class so let's
just make this like red background okay
and let's do background color is red
okay and we're gonna save that sucker so
we've got red background here and let's
add this to our home button classes red
background now as we can see nothing
happened in our designer window we don't
have a red background and nothing
happened in our actual display either
see it again let's right-click on home
and inspect this and let's start to dive
in and figure out why this element
didn't get a red background so here's
the Ayana item that we put the class on
right and we can see the background
color red the red background class
actually is working on the eye on item
it's showing up in chrome if this was
being overwritten by anything or if it
wasn't being applied it would be struck
out there'd be a line through the whole
thing and it'd be grayed out but it is
working so as we can see here over
our Dom tree that got generated you have
a list we have an alien item but
actually inside this ion item we have an
a tag an actual signifying a link
because this list item is a link the
inner portion is an a tag so that a tag
we can see actually has a background
color of FFF so let's try changing this
up a little bit and see what if if we
can fix it so let's take this and say no
you know what red background but then
inside that we want if I can type right
we want an a tag okay and let's save
that and let's preview it and we still
don't get that actual color so let's
figure out why so here's our a tag in
there and we can see okay now red
background a is on there it's applying
the class to the right element we're
getting background color red but it is
struck out by our browser now why is
that now as you know this tree is kind
of applied in order so things at the
bottom are have already been applied and
then things up further this list start
to override previous options that are in
here so we can actually see that dot
item complex item content okay has a
background color of white that is taking
precedence over the background color red
that we set so this is a built in ionic
style that's taking precedence instead
of this okay so let's go ahead and just
to be on the safe side here
let us go like that actually you know
what let's just try just dot item I
content was that it
I already forget all right so that's
saved and now we get a red background
color by switching it to dot item
content so just red background didn't
work using the a tag didn't work but
overriding the actual class that ionic
sets that background color on the a tag
using dot item content works to get us
that background color red so let's just
double check it shows up in here it
shows up okay in our preview as well we
have now successfully overridden this
style to be black
just great because I just clicked on it
so there we go that red is back red
background item content overrides now we
can see that the old background color
white has been crossed out so through
this process of working with CSS
sometimes it look like things just
aren't working right but the reality is
that maybe it's just on the wrong class
or something else is overriding it it
kind of got to spend some time in the
actual debugger the CSS thing here to
make sure that your content is getting
styled appropriately all right so we got
a red background on a list and that was
probably one of the most complex things
we were going to try to break today
let's move on and break something else
so let's go to our home page here and
let's let's do a direct a special
directive on an input okay so let's
here's an input right we're gonna do
let's do password okay and we can we can
even change this to a password type
right but then let's go down and let's
add a scope variable your scope dot show
password equals false right and then
let's add a directive to this input
let's do ng show show password okay so
theoretically what we've tried to do
here is set a scope variable to false
and so we can hide it and get rid of
this whole password input right now
let's do a preview so as we can see that
didn't work okay the password is still
here and actually the input is gone so
just the input disappeared I can't click
here I can't type anything but the whole
thing that we probably wanted to get rid
of is still there so now when you're
working with directives and maybe
something isn't working quite right your
number one place to go is to click this
little button here and see where the
directive has been added so by default
on inputs for things like ng-model blah
blah all that stuff you'd normally use
we actually default your directive
placement to be on the input so if you
want to hide this entire thing you
actually want to move it to the label
okay the completely outermost save and
close that and now when we preview that
scope show password false should get rid
of the entire input
for us so whenever you're working with
directives and they don't appear to be
working right remember just open this up
so you can see where it's actually being
placed and make sure it's being placed
on the element you really want it on I
normally after every time I had it
directive just kind of click that look
at it make sure it's right and then
close it right away
all right let's let's break some other
stuff okay here is menu dot home right
so let's go to cart and let us take a
button and let's assign this button to
ng click go to home and then in cart
over here
let's do scope dot go to home is a
function and we want to do state dot go
right so state go to whatever the state
was from our home page we can copy that
here and do menu down home all right so
this let's just say you're working with
code right we know we need to use state
to use go and we're gonna preview our
cart page click this button and we
should go home right so let's preview
that click it and we get a nice big fat
error over here and as you can see we
actually clear the console every time
you do preview for you so you can easily
see what errors are being generated by
your app so right now we've got
reference error state is not defined
that's our error we can see you know
this whole tree if you click this little
VM 8:04 blah blah blah blah yours will
say random stuff we can click that it'll
actually show you the section of the
code that that error has come from okay
so it'll show you what's been generated
for the code base here so let's go here
boom and let's figure out what's wrong
so it was undefined that's the issue
that we have to fix so the most common
thing for undefined is actually not
injecting a specific service from
angular so let's take this state and
let's make sure that we put it in the
function so we handle that injection for
you if you put the actual name in the
function declaration so function scope
is getting injected state params State
now we can use state echo hopefully when
we do this it will actually navigate
there we go we navigated we
nice back button everything worked we
did not blow up and get an error all
right what else do we want to break uh
uh all right let's break some modules
all right so let's add a new javascript
file down here and let's just call this
awesome dot j/s okay we're gonna call
this module awesome and we are going to
in here do awesome awesome sauce it's
gonna be your service and let's just
return an object testing is going to be
a function and let's let's alert testing
all right so we've got our awesomesauce
service here we've got it an arrow
module let's go to our home page and
inject awesome sauce and we should be
able to do awesome sauce testing and
call that right there so whoops actually
I didn't s there we go you know what
let's do that let's put the S there
let's put some random characters safe
all right preview what's going on okay
first of all we got unknown provider
awesome sauce provider awesome sauce
in-home controller so this straight-up
tells you we're in the home controller
you tried to inject awesome sauce we
couldn't find the awesome sauce provider
something went wrong you know our entire
thing is kind of broke here you can see
there's no header there's no anything
but it's like even if I didn't have the
debugger open if you start to see weird
stuff like this you know open your
debugger so you can start looking at
this all right so clearly awesome sauce
is somehow not being defined so let's go
back here we have angular module service
awesome sauce now this whole thing is
actually in a separate module called
awesome and we can see we've got this
important note here rename my module
blow and add your module to angular
modules above okay so let's go to code
settings angular modules and make sure
we actually inject the awesome module so
now that awesome is inner angular
modules we should be able to preview
this and now get that alert the reason
it showed up before pretty even did is
because it's already running and
injecting that right okay so now it's
still
screwed up now what is it that reference
era is not defined right so that was
that random stuff that we kind of put in
here where it broke our whole thing
because of a syntax error or a variable
not being defined or something like that
so now we should be able to preview will
get that alert from the service and our
page will be back to looking like normal
and being navigatable okay so overall
you've got a module that doesn't you
know it's not being ejected right double
check and make sure you know you've
typed the service name right you've
imported the module through code
settings angular modules and that
everything is happy alright what else do
we want to break let's like just for fun
break something completely and utterly
like let's destroy it okay so let's do
something like let's add some like
random text now obviously you're not
gonna do this but maybe you've you know
deleted this end bracket okay and you
know let's save that and let's just see
what this does
so you deleted the M bracket maybe
you've got some code down here you know
blah blah let's preview and we get a
completely blank screen so this is the
other kind of common debug area you
might get is your app doesn't show up at
all now as we can see it shows up in the
editor and normally when things are
showing up in the editor that means on
the creator side it's fine when you go
to preview we add in all the custom code
and it's broken so we get an uncaught
syntax error unexpected token bracket
right on caught error failed to
essentially my tap due to you know some
crazy errors module app is not available
you misspelled it you know all this
stuff well let's start off with this top
one here right and we are going to be
able to see that you know it's just
overall confused so this is kind of the
hardest one to debug because it's just
saying look we found like a bracket
someplace random and we weren't
expecting it because before you got all
screwed up you know it's just it's very
confused so like we kind of just got to
go through and check like okay what's
going on our most common case would be
this little red X so we can see there's
an unmatched curly brace which means we
didn't end it so let's get rid of that
put our curly brace back save that
preview testing we got that from our old
controller and we are now back to normal
again so overall there's a lot of
different ways that you could break your
application and the debugger really is
your best friend so you should be in
there working on your CSS styles you
should be in there doing the console
logs yet again we'll clear that for you
whenever you preview so hang out in the
console feel free if you are like in
your home controller let's get rid of
this we stopped getting an alert you can
do like console Don info like here's
some stuff and then we can do scope show
password
you know this console logger is
completely available to you so you can
see we preview here's some stuff falses
the variable for that so you can use
console.log and if it's broken your
errors will pop up here overall it's
your best friend working in creator is
kind of like working locally you know
we're just showing you your app so use
those tools that you normally would when
developing locally like the chrome
developer tools whatever developer tools
you're using so hopefully that was
helpful you know I just want to teach
you guys kind of how to debug in the
Creator tool so I will catch you guys
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
