creator team today I want to just
quickly show you all the different ways
that you can link pages together from
within creator so I've already created a
default project here has just got a
blank page and a separate login page so
the first kind of element that's going
to allow you to link things together is
buttons so you've got your standard
button and over here we've got this link
and we can link it to the login page now
when I go and I test this we do that we
get our nice back buttons everything
works exactly how we'd expect it to now
there's a lot of other elements that you
can use to link things together as well
another one just multiple buttons in our
button bar each one of these can have
its own link over here on the right hand
side also images have the ability to
link directly up to something so you can
link this image here and then we also
have list items so here we have a
standard list item that we can link to
something that has now created its own
parent list as well and list item with
thumbnails can also be linked directly
to other pieces of content so those are
the primary ways that you can link
content together you can watch the side
menu video and the tabs video to learn
how things are kind of linked up using
those but overall these four should be
enough to get you started and now you
can link pages together in your app and
see how all of that works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
