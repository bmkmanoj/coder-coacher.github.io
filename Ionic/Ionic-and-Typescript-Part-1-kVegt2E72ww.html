the adds features such as classes
modules and type annotations to es5 we
can also get features such as code
completion and intellisense inside of
our editor let's look at how we can take
an existing ionic project and set it up
for typescript so you get started we're
going to need to create a source
directory where we can place all of our
typescript files since any valid
JavaScript is also valid typescript we
can copy the code from the Jas directory
inside of our app to the source
directory and then just change the
extension to dot TS now typescript
doesn't actually run in the browser but
we need to compile it down to actual
JavaScript so let's set up our build
system I'm going to open up our gulp
file and I've already added the
reference to gulp TSC which is our
typescript compiler and we're gonna come
down to our paths and we're going to add
a reference to that source directory
that we just created and we'll just
gonna say source and we're going to
target any file that's inside of there
that has an extension of dot TS now from
here we need to create a compiled task
that will handle passing those files to
the typescript compiler and then piping
that back into the Jas directory from
earlier
so we'll say gulp dot task I'm going to
create a compile task so take a function
and we're going to take gulp dot source
and we're going to pass in the source
path right here and then we're going to
pipe that into the typescript compiler
that we've imported
up here now once that's done we're going
to take the output of that and we're
going to send that back to the js3 from
inside of our dub dub dub now we also
want to make sure that we're watching
the typescript source directory that way
anytime it changes we can just kick off
the compiled task again so we'll come
down to our watch task we're gonna
actually copy this line and we're just
going to change it so way anytime the
source directory changes we're just
going to call compile so if we come over
to our terminal we can run gulp compile
and we can compile everything down to
vanilla JavaScript if we go back to our
editor role refresh the file tree and we
can see all of the code that we had
inside of our typescript file in the
next video we're going to look at how we
can take the same app that we've have
set up here and start utilizing some of
those type annotations inside of our
typescript files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
