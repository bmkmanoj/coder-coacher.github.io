ionic show my name is van my name is max
what's your name that's a great name
fantastic name I love that name that is
a good name we have an awesome show
today we're gonna get into some really
exciting things it's been a while then a
long time too long it's been legit it's
been far too long so we're gonna go over
some ionic apps that are out there in
the wild we're trying to catch them all
we are gonna talk about ionic to talk
about some routing in ionic - I'm NATIVE
we're going to talk about some prices
web app stuff going on a lot since the
last time you guys chatted when Adam is
on the show we're also going to get into
ionic creator which just had an awesome
new release come out and we're gonna get
into the meat of that or the vegetables
of that if you're vegetarian and we're
also going to talk about the ionic cloud
platform which is quickly quickly
approaching production release we're
super pumped about that so we'll get
into some of those details and then last
but not least we're going to get into
this level the IPA that we are drinking
today local love the IPA and I just
found out today is my PA day today yeah
we just found out today is actually IPA
day so choose to that without further
ado let's get the show started man it's
been it's been a long time it feels good
sitting here no I was just thinking the
other day you know it's been it's been
too long since we were here with all our
friends follow our ionic friends all
around the world thank you for having us
favorite topic ever thank you yeah oh I
own it my my favorite topic is a hot
okay sure yours yours can be beer okay
fair enough
so what do we have to talk about today
well let's start with ionic to get out
of the way so everyone can kind of skip
the rest of it that's all I care about
right we have so much to talk about with
ionic - it's been a long time coming it
has been up we've been working so so
hard on the next release its
it's so close to being done like so
close the RC is so close but it's just
we're just not quite there there's just
a few more little things we need to
figure out what will get into that so
let's start with some fan mail and by
fan mail I mean forum posts it was
actually just searching about ionic - is
this a new thing we can do this is a new
thing I just was thinking like it'd be
fun to talk about like what other people
say about ionic I like it and embarrass
them in front of a national
international audience and embarrass
ourselves
that's a given okay so I found this
forum post that says my take on ionic to
having just crawled out of the old
school app coding woodwork on to ionic
one I was like taking my first steps
going forward and walking upright I just
found my feet just apartment and then
ionic to happen I have just had my first
look and ionic - is like sprinting think
Usain Bolt that's that's fast it is no
doubt a giant leap for it but I very
much doubt whether it is gonna be for me
oh okay so we didn't read the whole post
I should have read that first
that was the compact that hurts but but
in all seriousness I checked the forum
post it was from January 30th that was
eight months ago we've come a really
long way angular2 was I think in Alpha
back then were they not even beta
they maybe were in beta but it was it
was a rough day those so one thing we
learned is we read the whole we read the
whole fan let's first yeah let's get to
you in the fan mail before we decide to
read but honestly he made a good point
it was really painful back then it was a
really really it was really hard to get
up and running with ionic - it was still
a Malphite about yeah or even the last
ionic show when that was written we had
a very confusing build chain we had web
pack over here we had gulp over here no
clear answer and what we were
standardizing on we didn't really know
where angular was gonna go we didn't
know where JavaScript was gonna go we
didn't know where typescript was gonna
go we didn't know anything about the
tools that we're using underneath and at
the same time we were still learning
about what we wanted ionic to to be so
in January 30th like and I we totally
empathize with you guys our feel this
every single day it was hard for us to
build this so I want to talk about
things that we've done to make ionic to
10 times easier because the goal when we
built it was to make it 10 times easier
a hundred times easier than ionic 1
otherwise we were like well that would
be a failure for us if it was harder
than ionic 1 so in the meantime what
we've done is we've dramatically built
out our dogs so if you go to ionic
favorite calm / doc /v - we have tons of
examples of all the components we have a
getting started guide we have to Tory
'el we have to all these resources now
the community has been like stepping up
writing awesome tutorial thank you it's
been awesome and speaking of Doc's we
should talk about a lot of the love that
the ionic native Doc's have been getting
because there you have some recently
some really big improvements on that
actually we just wrote about it I think
a week ago but I nickname is a new thing
that we just released if you've been
actually working on it a lot but but we
actually have a community member
Ibrahim yeah and he's been he's been
doing awesome work on it because
eight months ago it was very challenging
for people to figure out how to use
native Cordova plugins with angular 2
because they wouldn't update your they
want to run the change detection so you
need to figure out how to use ng zone is
really complicated so ionic native is
another example of what we've done to
make ionic to developing with I think
too much much easier yeah and then and
then finally like the tool chain is
starting to standardize so angular 2 is
kind of converging around web pack 2 we
are starting to work with them to get
that incorporated typescript is much
more stable now all the features work we
threw out babel and es6 like that was
such a kind of confusing mess for us we
had an es 6 way and then we had a type
of way because we were kind of sitting
in the middle like okay well type
scripts kind of new or two or too afraid
and we intimidation and actually I get
this question all the time like at
meetups people often ask what do you
guys think about typescript what do I
have to know what types of good we
should probably just spend a few minutes
let's do it like this thing we were
really actually I think a little bit of
posed at first using typescript because
we just weren't used to it we didn't
really know how it was how it worked I
hated it
I'd be honest like it really didn't like
it I miss dynamic typing guy I used
Python
I came to JavaScript because I didn't
have to specify all my types like that's
what I like and so when I had to do it
with typescript I was angry because my
IDE was yelling at me that I wasn't
using the right type here I'm like I
don't really care it's a freaking number
just deal with it alright so for me like
the rules were kind of constricting but
what we found since then is that when
you actually do incorporate types and
you do start to use the tools like we
are working 10 times faster our code is
way more stable there's fewer bugs in
the typing actually is given our tooling
like a ton of interesting metadata to do
things like help us refactor and move
the symbols around and now there's some
new tools that help you analyze your
code base you can't do that without all
this rich type information yeah I think
we've actually had a full like 180 on on
typescript yep since the initial like
playing around with it but back then we
were like okay we're gonna try to push
es6 with babel be
cuz that was kind of what react was
doing and it seemed like a lot of people
like that and babble is winning but if
you look at the es6 space very I think a
lot of questions that are still
unanswered
whereas typescript for us and I think
for a lot of our community answered so
many questions it made people feel like
okay
typescript is it works it's it's
consistent the tools are kind of there
for me like it's a it's a very mature at
this point language so so we're super
excited by using it I think Adam likes
to say it's like writing JavaScript with
your seatbelt on
yep all right maybe that's just a sign
no you do where you see about right do
you wear your seatbelt great then you're
like touch me yeah okay so we covered
typescript what about let's talk about
ionic names a little bit - yeah we have
us we wanted to take some time out and
go into I mean you kind of already went
over the overview but I think it's
recently gotten a lot of love well the
project didn't even exist until I think
this this spring and for those who knew
about Angie Cordova we built that
because with angular 1 there were all
these weird things you needed to do with
like scope digests promises and all this
stuff to like make your code feel like
angular and ng Cordova was pretty
popular but we messed up by not a by not
pushing it front and center and making
it available for every single project as
a default and then also we wrote too
much code on top of the plugins so it
became difficult to maintain
so with ionic native we were like okay
we've got typescript we've got this
environment that doesn't actually rely
on any framework it's really just es6
and modules that were importing so for
us we were like okay we could wrap all
these plugins out there in the Cordova
world add types to them document them
put them all in one place and make them
really really easy to use in like an es6
class-based environment and then also
have all this amazing benefits by being
this being able to say like okay this
option that I'm going to pass through
this camera plug-in I actually know what
the fee
I mean and they're typed for me so it's
been a way for us to really like improve
I think the usability of the corner of a
plugins like curate them and have them
all in one place yeah and also trying to
like proliferate the knowledge around
the fact that you can do all the same
thing with ionic native or back in the
day with ng Cordova you can do all the
same things that you know native apps
can do you can access all of those
native you know features phone features
on your phone and get all the same
functionality that you're looking for
when you're building with Cordova or
you're building with you know a hybrid
app and that's really the the goal of
ionic native is to perpetuate that and
like teach people that actually it's
very very possible to do all the same
stuff yep so ionic native for a while
this is kind of like a small project we
weren't really working on it it wasn't
documented we had plenty of people tell
us in in in not so nice words that the
docs were just terrible so we have
really hustled to get them to be in a
much better place part of that has just
come from us promoting the project now
we have many more contributors more
people are using it more people are
helping documented submitting pull
requests so that alone is helping it and
the cool thing is it doesn't rely on
angular or any framework it is just
tight script and and and actually it's
just either vanilla JavaScript if you
use the bundle he has six modules if you
want to use them or typescript so you
couldn't use in any single project
whether or not use ionic like that's
that was kind of a cool of it we wanted
it to be agnostic for the Cordova
community yeah cool so check out ionic
native we have a pretty in-depth blog
post on it on a blog or just go to the
docs but can check it out there and see
all the cool stuff we have and we're
still working on it this is a work in
progress we're going to continue to
improve it we're gonna continue time
investing in it we trying to do a lot of
different things all at once right now
but we're really happy that we were
finally able to find some time and extra
resources to actually spend on ionic
media and like the people we in the last
few months we've added six to seven
really great people to the team and you
know for a while like we were kind of
spread thin and like we've really really
gotten some awesome help recently
velocity has gone up super-excited to
kind of launch all this stuff we've been
working on yeah we have a lot - a lot to
release obviously yeah so I think we
should also spend some time and talk
about our new router the routing and
attitude what is that routing routing so
what is it if it's between router and a
router
well a router is a router a router is
magic let's go into this so I feel like
we we could dive deep here basically
everyone keeps asking us about ionic 2
throughout how am I gonna have a router
how am I gonna use angular 2's rather
and for a long time like we've kind of
been like okay we were thinking of
incorporating angular to drought earth
which is you know a solid a solid router
and what we've actually come to the
conclusion of is that in order to enable
people to build apps that navigate in
the most native possible way a standard
router like the one we used in ionic 1
like UI router like ng router the
original angular router like angular 2
router it was gonna be really
challenging to get a traditional
web-based router to work like a native
navigation system so that's when I say
routing we're actually gonna start to
refer to this as a deep link engine
because that's what you do on a native
app you're you're linking to content
hidden deep inside of you know what is
what is traditionally not a web app and
there's a whole ecosystem builds up
around helping people link to content in
native apps which ionic apps are so it's
contextual right so like if you have if
you're navigating through an experience
on a native app inherently it's going to
have a different flow of content and
information than you would normally get
on let's say like you know just a mobile
website the bright for the same contract
and it's just not going to be stacked in
the same way and so the routing has to
account for that it has to be contextual
in that way so a good example is like
the context contacts app you can kind of
navigate between contexts contacts but
contacts you can navigate like
infinitely and the back button kind of
shows you this huge nested thing they'd
be gone had gone through and like okay
that's a good analogy for the standard
web browser now take a look at the App
Store app where you have tabs and inside
of each tab you can navigate
indefinitely as well but when you switch
between each tab and I've got a blog
post kind of showing off this exact was
an example coming shortly when you
switch between each tab you notice a
back button changes completely in the
history stack and each tab is totally
different so we've got this concept of
nested States nested navigation that is
not really there's no analog in the web
browser world and and these routers that
we're using on the web side they are
awesome they're helpful they're really
great but when you actually get down to
navigation in the app they're very
they're a little too rigid you have to
very explicitly map where each page is
gonna live in the hierarchy so let's say
on that on the App Store app to use that
example because I think it's a really
good example on the featured tab I can
go check out the Twitter app if it's
featured on the Search tab I can go and
search for the Twitter app and if I view
those two Twitter app pages they're
practically identical except they're
actually totally unique distinct pages
and so to do that in a router I have to
actually map and say okay this is the
feature tap and then the app detail page
and I'd have this nested route and I'd
have to do the same for search but the
way it's actually built underneath there
is no nest strict routing like that it's
totally freeform I can navigate to any
single page in the entire app from any
other page and I don't have to declare
routes for it instead what I end up
saying is hey if you want to share this
page here's a unique deep link to get
back here so the navigation is not
driven by URLs while the app is running
but a URL can be used as a breadcrumb to
get back to this unique place and if you
notice to continue with the abstract
example if you share an app store URL
the App Store app actually loads and
doesn't select any of the tabs it's like
this kind of weird default experience
and what that showed to us was it's up
to you as a developer as the app
designer to decide what happens when
someone clicks a link and comes from
somewhere else
and there it and you need to give them
like a good default experience and
that's really a design problem so so a
router we found was was was a little bit
too restrictive so instead all the
navigation in an ionic 2 app is done
with push pop where you basically say
I'm gonna push this new page on I'm
gonna pop it off and you can do that
nested pretty much infinitely and you
can have ten a hundred and parallel
history stacks is whatever it's
completely free for me and and in the
end every page can say okay if you want
to get back to me here's my unique URL
but I'm not going to necessarily show
you your entire progress when you come
to me in like a fresh app instance this
is kind of confusing so I've got a big
blog post coming that I think will
distill forever yeah and hopefully we
can make some graphics to go alongside
it to try to convey the concept cuz it's
kind of an abstract idea when you're
trying to explain it but when you kind
of yeah and it's not as well as it it
makes a little bit more sense it's not a
standard web development thing but
honestly it's really intuitive I mean if
you're used to using apps you already
know what this is and we're just
describing something that it's like
trying to describe someone how to ride a
bike you if you know how to ride a bike
you just know how to ride a bike kind of
if that makes sense it's like using vim
I can't tell you how I use it but I
sells know how to use it I use Ben we
know you use me everyone knows use them
all right so change that cheers to that
so so let's let's let's link to a blog
post ideally yes so you guys can read a
bit more and learn a bit more about how
we're gonna be tackling routing it's
gonna be awesome it really is gonna be
fantastic we're so excited about how it
works and it's gonna enable us to do
some really interesting things but one
of the things that I think we should
talk about that kind of is a nice segue
is progressive web apps yep because this
is another thing that ionic 2 is really
really set up to take advantage of and
allow you to take advantage of so if
you're not familiar or
haven't heard the term yet a progressive
web app is basically just a fancy way
for describing a mobile web app or you
know essentially going to a URL instead
of downloading an app than all of its
content you actually just do it through
the browser it's entirely web-based
which is great because ionic is entirely
web-based meaning aside from being able
to deploy to traditional you know
platforms like Apple's iOS you know
androids Play Store or the Windows Store
you can now also target the mobile web
with the exact same code that's the idea
that's the goal that's the dream and
we're already seeing this happen yep
so for a long time we were kind of like
oh progressive web apps I think there
was a lot of hype going on this spring
about them because Google was pushing
them hard and I think with good reason
with good reason airing that there
Google Google really really wants people
to invest heavily in the web because
when you go to Google search they want
you to stay in the web and not go
necessarily to someone else's App Store
right whoever that is so that may be
yeah so whoever that may be so so they
have a really big incentive to push the
mobile web and as part of that this
whole progressive web app thing is
confusing and also there's a ton of
marketing jargon getting thrown around
like it's not actually not really that
difficult to understand it's basically a
rebrand of something that's already
existed you know prior to the idea of a
progressive web app there are a few new
interesting things that come along with
the progressive web platform we'll get
into that and actually we have a
progressive web app that we want to show
you guys so that that's kind of what I
was gonna get to for a long time like I
know people have been hearing us kind of
talk about it because for me I'm like oh
cool now all these dynamic developers
can deploy to the App Store but also the
mobile web with the exact same code but
we didn't really have any good demos it
was kind of like hand wavy but now we
actually have a really awesome demo
thanks to one of our great new employees
Justin who put together an amazing
hacker news client that runs as a
progressive web app on kro
on Android feels amazing feels like an
amazing native app it does it kind of
blew us away I was like yeah
they'll tell you I was obsessed with
that I was telling everyone like oh my
god you need to check out this
progressive web app built because it's
amazing it's fast its fluid and the
experience just of a progressive web
apps and also like the the detail that
he paid it pay attention to made it an
incredible example of like I'm
progressing like that yeah not only is
it awesome to just see it open that way
but it's just it's fast it is it feels
faster than what I was expecting
I'm trying to load it up here so in the
meantime Ben can entertain you know it's
actually it I think the thing that I was
the most impressed with was the
scrolling in the app yeah I mean most
people who use ionic one know that
scrolling is the the bane of their ionic
one existence I know we use JavaScript
scrolling because it we could get pulled
a refresh to work back in the day it's
our it's bane of our existence too so
honestly this is one of the reasons why
we're building on hanok - so one of the
many reasons so the cool thing about and
I'm just loading it up here on my on my
Nexus the cool thing about it is you
should say what is that so that's a
nexus or is that just the nexus outside
the Nexus 6 yeah so but it'll work on
I've been iPhone users some kind of an
Android new but basically the cool thing
is like I can go into it in the browser
and the immediately in Cotton's show
well what cut in show but I'm just gonna
pretend like you can see what I'm doing
I immediately what I noticed is the
Chrome Chrome's chrome the browser
Chrome on Chrome actually turns orange
because that was the theme that that
that he set in the int in the app
manifest file and the app manifest files
like this additional metadata file that
chrome reads to do fun stuff like make
your app feel more native so in this
example they've actually said okay I
know this page represents or is an app
that's orange so they display the orange
color in the header it's a minor thing
but I think it's cool now the other
thing is
this is just a mobile website designed
to film it here over here oh so this is
a mobile website so I can go and I can
you know treat it like any other Chrome
page and it's you know feels like any
other Android app if I go up in the menu
like it's a standard Android menu
they'll be all muttering it's very
buttery smooth I can't believe it's
actually not butter also I can't believe
it's not butter either what about these
so they changes chrome actually changes
their the header bar yeah so the app the
app manifest file says my theme color is
this hacker news orange yeah so if I so
I can customize completed the Chrome now
if I want to go and actually save this
to my home screen you haven't actually
downloaded this I know I'm just visiting
in the browser so supposedly if I come
here often enough chrome will just be
like all right you know we know you
really like this website you just want
to add your homescreen cheese so so we
could do that and then it'll add it to
your home screen and it's like any other
app you know this is my this is my
Android phone so I can go and launch as
an app get this really cool splash
screen that chick should load or it
skipped it this time but now it's just
like any other app it's full screen this
is this is just like any other Android
ionic app in the App Store except we
didn't have to install anything they
could use it both on the web and ends on
the phone and and the cool thing is with
ionic native and Cordova you'll be able
to use a lot of the same plugins that
have web fallbacks so I'm thinking like
camera support you know Android Chrome
has things like WebRTC geolocation so
all that stuff will work the same if you
kind of are smart about which plugins
you use but there's some ways that kind
of just build one code base that does
enhance itself when running completely
natively has a little more support for
offline modes serviceworkers which i'll
talk about in a second when it's running
as a service workers yeah and then it
can run in like a nice kind of standard
web mobile web environment when it's not
any of those so okay we're really
excited about about
serviceworkers are kind of super
confusing let's define them first so
I'll define them in very like the kind
of common terms because the actual
definition I think is a little bit well
okay Who am I kidding I'm probably gonna
be way too nerdy about it I like to
think of them as a proxy script and
basically you have the script where it
can run in the background in response to
things like Network requests and proxy
them and actually do whatever it wants
with them so that's how we get offline
mode like let's say your app uses the
fetch API to say hey go fetch the top
the last 50 stories from the hacker news
API that fetch call goes through your
service worker if you if you included
one that service worker says okay
they're trying to make it fetch like I
can either go and actually do the fetch
and go request it from the API and
that's a slower process that requires
being online or if I know I have that
data cache I can return it immediately
and there's some some nice nuance for
kind of cache invalidation and making
sure you're getting new data after a
while but the nice thing is your script
has amazing control to override any
single Network request to return offline
data so what happens with service
workers and I think the reason why
they're gonna be a little bit slow to
take off is we kind of think like Oh
offline mode but what is like what
offline mode means for every single app
is very custom you know you might want
your app to do one thing someone else is
gonna want there have to do another
thing so you see these serviceworker
files that are filled with a lot of
custom code and it's kind of hard to
know how to adapt it to to your app so
what we're gonna do with ionic what
angular 2 is doing with their their
mobile toolkit is coming up with recipes
for service workers so here's a standard
offline mode you could get into mess
with it but chances are you'll get 90%
of what you need out of the standard
recipe so service workers are very
powerful they can do things like lism
for push notifications and everything
like that
they're only supported on Android Chrome
they might be supported on some of the
other obscure browsers but they're most
notably
supported on safari for iOS yet yet yet
but I will say with this app that Justin
built it actually runs really well on
iOS Safari and we can get some nice
experience from it
and we just get a nicer experience on
Android so everything is working really
well isn't that a strange thing to say
it is nicer we're getting a nicer
experience on Android it's it's I got to
give them a lot of credit I'm very
impressed with the api's I am really
really excited because I think you'll be
like me and you'll you'll have this
experience where you built this full app
experience it's running in a browser and
it's installed on your home screen and
it's not a native app you never had to
go through any app store and that same
code can be turned around and deployed
to the App Store and that's what's
unique about ionic and I keep pushing
that because it's like a superpower it
really is it's a good one it's honestly
why we keep doing this because we're in
love with that that idea that concept
the web running everywhere now we just
need to get electron in there that's
next let's hold off on that let's solve
the current problems we have we have a
lot of things we're trying to solve
we're very ambitious but I think I think
it's good I think we've actually come a
really long way with ionic - I'm trying
to think is there anything else we want
to ain't big things we want to talk
about so let's talk about release date
so we are waiting on contentious session
I bet I bet so many people are like geez
when are they gonna talk about this TV
release dad you had to listen to all the
other stuff first that's right so
release date we are waiting on
incorporating angular 2 offline template
compiling so what that means is instead
of loading your templates dynamically
which we just found is rather slow on
things like iOS etc we are going to use
these offline template compiling where
your template is pre compiled into a
very efficient format ahead of time and
this is more efficient than what angular
1 ever had it's it's built into this
kind of like it's not a template string
anymore it is this really efficient raw
view manipulation code so that was kind
of the biggest thing we're waiting on
because it was a hold up because for
everyone who's tried
- you'll notice that there's a few
things that feel like regressions from
ionic 1 like the boot up time is really
slow right now the bundle size is really
big right now these are things that we
knew were unacceptable from day one they
bother us as much as they bother you
they've been driving us crazy like yeah
you should you should talk to Adam about
it because he will you will give you a
piece of his mind yes
but the angular team has done an amazing
job getting this pretty impressive
system working to the point where like a
little bit of pain over the last few
months it's going to lead to
considerable improvement over anything
we had before so we're waiting to get
that incorporated yesterday we just got
the first testing version of that
working and so the RC is waiting on that
to be done and we're just anticipating a
few more weeks don't hold me to it but
you can pass your Adam about it I'm sure
he'd love yeah go talk to Adam go talk
to Adam about he loved that question
yeah alright but that's really it so
coming very soon and then we want to be
aggressive about going to production and
pushing on it - is the default because
so many people are using it today and
loving it the forum guy you know the
little forum think we should reach out
to him we should reach out to ya I'm
gonna follow up yeah it's been a while
let's see what he thinks that was that
was like ancient history you know I am
considering considering the space that
we're in there literally is like ancient
history yeah considering how fast things
move
so coming soon to a repo near you I like
that let's say using that okay so what
do we want to talk about next we talk
about creator we can talk about the
cloud do we want to do some featured
apps we kind of did one I wanted to
feature that hack news thing we did but
let's save our feature for the app
because I'm really excited okay can I
just say one thing though what do you
got to say it's IPA day and it is IPA
day cheers Cheers and we just we just
magically had our glasses refilled how
cool is that that's what happens on like
a it's a magical day didn't you know
that I do now
all right sorry it's not about pop so
let's keep it brief but I want to make
sure that we talk about it which
actually we should mention historically
we've been referring to what we're now
calling the ionic cloud as the ionic
platform so there's some confusion there
basically what the ionic platform or not
ionic cloud is is it's a it's what is
well it's a it's our back-end services
that we are working on alongside the
open source framework so things like
push notifications deploying live to
your device without ever going to the
App Store user authentication analytics
native bill packaging a bunch of awesome
stuff that you might need after your app
is in the App Store or potentially while
you're building it for the App Store so
we have an awesome team that's been just
working incredibly hard on this it's
super super close to the production
release we're getting so excited here
there's a few remaining things left we
want to tweak and finish up before we
get it out there one of which is a brand
new documentation site which is
beautiful we designed it completely
redesign it from the ground up and
reorganize a lot of the content to just
make a little bit more sense and be a
little more fluid and easy to use so
we're working on the little last-minute
things with that we're gonna have some
awesome starter projects that come out
with it but basically the services are
extremely stable we have a lot of people
in the beta using them I think we sent
how many push notifications were sent
we're sending you know millions many
many many millions every single you know
week so a lot of people using it even
though it's been in beta we kind of told
people not to use it so the reason why
we've taken so long to get to production
is we saw so much demand we're like okay
there's a few things we need to do to
make sure it stays off that this thing
was gonna scale you know like we we
launched the Alpha pretty quickly
relatively speaking ends there were just
some a lot of scalability issues that we
need to solve so a lot of this time
that's kind of been under the hood is
made
this thing's solid so when we do roll it
out shortly we'll be able to say with
100% confidence this thing's ready to go
in production in fact people have been
using it in the production despite us
telling them not to which is just
beautiful so we thank those people
because they've really helped test this
and they've gotten a pretty awesome
service I think and they they're
enjoying it so a lot of awesome stuff
coming we just will probably do a bigger
talk on it I think we'd like to yeah and
uh one big thing that we did just
release is the ionic 2 I had a to
support launched into the cloud climb
yep loosely so now you'll be able to use
the cloud stuff really easily form ionic
2 and we'll start to kind of move in
that direction as we roll out new
features yeah so we're going to spend
too much time on it because I think we'd
like to dedicate a whole ionic show just
to talking about how you will probably
barrack on area so she's not yourself
yeah Eric will kind of give you the
whole rundown so we'll get into all that
a different time but we just wanted to
give you a quick update everything is
going swimmingly they're really excited
about it super super close so honestly
stay tuned because we'll be going into
production very very soon
great or let let's put our Creator caps
on and get dived and dig ourselves into
crater land myself digging ourselves in
that hole let's dig ourselves in the
Creator hole so crater just had a big
release the team has been working really
really hard
the Creator team on adding code editing
so basically into actual yes so
basically Creator was was a really
awesome prototyping tool and people were
getting a lot of use out it out of a
building quick prototypes hallway
testing stuff they put it on the mobile
app and what we found was that was
really great but it only took you like
this far and actually go a little bit
further you needed to be able to
actually script things you need to be
able to write code incorporate
third-party libraries and all this stuff
so which I should say for a lot of teams
and a lot of people that was more than
enough that initial amount just getting
the prototype up and running exporting
it out the code that you needed or
exporting that the apk files or whatever
it is
that was more than enough but we did
have a set of of core users that were
like we would love to actually dig
deeper into this tool yeah in our dream
our dream but the tool has always been
to like have a visual way to build apps
but also have a easier way to kind of
script it also you know I think when we
started this company actually we built a
tool that was very similar back when we
were working on jQuery Mobile stuff and
the whole thing the whole like theory
was if we're gonna have a popular UI
framework like jQuery Mobile and like
ionic now you're gonna naturally have
these visual tools like every single
thing before it had that like I think a
visual basic like that was the whole one
of the whole reasons why it exploded was
you could just build these apps drag and
drop all the components it wasn't always
pretty but it makes it more interactive
it makes it yeah fun it makes it
honestly it makes it more accessible it
makes it a lot more accessible so for us
the first version of creator was a way
for us to get something out the door to
test how people responded to it to start
building a business on it like if you
want to go and upgrade and use the pro
features that is how one of the ways
that ionic is making money so that's a
really positive step for the company
because a lot of people have asked us
like how do you make money from all this
free stuff and if you are paying
customer thank you we appreciate it very
much it helps us continue to work on the
open source stuff and do what we love so
coding support is a huge step forward
we've got a lot of plans for taking you
even further doing some really awesome
stuff so this is a first step as well as
as ionic to support which is you know
it's one of those things that people
often ask us about so all the stuffs
coming soon here I think we could
probably stand to do an entire new
episode I'm sure Matt would love to come
up here he's he is the one leading up
the creative team yeah if you're
familiar with creator at all then you're
definitely familiar with Matt Kramer who
is the product lead on creator so and if
you have any questions about any of this
stuff creator feel free to reach out to
us reach out to Matt on Twitter he loves
talking to all of you talking in general
but he loves talking to everyone who
uses her stuff and sharing
and teaching and Matt I think it's
planning on doing some some new videos
about how to actually like take
advantage of their the the code editing
in creator and show you how to like get
a little bit further in it if you if you
so choose yep so we're excited about it
it's a big step for creator it is and
the tool like I built the first version
a while back just kind of like really
rough and it's amazing what Matt and Lee
the other person on the project have
done to turn it into like an amazingly
useful tool and I think we've gotten
such good feedback about it being
improved and helping people really build
things quickly but you can build a real
app in like a minute or so like it's
done and actually maybe a little bit
that's but but a couple minutes you have
a real app it's kind of crazy
and with the creator app the the mobile
app that goes with it you can actually
interact with the app or prototype that
you're building like live on your device
as it updates on as you drag stuff into
it and change it you can have it on your
phone preview and yeah now with the code
editor you can do dynamic stuff yeah
it's really really cool so anyway we'll
get more into that we probably have some
more videos coming up shortly all about
creator so stay tuned for some of those
let's go into some featured apps let's
do it what was this I don't know it is
just that featured app it is a featured
app we're home to featured app I'm so
excited to talk about this I've been
waiting for this moment I have two
untapped attacked untapped if you like
beer if you drink a lot of beer you've
probably seen this app untapped so
untapped will show you it here with all
these fancy graphics is in it basically
a social network for people who like
beer so if I drink a beer let's say this
beer what is this beer this so today we
are drinking the carbon local brewery
carbon for fantasy factory IPA let's
show the label because it's kind of wild
yeah it is well it's a great design it's
a wonderful design but makes you want to
get a little bit crazy so why don't you
why don't you use the app okay so I'm
gonna check in
I have on untappd here I'm gonna check
in this beer I'm gonna film you checking
it because I want everyone to know that
I am a serious beer drinker so fantasy
factory I'll type that in I spell I
spell factory wrong but the app is smart
enough to fix my embarrassing mistakes
so I've got it here and I'm gonna check
in what's up for Star is really popular
I'm gonna why would take a picture a
camera oh nice let's do it I'm gonna
load the camera and I oh let's do a
selfie can be in your selfie a double
selfie Cheers
great we've got a photo all right on the
set of the ioniq show we're gonna leave
a note saying it was just marvelous just
a marvelous beer so while you're
checking in so just for a little back
story for those of you who might not
know untappd is a incredibly popular app
like max set for basically it's
essentially a social network for beer
drinkers or beer aficionados and you can
check in different beers that you drink
and see what other people are drinking
nearby you discover new beers that you
might not know about it's actually
really really cool there's a lot more
that it does but that's the the main
concept of it and what's cool about
untappd is that and the reason why i
think both you and i have a lot of
respect for what the team is doing there
and has been doing is that they were
always from day one a cordova based web
based yep
app they were well probably one of the
first I think they made a star there
with like PhoneGap yeah even earlier but
I need to double check my history yeah I
don't know for sure but I know that they
were historically had just been built
just pure Cordova they they ran their
own CSS and an HTML Javascript they
rolled it out rolled their own
internally and then they recently found
out about ionic and basically took their
UI design colors all of that stuff and
recomposed it on to their app using the
ionic UI kit and I believe it sign it
one yeah yeah so
just wanted to back up really quickly
because the cool thing about untapped if
if you think about how popular the app
is yeah how much the users love the app
they were one of the absolute best
cordova apps out there oh yeah
and for me when I was just getting into
cardova they proves to all the Cordova
developers out there what you could do
with this platform and what you know
what a great experience you could build
with the web with the web on all these
devices the challenge for everyone else
who was watching that was we weren't as
good as the untap team we didn't know
how to build a mobile UI out of these
web primitives like CSS and divs and all
this stuff that felts fast and fluid and
you know dealt with all the quirks of
all the different browsers so for them
like they were an amazing team that knew
how to do this and I onic was kind of
born out of the idea that like let's try
to take something like untapped and take
all the the concepts of how you kind of
build something like that it release him
as reusable components yeah make them a
little bit more generic cleaned up the
design make them more cross-platform
cross-browser
so that people can take them and then
build with them according to their own
brand yep exactly and now we are very
humbled and proud that they've sent
adopted ionic one which I think says a
lot about the reusability and the value
of having these components and we are
super thankful didn't see that coming
actually didn't even know that they had
done that until we saw a random tweet so
right so Greg Ebola who is one of the I
believe he's one of the founders he is a
co-founder of of this app we actually
interviewed we interviewed the team we
interviewed Greg and he had mentioned
that their code to kind of turned his
spaghetti after all the years of trying
to just maintain this thing as it was
going on and on and on these years and
becoming more popular and kind of one of
the things that they really liked was
when they switched to ionic that was
able it allowed them to just clean all
of that up and move a lot quicker
because now they have some basically
like a template to follow and rules to
follow and then they can just add their
brand on top
and it just works and he also mentioned
that they plan to move to ionic - oh
very soon which we're also really
excited yeah so we're just really happy
another motivating factor to get that
are see out that's true that's true
we're really really grateful to have
them have the news ionic means a lot to
us because like you said we I think we
looked up to what they were doing a lot
yeah and still do and it's just a cool
app in general and and you know like to
you know just to kind of revisit the
whole like Cordova thing again that was
really I think the challenge that
Cordova had for a long time in PhoneGap
was it was a great stack but it didn't
give you all the pieces and this is
something that we've said over and over
it didn't give you all the same pieces
that a native developer would get from
Apple to build their app like Apple gave
you oh here's a nice tab bar and here's
like you know a navigation thing you
don't have to worry about it just focus
on like your content inside of it
Cordova was a blank slate it was
basically here's the bobby tag
everything is up to you which was really
great because you could build like
easily turn around and build like a game
with canvas with anything else it was
challenging and that you didn't have
those components so it was open-ended
but it was almost like to a detriment it
was like to open it yeah yeah so a lot
of people would would struggle to kind
of put the pieces together and deal with
all the browser issues teams like
untappd had the skills to do that into
ionic I think was kind of inspired by
them and be like alright let's let's
kind of do this reusable so anyways
enough about that we love we love on
taps we have some people on the team who
are super obsessed who are you know have
drinking a lot of beer and too many
beers maybe maybe too many but but
that's up for them to decide so alright
we are super thankful to have them we
love the app check it out if you like
beer if you want to tell your friends
and you like beer check out on tapped
definitely okay well I feel like we have
covered the main things we wanted to
cover today we got we went pretty deep
with Anik - again there's just so much
to talk about there's so many things
changing the space is just constantly
evolving and for us it's making sure
that we're literally like on the
bleeding edge of whatever is
happening in the like JavaScript world
so far as you know angular 2 goes with
our C's working with the angular team or
some of our team members on the fragment
fraction just out there last week to
sync up with them even further and make
sure that ionic 2 is always at the
bleeding edge of the latest stuff that's
coming out from them so we wanted to
make sure we took this time out to talk
about all of those things yep and we've
been quiet you know I'm sure a lot of
people are curious what we've been up to
that's all gonna change here soon we've
been heads down we hired a bunch of
people on the team some really great
people all around the country and
internationally so a lot of stuff going
on just to just to kind of like kind of
fill up the team and level up a little
bit and now everything is just kind of
coming together I'm so excited to get it
out all this stuff so stay tuned we'll
have tons of updates this fall it's
gonna be a super busy fall for us but
and I think people are gonna be super
happy with Roman release I agree
all right well I think that just about
does it we will see you next time thank
you thanks cheers Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
