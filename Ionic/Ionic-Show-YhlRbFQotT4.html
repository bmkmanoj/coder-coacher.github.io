coming through there is gonna be a
slight delay there it is yet all right
welcome everyone to the first-ever live
ionic show my name is Ben you guys know
max this is Adam I think Adam you've
been on one of the ionic shows in the
past what are you two of them yes sonic
and Justin is here Justin welcome to
your first ever ionic ship first of all
right sure
Justin's a developer advocate here no
he's very active on Twitter so you
should check him out there if you
haven't already so we got a lot to talk
about today we haven't done an ionic
show in like it's been a long time yeah
it's been a really long time cuz I don't
think I was hired on full time yet when
we did - last one when I was one of the
first PWA is that I build with ionic was
on the last one okay it's like I have to
pay donors it was a long time ago we had
a bit of a but it was a good time I will
say we haven't had an ionic show for a
good reason
probably mostly because of the fact that
we've been so heads down working on
trying to get the latest version of
ionic out plus a bunch of new projects
and we're going to talk about today so I
guess with that said why don't we just
get the show started one of the things
actually real quick before I start the
show if you guys have questions feel
free to throw them in the like little
YouTube live chat here and I'll make
sure that I like try to get to as many
as I can I'm gonna try to find a break
midway through the show or like when I
feel like I can just inject them in to
make sure that like you guys's voice our
voices are heard and that we can address
whatever questions you might have about
certain things as we as we go through
the show so we're gonna try to have some
Q&amp;amp;A in this one which would be fun I'm
going to mostly be playing host today so
we'll see how that goes
but I think with that said let's let's
start the show do it do it
so alright guys I think the first thing
that I want to talk about and I think we
should talk about his stencil stencil
yes you know we we started off this
whole
ever together as a team building ionic
framework and along the way we
specifically this fall we released a new
project called stencil for you those of
you who don't know you can find it at
stencil j/s calm right now
but what is stencil can someone like
just sort of give the Badgers what it is
so so I know it's gonna go longer than I
want to well let's say real quick
alright so so it's ten so one of our
goal is supposed to allow developers to
use ionic in whatever framework they
wanted to use like traditionally it's
always been good because you know we
love angler we started with England one
we've reported saying or two now four
I'm upgrading the angler five but with
with that we were very limited to only
to the angler community so which stencil
we kind of evaluated we wanted to look
into allowing it to work and react and
view and all the other different
frameworks and a couple months ago as
we're looking into this we realize that
you know actually web components are a
reality now and weapons can easily be
used and so we decided to take a serious
look into that it's like how can we move
I honestly what web components are and
so that's what the stencil has enabled
us to do and so stencil takes the core
of web components and kind of sprinkles
in a few more things that of the stuff
that we really like about frameworks
such as now making it easy to use JSX
being easy use add event listeners and
and all the niceties that you see in
your framework but what it compiles is
just another distal web component so the
output of it is just simple web
component javascript can be used
anywhere it can use it in j.crew jQuery
app can be used in vanilla JavaScript be
used in the biggest react app you've
ever seen it doesn't matter
basically we step away from the
framework world and we allow you to use
whatever you enjoy using should we go
back to like the why we picked angular
in the first place and how is in so back
in 2013
I think angular 1.1 was out when we
start working on up ionic one and we the
reason we picked it was but we came
hearing about it from everyone so that
that helped but we wanted like a
framework where we could define custom
HTML tags we were like we came from
jQuery Mobile and jQuery and the the
thing about jQuery is you have you had
to manually instantiate elements whereas
angular
automatically let you write custom
JavaScript components that would
automatically run if the user type the
tag and so for us web components was
kind of the actual dream we were going
after it just wasn't ready back in 2013
in angular and Euler was a great choice
and it's still a great choice today and
I mean we've been all writing angular
all week so we love it but the dream was
always custom HTML tags and and even
like even if you look at our very first
commits you'll see that we had a by
means directory and in that directory
had angular ember backbone Jake writing
a couple different ones eventually like
we're just going to support all yeah and
then we started doing angular we're like
oh the street are not going to very
difficult it's one of the timeyou thing
to like right when ionic one started the
kind of thing in your jess was like the
Google backs so this is kind of like we
had backbone we took some code out of
backbone to try to build like a
component model remember that it was
like a class system in the view system
yeah thanks for I think all the
controllers know that yeah yeah but but
I think what senseless and they want us
to do as the original goal that we had
of allowing people to just use whatever
they want to use and just we provide the
awesome components to checkbox toggles
all the cool stuff that that you want to
use so that you can focus on building
your application and that focus on how
it does a menu work yeah I mean I think
one thing we've realized we all use
different frameworks here like some of
us really like react so I'm really like
view some polymer wish we could just
include an HTML bomber and of course
angular so for us like internally
externally we're very like we're just
angular but internally we were pretty
diverse and I think we all came to the
conclusion that like it feels more like
a pinion than it does oh angular is 10
times better than react or reacts ten
times better in reality like we're all
building the same stuff with the same
tools that generally are the same the
api's are just more like than opinion at
this point yeah so we didn't want to
like tear like have to bind ourselves to
anyone any single opinion yeah so would
you say that's partially how a stencil
was born out of this desire to not be
bound so much well how did that come
about like because I feel like all of a
sudden we were like well this is gonna
be a thing
yeah yeah basically disappeared for yeah
no I think it a lot of I do with you
know as reported we've been through a
lot of work support from anger one anger
to and just that alone was a lot of work
and I think during that process we
realized that we don't necessarily need
to play this game because what we're
providing are just components of you
know Santo fancy CSS and event listeners
we don't necessarily need to be tied to
a specific framework and so as reporting
- anger - anger for we start kind of
question is lean all work and all sorts
of questions of like we want you know
UJS is great you know react is great so
right okay so let's make an anionic
react and you know about five minutes in
you realize this is also going to be a
very large project right sings like
wasn't there an ionic react repo for at
least a little while yeah yeah and there
were some third parties like community
projects there was like yeah I make for
something you phonic or something yeah
but yeah building a framework custom to
custom to a framework is so much work
that we didn't want to do that ever
again we wanted to like right at once so
we can maintain it and improve it I
focus on ionic rather than focusing on
the binding lace so how does stencil
work with ionic specifically like how
does it connect with ionic how do they I
guess how do they relate right so it's
so so far we probably pretty misleading
is like we don't like frameworks let's
build another one that's not what's
happening here so basically stencil is a
compiler for web components and so it's
built for us for the use of building
ionic to allow many people to consume
ionic but what it actually generated is
just JavaScript again so back to the
fact that doesn't matter what runs it
and so let me backtrack a little bit so
with stencil it's something that
actually consumers have ionic don't you
need to know about it doesn't matter and
so like don't let that scare you that
this is a new thing you need to learn
this is actually just what ionic is
using as core contributors is using to
build ionic and make it easy for us to
maintain I think we've got 91 components
which is not easier and then also some
of the lessons that we've put in ER the
lessons learned that we put
in distance Oh was that with ionic
angular we've got again 90 some
components and it's very difficult to
make it easy to use all 90 of them
without using or downloading the entire
library and everything included you can
get a very large app very quickly and so
that's easily some of the lessons
learned from from the past and so we got
a lot of feedback from the community on
that of how could splitting worked but
it wasn't great there were still big
bundles there yeah we got to be really
struggled to get like tree shaking to
really appreciate yeah and so we wanted
to take the same ideas we want to be
make it easy to use ionic you might just
write an ion button that's going to work
but at the same time we don't want you
to download the world and we also don't
want you to have a massive configuration
of how to use just ion button and so
that's where stencil kind of adds our
own little flair for us to use that only
when ion button is added to the Dom
stencil is then smart enough to only
request that and the CSS that you're
using that also includes the iOS and
metier design so if you're not using the
iOS every now know us platform it's only
going to get the CSS from inter design
just for iron button I think so that's
one of my favorite things about stencil
in ionic or which is all the ionic
components that are being ported to web
components using stencil is that the the
code splitting normally you have to set
up like a big web pack config is that
our make sure the imports are like the
right type of imports etc to make sure
that code splitting and and stuff like
that is working correctly where is it
stencil it's just not something you
actually even have to like you only have
to know what could split yes we just
handle it complete right we're in that
and that's a big part of like actually
zero config like completely zero and
that's a big part of it too is that we
wanted to make sure that stencil is as
close to the standards as possible we
don't want to reinvent how events work
we don't want to reinvent how to
dynamically request a model or a module
so that's where we're using standards as
much as possible and that's and then
basically that's where the web post
comes in so when a web component hits
the Dom we're able to then use the
basically dynamic import so that will
download exactly what we need and only
what we need and render that right there
and so we're able to step away from the
whole bundling scene and allow the
browser to actually do the real work
rather than having a developer at Build
time guess which stuff should go
together but in the browser be very
specific of saying you're using these
components
let's go get those quick so one thing
that I think we should talk about
because it's a important reason why
we're moving to web standards I think
the feedback that we got because we went
from basically angular 1 to angular 2
and there was pretty much zero backwards
compatibility and actually I'm I'm
impressed that people were so willing to
upgrade and I think you know we were
thankful that people took a risk because
it was such a big improvement but I
think teams and companies kind of
reaches a breaking point with big framer
switches and I think with angular
specifically like people still the
feedback we get from teams that haven't
moved angular 2 is that they still love
angular 1 you know it's a perfectly
great framework it works well it's they
understand it they have tools that work
with it so for for stencil and ionic we
kind of took that as feedback that like
maybe one of the values we can add here
is is less change and to get to less
change we have to introduce a little bit
of change but hopefully hopefully a lot
less than ever moving to another
framework and in stencil actually works
in angular 1 with some shims yeah right
like it's kind of automated shims that
you don't have to even realize it so I
think we'll end up web components are
gonna end up breathing new life into
some of these older freedoms yeah and I
think it's really important to point out
that like there is no stencil API they
actually stencil doesn't exist in the
browser at that point by the time that
ionic renders it so what's happening is
that to interact with a ionic component
you're just using the property or the
attribute or the event listener so
you're not learning a specific way to
interact with ionic you're just using
the Dom basically or whatever framework
you use so that I think that's a good
point like going into a kind of ionic
angular for a touch all the ionic core
components will be under the hood web
components etc and you just you'll still
be writing angular code on your end so
you don't even have to know that there
are web components in your bundles so
before we switch gears I want to make
sure we talk about a bunch of things
today and keep us on track we could talk
for this whole show on yeah
how does this affect what does the
performance like sure bottom line yeah
so so again back to the the biggest
thing you want to do was to lazy load
what you are actually using and through
that we were able to have the compiler
do a lot of the work and so that's where
most of the work if you look at the
stencil repo you see that majority of
what's going on is all in the compiler
on the build steps and it is able to
optimize tiny tiny files and be able to
download just exactly what you need and
even group things that you know are
gonna come together so like example I on
card iron header iron content we know
that you're going to use those
components all together so part of the
compiler puts them all into the same
file and that file we're talking two
kilobytes so in a way like we're doing
bundling but it's like micro bundling
time and it's not on the user it's not
on the user it's all you know it's it's
basically part of the design of that web
component to handle it for itself and
also a huge part of stencils to ensure
that different versions can all work
together because again all we're using
is events and properties and attributes
to communicate so if I've got a version
stencil version one sense of version two
they should be able to talk to each
other just fine because the only way
that they can talk is through the
standard Dom API so yeah our tiny little
loader file sitting up about like 5.7
kilobytes for a really basic app as it
sits now and then something they use
it's like a router etc it's in the six
six kilobyte range yes and so that is
and that's like all the lazy loading
stuff all that code splitting stuff all
built in async rendering shadow Dom
shadows we're all within six kilowatt
it's important to define like what
performance means because it's such a
loaded yes like so the thing is like
angular is is has great performance over
angular one with a lot of like rendering
when it's actually running we're trying
to optimize performance at load time is
really a focus of artists because you
know I think a lot of the feedback we've
gotten from ah from Island ektu is that
apps tend to be a little bit slower to
load because the way that it runs is
it's loading everything upfront and then
running so so performance Russ is like
trying to reduce that time to first
interactive like automatically yep okay
so it's I it's all yeah it's all about
the code that you ship in the first you
you know if you're only shipping six
points
kilobytes on the purse you on the
average device that's gonna parse way
faster than a you know when potentially
wouldn't about you have a lot of
examples - I mean just yeah so there's
if you go to a stencil Jess calm slash
dimmers there's a bunch of demos on
there so one of the the hacker news app
that we have is sitting at like 3.2
seconds or actually no the latest is
like 2.6 seconds to interactive and
that's on a just to be clear like a
really really slow Network to like 3G so
if you've like got into a parking garage
or something like that
and on average device or something like
a moto G that you can pick up for 100
hundred fifty dollars on a newer device
such as an iPhone 10 like you have now
or a pixel - you're looking at like
instant if you're on Wi-Fi or 40 yeah
that's an interesting change from like
the way we used to do things like
everyone's in the PWA era is testing on
3G slow networks and instead of testing
on their like home Wi-Fi or whatever San
Chrome yeah anytime we report the
loading times it's on those slow
networks and so it's kind of like any
any other network that's faster is gonna
give an even faster so yes Mexico
bertrand optimized for like that if you
can optimize for the slowest situation
it's like the lowest in device and the
you know the the crappiest network and
that means on you know I do revise for a
better device with a better network
you're gonna be just that much faster so
if you're fast on the way in devices
review blaze and fast when I are really
good device so alright I got I gotta get
us new top very well I have one more
sort of actually two more questions
about stencil that I want to make sure
our clarified one is can you talk a
little bit about polyfills yes sure
so I'm Sofia so as everybody knows web
components p1 are native in Chrome and
Safari they're coming to Firefox they're
actually already in Firefox nightly
behind a flag you can turn it on and
there so all also all chromium based
browsers so pretty much any browser you
can install on an Android device it has
one components electron the only one
really missing out right now or Firefox
and edge but I know it's definitely
coming to Firefox and edge has showed
some interest
under you know under consideration or
something like that I think they yes
because see yes sir so there are some
Pollock you'll see it also we do support
ie 11 what stencil although that's been
a pretty good challenge to get it to
work oh no it's not easy but it is it is
working I fight with it often there ah
but yes and Pollock feels we handle that
underneath the hood for you so we have a
little loader script that says hey do
you support web components okay you do
you probably don't need any of these
polyfills so you don't load them if
you're on a browser like ie 11 that
doesn't really support much of anything
and then you get our full suite of
Pollock eul's so this always means that
no matter what browser you're on or
something like that
first the app is going to work for you
and suck it you're never gonna be
loading more polyfills and you actually
need yes so may see we're kind of
already doing that I mean like we're
only loading what so like the the
initial sign in chrome safari really
most things it's you're gonna get just
the bare bones you know es6 even are we
get another good point or so you can get
a six now we're just finishing the
dynamic imports it's just shifting Karl
so yeah and so it's because it's all
done with like feature detection
basically as Firefox so like as web
components make it to stable Firefox
then you'll automatically get you want
to have to update your your app or PWA
or whatever exactly
it'll just automatically start getting
smaller bundles yeah sorry
all right I'm gonna save a few more
questions about it until we get to the
questions and answers part of the show
so I'm gonna move you guys along okay
thank you we're gonna we're gonna
transition as I think it's time to talk
about ionic framework the project itself
because nature I mean the last time we
talked about it wasn't even we were in
ionic to theta and now we're approaching
ionic for very quickly yeah so I wanna I
want to give people kind of some insight
on what's been going on with ionic
framework properly so I guess the the
first question or the first thing that
we should talk about is like what's new
what's new with ionic framework of v4 so
v4 is gonna be using stencil under the
hood with the goal that you'll be able
to take your ionic angular v3 app and
upgrade to ionic angular
for yeah what does that upgrade process
can be like is it gonna be a pain like a
Guyana quadratic to was because the
angular 2 shift or is it gonna be it'll
be not nearly as a shift that it was
from a ionic are angered 1 to 2 I feel
like it'll be a lot of fun to replace
kind of things yes like slot and so
instead of a sort of ng-content in slot
yeah it's sly and then in setup like
what is it feel block or whatever for
the button outs make it go across so
used to be block and now it's like fail
equals block it's moving to like actual
name yes and so it's a lot of lightens
vsk would find and replace kind of thing
nice yeah and then that's all stuff that
we're we're finishing out right now so
our what we're using as our our ionic
conference app that is currently an
ionic hangar 3 and we're using that to
test out what the process is to go to 4
so really our goal is to make it as as
painless as possible and really you're
going to continue to use angular just
how you've always using ER so if you
built this huge enormous app in angular
don't worry you're still going to
continue to use angular just the same
way yeah I would say for angular 2 or
angular the change is going to be a lot
less because it's we're really trying to
keep the API similar yep so we have some
things that might not map if you're
using like view or react you're not
gonna add some of the same things we
have in angular 2 like some of our
services those are probably not gonna be
in there because we're we're keeping
those melius backwards compatibility
would you say the the injectable like so
many injectors are they make more sense
in angular than they do another oh right
yeah so I mean most of our logic of
ionic itself has moved to the web
component layer yeah and so what's
actually an ionic angular is about 4
kilobytes of code and I was actually
just reading was that like custom
elements everywhere yeah poor thing
angular angular 2 plus has the best yeah
I mean they designed it for good from
the ground not to work what's yeah so
that's one of the best way to use it
yeah alright so stencil is a big change
well a big change for interns new but
for users going from 3 to 4 you're still
gonna I mean you're not really upgrading
frameworks I mean you're still using
angular 500 for English 5 and so that's
what that's kind of the
parison before is like you were going
from angular 1 dangler to with that you
had a change I own exchange so that was
a big change for everyone but in this
case you're still on the same version of
angular for the most part so with the
outlay API changes so I mean with iron
King's lair for really you don't even
have to know there's web components
underneath write all of your code is
still gonna be angular it's just the eye
on a components themselves will be web
components oh cool so it will still work
with angular like the experience if
developer expand shouldn't be too
different if you're used to do exactly
it should be you know that's their
biggest goal is to make it just as
seamless as possible and and there
shouldn't be any fear that you need to
rewrite your entire app again so
continue to use angular so with that set
what if you where your team is building
in react building with you that's also
is ionic for going to handle something
like that so
so what we're you know namings hard
right so ionic an angular we're
currently an ionic angular v3 and so the
next verse to be ionic angular before
right so so as far as the core is the
base web component thing I think yeah so
I think that is very important so naming
is super hard you know and I do see that
confused sometimes so it's important to
add like the ionic angular yes parantha
there because they're there like you
said there's an ionic core package which
is all the ionic components for next web
and once everywhere it comes your
confessor where you gonna say if you
like react or if you want to use
extensible to build your whole app or if
you want to use view whatever WordPress
then you'll be using ionic core but
ionic angular for I just yet the naming
thing is yeah depending is extremely
hard so maybe it makes sense to talk
about like what ionic is again because I
think people associated with like its
ionic is angular's mobile toolkit and
that's kind of how it like we used to
identifies that and but really I think
ionic at the core is a UI kit to help
web developers build a quality of mobile
apps and now progressive web apps so
we're like the bootstrap layer if you
will for mobile a lot of people call us
that which is fine really
we love bootstrap so in that sense it's
kind of you should be able to use those
components inside of your framework the
way you use your framework and then we
like we're not prescriptive I mean this
kind of gets back to why we we kind of
accidentally backed into the stencil
project because our whole goal was like
you know we understand that like as a
developer you know you you and or your
team might prefer you building apps with
react or you might prefer view or you
just want to try something new
and by you know getting you guys
feedback and realizing that I think
stencil was that way for us to build
ionic in such a way that like if you do
want to build your app with a view you
can with I on it because we don't want
to have an opinion on whatever
technology framework you and and or your
team are choosing to build with so we'll
probably have like look official ones
that we support better because I mean
doing documentation is important to be
describing like how do i how do i
programmatically show and hide a menu
there may be cases where certain
frameworks have to do that differently
so i i think the way that we're thinking
about protein that is we will have a set
of the most popular frameworks and maybe
that will change over time as we learn
and we'll have like documentation and
facial starter projects like this is the
pre act xl- the angular for the angular
1 version yeah that's cool so yeah I
really want angular 1 I think the cool
thing is since I on a course is like
since it is just about components and at
the end of the day you interact with it
just like you would any other HTML yeah
that if you already know like pre act or
react review etc it's gonna be I mean
you can use V dash 4 to iterate through
a list and you can put ion list in that
P dash 4 and it's just gonna work sir
and I think the other thing we should
talk about like because you know we have
a lot of feature requests that are
custom components like swipeable tabs
let's say reasons I think why it's hard
for us to work on those components is
because we have to spend a lot of time
in interrupting with frameworks and that
actually eats into a lot of our
development time yeah so one of the
motivations for moving ionic 4 to web
components is we want more time to work
on our components and less time having
to think about the framework because we
don't feel like we need to really have
an opinion on that that's up to you now
so we're hungry to kind of get back and
grow
focus on ionic UI components do those
really really well because that's why
people use our right and like our
focuses our API we're running against is
just the Dom which is a very solid
things not changing whereas you know
other frameworks are constantly evolving
and so we have to redo ionic each time
that something changes for the metal
that's my favorite things is it it's it
is kind of joke it's kind of hard to say
that but like breaking changes should be
able to be less in the future at least
to a certain point because I mean like
web standards like web workers for
example I've been around for a long time
they haven't changed forever or like the
geolocation API I wish it was promise
based I wish it would changed but it's
been in there for a while it's in
browsers then it hasn't changed for a
while so you can ship a site and that
you know never look at it again you
don't really have to worry about it like
all of a sudden is blowing up one day
yeah and this has been the year really
if you look at the standards and what
stuff is now accepted norms that we knew
no years past you could never use this
API look at the kennedys calm and it's
amazing of the things that we are able
to actually use around is what part of
stencil and get one is what web can do
calm is pretty cool too that shows you
some of the things like you can you know
build a camera and the browser now and
it even works in Safari now finally and
yeah it's pretty cool I guess we haven't
really even mentioned it like a lot of
this push a lot of the reasons for all
this stuff coming together was pwace
because we again we're already the web
we're already using javascript and HTML
CSS so when PDI pwace came out it's like
how this is obviously like this is
exactly what we should be doing
so I'm gonna stop you there real quick
the few things I quickly wanted to
mention that are also going to be new
with ionic 4 is we have a brand new
version of ionic ons are open source
icon font and just my contact library is
I I went in and how many did you 700
plus and changes so you know the latest
version of iOS kind of changed how they
want you to do icons and so of course
we're still gonna make previous versions
of
Ayana cons available but the new version
is going to go away from that like thin
and filled state if you kind of get how
happily used to do things with iOS
they've moved away from that and in
there you know their documentation says
to not do that anymore
so made a bit bit of changes to the iOS
forms updated them to be sort of the
latest style that Apple wants your icons
looking like um so we're going to be
pushing out a new update to an economy
hopefully in you know the next I don't
want to say any dates but soon cool
point to add to that too is that sir I
an icon which allows you to use those
icons is now a book component yeah all
right all right so you and have
unlimited yep and instead of pulling in
like the huge you know icon file that
was slight learn so please lullaby
shrines you know a super big it side now
just loads exactly to you so if you just
want to use like icons it's only issues
because there's so many introduced some
new UI paradigms as well so we're also
going to be going through in ionic for
all of our UI components and just
updating them to be reflective of the
latest like UI styles in iOS and Android
so they're gonna look great in the cross
iOS Android we did give had a question
here not too long ago about whether or
not we were going to still support
platform continuity of course we will so
if you don't know what platform
continuity is basically when you run
your app in iOS or Android
ionic will if you want it to it will by
default try to display the components
the UI components in a way that reflects
like the standard look and feel of that
particular platform so in iOS if you
load an ionic app up in and I thought
it'll kind of look and feel like a stock
iOS yeah no they have and it the same
goes for Android that I got a Core 2 so
yeah doesn't matter what framework use
it so I'll banked in by default you
don't have to do anything if you don't
want it to do that you can obviously
turn it off it's typically look and feel
however you want so one question about
that this is more about pwace but I
think it's relevant here like people
often ask or one thing we talk a lot
about is like what do you do on a PWA
when it comes to classical continuity
like and I think all right what we've
decided is it doesn't really make sense
to display an iOS native UI in a browser
but we're kind of thinking that material
design is probably a better choice for
at PWA s because it's just a little bit
bill bill more in mind for the web so
anyway it's defaulting you can change it
to be iOS if you want it but the default
it because we're saying that it so there
on the perfect segue in the Q&amp;amp;A so I
wanna I want to shift gears here we've
talked a little bit about stencil and
ionic framework before I didn't want to
get into when it's going to be released
because I don't like yeah why don't like
corner and ice but the timeline well
that was like a month ago right
soon basically it's it's ASAP it's our
thing it was done we really said if it's
if it's not done and you don't want to
ship something that's not so I will say
they're like if you look at an accord if
that is on NPM yeah a lot of the ionic
well actually I shouldn't say a lot
there are some ionic components there
aren't there yet some of them that
aren't completely done yet no navigation
is not done yet yeah but you can't
actually say like I said if you go on
the stencil chase calm slash demos or if
you follow me on Twitter about we've
already been building two motors I think
you built build an app with ionic or
instance yeah I mean I ability yeah it
already works pretty well but it is you
know beta so you might run into things
set or broken and anyway that's going so
all the way of looking at it really
quick is like we have a high
are with Anik too so we need to make
sure that ionic form meets that bar
before we release it but technically
it's actually usable right technically
it's there but just keep in mind that
its beta and stuff might not be there or
you might run into weird it's in the
core branch so at a annek that core
branch will work on install into MPM
right now okay I'm cutting you guys off
we're going to move into some Q&amp;amp;A so
actually that's a good segue one of the
questions that someone posted here was
is the desktop browser sort of mode
going to get more attention in the few
and actually already have someone that's
helping us out with that a lot it's been
a large patch of ours that it's always
been on the back burner that we want to
do but absolutely like with this
transition to ionic or we're making sure
that everything to be working grading
desktop and PWA is to serve progressive
apps you can open them anywhere that
there's web browser server where from
like my xbox one at home to you know my
my surface or so yeah I think this
brings up an interesting like topic
about like what ionic framework is
because when we initially released it it
was hyper focused on like building
native look and feeling Apple apps and
it still is and absolutely you can still
do that but I think as we've invested
more and more on the web and while at
the same time the web has come back in
power and style we've seen high onic get
pushed to its limits in terms of where
people want to put it and one of the
places that a lot of people are pushing
ionic is to desktop environments
especially I mean Justin right now I
mean you're not on desktop but you have
a nice little sort of portable it can be
a desk so this is a service it's it's
it's pretty cool so that's the surface
book so it's a it is the one I'm the one
person here that uses so I saw every
nice for pro but I do use to understand
a lot so it's nice yeah it's it's not
always fun as Adam can probably attest
you guy there's a lot of cussing that
goes on in the morning sometimes over my
desk but I des work and you it's pretty
cool you can so it's a tablet now and
then I can plug it into a my keyboard
and use it just like a record yeah like
all right next to my desktop yes very
so yes absolutely we are going to
already we're transitioning ionic from
just a mobile when we focused UI toolkit
swear something mekin yeah to get web
focus essentially I mean those desktop
great that's the dream runs everywhere
maybe eventually they'll be running in
carts yeah really honest real quick that
you know help us with what things you
don't think are right in desktops like
you're designing your everything we
we've built is like we knew it's going
to look good into a mobile but as the
expand is like a it's not gonna do that
wouldn't do that and that's episode let
us know you know submit issues all right
this is gonna be rapid-fire you guys
can't go more tangents all right does
anyone know if laravel works well as a
back-end for ionic HP a lot of people
use it works great yeah all right how do
you theme web components anything web
components well so that's another big
part of it is that we want to make sure
that CSS is largely the same so how
you've been styling your CSS today is
going to be largely the same to with the
web components we are not using shadow
Dom at this time to make it easier for
this transition so we basically already
manually scoped the CSS so that it could
work on any single page and not be
affected so we've kind of done the hard
work of scoping the CSS to begin with
and so with that you can continue to
style things just like you always have
and eventually someday we'll probably
move to shadow DOM and that said we also
have CSS variables support already in
there okay so kick those in there you go
there you go you can still use sass if
you want but CSS variables variables are
a great way to start you do know my team
all right okay next question I want you
when will that become a few Jas yeah
well technically if you read I follow
Joshua Moroni it's already here yeah
josh has a lot of good articles yeah
it's ionic or in view I mean that's kind
of the point it's like you don't have to
wait on us you just drop in our
components assuming that frameworks are
good citizens and support weapon and
I've actually used it imbue it works
really well actually
yeah great and we'll probably have some
like recipes and demos and start our
apps we want to build at once before is
I think you show me how to do that first
all right guys do you think that hybrid
apps will ever replace native in the
future completely it's not about that I
mean you're building a native app right
like your your
I can just as easily access healthkit
API on a hybrid app as I can on a native
app it's about saving you 95% of the
time when you're targeting different
platforms it's not about limiting you so
we're actually will talk a little bit
about the end about how we're gonna take
that even further but I don't I don't
care if it kills native apps because
you're shipping native apps like we
don't want to kill ya I think it's also
comparison to like there's still desktop
apps that are very useful but today if
your boss told you to build an
application for your your corporation
you're probably use the web you know so
because it's just a lot easier than fire
enough no visual basic and firing me
know create an actual executable Windows
File show compared to just you know a
web application so I think it's very
same but at the same time the web didn't
kill application and it really comes out
of your use case and way to like I mean
you can do like really high end like 3d
WebGL and web assembly in style but I
mean most you're not to be building call
of duty and it you know use web stuff in
the next few years least and that's the
nice thing about Cordova and ionic etc
is you can mix in native code if you
need that escape action escape hatch
that lets you do what you need to do
today and hopefully abstract it and make
it cross-platform in the future ok Jacob
has been just clamoring to know can we
touch upon lazy loading in an offline
first progressive webOS yes
IRA top stock so we could save that a
few more questions some other topics
what are our plans for supporting URL
routes for navigation that is a very
hard topic but we are working on that
one thing that we're really addressing
is trying to make the router of that
framework kind of be the the one that
controls it and so like with angular we
want to use the angler router as best as
possible and so we've been doing a lot
of research in that I know Dan and Ken
and both been doing a lot of work into
that but it's very difficult and another
thing that we're working on or that
we've always kind of had with anionic is
that we wanted to replicate native
applications whereas traditionally the
web is just you know a singular line of
you go forward you
backwards but with the native
applications such as you know think of
the place or App Store you have
different tabs and each tab has a
different stack that has a different
stack within each tab so we've always
tried to replicate you know what native
does and how it act because you know
everyone's familiar with how their you
know their phone works but when it comes
to web development it's kind of
different so exactly so at least not a
browser chrome back but so so having a
URL to represent kind of a traditional
native thing is very difficult but I
will say that I think that we've been
doing a lot of Awesome updates recently
and like with ionic or a lot of the hard
work that then kind of been doing is
gonna go and it's been a priority for us
because we know that like the PWA mode
of navigation is not the native ways to
work I think we're working on a good
middle ground that simplifies what we
have today and makes it possible to do
native and web style routing more easily
you know I think it'll come up in the
pwh app for sure but we also have if you
want to go like full-on PWA we do have a
stencil router too they implements that
very classic like URL just just like
react router or something like that yeah
so one more question then we're going to
move on yeah I had like 1 components how
will they or will they at all work with
stencil so that's this is a personal pet
project but I haven't one components the
code today will not work in stencil like
let's be clear about that
what what will work and what is actually
better is that I on ik four components
will work in angular 1 so unfortunately
you're not going to have a situation
where you're gonna be able to just take
your ionic 1 app and magically moved
ionic for tomorrow like that's not going
to happen but moving to ionic 4 will
mean changing some HTML tags getting rid
of we had like a delegate system we
don't use that anymore so that won't
exist but you'll be able to keep 90% 95%
of your angular code and so it's a much
smaller transition than going to angular
2 so I've done some testing I wrote like
a little shim for this and it works
really really well
angular just needs a it needs a simple
directive that map's properties to web
component properties otherwise
don't update properly but with a simple
like directive wrapper then we can Auto
generate so we don't actually have to
support any angular code at all it just
works so it's probably not going to be a
the number one priority for us but I
think if we can give ionic one users a
way into the future like that's awesome
oh yeah I think so
always speaks to you like we don't know
let whatever framework of choice exactly
that way you can keep your old code but
still be able to use to do new ionic
components all right there is one more
question I want to ask well well any
improvements to Cordova native API sever
alright we're gonna hold off on that all
right so let's talk about pwace yes all
right Justin this justice
so can someone just in case anyone still
doesn't know or maybe has questions what
is a progressive web app yep so I like
to think of a progressive web app is
basically you combine like the best
parts of like an app that you install
from the Play Store with the best of
what the web offers so progressive web
app is basically just a website that
uses some newer technology to give you a
more app like experience so uses things
like service workers and web manifest to
allow you to make sure that you know
when you go to your your PWA in the
browser even if you're offline or you're
on a flaky network it's still going to
work just like you know you can be
offline to pull up a native app and it's
it's still gonna render for you pwace
can do the same thing they also have a
web manifest so it's especially on
Android there's a pretty cool thing
where you're you know you can like go to
Twitter like our Twitter calm today on
mobile device chrome is going to pop up
a little banner that says hey would you
like to install this to your home screen
and that allows you to actually like
like I could you know pull up Twitter
and it's gonna be in my app drawer right
there along all the native apps it'll be
in your settings yeah it's it's just
like a native app so it's really just a
website so it's basically a it's a
really nice web app but it's it's
optimized to load quickly and give the
user a native experience as though they
were interacting with a native app I
think it's just a really nice really
modern for that so how do
that effect did you have something well
I often say to it's a mindset change
like for a long time companies we're
looking at mobile as oh we're just going
to tell anyone who comes from the mobile
web like all right screw you go download
the app in the App Store like an erratic
bear like it does today
sorry read it but when you think about
what you're losing they're like you're
it's risky to take a user who came in
from a google search and say hey we're
glad you're here but like go do 5 status
install our app you know sign up for our
push notifications like so I think
that's exactly what I was going to say
which is like what are they like
accessibility benefits of the PWA so and
I know that you have stats on that
because there have already been some
yeah major demands so I'm so like
Pinterest for example so they went so
Pinterest as a pw8 now so to get a
Pinterest comm it's a progressive web
app so they went from like their old web
app experience which wasn't that great
to the new progressive web they went
they had a hundred percent increase in
and people like interacting with the
yeah app just for making it a better
website so weight in bike max said so
you heard from like you know when you go
to read it and call it run it again it
pops up the banner and it says hey would
you like to download our app did you
have to click that which then opens up
the Play Store then you have to click
the reinstall it if you're on 3g apks or
really big compared to websites it's
going to take a minute and by that time
you may be like hey I don't eat read it
that much it's like if it's if you go to
like Pinterest comm today you are
immediately flipped right into the
experience just from a yeah it goes from
like five steps to you click a link boom
experience you're ready to go and I
think if someone's not talked about
enough is how the development of it so
let's say that you're just doing an
internal application how much easier it
is to put something together you know
have it on your internet and then anyone
in your company that has access on the
internet their phone yeah so like
Enterprise is a good example like we
talk a lot with big companies and they
constantly bring up pwace because
they're used to distributing web apps
and like securing them on your network
what's foreign to them is having to go
through like a third party absolutely
and
like if you ever shipped an app to the
App Store it's a it can be yeah I know
I've lost a few brain cells that were
trying to get something in snap story
it's yeah it's it's really annoying
it goes from you know submitting gets
Apple hoping that they actually you know
accept what you built put it on the App
Store it goes from that to just you know
putting on a hosting service there's a
lot of cool hosting services today along
with some some some pretty cool hosting
services coming out yes so so one of the
things I kind of hit sit around on
Twitter about is a we are working on
ionic Twi hosting so this will come into
the over ya pwace so this will allow you
to go to use ionic PW interesting and
it's gonna have all the best practices
so like HTTP to hhd to push all handled
for you all built in was it you'll be
over to do yeah and that's super art so
needs to be Anissa so so for example so
the hosting service that I've used a lot
and I'm not gonna name it but they do
support HP to push but it's it's very
hard to set up and I can't tell you how
many you know hours I've wasted
wondering why I'm getting some random
for I for when the actual issue was that
I was like missing a comma somewhere so
we're you know that's not the greatest
of a like they'll developer experience
to us so we're moving to a more doing it
the ionic way really which is we knew
the hard stuff Ori we handle making you
know making sure that you're following
the best practices and yeah so you can
get a really fast yep you a yeah and
like you know it ionic or is definitely
built for this experience you make sure
that the the files are tiny tiny small
that they can be cache on the CDN for
forever
as there all the file names are hashed
so all the benefits that you want to see
in a PWA is like a download of once to
be blazing fast service I mean good
that's like a second time because like
the benefit of having a compiler is part
of the process exactly yeah and the
developer can write nice clean verbose
code but then the compiler turns into
some it's very fast so that kind of goes
into something I've been playing around
with like a naming thing as the iron PBA
toolkit I know I've talked to you been
about it where you take the stencil app
sorter which is basically an app store
that allows you to use stencil to build
your entire app with web components if
you want to and then if you suck at CSS
like I do and you want some nice you
know a nice UI you can use ionic or for
UI components that way you don't have to
design anything and then yeah you can
use iron POA hosting so you can go from
0 to 100 with best practices built in
lazy loading code splitting etc and then
once you get to the hosting side of it
HT to http
all handled for you you don't have to do
anything about it completely zero config
I could go on for days about it but it
sounds lovely zero to a hundred solution
for building well I want to just really
quickly address one thing because people
always bring this up like our PWA is
gonna kill native apps and that right
where do we stand on that and I think
like for us it's totally dependent on
your business if you are doing really
well in the App Store users find you in
the App Store like you're confident that
that's a good strategy we want to help
you with that like we think we can help
you with native apps in the App Store
and on the web and desktop in whatever
else like that's why you pick ionic
because it web runs everywhere in social
dynamic and that's we don't like really
care if the PWA is like gonna kill a
native app or vice versa right it's
really up to you and the core of how
ionic is built is to ensure that you're
writing code once you're not having all
these if statements up like if I'm on
Android I need to do this and you do
this is but rather having one code base
that works everywhere so yeah we don't
really care where you ship to it's it's
a you ship to the web with ionic and
then the cool thing about the web as it
runs everywhere so you can you don't run
it everywhere from you know you have an
app in the Play Store to a PWA to you
know what are gonna exactly okay in
space so another question I think it's
asked
that we should probably address which is
where does Apple kind of sit in with all
of this with PWS and like how does that
how does that get us how is that going
to factor into people who do want to
target pwace as a destination well I
have strong opinions on this I think
just looking at the facts like Apple is
moving to support these api's like they
are working on service work service
workers are coming it's they're actually
moving along pretty fast too I think
I've seen Mike he's been messing around
with service workers in a safari a
technical preview and the last thing I
saw he said that the API was already
stubbed out was it totally working but
it was there you could access it I mean
and also and I should say that the the
tipping point for us to use web
components in ionic was at animal
support or I find everything we're
looking for and they already have all
the dynamic import zo6 all the stuff
everyone so I think eventually they're
gonna support it and that's going to be
awesome I think in the meantime like I
said PW is our own mindset change so
when you think about what progressive
means it means that when when there are
more API is available you're apt to take
advantage of them so it's up to you to
decide like do I absolutely have to have
a service worker or push notifications
for me to move to the web if so then
you'll want to keep a native app around
you know that way but if the answer is
like no like let's say you have a new
site well maybe then the mindset shift
is maybe I should not load 300 megabytes
of that and maybe I do a web experience
I'm at to me it's not progressive web
app - it's really a mindset shift so I
tell people you can build pwace on iOS
if you just change the way you think
about your web strategy and I think the
progressive part of that is super
important right it's like you pull up
Twitter light on your iPhone 10 today
it's still a really badass web app right
like it's not gonna do push
notifications like I can get on my
android phone it's not gonna work
offline like I can do am Android phone
but it's still a really upgraded
experience from what Twitter's did have
on the web yes and it's 10 times more
accessible yeah exactly and yeah just
like if you think about where these
companies came from like the web was not
part of their mobile approach at all so
Peter Hayes is all about like oh we can
actually build a performance web app
like maybe we should take that seriously
again that's PWS and yeah I think one
part that we should touch on too is like
um so you know here in the US we have
like you know iPhone
and Android phones with tons of storage
and you know tons of RAM like the iPhone
10 you know has like a better CPU than I
think I have in my surface probably in
most some back books actually got
macbook air but you know that's that's
great but you know that's not the case
for everybody right and the web is one
of the most accessible platforms out
there you can access it pretty much from
anywhere so making it work for everybody
is key um so you know apks IPA users are
great but they tend to be very large
downloads are very large and you know in
some in some cases your whole data plan
might be blown away just from
downloading twitter off the Play Store
yeah which i think is just like that's
just stupid
yeah again back to speak so just how
stencil is designed to allow for time
exactly yeah so in you know with how the
web works and then with like al stencil
works and ionic or and it's all they see
loaded in could split you know you're
going from I think the Twitter had a
good example there's a slide out there
so shares like the Twitter ad K is like
40 something megabytes and the Twitter
light on the first few only loads like
15 something kilobytes of code or
something like that so it's it you know
if your data plan really matters to you
if you have a phone like the average
like $100 Android phones it doesn't have
a lot of storage doesn't have a lot of
RAM etc pwace are going to be a much
better accessible experience for you and
speaking of accessibility I should also
add that with ionic or we put a lot of
time into accessibility yeah yep how
that works and and actually I'm sorry I
totally just derailed this I just
remember that we didn't talk about the
ionic iOS 11 updates changes I mean the
design changes yeah so we did idea I
mean well big congrats to Brandi put
into the iOS loving cards look so yes
we're adding in the nice it's going to
be hot and mano has been part of that
and just to call out brandi is also the
reason why the save
handling that I was content and I was
getting killed it it was not easy
it was not a fun experience but he did
pretty good job on sir very good job I
mean the whole team has been has been
working super hard to get this stuff out
and it will be out as soon as like
outside as soon as is done so we're
racing towards releasing it as soon as I
can and it's gonna be awesome we are so
pumped about it I don't think I've been
this excited about the version of Bionic
I keep getting progressively more
excited certainly make progressive web
app to first class citizen there's
another question that keeps coming up is
will an ik for basically can you build
PW eyes with a little okay let's let's
go into the Chi we've move on
I think we only have one other topic and
it's a it's a we have a big announcement
it's the thing that we tricked everyone
into watching this show for I'm kidding
we have something really excited to talk
about should be a transition into it I
can well yeah so there was a question
there about Cordova native apos and
we've actually been working on new
projects for a little bit we've been
quiet about to kind of reimagine the
native layer of ionic so historically
you know we've used Cordova we built
Cordova plugins every single ionic app
is a court of app so when are when the
strategy is kind of this PWA strategy is
kind of come into our lives so to speak
we've been kind of trying to think about
how do we actually focus on building
pwace and web content first and then
enabling them to do a bunch of native
stuff easily which I spend a little bit
difficult right now so we can work out a
new project we're calling it
avocado codename avocado it might not be
the official name but but it's basically
a native bridge so you can write plugins
and one thing that we're doing is we're
kind of updating a lot of the the way
that you write plugins and interact with
them so you start by writing a Thai
script file in a type script interface
which backs out all the different types
that your plugins going to accept so
let's say you're building a custom
camera feed
a tiger file will then you define to the
user and document what exactly the
arguments are for the camera what data
in return so you don't really have to
guess it's just kind of all there we can
use that interface to then generate a
starting point for a swift file we're
using Swift for this for building
plugins and Swift has become pretty
dominant in iOS if you search on Stack
Overflow if you try to get help it's a
lot easier to find Swift information
these days which kind of happens
recently so objective-c is I don't like
looking at check to see if s jaktip C is
kind of falling behind and we think that
we can get more developers building
high-quality native plugins by moving
the Swift they're easier to write the
easier to maintain there's more
documentation about it now and then on
Android we're looking in the Colin but
we javis colleges are filling it through
yeah quite as much as Java has but
luckily there's like a tool you can
translate Java to Colin and later so if
it ends up dominating like Swift or
taking over I think we'll do that
there's some it's actually already
having I saw that like the native
Pinterest app already uses Colin and
some parts of it yeah so so we're kind
of looking at that and saying like we
want to really quickly close track what
native projects are doing to build
native functionality and come support it
so so let's talk about avocado yeah this
and this may not end up being what we
call it officially I think it's been our
sort of internal joking name as we've
been working on this for a while and we
wanted to give you guys kind of a sneak
peek into kind of what we're up to these
days and where we're spending some of
our time and so so why why avocado I
mean you kind of got into that a little
bit but what are some of the benefits
that you're gonna get from using avocado
as a means to sort of bridge that gap
between your web assets and native
functionality so one of the bigger
changes that we wanted to make from our
own usage of Cordova and building
plugins we felt like having a little
more control over the native project
when we needed it would have been really
really helpful so for example let's say
we're working on an iOS app we want the
iOS project to actually be a source
artifact so you're going to commit the
iOS project into your actual app so
you're going to be able to go and say
I just want to write some Swift here to
do one thing I'm gonna quickly write
that and commit this whole project into
my repo oh I need to go and update a
permission well I'm gonna update it in
androidmanifest because that's how
Android works and I'm gonna follow
documentation in Stack Overflow posts
and try to use around the edges of your
app which is like the the 5% where you
actually have to think about native code
we want to just kind of use whatever
official Android is using the official
iOS and then so Stan a bit more
standards yes in moving to like the
official dependency management systems
so like cocoa pods and treating things
as frameworks so instead of having the
code or a plug-in in your project you're
going to have a framework which is
externalized and in it's not in your
actual code base and you can update it
kind of independently so one cool thing
too is like Android studio and Xcode for
example a lot of these things still
handle for you right so like if you
install a library or something like that
and you need to include in your Gradle
build you know you'll get a prompt on
Android studio that says hey this this
side you need to configure this and here
you can click this button and boom it
works yeah you don't have to understand
Xcode and Android studio yeah but if you
really want to dive in and add some more
native functionality you have those
powers yeah it makes that escape hatch a
little more accessible and for example
one thing that we've kind of struggled
with I think developers have is trying
to use for example iOS to the command
line is really hard and it's it's it's
hard to do because Apple built a lot of
their their emulation and simulation and
running on device optimized around Xcode
so right by it by just opening Xcode and
hitting the play button I personally
find that I get a much better developer
experience than using the command line
right on so that's an example of where
we kind of just want to defer to the
tool that's best at the job and but save
you 95% of the effort building apps well
anyway I feel like it also kind of like
opens up your ability to kind of know
what's going on a bit more behind the
hood so to speak instead of having it
completely like abstracted away from
your ability to understand with
abstractions you can get to the point
where you're abstracting things away so
far that it actually becomes harder than
it should be then if you kept a little
bit you're more just standardized and
yeah yeah nothing is like how we're
enabling you know Peter
we are talking about at length about
this stuff but pto be rates have emerged
and there's some new kind of concepts
planets like we wanted to make sure that
you can develop once have a run great on
PA but also you deploy it to the App
Store with the same codebase and so with
avocado we were able to kind of rethink
a lot of how that would work and
allowing you know to transition the same
codebase between it to without having
issues having like really seamless
first-class web fallbacks
yep but also there's going to be a few
more like tangible changes so for
example with Cordova today a lot of the
plugins are kind of separated out we've
decided to build in the most common 80%
of plugins as default part of the API of
avocados so you don't need to install
them they get them by default we've
updated the file plugin is a big one
that we wanted to improve we made the
API more nodejs like so it kind of
breaks away from following the defunct
file system and web spec and and
speaking of that you brought up
something I think that I also want to
make sure we touched on which is you
know avocado is using a lot of modern
tooling now to allow it to be at least
an hour from our perspective a better
developer experience right oh yeah talk
about like kind of how ma how we've kind
of used modern tooling as a way to
create an experience that we think is
just super streamlined and I mean I
mentioned typescript I think that's one
of the biggest things like having typing
information that's why we build ionic
natives we wanted we saw the court of a
plug-in ecosystem wasn't completely
adopting types and so we wanted to
provide types but also a consistent API
to keyboard and a module like you
normally would in any other case you
have an import camera and running then
like promise a file support so this is
like this is actually ionic native but
with actual native code to so we're kind
of blending the two worlds so I guess
that's what I was going to get out was
is there a is there a scenario in which
the avocado project kind of morphs into
the next version of ionic native or yeah
or is it going to be something that's
gonna be separate for a while how does
that like well I can reconcile we want
people to think about this is one ionic
experience so when you could come and
use ionic we help you with the native
side we help you with the web side we
help you with the hosting and updating
side like
we want to have kind of a full second
experience but we think that we can like
the rest of the ecosystem it couldn't
find this useful and we want to work on
an open source project and maintain it
that other projects outside of Vienna
can use like constants or framework 7 we
want them to be able to use this and
benefit from it we think that's
ultimately a net positive and it's
probably better and even even ionic can
benefit from this 4 so we've got a bunch
of overlays that you know look just like
the native but if you're on native ionic
is able to detect that like I want to
show an alert we can use the real native
alert and this is something that we can
easily do with avocado which was
traditional kind and doesn't have to
know it just it's the same stuff just
alert on that note we've also been
inspired by the company base camp in DHH
is now kind of the figure of heinrich
heine minor handsome yeah he's he's been
and the team has been doing a lot of
writing about what they call like the
hybrid sweet spot and the hybrid sweet
spot is is using let's say native
navigation controls or native side menus
and drawers but keeping 80 to 90 percent
of your app web-based and we want to
make it easy for teams to make that
decision so let's say you want to use
the Android side menu because you just
like the way it feels it looks like
material design perfectly or whatever
but you want to keep most of the app web
so you can move quickly we want to be
able to support that and right now
that's been hard to do and we just we
realize like if that's what you want to
do we're still gonna save you so much
time focusing on web first yes yeah and
we've seen teams I mean when we were in
ng Europe I think we saw a team from a
bank there yeah trying is that are
already going through and they're
already trying to push the boundaries of
like incorporating some native stuff in
with web stuff and so I think what
avocado one of the goals of avocado they
have a kind of project is to enable that
the mixing and blending of native and
web so it's more of like a web native
project and you can go as far in one
direction as you want or the other and
it doesn't really matter so long as
you're moving in the way that's most
efficient for you yeah then being able
to take that code and deploy it as a PWA
with the same exact yeah that's
especially I think about like the mobile
ecosystem and when we
Oh Diana there were a lot of companies
that were 100% natives they made native
development easier and we always believe
that eventually given enough time web
would actually be a more efficient
cross-platform of choice
it just was a little bit early so now
with PWA is exploding we feel validated
that focusing on browser technology is
going to enable us to do a lot more than
companies that just picked a native tool
because now they're kind of stuck with a
pure native app and they can't go to the
web right of us without a complete
rewrite without a complete rewrite yeah
it's not efficient so then you wind up
with three separate web web base Android
code based in the Iowa Scopus
so we want ionic to like take advantage
of everything it has on each platform
I even includes react native I mean you
could use so react native is the same
thing where they have you know web views
and they have web content I did it with
the way that I on a course structure
this is the same thing if you have a web
content inside of react native you could
use anion check box to make it look and
feel just like I'm inside a web kind we
want to say we want that web layer to be
ionic and save you a ton of time yeah
distinct points electron and look at I
guarantee right yeah yeah yeah so so
part of avocados is for electron to
which is really really important for us
so let's talk in terms of like time
lines and stuff so we've been working on
this for a while it's been a it's
actually been an idea we've been tossing
around for quite a year over a year and
and we've been working on it a lot
lately I think we'll be able to have a
public or Lisa private testing in
January so we're moving really quickly
on it
February for sure for something public
we're already using it like it already
works for iOS and Android internally
it's just not quite fleshed out enough
so we're working on the CLI and tooling
to make that really easy so if you're
interested in touch with us if we're
gonna want to have testers start testing
out really previews of this once we
start doing confident on rolling it out
just to get feedback on it but we are
super excited about this I think it's
gonna be an amazing I've had enough
experience those web assets to start
working communicating with whatever made
of api's you are interested in accessing
and you can access all of
by the way which is a misconception I
think a lot of times with building West
that's pretty sick it's pretty
straightforward yeah sir and I think on
that point like avocado allows you so
for example you know if the update to
Android comes out to add some new
feature that is a native feature since
avocado you know has that like nice API
that's where you can write plugins
pretty easily
you know you feel would technically be
able to access that native functionality
the daemon they account for anybody else
had actually released a plugin for it
well yeah and the thing about that is
like there's no cross-platform benefits
there anyways because Android released a
new API that is only on interview you
might as well just write some Java and
it work and then you can have it working
today instead of having to wait for you
know Cordova to add a plan for it yeah
so anyways this is this is an early
project we'll have a lot more
information it'll probably be a few
weeks before we have like a website up
but good semi we have a URL yet or not I
think the show for ya we thought we did
but we realized we didn't buy it and
that's actually why we're open for ideas
but the point is we wanted to share with
you guys this really exciting project
that we've been working on and give you
kind of a sneak peek into what's in
store for I haven't cuz we usually try
to do with the ionic show so just to sum
it up avocados gonna help you with the
native app part of your app it's gonna
help you with native code it's gonna
help you with building your app natively
running in the emulator simulator adding
plugins working with the actual native
projects that's what it's trying to work
on doesn't really kind of reduce you
know the friction and just go straight
forward like if you do want to just open
up Xcode and hit the play button or hit
the build button that's it's regular for
you embracing the native project without
us automatically updating the project
without you knowing and having to reset
everything so yeah cool
all right well these are the main the
main topics that I had we're trying to
keep this under an hour we went a little
bit over yeah but I mean let us know if
you like this format for the Onyx show
because I think Justin
has been pushing us to it to get back on
the horse here and I had a lot of fun
today I don't know guys I think I would
love to keep doing this on regular
episodes yeah we should have another one
scheduled so with stencil on our core as
soon as those come out i'ma grab a pre
big push you know pushing tons of
content out there for pwace how to use
something like that kind of PW a toolkit
idea that I talked about before so we
should have another ion show around that
time it's part of the marketing plan for
it I'm finna taint but I think yeah we
get not've inundate yeah it's gonna be a
little while we just put together that
plan like yesterday but uh yeah I would
like to do it like scrim began to fit
the community likes it yeah we used to
spend an hour just getting that intro
you guys to keep doing live streams like
this so leave a comment yeah follow us
on Twitter or follow I will let you know
when we're gonna have the next one up
and we'll probably have more news about
the avocado project but again this is
for you guys to know about early since
you were here to watch this and I think
that's about it well we'll talk to you
guys online all right all right thanks
everyone thank you see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
