Attic pro update this is the early March
2018 edition I'm Matt I'm the product
manager on the ioniq pro team it's my
job to listen to you guys take all of
your feedback into consideration and
help figure out the next ways that we're
going to improve ionic pro so I wanted
to start these videos to kind of give
you guys some insights and what's
already changed why certain changes
happen and what's coming soon as well as
any known issues so be on the lookout
for more of these videos as time goes on
we release more things I'll be making
more of these to give you guys kind of
better insights into the changings in
ionic pro those either don't know ionic
pro is a suite of tools and services
around our always free framework that
allows you to build test deploy and
monitor your applications faster and
easier than before that includes Creator
annek view deploy package monitoring and
later on in spring we're also gonna add
progressive web app hosting just to give
you an overview of what we're going to
talk about today
ionic deploy has had some updates both
on the bug fixes front as well as a new
Pro client API and a new full tutorial
video also the Attic deploy limits that
we've put in place we're going to start
enforcing those in April I have some
more information about that we've
launched some new getting started guides
as well as new billing options and have
given you guys the ability to customize
your own invoices will also talk about
what's coming next as well as some known
issues so first one of the biggest
changes we've been working on lately is
some improvements to ionic deploy not
only if there been a lot of bug fixes
but there's also a brand new deploy API
so Anna Cordova has been updated to 4.0
point o that has a lot of bug fixes to
update that he'll need to remove and
re-add the plugin with your desired
settings the pro client which was
normally used to access our monitoring
service has been upgraded to 1.0 point
20 and that release includes support for
the entirety of the deploy api this
means you'll no longer have to use the
Cordova API directly you can use our new
typescript wrappers that have you know
full definitions all enabled straight
from the pro client to upgrade your
version of the pro client you can just
do an npm install and you can check out
our documentation for more information
on this new api just to give you a
little bit of background ionic deploy
allows you to update any non-native
changes that you want to make in your
app bypassing the app stores
going directly to your users so ionic
apps have layers like onions
we've got Cordova plugins native
dependencies Settings permissions all
that fun native layer stuff which has to
be updated through the normal app store
process but then you've got ninety-nine
percent of your ionic app angular ionic
custom HTML CSS JavaScript images icons
assets all sorts of fun stuff can be
updated on the fly using our deploy
service so you set this up we came out
with a new deploy tutorial video this is
a very in-depth video that goes through
how to set up deploy how to use our Pro
client API in order to set up a special
beta channel that your users can opt
into with the toggle and get new
features before the rest of your users
if they've opted into that channel so
you just push code up to us choose which
channel you want that code to go to and
your users will get that update right on
their devices depending on which toggle
they've used so check out that new video
in our documentation one of the other
things you may have noticed as well as
we added some usage metering kind of in
the dashboard that shows you how many
deploys you've actually used so
throughout the dashboard and the app
settings in the org settings your
personal settings as well as in an
individual app basis you'll be able to
tell how many deploys you have used now
you know deploy limits that are on our
pricing page that's something we haven't
been enforcing since we launched Pro we
really wanted to kind of look at the
data and figure out how users are using
deploy so we could come up with you know
very nice limits for you guys that are
kind of more related to how you're using
the product right we wanted to give you
guys more than you need we wanted to
make sure that kind of the the deploy
limits you have in place is something
everybody's happy with so we help these
limits and the new enforcement which is
not happening until April are something
that you guys like so by all means feel
free to keep the feedback on this coming
like I said enforcement even though
usage is showing in your dashboard right
now we are not going to force you to
upgrade your account until April so
you'll have the whole month of March to
kind of monitor gauge where you're at
and make a decision kind of on what plan
you'd like to jump to in April if you're
even required to upgrade next up you
might have already noticed some new
getting started guides in the app detail
view so when you open up your app in
attic pros
- bored you'll be greeted with this new
getting started page that has
walkthrough guides for every single one
of our features so feel free to go
through those and learn how to set up
monitoring or deploy or test with Anik
view build native binaries that even
collaborate if you want to get the
default tab back to the code tab like it
used to be there's a link at the bottom
of this page that allow you to change
that as well also we've heard you guys
loud and clear you wanted some annual
discounts so we have released two new
annual plans for a developer and teams
if you pay upfront for a year
you'll save either 49 or $89 also we
have changed the business tier to allow
for monthly subscriptions as well so
monthly that's $1.99 a month per seat
instead of having to fork up the 2 grand
kind of all at once for annual billing
so we wanted to give you that guys that
option as well
invoices are now fully customizable from
the dashboard so either in your org
settings or personal settings page you
can customize that invoice you can add
your business name address VAT any
information you want on your invoice
you'll be able to customize that right
in the antic Pro dashboard and download
your invoice you don't have to reach out
to support anymore you can set it up and
it'll just continue to work right in
your dashboard now I wanted to talk a
little bit about what's coming next what
the team is working on and kind of the
future for Anik Pro so first off we're
working on a github integration if you
guys are using github that means you
would no longer have to push your code
up to our remote you can instead just
push it to github we'll pull changes
right from your github and start
building them in ionic pro so that's
coming soon very excited about that and
we're also possibly working on some
other integrations as well we're also
working on improvements to monitoring
and deploy we're going to bring those
two services closer together make them
easier to set up and provide you guys
more insight into the actual errors -
we're also always working on continually
updating the ionic pro dashboard so if
you're having any issues with it or
think it's missing something reach out
to us also we're aware of some bugs
going on in ionic view and ionic dev app
hopefully by the time you watch this we
have already solved those and pushed
them live so those are coming as well
that ionic dev app on Android it has
been experience some issues that will be
a native release so be sure to check the
App Store to update ionic dev app on
Android when that happens also we've
heard you guys loud and clear one of the
highest requested features
is a package API that you guys want to
use locally and in your CI solutions to
kind of automate the package building
process so that is something definitely
at the top of our list that our team is
working on so be on the lookout for that
package API some quick known issues
Cordova Android released version 7.0
point O and that currently is not
supported in ionic package if you follow
along with this knowledgebase article
will show you how to get it set up so
you can continue building in ionic
package also we know some people have
had had some issues setting up PhoneGap
plug and push that specific plugin just
requires a little bit of extra setup in
order to get that functioning correctly
in package so feel free to follow along
with that knowledgebase article to show
you how to customize your build and get
PhoneGap plug and push building
correctly alright thanks for tuning in
guys I hope you enjoyed kind of this
little update from the ionic pro team
like I said I'll be doing these more
often and keep the feedback coming
thanks and I'll catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
