welcome everybody to sell your client a
mobile app with creator I know we used
the word webinar but this is going to be
really untraditional compared to other
webinars that you might have been on as
you can tell we're all kind of just
sitting here chillin we're gonna be
answering questions that you guys have
on sales tactics both using creator and
sales tactics for small medium and large
sized businesses in general to sell your
client's mobile apps if you guys ever
have a question use the blab question
feature just click that little slash
button in the bottom right of your
screen and that will show you how to use
the questions feature so it's easy for
us to answer all that stuff so I guess
let's introduce ourselves and get
started my name is Matt Kramer I'm the
project lead for the creative project
I'm Tim dot I'm co-founder of mobile
igniter and I'm not as short as I look
he's just got a really high chair I do
have him very high chair an excellent
there you go so today you know we did
have a blog post about this whole
process and actually not only think
about it let me link you guys all to
this right now the blog post was
released a couple of weeks ago on how to
sell your client a mobile app
specifically using creator and some of
the tactics that creator allows you to
do like preview via creator mobile and
use those techniques to sell to small
medium-sized businesses I guess a little
bit of dude what's up yeah I know I
wanted to like quickly just recap the
idea behind me yeah go for it so a lot
of people are building like pretty
serious mobile apps for big clients and
to actually cook them like there's a lot
of upfront work and that could be really
time you know cost a lot of time and
money and it's pretty risky so creator
ends up being this really great tool to
build prototypes quickly and actually
preview them as if they're real apps so
you're you're jumping past like the wire
framing yeah and you're actually getting
something real that might very well be
the actual app you build that gives you
code to so it's so trying to just kind
of get people in the mindset of
switching from wireframe and actually
building something prototype and quickly
and using
yeah and the word that a lot of
companies use for this is kind of called
speculative work which is work that you
as a company do to get a client but
before that client has actually paid you
any money or told you they're going to
give you any money so a lot of companies
especially consultants do not do spec
work they don't do work where they're
like oh yeah you know we'll lock you up
a preview of your whole app and show it
to you and then you can decide if you
buy it because there's so much waste of
time in that process and you know things
like creator allow you to actually do
spec work by making that amount of time
needed like really really small nice
what's that on the first half we were
99% perfect from creator it was amazing
we'd love to hear more about that so it
sounds like you were able to get an
apple from creator that was kind of
almost pretty much 99% ready to go into
fruit that was that a matter of like it
also kicked out most the cover you
needed or is it just that the customers
like liked all the features that you put
in do you want to chat with us if you
want to grab a square I can unlock it
quick for you man I can't tell that yes
to other questions or if the yes was to
I'll grab a seat unlock the seat we'll
see if you join men yes so anyways you
know as creator grows it's something
where our goal is to get you closer to
that 99 percent I think our goal is to
get you to a point where you're almost
done by the end of creator a little bit
of I'm not who talked publicly about it
at all but like one of the next major
features we're gonna add to creator is
actually code support from in the tool
so like JavaScript controllers right in
the tool it's you know start getting you
more dynamic and get you a lot better
with that kind of stuff with actually
getting you to that 99 percent so so Tim
do you want to just give people like a
little bit of background about what you
guys do how you approach like
speculative yeah we've been we've been
doing that since back in the Kotick a
days and you know it was like the reason
that I used code ago personally because
as a developer I didn't necessarily
need a drag-and-drop editor so much but
if I wanted to show clients something
really quickly I would throw something
together really fast show them and
actually they'd be able to touch through
it and they were like amazed like how'd
you do this so quickly I'm like well the
reality is that there's still a lot of
work to do the logic still isn't there
and that kind of thing
but they could get their mind around
what the app was gonna be in a heartbeat
and they would they be really joined by
and you know we've kind of we're still a
mobile company both now we do a lot more
with Internet of Things and we've
actually sold IOT projects using creator
because we go in and show them like a
mock-up of what the IOT would look like
coming through to the mobile side so
what is the UI of this product gonna be
like and then we actually never like the
last client that we sold using creator
in IOT we'd never actually even made
them an app I mean it was like we get
hooked them on the concept of what was
going to happen and then and then we
ended up building something else
completely different interesting in the
door yeah yeah and like that's the part
I like about this so much is it just
creates more of an emotional connection
I think with the sales process when you
can hold something in your hand and like
actually play with it and feel with it
and yeah normally it's like it's really
hard to get to that point even with
prototyping tools or like having a
full-time designer and like mock this
stuff up costing you money while using
something like creator is much easier to
get that into their hand really so so
then who's one of the co-owners here at
Bionic when we started the company we
were actually before we did ionic we did
this thing called Kodaka some of you
might know what it is but it's a similar
drag-and-drop tool but for jQuery Mobile
and what like the reason we built it was
Ben was a designer at an agency and he
would do these big elaborate mock-ups
wireframing
Photoshop design but then they actually
go and build it you had to just give all
these assets to the developer and they
would start over from scratch so if you
were using a mobile and if you're using
ionic with Creator the idea is you're
doing that prototyping and mocking up
but it's actually giving you actual code
that you would write yourself so you can
go and just start to build it so the
whole reason was it was empowering those
that first step of the process so it
wasn't this kind of like speculative
was actually building something real you
were investing in real assets yeah in
our side we didn't have a designer on
staff we always outsource our design
because they designers tend to like to
be freelance anyway so that we built our
business around that we're gonna hire
developers outsource design and so when
we wanted to sell on spec we couldn't
have somebody Photoshop but that would
have cost us way too much money oh yeah
for sure so we would just have whoever
wasn't busy throw something together and
and spit it back out I mean you put the
client's logo inside of a mock-up and
they're like what yeah that's that's an
important thing to note and really drive
home I think I know we just kind of
mentioned that in the random discussion
but like making the app feel like it's
actually your clients app is one of the
most important thing you can do for
sales in my opinion and it's really easy
with with traitorix I mean if you have
an app that you just showed to somebody
else you're basically just playing it
alone so change
yeah make sure you change everything out
I've done that made that mistake right I
have a different showed credibility but
yeah I mean yeah you're changing a
couple CSS Styles and suddenly the
entire thing is now yellow and black
instead of red and white so yeah it's
really cool that way yeah using their
colors flipping out their logo things
like that I know when back when I had my
own consultancy we targeted a lot of
restaurants and we actually got like
very ingrained in the local restaurant
community where everyone started coming
to us for these projects because we knew
we could do it cheaper than anybody else
we could help them out
now this was actual websites so we were
doing like WordPress but what we would
do is they already heard we were good
from a previous clients that we started
doing for like 500 bucks they're pretty
cheap but then we move up and be like
okay here's three templates you have to
choose from if you had to pick one what
would you pick and then we take that one
with their pre mates we'd like buy the
template for seventy-five bucks put
their contents in it which took us an
hour or two maybe and then short it -
and be like you know is this something
you'd like for thing the sale is almost
done like because you're already so
close to that 99 percent at that mark
and Creators what allows you to do that
same process for mobile apps instead of
web sites so so one thing that I think
is interesting is a lot of people have
kind of started using balsamic and doing
wire framing and
I love balsamic like I use it on my own
for a variety of reasons but I find that
when you're actually ready to look you
kind of know what you're building so
you're building an app and an app kind
of looks like an app it uses these UI
elements that people are familiar with
so I don't know if wireframing is really
as useful for mobile app development
anymore especially because you can kind
of put together something that's like
the the end user can actually understand
like Oh actually it looks like an app
that I'm used to so I can imagine like
my logo I can imagine my list items and
my tabs but like the mock like the
wireframe is almost too far away from it
that I don't know if always helps you in
mobile I think it's it's kind of a 50/50
thing I think all anybody out there
right now who is a UX designers like
screaming through the internet like No
Yeah right and in one of the problems
we've actually had is that we'll show
somebody something we've done in in and
creator and and they're like they think
it's done yeah and so part of them part
of it is that they get a little bit
nervous about well but I want this color
I want this and I'm like okay let's step
back and that's actually just a really
good indicator that it's time to step
back into more of a UX mode but if
you've got a customer who wants it fast
and inexpensive they're gonna be all
about like just bam bam bam let's skip
over that entire process yeah we got a
couple of questions we wanna dive in a
question or two real quick so somebody
said we're talking about like swapping
out the logo swapping out information
about the client things like that
Debra asks what about using tokens to
replace client information with the code
support that we're working on putting
into creator right now that's definitely
something that we're gonna allow you to
do we're gonna allow you to edit those
controllers in the controller you could
have you know a JSON list of data
related to the client and you can put
that right into creator so you could
literally just change that JavaScript
and have a whole app update that's
definitely something that is part of our
goal for this next major feature that
we're launching for sure like template
placeholders so you put like client you
know double brackets client name and
then in JavaScript you'd set the client
name to and whoever and on that note I
think the workflow there would be you
build one template and then in the
dashboard just duplicate the project
every time and
change those variables that would work
really well a couple other questions
that weren't necessarily asked via the
questions feature but a couple I wanted
to hit on just to confirm some things
elopes one of them was if I can find it
okay
somebody asked about SAS support SAS &amp;amp;
theming support definitely something
that we are super aware we need to have
in creator that is the next major
feature we will be doing after code
support and with that SAS we are I mean
we're gonna have some crazy stuff
available for themes and creator where
you know if you want to edit all of
ionic SAS and like have it recompile and
creator and change the whole app we're
gonna let you do that if you want like a
drop-down to change all default button
colors we're gonna let you do that
and then with that that's actually going
to start to allow designers to kind of
save themes and creators which might
turn out to be a creator theme
marketplace where somebody puts in
custom an Access hits save ups loads it
to the Creator marketplace and then
those themes are access to everybody so
like this is definitely stuff that we
are going to add and make everybody's
life easier for sure yeah with above
material design that that's you'll kind
of get some of that with with the
Android support and be one but ionic to
support is coming and the material
design is much more part of v2 so you'll
get an improved material design look and
feel here pretty soon yeah so on that
note one of the questions was what about
creative Radek - definitely on the
roadmap definitely something we're super
excited about right now we just want to
make sure that creator for v1 is stable
and feature complete you know as we can
already see if people are asking about
SAS support code support things like
that like those are all integral
features to creator that I would like in
there before we tackle essentially a
whole nother language but still very
high on the priority list I'd put it
probably at number three behind code
support and SAS support and then be -
sure cool cool alright so we dumped a
little bit into creator there thanks for
the question guys so keep them coming
let us know if you have any sales
questions about this whole process -
saying to answer my yes so like you guys
you're talking about going into ionic
which is based on angular 2 which is
also a little bit early maybe what do
you think I think will the really cycle
for angular 2 and I actually I think by
the time people realize it they'll both
be 2.0 or these stable mmm so this
summer very cool yeah so it's coming up
quickly our seas are both on the very
short term sweet so by the time we
implement it yeah we stable enough that
we're comfortable with it and creator
for sure um so so one thing that I was
hoping to get out of this as well as is
to hear from you know you all in the
blab have you used creator for your own
kind of client sales process for
consultant you know consultant
development building apps for other
clients you know if you if you have any
experiences with it or other tools like
it you know definitely let us know and
we'd love to talk about it yeah for sure
if anyone is like I mean like I said if
anyone's used creator for selling mobile
apps or gotten to the 99 percent point
90 percent point let us know in that
chat and we can unlock the seat and you
guys can talk to it too and we can chat
about it for sure
all right so anything else creator it's
specific before maybe we dive into
general sales I like so I guess I want
to talk a little bit about the creator
mobile app yes because the creator
mobile app is my baby it's honestly
honest to god I say it's my favorite
featuring creators our mobile app which
allows you to literally make changes in
creators so like change a button color
and then click a button on your actual
phone and have it show up right on your
phone immediately
there's no download process there's no
upload process it literally lets you
preview right on your phone so that
actually lets you take these completely
like non-technical creator mock-up
prototypes and then literally hand your
phone to a client and say here touch
this it's already on the phone and that
experience is super powerful we've
already talked about that a little bit
and with creator mobile like we try to
make that as seamless as possible that
creator mobile is something that's on
our Pro and team plans yeah so crater
mobile is is really cool because it it
kind of shows the power of ionic and
like web mobile apps but it actually is
like a mini app store so if you have a
bunch of clients and you have their apps
on your phone you can carry that around
that's like your portfolio and you're
talking to portfolio of it you can go to
a new client even if you didn't built
them something you could say oh here's
like you know in the example of my work
you could really quickly prototype
something get it on your phone in a
couple of minutes I think it's one of my
favorite features as well
it's hands-down my favorite feature I
love that feature yeah so Bravo and the
chat here says we started using creator
over envision and it was a huge
improvement they were shocked to see it
on the Creator mobile app so yeah
totally like its it's a totally
different experience when you have it in
your hand and part of that too is even
in even in the Creator editor right now
we just added phone skins to the desktop
client as well which yet again is just
another tiny little feature that makes
it feel a little bit more real yeah and
when you're on the desktop for sure and
it plays it also plays into the share
feature the preview feature yeah so so
so if you're not familiar you can easily
send people a link of the actual
prototype and they can view it on the
web as well and if they visit that tor
browser like you know through their
email or whatever they'll see the apt is
the same so you're getting the same
experience on the actual native
environment and on the web as well and
you know with the code editing coming
down the pipeline I think it'll be it'll
be pretty easy to start doing native
like take camera photos and such oh yeah
for sure I'm a creator and script all
that and have it actually be a working
app for sure and I mean I'm gonna
brainstorm a little bit here and some
future features you know we really want
to enable you guys from creator to use
it this way to use it as a tool in your
business to get you more sales to make
more money like we are here to enable
you and make you guys success
so long-term like I'm even thinking like
you know things that are very popular on
a mobile app side like royalty programs
creator might wind up having like a
loyalty program widget that you can just
add straight in your creator prototype
and have it work like we want to get you
there we want to help you guys and be
successful so I mean that's all stuff
that we're super excited about having
yeah like easily story form data yeah
like yeah for my customer support
requests or things like that like just
fill out this form hit go and then like
you you know you get a notification on
your phone and call them up like all
this stuff we want to make it super easy
for you guys to do and creator cuz like
that's our goal is to enable you guys to
be successful for sure you really just
sit on a really good point too about
mobile apps and and that is that it's
when you're selling to whatever company
whether it's a small business or an
enterprise you can really talk about how
these apps are not just about you know
the basic things that you think about
apps work but like you know talking
about customer support you can sell them
to their customer support aspect you can
sell into their sales aspect you can
talk to their marketing team you can
talk to their engineering team every
every aspect of a company can really
benefit from having a customer facing
mobile application even internal mobile
apps so yeah absolutely you know a lot
of company like for instance I mean
there's already a ton of stuff that
exists for this but like if you went
into a restaurant and we're like let me
make you a custom point-of-sale system
like that's something that you could
easily do with ionic for sure right
might even be cheaper than buying one
right I don't know I think you're right
I mean it's a good point of that there's
a lot of there's a lot of products out
there that are ripe for disruption
Mobile is probably the right product for
it or you know like for us in the IOT
space a combination of mobile and
sensors and and there's a yak because a
POS system cost thousands of dollars
they're very complicated they're a lot
of them are super outdated in terms of
Technology and there's all these things
happening like you know like NFC pay and
all these other stuff that they just
can't do so yeah yeah I'm just throwing
out ideas now so like with you know you
guys are hearing like the long-term
vision for what we want creator to be
able to do and like this selling your
client mobile apps with creator like
is a huge part of our long-term vision I
would say is enabling these kind of
these kinds of features for you guys
that's some good news for Venezuela so
that's awesome
so that's two that's two in the bank
yeah two in the bank so yeah I already
sold two apps using a creator showdown
with clients yeah we got people excited
about the clouds for stuff like that
yeah I can tell you that like we've we
were a small software development firm
and we've gone up against heavy hitters
in arts you know locally and the fact
that we can show things on a phone so
fast has kind of like people have been
like I don't care how small they are I
don't care if they like disappear
tomorrow but they're obviously faster
than the people that we've been using in
the past and we've actually taken that
to the next level
with you know incorporating creator and
products like it into our agile space
because we can come in and show a
feature you know like they can say well
what if we did this and how much would
that cost like okay well we're gonna
spend three hours I'm just mocking this
up and showing you like two or three
ways that this that this workflow could
work and then they're like oh oh yeah I
look at like this we think our customers
will use it this way yeah and that's
just way faster than building them
something completely showing it to them
and then having to be like oh yeah how
it feels right our customers would never
use it this way and you know what the
usability guys out there gonna they're
gonna skewer me but that is you know
it's a great way to shortcut that whole
experience is actually just showing them
two or three and they can take it out
and do hallway testing they can
literally list and run around their
office and show it to five or six
stakeholders like right then as opposed
to you know like feeling like they just
spent 10 grand and those feature that
everyone had better like it or else
we're screwed
well the other thing is to is it like it
rains in your clients yeah so like if
you show them one option they're like
their mind is like what would I change
how could it be different Nick they've
got a million ideas running around in
their mind about how they can change it
cuz they've only seen one object you
show them three different options and
now instead of their mind like exploding
and going in all these directions
they're saying which of these three
would I like more right that's something
Eddie I'm tying back to like creator
mobile just mock-up three different
actual relic and they're all right there
on your phone yep yeah and we've we've
done that as well I mean it's just it's
the easy way to go and then we end up
times like if they want to optimize it's
really about taking a feature from one
in a feature from another and bringing
them together as opposed to well I found
this app over here that does it like a
completely different way that no one's
ever seen before
yeah oh man I had some crazy stuff at my
and my last gig we did we did IOT mobile
apps and things like that for clients
and man some of the things that got
requested from like internal user
experience departments at these
companies were like the like things
where it was like this is a horrible
idea and but like if we didn't make it
they didn't understand like they wanted
to feel with it feeling quickly get to
know we do in smoke these days I hope
just said that knowing and showing your
hand this is shocking all modern
marketing so so one thing that I would
be curious to get your thoughts what do
you think is happening in the mobile
space like so our whole thesis and
theory behind ionic is that more people
are going to need more apps which means
that they're gonna have to be built more
quickly and for less oh and there's a
traditional native development shop that
spends 100 hundreds of thousands if not
millions of dollars on one app it's just
kind of going by the wayside yeah I mean
that that's homey that's the reason we
started our company mobile igniter in
the first place back five years ago was
because we realized that people with
Wall Street budgets could very easily
buy a quarter million dollar app and
just be like yeah no problem you know so
if you're Walgreens you're gonna have an
app that was made native on both sides
but if you're you know we've got a local
local pharmacy here melot's and they're
a great business but they could never
drop the quarter million dollars and so
that's that was kind of our thesis and
starting the company and now we've seen
it happen where the price point is being
driven down even if we're going to a
large corporate client where they're
like yeah yeah we're not gonna drop
we're not gonna spend a quarter million
dollars on what is essentially an idea
an experiment yeah so part of it is that
the marketplace is pushing things down a
part of it is that more and more people
are doing things that are lean so
they're thinking like you know I'm gonna
I'm gonna risk less and this is a great
way to do that you can you can actually
not only like show ideas faster but you
your finished products faster yeah so so
on that note I think also like when you
see IOT stuff what we're seeing is that
a big company will have a lot of
internal stuff that they need apps for
so they have like oh so it's with one
company that we work with has like 20
apps internally for a variety of like
factory stuff
HR stuff so they have their own world
inside and they can't spend that much
time and money on these absolute they
have to build them quickly but you know
they're not always the right person to
build independent how important they're
so I don't you seen that without see
especially yeah well it's it's all it's
all of a piece I mean it's it's all kind
of the same stuff like no matter which
way you're looking at it you know
someone just mention that Walgreen has
their own internal and and it's great
but they're spending their spending at
least a quarter million dollars just to
maintain those people on an annual basis
so that's I mean they're still spending
the money one way or the other they're
spending probably more in having their
own folks yeah end of idea write-off
show not another thing to said I found
that not only is that so true but most
of these big dynamic have bad user
experience and totally painful to use
right and like it totally is true like
people but I'm one only money into these
things they try to use like completely
new and different ideas for like
navigation and like all the stuff that's
like you know simplicity I don't want to
say simplicity is key but more like just
common user experience yeah and that's
something that I addict like that's the
ionic is I give you guys really high
marks for for having like common UI
elements like these are the thing this
is the way people interact with apps
today as opposed to like we've got
clinically well we need infinite scroll
on this like no you really don't need it
in school because we can't like no one
can book marketplace inside of infinite
scroll or you know there's all kinds of
like weird how do I get to the footer
right like it's sometimes it's exactly
the right thing if you're if you're
making Twitter yes you need infinite
scroll but like not always that's not
yeah yeah so I think the point point is
basically the market is changing it's
compressing a bit unless you're the like
you know the big fish building a major
consumer app I think that's all
it's gonna be I think that's gonna be
kind of stable for a little bit but all
these other apps that are proliferating
the native models it's not sustainable
so for for creator we're trying to help
everyone else kind of adapt to that I
mean that's that's the whole point about
ionic so Creator takes it a step further
absolutely yeah any any app that's using
basic create update no kind of kind of
stuff is a great use for ionic and
Creator yeah if you're building mover
from the ground up you're probably going
to want to go native I mean there's a
lot of their interaction has to do with
you know like the mapping of stuff and
all those things and they can be done on
the web but you know that doing it with
a native layers you know if you're doing
something completely new kind of makes
sense for sure for sure the yeah the
cool thing that like so I don't know I
had a list of like little tips I came up
with I don't know if any of these
irrelevant or if we even want to talk
about all of them but like one of the
things the two about ionic is yet again
like you're just getting a OS and
Android immediately with Anik you get
both and like that's something we're in
that sales process
now we're talking two for one right like
so you know two for one you get is a iOS
and Android cuz you don't have to
program both one things like that these
are things that I like just to take for
granted as kind of a long-term cordova
developer yeah we still have clients who
are like so we got a bid on an app and
we're like okay great you know they'll
throw it a number like okay well that
sounds reasonable and they're like okay
so how much for Android really like no
that's done and well actually we don't
say that what I say is we can do that
for another 10 grand or you know
whatever basically in in well put the
money to good use because we'll just do
a digital testing you know if that's
sure that's what they want to do if they
want to make if they have a specific
aspect but yeah and then it's it's a
great opportunity to just say yeah
that's done do you think clients are
good I mean I see them getting used to
it being kind of a two-for-one as more
people are offering that I think paying
for both is going to become increasingly
a of market kind of self yeah
challenging self I still I still see
that I still see people who have no idea
yeah
but I think if you're a head of that it
seems yeah and like here's here's the
thing like our development community
like we're aware of a lot of these
things like for me like I didn't even
think of two-for-one until I read
something yesterday and was like oh yeah
like ioniq is a two-for-one deal like
that's pretty sweet like when you go to
these businesses like a local restaurant
or things like that like you're starting
the beginning almost like babe you might
even have to explain to them just the
benefits of having a mobile app and what
a mobile app can bring to their small
business to their restaurant you know
loyalty programs push notifications for
like maybe you're having a slow day you
know send out a push notification from
this you know your personal ad to your
clients apps where it's like hey free
burgers tonight or something you know
like there's there's all these things
mobile can do where you're gonna go into
that business and oh by the way you know
we can do i OS and android at once
the look and feel you know like they
should on each device you know that's
something where because you you're
starting the whole process with these
smaller clients that you know I still
think it's gonna be beneficial for for
at least the foreseeable near future in
my opinion so the other thing too is
we're kind of just starting to focus on
is there's also a mobile web portion to
it and there's also gonna be a Windows
portion just so it becomes an almost a
four-for-one but I think about
restaurants and I think about how
terrible their Google search - mobile
web experiences usually are
oh yeah there's so much opportunity
there I think to fix that as well so
ideally in we're trying to take this
gigantic in this direction in general is
to also make that mobile web experience
awesome and create our apps work in the
browser as well so that's another aspect
to it so you can kind of cell be like oh
well you know Google is starting to
really prioritize mobile web traffic if
you have a bad mobile web experience and
you're not mobile web friendly Google's
gonna you know reduce your search engine
rankings like you don't want that so now
like you've got a great mobile web
experience but you can also have a app
store experience if you if you want
they're not mutually exclusive they're
just different distribution channels and
you can kind of do all those at once so
so this won't be in the weeds but what
about what about me you're talking about
the Google search engine stuff single
page apps and and SEO seem to be a huge
drag
question mark yeah
so there's definitely some server-side
stuff that needs to be in place for that
I think aren't they getting better
nothing people's Google like that
doesn't Google now know how to crawl
angular apps I thought I wrote something
about and here's the thing like we
turned on for Mountain developer ii-if
creator we turned on html5 URLs and I
think Google knows how to how to get
through those I think now yeah I mean I
we see there's a start-up here that that
did a full SP a not really doing SEO
stuff not to read server-side rendering
and their their search engine results
are are doing really well so so Google
is I personally don't like relying on
that I think it's fine but there's a
server-side rendering aspect that we are
doing with with ionic 2 that angular 2
is doing really well so we'll try to go
in that direction and kind of cover all
the bases for sure for sure somebody has
I guess we can answer this click is
there any claim for crater desktop app
maybe maybe it wouldn't be some of that
content would be offline and available
we'd still have to be able to push
updates relatively quickly and we'd
still want to ping our server so like
even if we have an offline creator I
think we're not offline but a desktop
app I think we'd still at least have
some minor like server pings and things
going on yeah that makes sense because I
mean we have paid accounts and things
like that you know it's very difficult
for us to be like yeah download and use
it offline for forever and then like you
know we got a story somewhere right yeah
yeah so we do this with a code ago and
it worked fairly well I think it's a
it's just to me like you're it if you're
used to got some apps like you'll to use
it more often you know like like
balsamic is another example like Excel I
usually sings on my desktop mainly slack
so if it's a convenience thing you're
using it all the time like I love the
idea of it
yeah we just got prettier how it's gonna
work and like yeah with sauron's it's
very yeah yeah with electron it's
totally sweet so yet again that's
definitely something that we're aware of
it's on our development list you know
but things like the JavaScript coding
SAS v to support things like that are
kind of been pushed up the chain who
knows maybe on a Friday we'll get real
real mad and just program it in the day
we'll see what happens okay we just got
a question though let's answer this
quick because okay so you got a client
right there's several different kinds of
mobile applications we're not just
talking about iPhone and an Android
phone we have iPads all different kinds
of Android tablets like so many devices
now are aware and clients might want a
device for explicitly the iPad and that
is a feature that we actually launched
last week we're in creator now you can
preview things in iPad and Android and
all those different views right in
creator and the other thing is too like
creator mobile is available on all
devices as well we publish that to the
Android store in the iOS store for all
the devices so like you can just create
a mobile write on an iPad and it'll
still work just fine - it would be great
we just we just we just built an app and
we're putting it into the store now and
Apple wants like 4000 screenshots oh man
that's that's been on on my list of
things I want to figure out how to
automate trust me I've done research on
it what is coming and nobody told me
about as we look up a splash screen and
icon support are coming i like splash
screen i'm talking oh that's something
where i've asked for that too so like we
feel you're paying on that so you want
it kind of like well I mean either-or I
mean but the thing is you need like 15
sizes of images that's the promise right
now like so yeah and I forgot that you
had to do that it's been so long like we
do a lot of internal apps oh I forgot
about the fake story and we went we
submitted Mike oh I'm just gonna put up
screenshots for the 4.7 wrong you're
putting up screenshots for everything
and I'm like do they actually expect us
to like have all of these devices who
can you know literally do screenshots I
mean though in my partner's like we all
know yours we use the emulator like
really I'm gonna spit up spin up the
emulator like 15 times to do this that's
ridiculous
so yeah so a future where you could just
like like pick three screens and have it
spit out those shot to be awesome yeah
that would be cool and actually we
should we should get that into the ionic
resources tool this screenshot
generation that'd be really nice yeah
that's definitely something that I think
would be cool so Bible says that's
exactly why we were only at 99 and not a
hard percent because we had to do splash
screen icons oh yeah oh so that I should
mention the splash screen and icon
support we are baking directly in a
creator with ionic package and it's
going to be in the export for the new
version of the client like so that's
definitely something that is coming soon
like that's definitely coming yeah
yeah for sure so so if you want to talk
a little bit more about like your
process for going from you know start to
finish and how you use and we talk a
little bit about the kind of rehash for
everyone how you use tools like creator
to jumpstart that get a little bit ahead
of the development process so on the
developments well yeah so I mean the big
piece is because we did it for sales and
because we use creator we are ahead of
this ahead of the game because we've got
code that will literally spit out and
granted your or you're gonna be adding
stuff like controllers and all that but
even just having you know a bunch of
views that I can that I can drop
directly into an app and and and start
writing our code is a huge jump start I
mean otherwise yeah like you'd like you
mentioned earlier otherwise we'd be
getting on Photoshop or a balsamic and
we'd be then translating that into a
bunch of stuff and our developers really
want to work on logic not UI elements or
if they're working in a UI element is
because we're building a custom one you
know they don't want to like they don't
want to waste their time this
boilerplate boilerplate boilerplate so
Creator saves hours and hours and makes
for happier developers yeah which is a
huge a huge bonus because then we can
pay them less because well that's I mean
if they're not angry about having to do
stuff they don't want to do then I know
they're not complain about none of our
guys are watching this right like
they're all yeah we've used them side by
side with crater and yo sometimes
that is the right tool for the job
because we're doing something especially
for doing something that's outside the
realm of mobile but we're inside of
mobile we almost never use any of those
tools anymore do you find like so some I
thought with with some of those is you
kind of need to have a lot of investment
in that design assets ahead of time yeah
you have to have and you have to have
someone who has their masters in sketch
like you have to you have to like really
know that product who they're gonna use
it and again since we don't generally
want to have designers on staff it's not
that we don't love them it's just that
they like to be freelance we just don't
have that tool on our team so we do have
one one guy who does UI but he's like an
important asset I don't want him wasting
time is if he can be doing something
seven times as fast and creator
somebody asked an important question I
think we should hit on for right now cuz
this gets asked a little bit which is
are you saying ionic creator means you
can build a shell of an app look and
feel or can you build a fully
functioning at our goal especially long
term is to get you all the way to
functioning app like we said we're
working on today's coding or against a
support and all these features that are
going to get us closer and closer there
right now how I like to view it is ionic
creator gets you that prototype gets you
look and feel but the thing is it
exports real code and we get all of our
UI router code exported all the
templates are exported blank controllers
like we get you essentially an app where
let's say you were building like a fully
static app then you can get to 100%
already with creator once you start to
add that dynamic functionality that's
something where you might need to export
and add a little bit things right now
but we're gonna try to bring more and
more of that in the tool as we go
starting with these J's coding features
for controllers and services and things
like that starting with the SAS support
and all these other features that you
know I've been highly requested are
things that are on our list to get you
clothes from that hundred percent yes so
right now we're trying to get people in
the mindset of use the tool as a great
prototyping tool to get you know get
your app they'll quickly start working
on your next step the logic part kind of
comes after creator but you're just
we're expanding its usefulness past that
looking looking at your use case three
I mean you're looking at the real answer
for an Android developer right now
you're still gonna want somebody to
build your logic but you can now get
somebody who writes javascript to build
your logic instead of like an expensive
native program and yeah you just hit me
up it at Timothy not calm if you really
want Android developer there you go you
know and the other thing is too we have
if you guys go to ionic I Oh
slash discover you can find links to a
lot of our community things they're our
forum and our slack group specifically
our slack group like if you guys are
looking for ionic developers to maybe
take something you've made in creator
and make it dynamic check out our slag
group there's I think there's like a
gigs portion in our psyche repair jobs
or something where you could ask there
and see if people can finish up your app
that you've made from creator for sure
like I'm sure there are tons of people
and they're willing to help you out and
you'll they're looking for work yeah and
you'll you'll find people who are gonna
be really really comfortable with that
aspect developers like a developer who
understands ionic is gonna be much
happier working with a creator started
app than they are going to be if they
get a a Photoshop document yeah
absolutely well that's why there's such
a big business in PS PS Vita HTML right
yeah which needs to go away people we
need to stop this now any other all
right let's see if we got so somebody
answered a question or ask a question is
there any way to connect firebase from
are going to be easily through creator
same answer kind of we not yet but it's
definitely something that we really want
to get you today 100% point that's
something that we've definitely talked
about in figuring out how to do so I
will add that with soso connectors that
are more like baked in like firebase
Mongo that's gonna be coming a little
bit later
yeah ever with the jas anything you'll
be able to do anything
totally like exactly with that jazz
editing include the script run add your
service like and you'll be able to use
firebase right in there if you're
comfortable with that firebase angular 2
Toria Lester's try to help just like
yeah I use this yes it's kind of used
the generic miss of the tool before we
start to bake insert totally totally so
like once we come out J's coding support
I will probably be releasing a
creator tutorial I'm like how to use
popular things with the Jas coding and
get them up and running I love it it
started with something that just did
mock data ya know like not even having
to spin up a real service yeah yeah just
give me a JSON doc and that would be
awesome
totally totally let's see here another
one are there any thoughts of
consolidating creator app and viewer
there aren't any thoughts for that right
now
we like creator mobile in creator land
just because we're gonna have a lot of
features in creator that are more
structured for instance like once there
would be an official fire based plugin
to that there might be features in
creator mobile unique to creator based
on some of these features we've been
adding in other words Creator like why
annek view is going to allow you to like
anything you want just upload it like in
our structured environment of creator
we're gonna be able to give you more
powerful features in Creator mobile
because their structure around it does
that make sense that I explained that
okay yeah so it's it's targeted at
workflow and view and that's true too
yeah I think yeah I think feature wise
there is definitely some overlap right
now but I think that'll cause they
diverge a little bit yeah yeah I
definitely think we'll get like we will
get further and further ways yes and
we're also thinking about ways to do
some way labeling yeah the creator app
like if you want to if you want to have
your your agency your company's brand
for the creator app so you can be like
oh download the mobile igniter testing
app they can just it's your sounds
really familiar yeah yeah yeah yeah and
I mean this audience like if that's
something you guys are interested in
please do hit us up on Twitter or chat
with me in the tool about light label
and creator mobile that's definitely
something we've talked about and we'd
love to get a pilot person on board for
that concept so and like imagine having
your app and telling your client like oh
download my app it's got all the
prototypes got your it's got your
happiness yeah like go check out your
prototype right in the mobile igniter
yeah you could totally do that you could
totally see them and make part of it
available for a portfolio if you want
them to look at five or six different
apps yeah I mean that's that's
the thing about also about selling sews
SMBs that we're talking about earlier is
that these guys have five minutes tops
yeah and they have to understand
everything and they have to like
viscerally get it like immediately
because if you're trying to sell to like
a restaurant like they've got peoples
trying to sell them crap oh and they've
got no time yeah no time you're managing
a restaurant and there's and there's no
like excess money either so you're in
have to like be able to show them an ROI
like instant yeah it's gonna be like hey
dude here's the app right on this phone
like here's three options like do you
think you'd like one of these three
right and like at that point time it's
right in front of them they're viewing
three different options on the phone
they get to pick one they like and you
can close that deal like exceedingly
fast yeah and you can and you could even
like split things out by by by feature
in that you can say listen this feature
will increase your business by 10 to 30%
I mean what kind of ROI does that mean
to you okay great it's gonna cost you
this much a month and that you know
that's easy math for them to do whereas
your business really needs a mobile app
is a really hard sell it's it's just way
too much Theory too abstract yeah sure
sure for sure for sure yeah you know
yeah you know it it the thing is social
media account we have two different ways
one was almost perfect right out of
creator the other was a handoff to a dev
team from static both have been a great
experience like there's gonna be apps
that you can already get close to a
hundred percent and creator especially
if they're fully static you know we
added YouTube and Vimeo video support
right now so like we have a client or
two that's using creator to build an
internal knowledge base app that's just
like lists up there to you know their
internal company videos where you know
everything works how do you handle a
private content in that respect they
probably just set the YouTube videos to
be if you have the URL only for that
specific use so yeah so so before you
write that Matt we we are also very
interested in case study so
you're using creator successfully for
your own sales stuff for your own you
know client pitching let us know we
would love to write about it put it on
the blog put it on the site showcase you
very prominently on the website and also
we're looking for someone interested in
trying out a white label version of the
Creator mobile app so if you want to put
like your email so we can get in touch
email
Oh we'll do this one I don't use email
much anymore but if you use it from the
front of the office like I'm here are we
doing this thing or not get ahold of me
it helped it use creator calm that goes
straight to that little it goes to the
same place the chat bubble on creator
goes to so hit me up via there you know
we'll be on the lookout for anything
relating to the white labeling or case
study is like we'd love to have you guys
on the blog you know we'd love to test
out all the stuff with you guys yeah
we're here like I said we're here to
help or Hilger make you guys successful
like that's the long-term vision is to
make stuff like this a really great
experience for sure let's see anything
else we want to chat about no I mean you
know love we had we've been getting you
know feature questions and such we're
hoping to kind of keep them or salesy
but we I guess if people are interested
so so so much if you use an eye cream
you get this kind of love so keyframe
stop animation support not quite yet
I don't know if we will end up doing
that I think it might add too much
complexity I don't know what's going but
you know with CSS animations we in ionic
and ionic 1 &amp;amp; 2 we have a set of baked
in CSS animations we're trying to add
more like defined flows so that you'll
probably have more of like a you know
kind of a little bit on Rails experience
so it won't be like a flash-based
keyframe
animation editor but this Matt Matt
Matt's faster always wrong I have no
life I just hang out on creator support
all the way ok so here's another
question regarding sales do you tend to
go into presentations with the prototype
or do you prototype on the fly from of
the clients I think it fully depends on
the type of client like like we said if
I'm going into a restaurant we've
literally walked in and we were like
here's three options do you like these
we can mock one up for you we'll be back
tomorrow
and we can show you it with kind of what
you're we take a copy of their menu and
be like we'll put your menu into this
template and show it to you tomorrow is
that's something you would think it's
cool like oh yeah give that a try oh
really cool it's like usually around
1200 if you do it and they're like cool
1200 sounds go come back tomorrow and
we'll you know talk about it and so like
that like I like doing prototypes when
it's people who have less amount of time
it also feels a little bit more personal
to me I would imagine that changes with
larger clients yeah if I'm if I'm
selling to a larger client I will
absolutely have two people in the room
and if I can if we get the network
connection everything else Oh
get comfy yeah I will absolutely like
drop something on the on them like that
where we like drop in they're like oh
our goals updated I mean I don't give a
furtive glance to my to my sales
engineer just be like make it happen and
and they'll be I mean that just the
mind-blowing piece and that's where a
small shop like us can really can really
just destroy a larger larger group
because they like it well no we can't
what so yes absolutely I'll do that on
the fly hi so one thing that well yeah
but those those presentations though in
that vendor atmosphere are probably
important - yeah something like that is
that if anything goes wrong if you're
counting and I'm doing that just don't
yeah yeah things locked and loaded on
the app be able to show them stuff not
require a network connection because all
of those things will chip away at your
sales yes it can be amazing if you're
like connected directly to Twitter and
also stuff just like starts dropping in
but if it doesn't drop in you're screwed
which is why I asked about the mock-up
like you know be able to do mocks
because I would much rather have my data
completely yeah you know that you
wouldn't have to log into something like
there are ways to change the data right
it could be local that's a good price
absolutely be the point you want to be
you want to have that a hundred percent
you know so one thing that I don't know
people are in the in the share the
preview page that you can send to people
so one thing you can do is you can you
know password protect it so you can send
it to a client but they have to know the
code to put in so only they could do it
and you can actually do a nice kind of
dim the lights presentation mode you can
kind of make the screen dark put it up
on a projector but actually in the phone
frame and that's a great way to actually
show in front of a larger group of
people yeah now we got about eight
minutes left so I did want to hit I know
it talks a lot about different features
in creator I did one hit a little bit
just on like where you find these
features and the plans that we have
available for everybody so on the free
plan you guys get one project that you
can you know create markup with things
like that now if you're doing sales
we're doing consulting you're trying to
mock up three different ones the pro
plan has five different projects and
access to creator mobile that you can
view those projects right on your phone
and then the team above that is our team
plan which allows you to have five
different collaborators so the cool
thing you can do with the team plan is
like if you where we go to the
restaurant I have three different
versions that's something where you can
like add that client to your account and
like give them access to their mock-ups
where they can play with it on their
phone for a day or something like that
if that's something you want to do or
you just have like your sales guy a
couple other people like you might want
to have those people all have access to
the same projects so I did for you guys
starting out here we did create a little
promo code for you guys to get 25% off
your first month if you wanted to try
any of our paid plans like I said it
comes to creator mobile comes with
sharing stuff like that so we can use
coupon code and get effect in the chat
here for you guys it's 20 sales 25 of
the code for 25% off your first month
and then we will
laughter says how did you blab for sales
there's a lot of stuff I'm glad for that
kind of stuff yeah like like yet again
guys blab is a great platform we have
over 180 people watching this thing live
there are 43 people live right now over
a hundred eighty people have come
through like this platform can handle a
lot of stuff I love glad I have a suite
hangout on here creator suite use that
code sales 25 to grab 25% off your first
month I will also be emailing that
coupon code and recording this whole
discussion to everybody who signed up
using the Eventbrite link so make sure
that you ordered something via that
Eventbrite so it says if I am my client
wants to use creator does that require
team if you want to give your client
access to creator mobile app to view
your projects in your account or you
want your client to have access to like
edit any of your projects or things like
that and see them like from their own
dashboard those are both things that we
require a team account if you wanted to
walk in and just show it to them on
creator mobile don't give them access
and don't let them download creator
mobile or things like that you might be
okay with just a procow yeah so mobile
emitter is a full-service
development shop focused on the Internet
of Things we do mobile cloud and
embedded programming and we are teamed
up with a lot of really great
engineering outfits to handle you know
me work and industrial design so yeah
that's nice
yes so the possibility to have clients
download creator to review the app if
you're talking about creator mobile like
yeah that's totally something that like
so I think what you're asking then is is
there possibility to use creator mobile
not have them create an account but
still have them have access to those
apps yes I think that's a great idea
yes yeah so let's definitely get that in
the roadmap and I'll see if that's
something we can get into creator pretty
soon for you guys yes cuz I think that'd
be a cool idea
yeah just like download creator app
don't login instead put in like a code
like five or six digit code to view an
app or scan a QR code so alright guys
thanks everybody for joining us thank
you Tim for joining us I appreciate your
time and really fun we appreciate all
your guys as x know QR Cup all right
guys I will be sending the recording and
the coupon codes you guys to your emails
if you registered ahead of time so be on
the lookout for that
and remember tacos are better than for
