team and today I want to talk with you
about forms and all the components that
you can put inside of forms so first of
all there are two ways that you can
start a form in your new project the
first is taking this form element from
the left and dragging in an entire
default form that just comes
pre-populated with a toggle a radio and
input you know you can delete whatever
you don't need move things around
whatever you need to do the second is we
made it a lot easier to add forms in
this new version by allowing you to drag
any form component onto the page and
will automatically create that form
parent for you so let's drag a check box
onto the screen and as you can see we
have a checkbox and the parent form
automatically exists now on this parent
form we have an action and a method now
these are straight links to the HTML
that are going to be giving that action
URL or the methods such as get or post
you know these are kind of programmer e
things if you don't if you're doing
something in JavaScript with this form
instead of actually submitting to a page
you know you can leave this stuff blank
we just wanted something there for you
in case you wanted to actually post to a
URL or something like that so let's
start off with by going through every
component that you can add to a form
starting out with this check box so this
check box here you can add a title here
so you could do you know you want extra
cheese on your pizza and name name is an
internal thing you use for the forms so
when you submit this form name could be
you know toppings or you know what let's
name this cheese and cheese would either
be set to true or false depending on
whether or not that check box is
actually checked so as we can see if we
preview this we have that check box
capability right there we can turn it on
we can turn it off now next up we have
our standard input and this input can be
given a title that's what shows up on
the left here so name your pizza and
then we have a lot of different types so
we start off with text but you can also
put a password email phone number number
date month and the difference between
these especially like email phone number
of things like that is that we're going
to bring up the corresponding keyboard
on the phone
for that email so the email will have
the @ symbol and calm and buttons like
that really handy for you to use
placeholder just puts whatever it's
there if there's nothing so you can put
you know we'll just do nothing and see
how that's a little placeholder text
that you can put in there and yet again
the name is the internal form value that
you're associating with this input next
up let's talk a little bit about radio
buttons so radio buttons are interesting
because you probably are going to use
that name attribute when you're making
them so let's just say you wanted radios
for all the different toppings on your
pizza you know we will have pepperoni
and we're going to name this topics and
that's important because we're gonna
duplicate this two more times and will
change pepperoni to sausage and will
change this third one to mushrooms and
all three of them have that toppings
name which means that when we preview
our app only one of them is going to be
selected at a time and we took care of
that for you because you named them all
toppings now let's move on to the
arrange component so this range
component you can give yet again a title
the name yet again the form name you can
give it a minimum value and maximum
value the current value and you can also
change the style which is just the color
of this bar so right now it's a positive
color you can change it to red by
switching it to assertive the next
element I want to talk about is the
search component now what's important to
note is all of these components here
they don't actually do anything so we're
not creating a form that is fully
functional for you you're gonna have to
wire up this form to something in the
backend so the search component will not
automatically search anything for you
it's just a styled component that we put
a little search icon here to make it
look a little bit different than input
so really this is just an input field
that's styled slightly different because
we added this search icon for you now
the next one I want to talk about is the
Select component so the Select component
yet again you can give that a title so
here you could pick size maybe you could
name that size and then options now you
can add here so we could do small and
then we could add an option for media
and then we could add an option for a
large and then when you preview that
right now it's going to use this default
thing because we're in the browser when
you're on your phone it'll bring up your
browser's default select so we change
this to medium we see that updates to
medium the next one I want to talk a
little bit about is text area so a text
area is essentially just a multi-line
input field so yet again title name
placeholder default value and then when
we check that out here we see that we
have the ability to type multiple lines
in this now here let's clear out some of
this stuff and then the last one we're
going to show you is toggle the toggle
yet again you can add a title you can
name that freeform you can change the
style of it and default it to checked so
lets default that to checked you can see
our style is currently positive yet
again if we want to change that to red
we can switch it over to assertive so
right now that's all the conform
components we have available to you off
the bat it's also important to note that
really this form outer liberal element
is just a fancy list okay all it is is a
list that we added the action and the
method parameter to and it uses the form
HTML tag in your export so if you wanted
to add a list divider directly in your
form or list items list item with
thumbnails whatever you want you can add
any list items you want to this form as
well and really that's all there is to
forms today so I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
