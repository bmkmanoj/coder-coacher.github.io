ionic and I'm the designer of the
framework and I'm max one of the
original developers and creators of the
framework and today we are launching the
very first series of the ionic show
which is a monthly video series we'll be
putting on every month covering
interesting community projects ionic
built apps new releases features of
ionic that you may have missed and going
over cool stuff going on in the hybrid
app development community yep and we are
also at home brewers here that is right
every month we'll be bringing a new home
brew from the ionic team
this month we've got a black earth
porter which is a clone of your local
Madison based brewery it's a pretty good
beer so we'll be putting a recipe up at
the end Oh being good awesome
so today we are going to be talking
about key chain which is a company based
out of San Francisco and they use ionic
to build their iOS app and Android app
we're going to be talking about habit
RPG which doesn't have that game of
flies your life and genymotion which is
a fast Android emulator ng Cordova which
is a community project that was just
released a couple weeks ago and took off
and lastly collection repeat which is a
new feature in ionic that is pretty
awesome so with that let's get the show
started
all right so first up let's talk about
key chain so key chain logistics is a
start-up in San Francisco that is
basically building in uber for trucking
the idea is if you're an owner operator
which means you own your own uh
semi-truck you can pick up trucking jobs
through the app and kind of be your own
boss so the kind of jobs that you pick
up so keychain had an iOS and Android
app basically two different separate
native custom apps for Android and iOS
and they took those two apps and
converted them to ionic to two hybrid
apps with ionic so something that
keychain has told us they love about
ionic is they were able to basically
take their web developers in-house and
make them mobile developers so instead
of finding really really expensive
consultants to build an iOS app and then
an Android app they were able to just
build one code base and then deploy it
on both iOS and Android it saved them a
ton of time a ton of money for startups
it's incredibly important that you get
something done really quickly
ionic makes a ton of sense for them
check them out in the showcase showcase
ionic framework comm yes one of our
favorite apps it's the number one on the
list
we actually got to know the key chain
people quite a bit while they were
developing the app they are a few of the
developers from keychain our graduates
of hack reactor yep so hack vectors is
really cool kind of alternative to go in
to Normal University to learn how to
code you basically take three months a
lot of people who go there have never
coded before and they come out of it
being professional developers getting
great jobs so we've met we spoke at
height reactor a few months ago we met
some of those developers they're a
really great program and those
developers have really kind of amazed us
at how quickly they've learned to become
really really great developers in the
short amount of time yeah and they love
ionic which is awesome
yep so next up is habit RPG which is an
app for Android and iOS that essentially
gamma Phi's your life so the way that it
works is it's basically like a to-do
and I've downloaded probably tend to do
a lot to do apps in the past I know
you've probably you probably built tend
to do absolutely many there they're fun
to use I probably get sick of my to do
apps within about a week of downloading
them but what habitrpg did was they
actually added game mechanics that you
would find in like RPG games like World
of Warcraft or Skyrim or big gamers and
they added it on top of it to do lists
that you have in this app so basically
if you if you get done with the list or
if you you know achieve whatever it is
that you set up to do it will reward you
for getting it done so you actually are
incentivized to carry through with your
to-do lists which is awesome and they
switched from topcoat I believe with
their attitude onic and loved it they
got in touch with us and said that they
they up their app star rating from 2 to
was it for for on some change yes which
is sweet pretty pretty dramatic
increases the it's awesome so they are
also in the showcase page and definitely
check out the app it's pretty sweet I
use it a few of the guys here at ionic
to use it so yeah so have an RPG great
great company great product we'll be
hearing more about them later so another
great product that we've been using here
is something called a genymotion we fall
in love with genymotion we love it
genymotion is basically what the Android
emulator should have been if it makes it
easy to test your Android apps and
actually make it fast so it actually
feels like your normal app because we
all know that the Android emulator just
it sucks it's awful it's not it's slow
it's almost pointless how useless it is
and I'm sorry and probably exaggerating
a little bit but the point is that it's
not good
know whenever you try to test your app
in an Android
later it just it doesn't work so
genymotion is basically a virtual
machine that runs Android and they have
tons of different devices different
versions of Android so you can test like
two point three four point I don't why
you want to test two point three yeah
you probably just forget about two point
three forever we're trying to do that
but you can test new versions of Android
you can install your app and the way
genymotion works is it actually kind of
looks to the computer like a Android
device that's connected so if you're
going to use ionic you'll do ionic run
Android and you'll run it on the device
same with Cordova you don't run it
rather than emulate it because
genymotion treats it as a connected
device so we test all our apps on it now
it's been really really great for us
they have a free version genymotion
is awesome so definitely make sure you
check it out for testing your apps on
Android
what kind of obsessed a little obsessed
so next up is ng Cordova which is a
community-based project actually
community started project it was a
suggestion given to us by a anionic
community member Palo bernasconi who
basically got in touch with us and said
you know what you guys should do you
should make basically Cordova easier to
use wrap it with angular directives and
services so Max and I took I don't know
a weekend out busted out ng Cordova comm
launched it to the community and it kind
of took off in a way that we weren't
expecting yeah I think I've heard like
500 stars in the first week which is
pretty crazy and the community is kind
of taken it and run with it yeah so
since we launched we started with like I
want to say like four or five plugins
like core Cordova plugins and now we
have like 25 plugins that are supported
to the framework so it was crazy enough
that we had to release a custom download
builder so if you go to ng Cordova comm
you can actually go to the download
builder and pick and choose your plugins
you want to use released at this time so
the project has really gone from like
just a crazy idea a few weeks ago to
something that a lot of people are using
it's been very useful it basically just
makes it easier to use all these native
plugins that are available on Cordova
and use them through a simpler cleaner
API that we've all grown to know and
love with angular and and one of the
reasons we really wanted to make this is
because hybrid apps have this like
totally unwarranted reputation of not
being able to use native functionality
it's not true at all it's just a simple
little API bridge that you can pass a
native data back and forth and ng
Cordova just makes it easier to use all
these great plugins to do the same
things native developers have done for
the last several years but on both iOS
and Android like on day one yeah it's
it's not 2007 anymore nope things have
changed
awesome so definitely check out ng
Cordova is ng Cordova comm I think we
link to it from ionic framework we may
need add that link yep it's it's super
new so so next up is collection repeat
yeah so collection repeat is a really
important feature for mobile apps that
we released a few weeks ago but we
haven't really publicized and we're
gonna start talking more about how to
use collection repeat and what it can do
for you but the basic point is mobile
apps need to render a ton of data and
lists are very very important way of
rendering that data but historically
showing a huge lists of data on the
mobile app has been really really slow
unless we were using the native iOS or
Android for example if you had like
10,000 contacts showing a list of 10,000
contacts was going to be really really
slow
so we built a collection repeat to
basically only render the actual visible
elements on the page so you could have a
huge list of 10,000 songs 10,000
contacts things like that and it would
just feel as fast as if you had only had
10 so we put a lot of work into building
a way to kind of show tons of items
would only draw a few that worked just
like ng-repeat so you can basically take
ng repeat code that draws a list and
convert it to collection repeats and get
insane performance improvements using
our collection piece system in ionic
it's awesome yes so that's a new feature
we just launched we're going to
using it we have we're going to be using
it in a new app that we're building yep
so we got an app that we're gonna
release we haven't really publicized it
yet to kind of show off a bunch of ionic
features collection repeat will be a
huge part of that and it's a major major
win for hybrid apps on mobile yeah cool
well that about sums it up for this
episode yeah yeah so like I said we'll
have the Humber recipe at the end we'd
love to talk about your own apps that
you're building with ionic so definitely
submit them to the showcase showcase
dynamic framework comm or send us an
email I'm max at ionic framework comm
and has been at ionic framework comm
definitely get in touch tweet at us we'd
love to cover it and we'll be talking
about some new special stuff we haven't
released yet can't talk about it much
yet but it's gonna blow your mind
it's already blowing our minds that's
that's you don't want to build it up too
mugging it's gonna be awesome so we'll
talk about that in a few weeks and
thanks for joining us and we hope to do
a lot more of those so let's know what
you think see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
