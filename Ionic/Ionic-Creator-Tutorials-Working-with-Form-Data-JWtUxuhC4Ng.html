team and you're watching our weekly
workshop this week i want to show you
how to take form data and access and
store that data in your pages controller
and then send that data to another page
via our route parameters function now
you can also edit this data along the
layer sorted in a database but in this
video i just want to show you how to get
the data from the form into your
controller and then pass to another page
using creator so let's get started by
just creating a new project here and
we're gonna call this project form data
now we're just gonna make a blank we're
not going to make this one like look
crazy good i just want to show you guys
the code functionality behind all this
so now that we've got a page let's make
a pizza ordering application here so
let's do order your pizza as the title
of this page and we're going to start
off just building our form so the first
thing we're going to want is a select
box that is the size of our pizza and
we're going to populate the data for the
select box later dynamically from a list
of options in our controller and then
let's to a toggle and we're gonna have
that toggle be for extra cheese then
let's switch it up a little bit here and
make a topping radio control so you're
gonna be able to choose one out of two
toppings so our first topping here is
going to be pepperoni pepperoni and we
can duplicate that and call it sausage
and then at the end of the you know a
lot of these applications have notes
that you can send to the driver so let's
just create an input here and so people
can leave a note to get their Pizza
ordered now you know we preview this the
form works you know you can choose
different things you can type a note but
this data isn't stored anywhere yet so
we're going to want to open up our code
editor here and this is the controller
for our order a pete sub page okay so
the first thing let's do is rigged up
that size drop down to a set of dynamic
options so we're gonna do scoped out
sizes equal a list we're going to have
three options in here each one is going
to have an ID so if this one is going to
be lower case small and a label that we
can show in the box so for that won't do
in upper case small and then we're going
to take this and copy it and change it a
little bit for
options so we'll do medium medium large
and large now we also need a place to
actually store the value that's selected
for all of our form items so let's do
scope data equals an object and we're
going to start off just with size equal
to we're going to set this to scope that
sizes zero dot ID so this is actually
going to be set this code right here is
going to be set to the ID of our first
option which is small so that kind of
just lets us set an automatic default to
whatever the first option in this list
is so now we need to populate that into
our actual size drop-down and for that
we're going to use two different
directives the first directive is a
standard ng model where we are going to
set that to data size okay so we're
going to set that directly to this
variable and that's what's gonna let it
store the current value the next thing
we're gonna do is do ng options now ng
options is a little bit weird okay so
you can look up the documentation on the
angular documentation for ng options but
it's a little bit complex so I'm gonna
take you through a couple different
steps to get this working so the first
thing we're gonna do is just size in
sizes okay it's like a standard for loop
but that doesn't give this enough
information actually generate so like if
I try to preview this it's definitely
not going to work we're not going to get
any options because this is not a
complete quote-unquote sentence that ng
options is expecting so what we're
actually going to set this in is we are
going to have to give it a value to
store so the lower case ID and then what
to display on the options so that would
be the size dot label so we're going to
do size ID as size style label for size
in sizes is our complete sentence here
and once we get that whole sentence when
we preview it we can see it defaulted to
small just like we told it to and we now
have small medium and large right in
this text box and all those were
dynamically now just to prove that this
data is actually getting stored in the
controller let's throw a paragraph under
our form here just to show this data as
we go so we're going to show size as
data dot size and if we preview again
okay
we're at small red medium that updated
to medium on the fly or at large that
updated a large on the flies so far so
good so let's move on to the extra
cheats this is just going to be a
boolean okay so this one's a lot easier
we can just do extra cheese is equal to
false and then on this extra cheese
you're just going to want to add an NG
model to be data to extra cheese okay
and then down here we'll make sure we
can preview it extra cheese data data
extra cheese to make sure it's getting
stored there and we could preview that
save our code changes and now we can
change this to a large or medium we can
toggle it on and we see true now we see
false there it automatically updated for
us all right cool
so let's do let's see here okay next up
we're going to do that topping so for
the topping we are going to set topping
equal to pepperoni by default okay now
for this to work we also need two
different directives on each of our
options here so we're going to add a
directive for ngmodel
it's equal to data topping so we're just
going to tie the current value via the
pepperoni and sausage to that model then
we're going to add another one this
one's a little bit weird this is ng -
value okay and here week they want an
actual strength so you have to encase
this in quotes the word pepperoni
if we don't case it in quotes it's going
to look for a scope variable instead of
like the raw value pepperoni okay we're
going to do that same thing to sausage
so ngmodel is equal to data not topping
and ng value is equal to the string
sausage okay so for this one since you
have topping set to pepperoni it should
default to pepperoni being checked and
then we should be able to change from
pepperoni sausage so just make sure that
works let's add topping data topping to
our preview here preview that save our
code changes ok we can see here now why
didn't it do it automatically here
pepperoni
okay pepperoni preview there we go okay
so pepperoni sausage and it switches
between the two okay
out next up let's get this note just
stored as a string so here we're gonna
do note as an empty string okay and we
are going to throw an ng-model equals
dated note then we were going to preview
that yeah save the changes okay whoops
we didn't actually save the changes we
didn't put a note here so let's do data
dot note here just so we can preview it
again so save boom all right so let's
change it to large updates to large
extra cheese cool sausage no testing one
two three
so all of that information is now stored
on our scope so now that it's stored in
our scope we actually have access to
this through variety of means okay so
first of all let's create a scope order
function and here I'm just going to do a
console log so we're gonna do console
dot log order a scope data dot size
pizza with the topping plus scope data
dot topping okay so we're just going to
do a simple scope thing here we're going
to drag over a button and make that
button do an ng-click order now with our
new code previewing here if we inspect
this okay what we actually do for you is
we get rid of all the console logs from
creator so we clear it out for you
whenever you preview and then we only
show you the logs that you've logged so
you can console log away console and
fall this debugging has now become a lot
easier okay so we're gonna do large
extra cheese sausage testing one two
three tap me and we get order a large
pizza with the topping sausage awesome
but now let's actually take this data
and send it to a second page using our
route parameters so we're going to
create a new blank page and this page we
are going to call order confirmation
okay in an order confirmation we're
going to add a route parameter for each
of our different things so size extra
cheese topping and note okay so all four
of those are stored now what we can do
is go back to our button unlike the ng
click so we
longer whenever working with that
function instead we're going to use our
default linking mechanism up here and
it's going to ask us for the four
separate route parameters now you could
just type regular things like we could
pass small to this okay but we want to
pass that dynamic value so we're going
to do the template tags data dot size
and for each one we're going to put the
corresponding variable and it's going to
send all that data straight to our
second page but we haven't done anything
with it on the second page yet so let's
go to our second page controller here
set up scope got data here and all of
these state programs are stored in this
state params objects so we can go size
is equal to state programs dot size on
here you know what let's fullscreen this
again
okay and let's do extra cheese is state
params extra cheese let's do topping is
state params topping and then let's do
note is state params note all right and
just for ease of use here let's just
throw in data so we can preview that
whole option so now we go back to order
a pizza we're gonna save our code
preview this and we're going to change
it to large extra cheese sausage testing
one two three tap me and we're going to
go to that order confirmation page with
all of our default stuff right here so
all of that information was passed to
the page through the button now let's
say you wanted to modify that data or
you just wanted to do it via code
instead of through our default system we
allow that to so on this button
let's not link it anymore and let's go
back to our ng click on that order
function okay but instead of doing this
console.log we're actually going to want
to use state so let's inject state into
our controller we're going to do state
go here we're going to need a value for
that page the what it needs to go to but
first we're just going to throw a scope
data in there because sighs extra cheese
topping note is the same as what the
page wants for its wrapper
I'm just gonna pass scope data directly
just to be easier now like I said we
need to tell it where to go
that's the state s riff that we added to
every page now so this valley could be
used with state facto UI test RF
everything like that so we're gonna copy
this and we're gonna put it here and
save and we're gonna get that same
effect that we had before where if I you
know change this to a medium sausage put
some stuff here and hit tap we're gonna
go to that second page with the
information we have we just did it for
you code instead of a button now so you
know if you wanted to modify any of the
stuff like right here you could add
something to the note you could add
another parameter that you've hidden
from these you can do whatever you want
and then send that data to a page
instead of just linking it straight from
the button so overall that's how you get
this form data into your controller and
how you can kind of work with it like I
said we're gonna be doing these weekly
workshops every single week next week
you can be able to look out for the
Attic off video I will catch you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
