uh make sure everything is better so
yeah so this is just a progressive lips
deep dive we'll go into kind of what
what and what pwace are a little quick
overview of what a PWA is why and when
you should build one and kind of how
ionic helps you helps you build a great
production ready fast PWA so this is me
so I am just Willis I do Deb relations
at ionic and I'm on Twitter at Justin
Willis 96 so I saw somebody was asking
about that that is that's my Twitter
handle
so like said here's the agenda we're
gonna go over why and when PWS makes
sense some trends so we'll give some
stats about what we're seeing and we'll
also show you kind of like how ionic
helps you embrace pwace or how we help
you easily build a fast production-ready
PWA so yes what are protests exactly so
progressively up so our apps that have
the reach of the web and a reliable
fastening gauging so basically they
provide the best of the web and the best
of native you know mobile apps that
people are used to so they provide you
know you just click link and you're on
the PWA and then you get that nice like
fast native light feel from your PWA i'm
so we're seeing some pretty big brands
building pwace so everybody from Twitter
to Hoover Starbucks Pinterest has really
nice PWA and I think this kind of proves
that you know Peter berries are
definitely going to be are definitely
you think and there's something to
definitely look at if you are planning
on you know publishing a new experience
so back in 2017 we did the ionic
developer survey so at that time Peter
blaze were you know still just starting
to get started and we were already
seeing that we have 31.5% of people that
came into the survey said that they were
you know interested in building a
progressive web app so I think this is
this is pretty awesome and I would think
this number would be even
higher today
so why pwace so first is your user
acquisition of retention so Google did a
study and showed that 53 percent of
mobile sites are abandoned if the user
can't load the site within three seconds
so I mean three seconds doesn't seem
like that long but humans have pretty
short attention spans and three seconds
is actually a good amount of time when
you're waiting on some content to load
in your browser so mobile sites that
load within five seconds so are pretty
close to that three second range tend to
earn up to two times more mobile ad
revenue so this just makes you know
makes sense to me the better you know if
you should have a better experience
through users they're probably going to
stay on that site longer and use it more
which translates into more ad revenue
and so you know three to site three to
five seconds is kind of the target that
you want to be at but when this study
was done the average load time of mobile
site was about nineteen seconds on
average three 3G connections so the
average mobile connection that that you
know everybody everybody has nineteen
seconds it's definitely far from the
five to thirty second range that you're
trying to go for it so that's kind of
when pwace came in um so yes of
Pinterest if you go to Pinterest com on
a mobile device you'll be able to use
their PWA you got to download or
anything anything or anything like that
just click the link and you're good to
go so they they put out some some some
studies they did to get some stats so
comparing their old mobile website which
was just like a responsive you know
mobile website that people have been
building forever to their new mobile web
experience which was a PWA
they solve you know some really really
good improvements of ad click-throughs
was up to fifty up 50% user generated ad
money so like revenue from ads was up
forty four percent that is a pretty huge
increase time spent on the on the PWA
was up over five minutes was up forty
percent so people were obviously
enjoying the experience for so because
of that they were spending more time on
it and querying
agents was up 60% so actually Pinterest
is one of the first first company I've
seen to do this but they also compared
their PWA to their native experience so
you can see the the increases aren't as
huge here but across the PWA is it doing
at least as good or even better than
their native experience so times spent
over five minutes on the app was up five
percent on the PWA compared to the
native version two percent which is not
that much but it's still an increase two
percent increased ad revenue for the PWA
and as you see ad click throughs is
about the same and corrugate this is up
two to three percent so that's comparing
the PWA to the native Pinterest app um
so Twitter also felt some some stats so
they saw a 65 percent increase in pages
per session so 2 percent increase in
tweets sent and 20 percent decrease in
bounce rate so this was comparing their
old Twitter experience to their new PWA
and you can try out their P EE if you
just go to Twitter comm on a mobile
device it will take you to to their to
your to their PWA and so what are the PW
advantages for users so what you know
way advantages to pwace bring to the
table for users of those apps um so
first there is smaller than native apps
so this was from Twitter actually so
with the Twitter native app on Android
it's about 56 megabytes on iOS it's even
bigger it's like a hundred something
megabytes the PWA is 150 kilobytes all
together so as you can see that's a
pretty huge difference there and while
that may not seem like a big deal for
people using you know like average like
affordable devices that only have a few
gigs of storage megabytes versus
kilobytes can be a huge difference it
also uses just much less data across the
board so this is like Network you know
data coming over the network as you use
the app the PWA uses much less data
compared to the native version also you
get instant access to the experience so
kind of like I said you can try try the
Twitter PWA just by you know clicking on
a linking and going directly and you're
you're there it's just there's nothing
to download there's nothing to
stall you don't to go to the Google Play
Store or the App Store to search for it
you just click the link and you're ready
to go and because of that it's also easy
to share so it's just a link all you got
to do is click it and you can do to
share it just like any other link to any
of your friends and therefore if you
know something you see on the Twitter
PWA share link will quick and you can
instantly you know share that share what
you're seeing with your friends so now
let's kind of move over to the
enterprise side of things so for
enterprise pwace offers some also
officer pretty cool advantages so easy
distribution so a PWA is really just a
website right so you just push it to
your web server just like you know most
enterprises have been building web apps
for years so a PWA is not really you
know that big of a leap from just a you
know and like an old-school web app so
it's easy to see even just push it to
your web server and you're good to go so
because of that there's no App Store so
enterprises especially with like Apple
devices it can be very hard to
distribute your native native iOS app to
all of your employees because a PWA is
just a link it's just a website
Andy anyone can you know get instant
access to it there's no need to have to
jump through hoops to get a native app
deployed to all your customers devices
I'm also instant update so as we all
know especially with iOS also with
Android 2 updates can take a while so
you have to build build your update
build it to a binary submit that buyer
through either the App Store or Google
Play Store hopefully eventually that
gets get some approved by Apple and then
you can finally have you know and update
on users devices because the PWA is just
a website you can you know just push new
updates your web server just like you
would any normal website and people can
get instant updates so as soon as they
click the open the app or click the link
again they'll have the latest experience
instantly and also control the
distribution process so you know with
the native app you have to
Apple is in or Google is in total
control of you know high rap gets
distributed so you know you have to
follow their guidelines on how you can
distribute your app with the PWA it's
just a website so you're in total
control you can run the web server
yourself if you want to and then you
have total control over the distribution
and running of that app I'm so now so
that was like why you would want to
build a PWA let's go into like when you
would want to when you would want to
build one so we recommend like if if
you're getting most of your so first if
you have functionality in your app that
is not available on the web today and I
recommend everybody check out that link
you can go there and see see all the
api's that are available in the browser
that you open it in but there is still
some functionality that only native apps
currently have access to so if that's a
crucial feature of your app you can then
you probably need to stick with a App
Store app also if most of your users
aren't coming from Google search so if
your product is not getting is is not
very does have a very big presence on
Google search then it might not make
sense to deploy a PWA so yeah
progressive web apps when you when
should you build them first of all what
value needs to be proven immediately so
like I said if you get a Twitter or
Pinterest or something like that you can
you know it's just click link and your
users immediately have the correct you
know they're immediately into your
experience nothing that they have to go
through and download or install or
anything like that it's just there
immediately and search if search is key
to user acquisition so if you're going
to get a lot of traffic through search
so maybe you currently have like a
responsive website or something like
that and it gets a decent amount of
traffic if you deploy a pw8 you're only
going to see that increase and you're
gonna be good to go
but like right now we're only really
seeing elite engineering teams build
these pwace so all of this sounds great
right but we're only seeing you know
companies big big well-funded companies
like Twitter Pinterest etc actually
building pwace so you know part of ionic
we want everybody to build be able to
build these peers so I'll you know this
is a
kind of an important part and I'll dive
into later why we're helping to change
this so first like building fast
production-ready POVs is hard so you
know building making sure that your code
size is correct that all your
functionality is there is a really hard
thing to do also traditional frameworks
that we've seen don't really work well
for pwace you have to do a lot of
working around that that framework to
actually get a good PWA experience so
we've seen this if you read like some of
the Pinterest Engineering blogs you know
having to configure wetback having to
have very intimate knowledge of web pack
and how it works
getting reactor or angular or something
like that to be small enough and code
split correctly so that actually loads
fast it's all of you know very very
challenging very hard engineering
problems to solve also have to build PWA
as like a separate app so you know code
bases can't be really shared on the PW
it has to be its own thing and then you
have you know your native apps or your
mobile website or your responsive
website or something like that and it's
you end up with all these separate code
bases so also you have to be able to you
know custom cross-platform UI so there
is no really like accepted like standard
UI toolkit out there for pwace yet now
you may have heard something cool like
ionic that has all these Knights
pre-designed components so as you can
see if we're going to try to change this
yeah so as it sits now there's no but I
think I want to build a PWA there's no
real UI toolkit that pops into your mind
immediately like oh I can use this and
have a nice UI I'm yet to build all this
from scratch and as we you know that can
be a lot of engineering time put into
just making a good UI so yeah so let's
go into building a PWA with ionic so we
kind of heard it was very hard you know
it's challenging but let's kind of see
you know how that is different with
ionic um so yeah we have an ionic PWA
toolkit so this is in beta it's still
early but we I've already built some
stuff with it we have some of other
teams some you know pretty decently
sized teams building things with it and
so what is the pea
okay so first its ionic plus stencil so
as I said before there is there was no
really like accepted UI toolkit for
Peter vase but as you know if you've
already used ionic we have 90 something
components that are all pre-designed
they look well on mobile they work well
on mobile they're fast all the
animations are there and yeah it's you
know if you got all these 90 components
that you can use and it gives you a very
nice UI out of the box also stencil so
stencil is this new thing we're working
on so it is basically it lets you it's a
compiler that lets you build fast lazy
loaded code slate components so this
lets you you know you can you output
some code and it's tiny it's like 6.5
kilobytes for the main file and it's all
zero config you know you don't have to
configure anything to get stuff to lazy
load it's all code split out-of-the-box
and yeah it gives you these nice tiny
little components that you can glue
together to build your app and yeah it's
really nice it's really fast it's really
small so yeah so NPM drum built gives
you a fast video view out of the box so
the PW toolkit includes everything you
need out of the box to have a PWA so you
can literally get cloning npm run build
deploy that to a web server and it's a
PWA right there nothing to change
nothing that you have to add or anything
like that
and yeah so it's using ionic so you have
a nice pre-built cross-platform UI
that's you're already used to so all day
you know I unbutton and I on header and
pop over and action sheet those are all
they're all pre-installed ready for you
to use and it's you know one code base
runs everywhere so it's built on the web
so you know web web runs everywhere from
Cordova to pwace to electron so you can
have you know this nice code base that
you can then deploy to anywhere the web
runs so like I said we take care of all
the PWA stuff for you out of the box so
there's no real need for you to worry
about the underlying tech so stencil is
very very simple it's like eight
decorators and that's all you really
need to know ionic is obviously you know
it's just a bunch of components that you
can use so I am button
as simple as putting iron button into
your template and you're ready to go
and yeah service workers manifest all I
get stuff is all built in it's you know
ready to go nothing that you have to do
customer and because of this we like to
call it zero config it's also you could
call it like minimal config there's not
much that you there's nothing that you
need to configure out-of-the-box
although you can you know configure
things we won't really get into this
right now but there are things you can
configure if you really want to I'm so
yeah so I on ik if you already know like
ionic Engler you already know all of our
components so it's a we're with ionic
for moving to web components so we're
actually using stencil to pour all of
our components to web components so yeah
so ionic will just be a a agnostic set
of components that you can use anywhere
you can use it with stencil without a PA
toolkit you could use a react angular
obviously you know angular is still our
number one go-to framework pre X view
polymer no framework if you don't want
to you can simply just grab a script tag
- ionic from NPM CDN and on your
WordPress site you could add some ionic
components so we give to you that you
know nice cross-platform UI that you
know people expect and it looks like a
you know apps like thing that people are
used to I mean yeah so it helps provide
an app like feel to your PWA down so you
get those nice you know native looking
components that people are used to so
like on Android material design and you
know it feels like what people expect an
app to feel like and it looks like what
people expect an app to look like um so
yes stencil so stencil as I said before
it's just a compiler it's the web
components compiler so you write your
code we have a couple of decorators that
you can use to do cool things we also
use JSX
as our templating language so you write
your components and then you run it
through the stencil compiler and it
outputs totally vanilla custom elements
so there's no you know there is no like
window dot stencil stencil is not
something that's actually running in the
browser it's all just you know vanilla
custom elements and some JavaScript so
the best practices are built-in so you
know as I said before lazy loading code
splitting these are all things that are
really
and to making sure that your PWA is
performant and with a lot of other you
know stencil gives you you know there's
nothing given fit configure like I said
before it's all just built in it's ready
to go whenever you build a component
that component is lazy loaded and code
split right out of the box so nothing
that you have to build custom yourself
and then so it's modern so we use all
you know all the new modern specs so we
use ES modules for our lazy loading we
output es6 code by default although we
do have es5 callbacks for older browsers
and I should mention those are all like
polyfills and knowing when to load es5
code versus es6 is all handled under the
hood for you
so in our little 6.5 kilobyte loader
file we handle knowing which ones which
polyfills in which es5 or es6 version to
load so on modern browsers like Chrome
and Safari the latest Safari inlets
Chrome you'll get straight-up es6 code
so if you open like sources and chrome
dev tools you'll see class and Kant's
and all that good stuff and yes it's all
right there and ready for you to a ready
for you to use and and then older
browsers or browsers that don't have
support for custom elements yet they get
an order es5 version it still has all
the lazy loading code splitting it's
just done done in a slightly different
way so yeah I know PW is in the wild so
stencil J's calm that is a PW a if you
go to it today you'll you know see it we
also have some other big companies that
are you know building pwace with ionic
and also I should mention coming soon so
it's not ready now but we hopefully
plans have some kind of beta or
something like that as soon as possible
but we are working on adding PW a
hosting to ionic probe so this will be
one-click hosting you'll literally just
go into pro - bored hit a button and
you'll be able to deploy the PWA that
you just built - ionic pavi hosting and
rpw hosting is going to have all the you
know all the stuff that you need built
in out-of-the-box ready to go
so that includes like HTP to h2 push all
these best practices that you're
supposed to you know have to give your
app the best best chance of being you
know extremely fast that's all going to
be built in out of the box alright so
now let's try a demo and hopefully the
demo doesn't go like the first part of
this presentation and we'll hype it uh
it all goes I hope this goes well
so I'll just pull up my turtle here
let's close these all right and so let's
go in here then we'll go into the I
appear toolkit make sure we don't have
anything changed here let's divert that
and get that one second alright so so
yeah so this is all the all the you know
this is the pwe toolkit it's just like I
get cloned this from get I'm not going
to do it live be I don't want the
Internet to to blow up but yeah so this
is I just pulled this straight from yet
alright so now we'll do an NPM run build
or actually let's do a name team
installs make sure we got got everything
and while let's waiting on we're waiting
on that to install
yep and let me make it bigger for
everybody so we can make sure we can see
and let's see
all right so as we can see this is CPW
toolkit now actually this is the wrong
repo so give me one second here don't
save
and one second and yeah can everybody
still hear me and see me
alright alright so hopefully everybody
can see in here we again okay don't know
what's going on with YouTube stay
alright so yeah so let's look at the
code real quick so what does the Phaedo
a toolkit give you so as you see here we
have some funk components built in some
of the cool things so we have a lazy
image component so this is one of the
things to pwace images loading on the
first load can definitely cause some
performance issues so trying to load in
a bunch of really big images while also
trying to learn in JavaScript CSS and
HTML can cause issues and cause loading
load time issues so you can clog up the
network and as I had before just a few
minutes ago with YouTube you can see bad
you know network issues are not great so
this lazy image component is a component
that's pre-built for you and you can use
it to lazy load images so it uses the
interception observer API to know
exactly when to it will only load images
once you've actually scrolled in to
where the images are right and yes so
that's one of the things that the PTO
toolkit offers you out-of-the-box also
like I said it offers a service workers
out of the box so we use so yeah we use
work box underneath the hood that gives
you automatic service workers all you
have to do is run NPM run build and the
service worker will be generated for you
with all of the precache precache you
know stuff that you need to get all your
assets cached onto the years advice so
they can use your PWA offline and also
as you can see here we have some code
for push notifications so the PWT
toolkit offers all of the boilerplate
code that you need for push
notifications out of the box so as you
can see here we have you know the
service service worker side out push
notifications built in right here for
you and if we go to this component we
have some code that shows an ionic turfs
component that you might
or I'd be familiar with from ionic
angular and this will tell the user hey
there's a new version of the PWA
available you can reload the page to get
the latest version so this is normally
stuff all you would have to you know all
of this code you would have to build
yourself and put together yourself the
PW toolkit offers it right out of the
box and the other important part pwace
is the web manifest and as you can see
here we have one already built for you
all you would have to do is fill out
with your icon and your the name of your
PWA and you're ready to go alright so
that's kind of the the main parts of it
let's look real quick at what like a
stencil component looks like so remember
this is the ptoey tool kit
so it's using ionic + stencil so as you
can see I mentioned we use JSX this is
technically TSX since we're using
typescript here just like you would an
ionic angular but it's just JSX with
some subtypes so as you can see here you
might recognize some of these components
so these are just all ionic components
that we're using here and as you can see
we have them in our JSX templates so
this is a very basic stencil component
it only yeah it's just displaying some
ionic components and yeah that's about
it so one interesting thing here there
is a stencil route link so we have a
stencil router so just like react has
react rotor angular has angular router
there is a collection of web components
called the stencil router that give you
stencil or give you a routing yeah the
ability to do routing just like you
would with react router so you can see
here we have a stencil rail link as
anion but inside of it and that will
navigate to this page so as you can see
here this is just an es 6 Class B right
now you might recommend or might might
know what these are if you've already
built anything with ionic angler but
these are just decorators so as you can
see here we use a component decorator
kind of like angular and here you can
put in your tag and this is like what
the component is going to be just like
in angular and you can also see we have
props and States just like react but we
like to use decorator so we have
decorator's that allow you to to say hey
these are properties that's going to
take and these are state variables so if
you've and the rest of this is just you
know an es6 class so there's nothing
really custom here this is another one
of our decorators a list and decorator
yeah it's just an ESL class we're using
TSX and it's a yeah it's all there it's
ready to go all right so let's do MPM
run dev
and I see people mentioning so yep so
yeah TSX is just JSX but with typescript
and hopefully with my computer trying to
stream this doesn't take too long there
we go
and so let's have dev tools here real
quick and see how about Cabiria it's
gonna be a little slow since I am
streaming from this computer but
hopefully everything works here
if not we can move on to QA yep so this
is what the PTO toolkit looks like so as
you can see here it looks like an ionic
app because it is an ionic app so as you
can see here I can route to a different
page we have the UI setup for push
notifications and this gives you a very
basic starter so we're planning on
planning on you know making as ionic
core and stencil get closer to stable
planning on adding more components to
this if you can think of anything that
you would like to add feel free to give
me up on Twitter and you know we can
definitely I could definitely look into
adding this stuff but we think it gives
you a nice basic starter to get started
building a PWA with ionic and stencil
and so just to clear up some things real
quick I'm so like I said I on ik is
we're moving it to web components so
that gives you a nice you know agnostic
set so we don't really you can you know
use it with any framework that you
choose ionic angular 4 will be you know
an update from my own concealer 3 the
cool thing is all of the ionic
components will you know be web
components but you wouldn't know that
you'll just write continue to write your
ionic angular app like you always would
the api's are going to change a little
bit but we are you know as we always try
to do with every release to have a very
very comprehensive update guide to tell
you all you know make sure you know all
the things that you need to change we're
also probably gonna put out some videos
or blogs showing how to update an app
but we are trying to keep the API
changes as tiny as possible and it will
not be anywhere near the update from
Bionic once ionic - I would say I mean
roughly you know 90% of your code
especially all of your angular code will
be pretty much staying the exact same so
yeah so and then this you know the
period tool kit if you are you know want
to move into something new you can give
this a try and you stencil an ionic to
build a
PWA let's go set all rights so yes sir
that was the PETA where he took it it's
very simple it's simple and purpose and
as I said it is in beta we're planning
on expanding it in the future as time
goes on and so yeah if anyone has any
specific questions or anything like that
feel free to ask in the chat I'll try to
answer them as best I can
so yeah Ryan asks is this only for pwace
we have about five minutes for Q&amp;amp;A by
the way so yeah this is focused on pwace
but obviously ionic is a you know
cross-platform that is our key thing and
these ionic components as I said will be
able to be used for all platform as
you've always would we're planning on
you know supporting Cordova just like we
always have but Pete aways are a big
thing and this allows you to you know
deploy a great fast PWA the episode IANA
Kingler is always going to be supported
so like I just mentioned earlier the
update from ionic angular 3 tie on
kingler 4 will not be anywhere near the
update from Bionic wind ionic 2 all of
your components will be web components
underneath the hood so all the ionic
components will go up components this
will lower your bundle size and make
your ionic and angular app faster but
you'll still continue write angular code
just like you always would so let's see
so yeah PTA is not in a webview
APW a is actually just running in the
browser just like a normal website yeah
so it doesn't work on desktop that's a
good question so so yes so desktop
support is something we're working on
we're hoping to have some desktop
features in ionic ink or ionic 4 but as
time goes on we're definitely going to
be implementing some more desktop
features obviously PWA is just running
the browser so they need to work on and
look well on any nice sized viewport
yeah so can you take an ionic app that
you have right now and convert it to a
pedo bag so you definitely can sir ionic
Engler three apps can be deployed as a
PWA we have some blog posts if you go to
our blog you can see if you just look
for a PWI so we have some posts to show
us how to do it
also if you had a Josh Maroney he has a
lot of good blog posts on taking your
ionic app and deploying it to as a PWA
yeah how is navigation routes working
with pwace with the PTO toolkit it's
like I said we use the stencil router so
it's a very very simple set of web
components that allow you to do routing
the API is pretty similar to react
router and yeah
yep so desktop web so as I said desktop
is something we're working on now we
want to make sure all of our components
look really well on the desktop or any
size viewport so that is something we're
working really hard on
and sorry there are lots of questions
coming in
yep so v1 to v2 was definitely a big
change that was you know that parade
from angularjs to angular 2
that was a huge update for anyone that
had an angler out so like I said I and I
can't learn three guy on a kingler Ford
will not be anywhere near that heart
it's going to be syntax changes here and
there but as we always try to do we will
have a very comprehensive update guide
also maybe some videos or blog posts
showing how to do an update and by
moving to web components we actually can
avoid some of these big changes so
because we're not going to be relying on
any one framework and our stuff is all
just standardized web components with
you know it's a web standard it won't
change for hopefully ever our stuff can
stay really stable and you know whatever
framework you use that would be the only
changes ionic itself when I have to make
that many changes
so some people are asking like NATO
functionalities in a pedo way so you can
go to what the web can do comm or web
web can do today comm that kind of shows
all the api's that are available on
modern web so anything from geolocation
to push notifications to background sync
all of these things are available in
modern browsers service workers are
coming to Safari soon so that would be
the you know the other chromis had them
for our box has them tomorrow is going
to have them in very soon and edge
actually already has them an insider's
preview builds of Windows 10
I see people Toma release dates release
dates are ASAP we're working very hard
on it as I said the IANA PTO toolkit
includes a early preview version of
ionic and you know a beta version of
stencil so you can already start using
it if you want and we're working very
hard on getting to 1.0 yep so electron
on desktop so that is definitely
something that we want support and like
I said we're adding PWA or adding
desktop features to our on components
that will help ionic for even better on
electron alright and yeah we have a lot
of questions coming in so yeah so on the
camera I saw somebody ask about cameras
so yes we're working on baking some web
components that allow you to have a
native camera look and feel right there
in your PWA so it's super early but we
don't really have anything to show yet
yes so the idea is that you would
install this web component and in your
PWA you would be able to take a picture
and it would open a UI that looks just
like the native camera on the device but
because it is HTML and CSS you can you
know customize it to your liking but
yeah so you'll just click a button it'll
pop up a camera looking UI and then it
will use some modern web api is to
actually take pictures and give you a
give you you know some pictures just
like you would end up with a native
camera and ya know I can't deny that yet
it's very very early but it's something
that we're we're working on and that's
it
gonna be pretty cool
CS equal light on pwe so we don't so
this equal I is a native side thing but
the web does have index DV which is a
nice database that's built right into
the browser it gives you very powerful
like querying features so you can query
data you can store large amounts of data
and there's also some new API is coming
out like the there's an API coming in
chrome to allow you to be to prompt
users to say hey I never want my you
know data to be cleared by the browser
so that you can be sure that your data
is always going to be there and I'll
just take a few more questions here
yes SEO yeah SEO has its you know PTAs
are just a website so SEO would be done
just like you would any other website
and yeah virtual scroll that's getting
rewritten for ionic for it's in a we
have a preview version that we've been
testing in-house and performance it
looks really nice and we're working on
making it much more robust and less
buggy
yep sub UJS vgs support so like i said
we're moving all of our components to
web components that means you can use
them in view just as much as you can in
angular so yeah well please support view
in the future and let's do one more
question here let's see
so yes support for service workers I'll
go over that again so service workers
are definitely so they're already in
chrome they're already in Firefox and
let's see any chromium based browsers to
offer a sampling Internet pretty much
any browser you can install on Android
Vice they are coming in Safari so
they're in the latest WebKit preview so
they should be in Safari very very soon
and edge actually already has them in
Windows 10 insiders builds and they're
planning on turning them on by default
for everybody in the next
a Windows 10 release so yeah I'm gonna
leave it at this for now so like I said
I am at Justin Willis 96 on Twitter so
if you have any questions or anything
like that always feel free to hit me up
on there I will try to try get back to
you as fast as possible and yeah
hopefully I am like I said I'm sorry
about the technical issues at the
beginning here I hope you know who
everything else was kind of worth those
technical issues and yeah we plan on
doing some more of these in the future
hopefully with no technical issues so
yep that's it and and thinks they're
ready for coming
greatly appreciate it I know we have
like a ton of questions come through but
my blyve chat is literally going faster
than I can read so yeah always feel free
to be up on Twitter or something like
that and we can help you I help you
answer I can help you answer some of
those questions alright thank you for
joining died on a POV webinar like I
said we plan on doing more of these in
future so yup thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
