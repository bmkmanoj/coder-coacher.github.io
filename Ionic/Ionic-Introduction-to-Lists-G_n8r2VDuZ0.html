element of any mobile app and almost
every app has some type of list because
they're so essential to building an app
ionic makes it pretty easy to work with
them
here I have the basic skeleton for an
ionic app to add a list we use the ion
list and I on item directives creating a
list of five items with these directives
is pretty straightforward when we
refresh we can now see that we have
native-like scrolling and it generally
looks like a list it's worth noting this
works like any other directive and
angular it wouldn't be a list if we
couldn't add some data first I'm going
to add our two dues controller into the
markup
now I'm going to create our two dues
controller over on the JavaScript side
let's add a couple to dues into our
scope I already have a few like clean
the kitchen do laundry mowing the yard
and whatever else comes to mind
right now the market for a list is
static and what respond to updates let's
change that using the ng repeat
directive if you're new to angularjs and
don't know what ng repeat means check
out the notes for a link to the ng
repeat documentation now that we're done
we can save refresh and check out our
list and we see it's no data-driven now
we can go back to our controller remove
things add things and save and watch our
scope update but it really wouldn't be a
to-do list if we couldn't add some items
to it
fortunately adding an item to our list
is as simple as adding to the to-do
Zorander scope for this example I'm just
going to add a header button if this
example looks unfamiliar to you check
out the formula for header bars in the
notes
we now have an ad button that is
pointing towards a ad to do function on
click so let's wire that up
for our to-do list I'm just going to
push a to do on to the end of our two
news array now we can save refresh and
give it a shot we click add and watch
the two dudes get added to the list
no to-do list would be complete without
a dilly function ionic ships with that
function by letting you talk about
delete mode on your list let's add a
flag to our scope to help us maintain
that state back in the mark-up at a show
delete directive to ion list this
directive is used to determine if the
list is in delete mode if it is the list
will display delete drawer next to each
ion item in the list we also need a
header button to toggle whether or not
we're in delete mode I'm just going to
add a simple header button that does
that
right now we don't actually have a
delete button ionic is flexible and
letting you decide exactly what that
should look like in this case I'm just
going to replace our item with a
standard looking delete button when it's
clicked all we're going to do is splice
that item out of the array and let the
scope update now when we add some items
we can come in here toggle delete and
remove them from our array again this
gets us started with using lists in
ionic in the notes I've linked to
formula talks about lists more in depth
including using infinite lists
reordering and more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
