team and you're watching our weekly
workshop we recently added a brand new
component our slider component that is
based on the I on slides directive from
a ionic framework so today I wanted to
showcase off two cool things that you
can do with the slider component the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to make a full height
welcome slider so you see these in a lot
of apps they're you know they take up
the entire screen they normally have
nice background color some beautiful
images and a little note about what the
app does before sending you to the login
page so we're going to make a full
screen welcome slider and then we're
also going to use a list of a list of
different images to populate a slider
dynamically so first let's jump in and
create a new project here I'm just going
to call this slider we're just going to
keep with a simple blank template today
and on this page we are going to want to
start creating our Welcome slider so
let's drag over a slider and as you can
see it takes up our normal content so
we're going to have to do a couple
things to get this to actually be full
height so let's start off with the page
so if you select the page here we're
going to do a couple different things
first thing we're going to do is turn
off padding then we are going to hide
the header now there's this margin up
here so we're also going to get rid of
the header margin so those are the three
things right now that we have to do on
the page then click on the slider
component on the left here and for
height we are also going to do a hundred
percent on height so if we bring this up
now you'll see we have our default cat
pictures taken up the whole screen looks
kind of nice so let's start actually
taking each of these slides and actually
you know what we're going to delete two
of them and just work on one and we're
going to duplicate this one as we go to
start working with it
okay so let's remove the background
image first of all we don't need a
background image quite yet but we do
want a background color so I am going to
paste in a nice blue hex code here you
can also use the slider here if you just
want to pick a random color and then I'm
going to move over an image now let's
upload a nice-looking image for
slide 1 ok now I want to take this image
though I want it to be vertically
centered so let's go to back to the
slide and do vertically aligned content
let's also give it a little bit of
padding on this slide so this is the
individual slide component that we had a
padded vertically aligned content and
then on the individual image here I'm
going to do an 80% width on that image
ok just to make it a little bit smarter
but we do like that middle Center like
we have now let's bring in some detail
about this feature so we are going to
Center a heading make the text white so
it looks a little better I'm going to
change it to an h3 we'll call this build
your apps then let's pull in a paragraph
also Center that also color it white and
let's do a use creator to build your app
online ok so we've got a nice welcome
slide here if we preview it yet again
it's only one slide but we're going to
use this to build two other slides that
look almost the same as this one so
let's go back here let's do slide and
duplicate this slide ok and let's start
to change things here so first of all I
want to grab a different background
color it normally looks nice if you
switch between different colors here
delete the image source upload a our
next slides image okay and on this one
we will change this heading to preview
on your phone and change this paragraph
to say make a change preview it
instantly ok and yet again I like having
things we have a heading describing a
feature that the app does and then a
short description under that you might
like a different style that's totally
fine alright now let's duplicate that
one again and go grab our background
color for this one alright we got a nice
purple for that then let's get rid of
that image upload our next image that we
would like choose file the next
line okay and on this one let's change
it to collaborate with anyone and we'll
change the description down here to
easily share access to your preview so
okay so you didn't guess it I'm just
recreating our Welcome slider actually
from creator mobile so let's preview
this as you can see we have a very
nice-looking Welcome slider but we're
going to want to have a fall and
actually we probably don't want people
to go around in a circle either so let's
go to our overall slider component here
and turn off loop so what that means is
they will not be able to loop in an
infinite circle it will stop them at the
end and it also stops them at the
beginning all right so now let's yet
again duplicate this slide and we're
going to do something a little bit
different for this one we're going to do
a white background we are going to
delete our now invisible heading in
paragraph and then we are going to
change this image to creators logo and
we obviously don't want this logo taking
up 80% so we are going to change this to
150 pixels that's 200 pixels okay it's
still centered there for us let's add a
space or component and let's add a login
button
alright so now if we preview this whole
welcome slider here build your apps will
approve you on your phone collaborate
with anyone and then we have our nice
login screen so we want to click this
and go to a different page so let's
first of all get a different page going
here this page I'm going to call it
apartment hunter we're going to build
like an apartment image slider real
quick let's we actually want this one to
have a header let's call that header
royal and now a couple weird things are
going to happen here okay so we are
actually going to change this login
button to move to apartment hunter but
we're going to want to change the
behavior so first let me show you what
this does that's a little weird so we
don't
have a header on our slider page so when
we navigate to the last slide and hit
login it has a weird transition where
the header pops down it goes to the next
page and we have a back button going to
our welcome mat which we probably don't
want okay so we're going to do a couple
different things on your slider page
okay we are going to scroll down here we
are going to disable transition on that
page so we will no longer get a
transition to the next page then on
apartment hunter we are going to want to
disable the back button so that we don't
go back to our Welcome slider
okay so let's preview this click now if
we go to our final slide hit login we
get a nice instant transition that looks
normal so you might have you know a
login page here or anything else you
want but for right now I want to move on
to the next portion of the tutorial
where I'm going to show you how to build
a slider based on dynamic images from a
scope variable so in apartment hunter
here let's open the code and switch over
here
whoops to our apartment scope and I have
some code already written here that I'm
just going to copy in real quick and you
guys don't need I'm not going to put
this on the github or anything it's
really easy it's scoped out pictures
equals a list of three URLs that I had
actually uploaded these using our image
component and then just stole the URL
from that and pasted it in a list of
three different images here so I'm just
going to save that code boom and then
let's drag over another slider into this
page now this page let's actually add a
heading here and we'll call this awesome
apartment kh3 and it's to a paragraph
you should rent this apartment it's
awesome and then we'll have a button
that says rent now okay so now when you
see a lot of different apps that have
sliders even though we want padding
around this content we actually are
going to want to
select the slider and do make full width
on this so that it extends all the way
to the edges of the phone but we still
have a little bit of spacing up here so
now we're going to want to select the
whole page and we are going to want to
remove the header margin so now we have
that slider moved all the way up our
page it's full width even though we have
padding on that content and we can see
these nice images so now let's actually
delete to the slides here and let's
focus on this one slide and we're going
to remove the kitten and we're going to
make this dynamic so we are going to
actually do an NG repeat on the slide
for picture in pictures and we're going
to switch the background image to text
based input and what this is going to
allow me to do is do picture here okay
where we can now preview and it's going
to use that URL and repeat the slide
three times to get our three apartment
images from our dynamic data as you can
see this looks really nice so overall
let's preview from the beginning here we
have our nice welcome slider with three
different feature slides that go over
what our app might to our nice logo
where we can log in and go to a
different page instantly then we created
an image slider based dynamically on
images from your data so now you know I
put static images here you could pull
this from an API using some of our API
weekly workshops if you want to go look
at those you anything you want to get
this data into your app so overall I
hope you guys enjoy the new slider
component and I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
