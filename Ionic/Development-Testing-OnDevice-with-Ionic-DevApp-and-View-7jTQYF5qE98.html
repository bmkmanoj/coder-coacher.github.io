team and today I wanted to talk a few
about development and testing on your
device using ionic dev app and ionic
view now there's a lot of stuff that
goes on when it comes to on device
testing today in native land that makes
it really hard so native dependencies
for each platform are required on your
machine that means you'll need things
like Android studio or Xcode and just a
lot of stuff on your machine just to get
started with on device testing on top of
that if you want to on device test kind
of live while you're programming that
requires Xcode which is only available
on Macs it's also very complicated and
time consuming to setup right the stuff
isn't fun it's not fun using iTunes
Connect and when you're utilizing things
like test flight or multiple platforms
it just gets really hairy and you can
only test on your device using one
device at a time normally when you're
like connected via USB with live reload
things like that and then sharing your
app so if you want to get your app into
the hands of testers it's very operating
system specific so you need to know like
does your tester have Android or iOS and
then you need to invite them to test
flight or hockey app or Android beta
program there's just a lot of stuff
going on so ionic makes this a lot
easier with dev app and view right you
don't need any native dependencies no
Xcode Android studio emulators nothing
is required to be kind of installed in
your machine just a standard ionic
development environment you could also
test directly on your device while
you're programming with live reload and
access to native features so you can use
things like the camera still when you're
programming so the two apps kind of
function pretty differently so dev app
is used for local development so when
you are actively programming your on
your machine you're writing new features
things like that you can use dev app
with live reload to program with your
phone kind of as a sidekick or multiple
devices right you can have six of them
next to you view on the other hand is
for sharing versions of your app with
testers it's a little more permanent it
allows you to gather feedback you can
say have a channel for marketing and
share new updates with marketing as you
get new versions you want to share with
them so dev app for your personal
use during local development view is for
sharing with kind of external testers or
stakeholders so let's talk a little bit
about each app quickly so dev app you
download it from the App Store under
your phone you run ionic serve on your
machine and dev app is listening
whenever you're connected to the same
Wi-Fi network so as long as you're on
the same Wi-Fi will be able to see any
apps running ionic serve on your machine
we will be able to load those in dev app
and you can get live reload
functionality while you're actively
programming right in dev app it's also
got access to a common set of native
plugins there's a lot of them you can
find that list in our Doc's and I'll
have a link to it later but really it's
built for local development with live
reload check it out now view on the
other hand like I said earlier is for
remote sharing and testing so this
functions a lot simpler than any other
native testing platform you just upload
your code to ionic you say I want to
share with you no Jo at gmail.com or
whatever and we shoot Jo and email and
we allow him to download the app whether
or not he's on Android or iOS we handle
that part for you
downloads ionic view you can open your
app in ionic view and leave you feedback
which goes right back to your ionic
dashboard so without further ado let's
kind of dive into a demo but I did want
to talk about kind of what our demo is
going to cover real quick so we are
going to set up a brand new project
we're gonna run ionic serve do some
development that development we are
going to add some camera plugin
functionality and we're gonna test that
with live reload on dev app then we're
gonna push our code up to ionic Pro once
we're happy with that feature we're
gonna share that app with a tester using
ionic view to get their feedback after
we get that feedback we're gonna make a
change and locally with live reload
using dev app and then test with ionic
view again so we're just gonna kind of
go through this cycle right this cycle
of dev app local share with testers get
feedback start over is kind of the the
the workflow you want to go for when
you're using dev app and ionic view so
without further ado let's jump into my
local machine here as you can see I've
got my command line up I've got the
ionic dashboard up and then this over
here is actually my phone connected
directly to my computer so I'm sharing
my phone screen over there
so the first thing we want to do is run
ionic start we're gonna call this view
dev app let's just call it demo and we
are going to start a brand new ionic
project for this let's say let's just
choose taps and then we are going to say
yes to using cordova because we're gonna
want to use some of that cordova
availability there it is going to set
everything up there's even going to be a
tiny little kind of advertisement when
it comes to dev app here just showing
you how to download it and right now
it's going to install the way for that
to finish and we'll come right back
alright and then we are going to connect
to ionic Pro later so I'll show you that
part later I'm going to say no for now
it is going to go ahead and set
everything up for me so we are just
going to CD into that directory we can
see it's a standard ionic project and
I'm going to open this first up in vs
code so that we can start to work on it
all right now the vs code is open let's
go ahead and let's get started with dev
app so let's run a an exertion now is
going to port all console output back to
my terminal here so if I've got errors
happening when I'm playing with this on
dev app they are going to come back to
my terminal and I'm gonna be able to see
any console logging or errors that are
happening right in my terminal so let's
run ionic serve - see we are going to
let that boot now it's going to go
through the standard process of you know
opening this inside of a browser tab but
we're gonna access that via dev app
after it's finished running alright so
looks like ionic serve is up and running
on our machine it opened in a browser
tab somewhere else we're not going to
worry about that right now we're going
to jump right into dev app so on my
phone we are going to open up dev app
dev app my phone is connected to the
same Wi-Fi network as my computer so
it's going to be searching for anything
running on my Wi-Fi network and it's
gonna find view dev app demo running on
my local macbook so let's open that up
real quick and there we go we've got our
app running in dev app it is functioning
just like a normal app we can click
around our tabs we can play with it we
can do whatever we like and it's
connected to the live reload server
running off my local machine so
what I wanted to show you guys today is
adding some native functionality to kind
of showcase how that works in dev app so
we are going to start adding a camera
plugin and we're gonna let it take a
picture and display the picture on the
screen so let's see here let's go back
to the browser here I'm just going to
install the camera from ionic native so
we're gonna run at a quarter of a plugin
add cordova plugin camera and let's
actually open this up in a new tab here
alright so now that we're in a new tab
let me run this command that we need to
install the cordova plugin so we are
going to do ionic cordova plugin add
cordova plug-in camera and that's gonna
set us up with the actual quarter of a
plugin alright so that plugin got added
let's do npm install say that ionic
native camera so the attic native camera
is kind of just a just a wrapper around
the standard cordova plugin that makes
sure it works with any change detection
and angular so we're gonna use that just
so we don't have to worry about any of
that weird stuff cool so looks like that
finished installing let's just go back
to either tab with that live reload and
let's go back to our code so let's start
adding some of this camera functionality
that we just installed and we're going
to do it with live reload so if we have
kind of anything going on any errors
we're gonna be able to see those and
we're gonna be able to test right on our
device so let's just open the home page
will open the HTML will open the
typescript and let's get started so I
kind of want to do two different things
here so we want to display not only the
picture that we took but we also want a
button that allows someone to boot up
the camera on this page so let's go
ahead and let's add our HTML first so
first we're gonna want an image we're
just going to set that source equal to
the image variable that we're going to
have in our typescript file then we're
going to add a button we're gonna call
that I on button we're gonna give that a
color of primary and on click let's call
the fun
should get picture and then we're gonna
put take picture inside if that button
we're gonna save that HTML file and it's
gonna refresh with live reload on the
left-hand side there so as we can see
right now that image is a little bit
confused just because our variable is
undefined so let's see what happens when
we go back to our typescript class and
start making some of the stuff defined
so let's add public image
I was just equal to an empty string save
that and let's see what happens to the
image on the left over there it's most
likely going to understand now that it
is empty so you can see that little
image Square went away we're starting to
get something that works here cool now
we're going to need to import a few
things to get this camera to work so
let's import let's import camera and
camera options from at ionic native
slash camera right we're gonna save that
now we're going to want to start setting
up our default options for the camera
and make that function that is going to
actually kick off the camera so let's
add private options that's gonna be
camera options type there we go
and then in our constructor here we are
going to want to give access to an
instantiated version of the camera
plugin so let's do camera is camera cool
and then in here we're gonna want to set
this options equal to an object and
you'll find this in the documentation
there's just different options you can
set on here so we're gonna want the
quality of a hundred
let's do destination type is going to be
this dot camera dot destination type
data URL let's do the encoding type is
going to be this dot camera dot encoding
type jpg and then we will do media type
is equal to list camera media type dot
picture cool awesome we got our options
set up so now let's add the actual
taking a picture function here let's do
get picture and start working on that
let's let it finish live reload first
though just to make sure we're all set
all right it looks like we actually have
a runtime error so during setup here it
looks like it can
find the injector for the camera right
no provider for cameras available so
we've forgot to do something
we actually forgot to set up the camera
that we imported in our app dot module
TS as something that's available so
let's go ahead and fix that
let's do import camera from ionic native
slash camera right and then down here in
our providers we are going to add camera
as something that is available to the
rest of our app so now you can see we
got that error to go away we continue
programming so let's write this get
picture function this is going to do
this dot camera get picture we're going
to pass it in this dot options and then
we will take the image data and we will
pass that along and we will set this dot
image equals to and we're going to do
some weird stuff to get the image to
show up so data image it's a JPEG and
then it is base64 comma plus the actual
image data so that's just setting it up
so that it understands this correctly
now let's set an error too if you wanted
to catch any errors that happen here's
where errors would go all right so we
have imported the camera plugin we
installed that we included in our app
module we set up our options and now we
have a function that takes a picture so
let's go back to our actual phone and
let's see if this thing works so we are
in dev app we are going to click take a
picture and we're going to take a
picture of this sweet-looking Tentacruel
figure on my desk
boom it's gonna ask me do you want to
actually use that photo we'll say yes
and then it's going to load and that
photo is now available right in dev app
so we access native functionality with
that live reload we even had an error
happened through dev app but now we're
we're happy with this functionality
right we want to get it into our testers
hands so let's go back here to our
antics server let's go to our other tab
actually right and I'm gonna try to make
this a little bit bigger for you guys
there we go even bigger suite and let's
run ionic link so ionic link is going
to set us up with access to ionic pro
this is how we interface and good stuff
up to use ionic view or deploy or anyone
other kind of pro services so we're
gonna run ionic link if you're not
logged in it's gonna want you to login
I'm gonna create a new app we're gonna
call this view dev app demo and it's
gonna set up that thing we're just gonna
use ionic pro for our host you could
also link this up to a github repository
to pull from automatically but today I'm
just gonna use an apropos anak pro we
are all fine and dandy now if I do get
status though none of these changes have
been committed yet so first we're gonna
do get add we're gonna do get commit
this is our camera function we're gonna
do get push ionic master so this is
going to take all of the code that we
just wrote our app push it up to ionic
pro and that's where we're going to be
able to set this as active for ionic
view so let's go to our dashboard here
let's refresh this and we are gonna see
our view dev app demo we're going to see
we've got that camera function as an app
right now it's not finished building so
if I click this I can watch the build
log live here so we're gonna let this
finish building just doing kind of a
regular bill just like ionic serve in
the cloud so we're gonna let this finish
and then we're going to use an ik field
alright now that our build is finished
we can use it in ionic view so let's go
back to our builds tab here now ionic
view works with this concept of channels
so right now we've got a master and a
production channel we're gonna add a new
one for our marketing team so let's call
this marketing and we're gonna use this
channel it points to an active version
of code in ionic view for a group of
people so we are going to for instance
every time we push up a change that we
want marketing to see we will set it as
active on the marketing channel and
their ionic view will get updated so
let's go back to builds here and on this
camera function that we sent up here
let's click deploy and let's deploy it
to that marketing channel as you can see
now we've got this little tag it says
marketing next camera function that
means it is active on that channel then
let's open
the share function in the top right here
we want to share that marketing channel
today I'm just gonna use a alias of my
own email address so let's just do Matt
plus marketing at a anakata oh this
could be any number of teams this does
not need to be someone that has an
account no account required to use ionic
view there will get an email that
invites them through the system so they
don't need to have a username or
password if you're on a business account
they do not need to take up a seat in
your organization this is purely just an
invite mechanism for private sharing so
let's share with matt at marketing dot
IL and then we're gonna go back to my
phone and pull up the email invite that
we received all right so here is the
email that we received from ionic it
says ionic because I'm in the ionic
organization has invited you to check
out the view dev app demo app and and if
you click the button below and it'll
help you install ionic view and load the
app so if they don't have it installed
it's gonna take them to the App Store to
install the app if they do is just gonna
open the app and it's going to grant
them access okay so let's do loading
ionic view here that's going to go
through a deep link alright so as you
can see at the bottom of the screen here
you can see matt plus marketing at ionic
IO has access to the view and dev app
demo now I am also logged in to my mat
at ionic dot IO developer account okay
so I have access to all the apps that I
have in my dashboard right here now if I
click on the view dev app demo it's
gonna show me all the different channels
so I as a developer logged in can see
all of the channels when I'm out on the
go and then if I scroll down to my mat
at marketing email here that we shared
with and I click it it's not even gonna
give me the option to pick a channel
because I've only been shared that
marketing thing so let's go and load
this up alright and our app has loaded
in ionic view so now we've got access to
play with this just like we normally
would we can use any functionality of
the app here and we're still going to
have access to that native functionality
so yet again let's take a picture here
it is going to open up the camera let's
take another picture of that sweet
Tentacruel figure hit go use photo
and that photo pops up right in ionic
field so here is kind of the same
experience at dev app except I can
access this version of the app at any
time it's not running locally off antic
server or anything like that so
definitely more useful for testers
developers use dev app during active
development right so let's shake the
phone here real quick and we are going
to send some feedback to the dev team
okay so let's send some feedback let's
say please put the button at the top and
change it to red
send it feedback submitted successfully
awesome so let's go back to our
dashboard here let's go over to the
feedback tab and you can see we got this
feedback and it shows us who it came
from it shows us the message if I click
it we can even see a full screenshot of
what the user was looking at when they
sent us this feedback so here's our full
screenshot please put the button at the
top and change it to red we can see they
had an iPhone running iOS 11 to 6 and I
was looking at the marketing channel
when I left this feedback all right cool
so let's actually make that change so
let's go back to our code here let's go
let's actually go back to dev app ok and
let's actually make this change okay so
first of all they wanted the button at
the top instead of at the bottom so
let's take that let's go there
hit save we're going to see that live
reload happen in dev app and now if I
take a picture the button should remain
on top because we move that sweet so the
buttons on top and let's actually change
it to danger awesome and now the buttons
red so we've worked locally again we're
using dev app with live reload and now
we want to push this back up so that
marketing can take a look so let's go
back to our code here let's do get
status we can see we've got that a
little bit of change so we're gonna add
it we're gonna commit it and we're gonna
say marketing's changes we're gonna do
get push ionic master so this is yet
again going to push the code
up to ionica Pro and then this thing
right here is actually special links so
I think of my do command click it'll
actually open the build log right in my
browser here so we can see the build log
will wait for this to finish we're going
to set it as active and check it out in
view again alright it looks like our
build finished successfully so let's go
back to builds again as we can see we
still have this camera function that's
set to active on all these channels so
let's actually deploy our marketing
changes to the marketing channel okay
now a couple things are gonna happen
right now so for one anyone I've shared
the marketing channel with is gonna get
an email and says hey there's been an
update however they can also just look
at the app in ionic view and they're
automatically going to have that latest
update so let's go back to our phone
here
let's open up ionic view okay we're
gonna close the app we're gonna refresh
our list of apps so that we make sure we
get the new version here and we're going
to open up Matt + marketing at ionic dot
IL and we should see the new version
with the red button and the picture at
the bottom because we said it just
active out that channel so take picture
boom we've still got that native
functionality use photo and then they
can yet again shake the phone send some
feedback and say you know looks great
send feedback submitted successfully now
if we go back to our dashboard here yet
again we can see that feedback looks
great awesome this has been marketing
approved so we can go back to our code
and maybe we do something like deploy
this to production and maybe we've got
that production channel set up to pull
from our like actual binary from the app
store I've got a different video on that
if you'd like to check that out it also
shows you how to set up a beta channel
so overall let's go back here to our
little presentation so demo we set up a
new project we program the camera plugin
functionality we use dev app to live
reload we even encountered some errors
that we were able to fix then we push
your app up to ionic Pro and created a
new channel shared that with marketing
marketing gave us some feedback we made
those changes utilizing dev app with
live reload again sent them a new
version V ionic view view they
of those changes and we set them to
active on our production channel so I
just kind of wanted to give you yet an
again a kind of an overview of each app
so dev app is used with live reload
while you are actively developing while
you're programming on your local machine
right it auto detects any app running on
the same Wi-Fi network that does ionic
serve I like using - see which ports
that console output back to your
terminal even if it's running in dev app
yep works on any Wi-Fi network you can
also live reload on multiple devices at
once so you can open dev app on four
different things and lo it click you
know your app on all of them and you'll
be live reloading on an android device
and an iOS device and maybe an android
tablet and an iOS tablet all next to
each other live reloading while you're
programming so you can make sure your
changes look good and all those
platforms live while you're working also
gives you access to all those native
plugins that are included so let's talk
a little bit about ionic view attic view
is used for more I call it like
permanent testing right you're sharing a
specific version of your code with
someone and that version persists so
it's not like ionic server where if we
stop tonic serve serving off our machine
dev app would stop working
ionic view allows us to have that
permanent version on our phone for
testing right you could update that
version like I showed you with the
channels and stuff like that so it's
more useful for kind of sharing with
external testers and groups or if you
personally wanted to have like just a
version on your phone when you're not
actively programming good for that -
it's got that easy email based sharing
you don't need to know if they're on iOS
or Android or anything like that we just
shoot them an email and they will get
access to the version of code that you
wanted them to see also as that in-app
feedback mechanism so they can shake the
phone click send feedback comes with a
screen shot and allows you to view that
right in your dashboard and then just
like dev app also has access to that
native app behavior now speaking of that
native app behavior I wanted to talk a
little bit about how dev app and view
work right so as you guys know attic
apps kind of have layers like onions
okay
there's red layer on the Left we've got
our Cordova plugins or native
dependencies basically anything in
native land now when we make ionic view
in ionic dev app
we control that layer so ionic sets up
the plugins that are available the
native dependencies anything kind of a
native a plan but the reason we can make
this so quick and easy is because when
you're working with a hybrid app like
ionic you control the entire separate
layer the angular ionic HTML CSS
JavaScript images icons assets anything
you want to put there is completely
controlled by you effectively you have
the ability to take the www directory
and use it in dev app and view and then
we control those plugins so let's talk
and that's what that's what gives us the
capability to put it in the app store
and make it really easily accessible to
everyone is because we control kind of
the native layer so when looking at
supported native plugins you can find
the latest plugins here in our
documentation under the View tab we have
plugins support it's the same set of
plugins for view and dev app we're
always looking to add new plugins as
well so if there are plugins you are
looking for reach out to our support
team we're always keeping tabs and kind
of which ones at the top and which ones
we should add to view and dev app so
view and dev app are both kind of part
of this ionic pro set of tools and
services that's our suite outside of the
free MIT license framework that gives
you kind of better ways to build test
deploy and monitor your ionic apps that
includes crater or rapid prototyping
tool it includes view that I showed you
today includes an ik deploy which lets
you bypass the app store to send you
know how it fixes bugs and new features
right to your customers on the fly
that's what you might set up that
production channel for we also have a
package service that actually takes your
ionic project and turns it into that
native binary that you can submit to the
app store we have a monitoring service
and that monitoring service allows you
to kind of take your errors that are
happening maybe in production maybe
during development and it takes them
back to the original source code so that
you can see kind of the original error
that happened so instead of like error
line one character thirty thousand and
seven the letter e is undefined you get
a very specific error so thanks for
tuning in I hope you found this useful
like I said there are other videos out
there especially that deployed beta
channel one I definitely check that one
out next I'll link to it in the
description below but thanks for tuning
in see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
