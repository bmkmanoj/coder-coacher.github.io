typescript build step for a project and
then looked at how we can add type
annotations to our code in this video
we'll take our controllers and convert
them over to es6 classes to get started
we will clone this project which has an
up to date list of dependencies so run
git clone and then CD into that
directory then run NPM install this will
go out and fetch all the necessary build
tools that we'll need
from here would install all the up to
date typing's with TS d install and then
we'll open up our editor first we'll
want to navigate to our controller ES
File and take a look at all of our
controllers and notice that we all have
anonymous functions at the end of them
so what we're going to do is create a
class that will replace that anonymous
function so we'll navigate above our
angular dot module definition and will
create a class and for this first one
we'll call it our dash controller and
inside of it it's going to contain a
constructor which has 0 dependencies and
does nothing so it will close that out
we'll come back down to our dash
controller replace this anonymous
function with the named dash controller
class that we just created
for our chats controller we're going to
take the same pattern and then look at
how we can actually work with dependency
injection so we'll take a class and then
give it a name up chats controller and
we're going to do a dependency injection
a little bit different than we're used
to in just regular JavaScript so we're
going to use angular's dollar inject to
inject a list of dependencies for this
controller so say public dollar inject
it's going to equal an array of strings
and for this one will inject the chat
service then we can come down to our
constructor and inject the chat service
that we just injected right here so
inside of our constructor function we
will essentially copy this save but what
you'll notice is that we have an error
our typescript compiler saying that we
do not have a property of chats on this
class so what you need to do here is
create chats property and then give it a
type of any kind of array now semicolon
save and then the typescript compiler is
happy the next part will recreate this
remove method that we have right here so
we'll copy that and move it up here and
what we're going to want to do is remove
the this stop before the remove name and
then we'll also delete the equal sign
and function so now we have a our
typical class setup and what we're going
to want to do instead of saying chats
that remove will say this dot chats that
remove pointing to this chat service
that we injected in our constructor and
last but not least we'll come down to
our function delete that and replace it
with the chats controller that we just
created now for the last one we're going
to look at look at the chats detail
controller so again we'll come down here
create a class detail controller will
create our injected array of
dependencies this one taking chats and
dollar state programs from here we'll
create a constructor and it will have
two dependencies public chats and if you
want to annotate this we can an take
this with any and for our next one
dollar state programs and then we could
also annotate this dollar state programs
using our typing's from PSD zhen GUI
interface state program service we have
a chat object or chat property on our
controller so we'll say chat and we'll
give it a type of object and then from
here we can actually just copy that and
paste that right there and then we'll do
our final cleanup of removing the
anonymous function and replacing it with
the named class that we just created so
we'll save we will go ahead and run
ionic surf well you notice is that
everything still works was still loading
in all of the user data from our service
you notice that we can navigate around
and still have everything load in our
next video we'll take a look at our chat
service that we had and look how we can
create an interface and get intellisense
for our own code completion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
