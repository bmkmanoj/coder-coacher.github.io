team and today I want to show you how to
use our three different interactive
button types that we now have on list
items the first being our standard
delete button for an entire list the
ability to reorder lists and then also
our swipeable buttons that are now
available for the list items so let's
dive into that and create a new project
here and we're gonna call this list item
buttons I'm just gonna use a blank
project type for that and give it a
second here and the first thing we are
going to do is go over and change our
header color here because we're gonna be
doing some buttons and headers for this
tutorial as well alright so let's drag
over a single list item okay and then
then I want this to be full width so
we're going to go to the page toggle off
padding so we can get a full width list
item now we want to start off start off
though so we're going to delete and
reordering I want this list item to be
repeated dynamically so we are going to
open our code here and I'm going to copy
over an object I already have set up
called scope dot items and scope dot
items is just a list of objects where
each object has an ID the numbers 1
through 5 some really easy object to get
set up here we are going to save that
then back on the item here we're going
to add an angular directive ng-repeat
for item in items and we are going to
change the text content to be item and
then item dot ID so if I preview this
we're gonna see five different lists I
have show up taken directly from our
data now if we go to the overall list
component in the left here so not list
item but the list component you're gonna
see our buttons section here which has
delete and reorder now these are
interesting properties because since it
delete or reorder button is shown for an
entire list they're managed here via a
variable on whether or not they're shown
so we're gonna go back down to our code
and do scope dot show delete equals
false and scope that show reorder equals
false okay and then we're gonna also
want to have a little table
function here that we can use for the
header buttons to toggle whether or not
these are true or false so let's just
set up called something scope dot toggle
equals function V and we were just gonna
do scope v equals the opposite of
whatever scope V currently is so we're
gonna be able to pass in any scope title
here essentially and it's just gonna
reverse true or false so this gives us
one really easy function to toggle both
the delete and reorder buttons so now
we're gonna go and we're gonna select
the entire page okay and we're gonna use
a left header button icon - for iOS here
okay there we go and then for the right
header we're gonna enable that and I'm
gonna actually just use text and call
this one reorder now that's all fine and
dandy nothing is going to happen unless
I hook these up so what we want to do is
add two different directives to this
page we want an ng-click toggle the
string show delete and we are also going
to want an ng-click toggle the string
show reorder now these haven't been put
anywhere they're actually on the entire
page right now so we're gonna want to
click this button here next to each one
and we're gonna put the delete one on
our first left delete button here and
we're gonna put the reorder one on the
button that is on the right side in our
HTML here so now that those directives
are both set up we should be able to
preview this and automatically see a
delete button I did something wrong oh
we actually didn't put the variable
names in the settings here so we're back
in that list item okay and we're gonna
do a show delete here and a show reorder
here and it's just straight from these
variable names in scopes so we're just
telling you're going to show the delete
button based on show delete you're going
to show the reorder button based on show
reorder both from our scope variables so
we kind of did three things here show
delete in our code show reorder in our
code a toggle function we put those in
the list item okay and then on the page
we set up buttons that toggle each of
those variables okay so we didn't
things are so now when I preview we're
gonna see this and it's gonna show our
delete buttons okay we can click it and
toggle them off and our reorder is going
to show our reorder buttons built in and
that's because we're toggling that
variable on and off with those buttons
now we want to make those actually do
something so let's go back into our code
here and we're gonna do scope dot delete
equals let's see for delete let's just
pass in the item and scope top reorder
is actually going to take the item the
from index and the to index so for
delete we're going to let's see we're
just going to I'm going to copy over
some code here we're going to do a
splice on the item so scope dot items
dots place the index where this item
exists only delete one thing so that's
our very simple delete function for
reorder I am going to copy and some code
here that is actually going to splice it
away from the old index and then put it
back into the new location now this code
super simple I'm gonna put it on github
dot use creator com but this is also
just the straight-up list item tutorial
from ionic frameworks documentation that
we're going through right now so this is
really easy code here all we're doing is
splicing some things around okay
now the only thing is we need to set up
this delete and reorder code and we're
not actually going to set that up on the
overall list even though that's where
the delete and reorder buttons are
managed it is actually part of the list
item because each item is in charge of
deleting or reordering itself okay so if
we go down to directives here for this
individual list item we can do an
ng-click delete item and we can also add
an ng-click or nope this is actually not
added click we're going to get to that
one in just second sorry so let's do ng
click delete item and we're going to
move that to our I on delete button that
is new leak really created now this is
created because we already set something
on the list item so we're gonna save and
close that now the next directive is
actually a special
then made specifically for reordering so
that's on - reorder and that is going to
be reorder our function name that we
used from over here okay reorder the
item dollar from index dollar to index
and we are going to move that towards
our eye on reorder button and save and
close that as well so in order to
actually bring up the delete and reorder
functionality we did two things added
the functions to our scope to manage
what happens when you click delete or
reorder and then we also added an
ng-click for delete and an on reorder
for reorder to the list item so let's
preview this and see if this works so
we're going to click this button I'm
going to delete item 3 as you can see it
disappears we can toggle that back off
reorder and we're gonna drag item 5 up
to the top now it's up at the top we can
drag one above that so we can drag two
above that we can keep going and
reordering these list items so I know it
took a little bit of code to set up and
like I said this code will be on github
use creator comm but that's deleting and
reordering for an entire list for our
special delete and reorder button types
now list items also have a third option
available to them now which is swipe
buttons swipe buttons are also managed
on a list item component basis okay so
these are a little bit easier you could
just add a swipe button and for this one
let's do share and we can switch this
over to balance so it's going to appear
as green and then let's make a share
function so scope that share equals
function item and let's just do an alert
method for I share item plus item dot ID
okay
and so that share balanced we're gonna
add yet again another directive ng -
click share item and we are going to use
this little button again to move it
towards our I on option button class
button balanced share button that we
just created save and close that and now
when we preview those changes we should
see that you can swipe this open on any
one of your items okay so we're going to
open this one share it and we get an
alert for share item three alright so
now that was kind of a lot of
information all at once
but that's how to use delete reorder and
swipe buttons on lists items and all set
up to actually have directive handlers
that are set to the correct elements let
me know if you have any questions in the
comment section below and I will catch
you guys next time
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
