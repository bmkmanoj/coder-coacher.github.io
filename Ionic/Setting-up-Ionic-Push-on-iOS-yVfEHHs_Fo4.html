simple push notification service built
for your ionic gaps to get started let's
follow the official push documentation
on the ionic diode Docs let's follow the
QuickStart guide so we can get up and
running fast first we need to install
the alpha version of the ionic
command-line tool this won't be required
for long but for now the push features
are available only in alpha
next let's start an app using the push
starter template let's run ionic starts
my push app and push this will going
down the the push starter template
now that our app is created let's upload
it to ionic to dial our API key let's
open a text editor and go into that app
that we just got created open www such J
s slash app j s in this config call
where we're identifying our app with the
ionic app provider we can replace our
new app ID that we find in the dashboard
my push up here's the app ID and if we
open the ionic services dashboard we can
see our API keys so we're going to use
this API key and the GCM ID we can
configure later for Android but that's
the official Google ID that you get from
the cloud console okay so we've
configured our app ID let's go and
install the platform support for iOS
first and this is the process that takes
the most amount of time unfortunately to
get up and running with iOS push
notifications we need to configure our
certificates and also update our
provisioning profiles and enable push
notifications for our app let's start
with generating the certificate requests
we need to open a keychain access then
the certificate assistant and request a
certificate from a certificate authority
and we'll go save to disk and continue
and I'm just going to save it to the
desktop great our certificate request
has been created now let's login to the
Apple Developer Center to configure push
notifications for our app ID
in the app of the developer center we
need to click certificates identifiers
and profiles
will select identifiers and we'll create
a new iOS app ID we'll give it a random
name and then create an explicit app ID
using reverse DNS notation
you should do your domain dot your app
ID and notice this is different than the
ionic app ID this is just for Apple down
here at the bottom will enable push
notifications which will configure in a
bit don't forget to hit submit down here
on the next page
our app ID is configured let's enable
push notifications for our app this is
the one that we just created we'll go to
edit down here a little bit on do push
notifications and configure our
development push certificate now we need
that certificate signing request that we
generated in the first step so let's
find that and then upload it here and
then click generate
you
great our certificate is ready so let's
download it
certificate to our keychain we can open
it or double-click in finder great we
see it here now we need to export it so
when I click on export and we're gonna
save it to the desktop we shouldn't give
it a password to protect it but we will
need to enter our password note if you
want to go into production you'll need
to do the same thing but click
production push SSL certificate instead
of development now we need to generate a
provisioning profile that has our new
certificates and push notifications
enabled even if you had a provisioning
profile already you'll need to generate
a new one so let's go to development
let's click the new provisioning profile
we're going to select iOS app
development and continue find your app
ID in the list it's already selected
ours select the certificate select
devices so I'll do all devices and then
we'll give it a profile name and click
generate great our provisioning profile
is ready let's download it and to use
this will you will open it
now to add this provision profile to our
app we will go back to the command line
into our ionic app and type ionic
platform add iOS to install the iOS SDK
once that's done we can go and open the
iOS project in Xcode
then we should edit the config dot XML
file to set the app ID to the one that
we entered in Apple in the iOS developer
center save and we can run ionic build
iOS to update the iOS project great
great we should check in the app that
the bundle identifier is set to the one
that we entered online sometimes you
need to delete it after doing a bill to
make it update but that's the correct
one and we'll make sure that our team is
set to the right team for the
provisioning profile that we have now we
can go in open provisioning profile and
it will open in Xcode okay one thing we
need to do before we test our app is
actually send our iOS development
certificate to the ionic server so we're
gonna go and use this ionic push command
and then specify the location of the
exported certificate from the last step
let's try running her app to see what it
looks like we're just going to use the
simulator to start great we should see
the ioniq push starter with information
on how we can use the service the way
the ionic push service works is it takes
a a user that we've identified in our
app and associates it with device tokens
this way we can have a user ID device
token pair so we know how to target
individual devices it's not that useful
just to store device tokens because you
don't know who is using the app so you
have no way to target that push on
occasion you'll end up just having to
send push notifications to every device
that you have registered and that's not
a good idea so the first thing you do is
you want to identify a user in your
system you can generate a good for the
user if you want or pass in the user ID
from your application you'll often do
this after the user logs in for example
once I've logged in you can trigger
register call this registers the app for
push notifications and also sends the
device to pin to the ionic services
which will then either send you a web
hook or store the device doggin on our
service for the upcoming dashboard now
you can't test push convocations in the
simulator unfortunately you have to test
on the device so for the next few
minutes i'm going to be testing on the
device but walking you through things
that you need to do to make it work so
let's close the simulator great my app
launched and I see the same UI that I
just saw in the simulator so I'm going
to tap identify just to do a test
identify and then test register and
you'll notice there's command line
output down here so I just got the push
notification prompt someone hit allow or
okay
okay so we can try testing the push
service by using ionic push - send we'll
put in our API key from the dashboard
use the secret private API key to send
it's an authorized endpoint
and the device token that we want to
send to you can get the device token by
either looking on the app itself it'll
be printed down at the bottom or open up
Safari and use the web inspector to wrap
it or it'll be sent to your web hook
which you can optionally configure and
we're going to say hello and we'll set a
badge count to ten great if we look at
the app we should see that we got a push
with an alert field a badge field in the
sound field for round field that's for
debugging when you're actually testing
this you'll see that if you're not in
the app you'll get an alert in iOS
otherwise it's up to you to handle that
inside the app great that's all for
setting up push notifications with ionic
bio and iOS thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
