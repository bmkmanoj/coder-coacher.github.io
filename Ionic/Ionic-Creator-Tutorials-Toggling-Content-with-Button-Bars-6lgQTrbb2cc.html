team and you're watching our weekly
workshop today I want to show you some
simple tactics that you can use to
toggle content in two different ways so
the first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna make a button bar that toggles
content based on which button you have
pressed and also give that button an
active state and then I'm also going to
show you just how to use like a regular
on/off toggle to toggle a content to be
shown or hidden so first we're gonna
start by creating our new project here
and we're just going to call this
toggling we're just gonna do a blank
project something simple I'm not worried
about looks or anything today I just
want to show you guys some simple
JavaScript scope variables essentially
that you can use to start getting this
stuff off the ground so the first thing
we're going to do is we are going to
drag over a button bar and as you can
see these buttons have we got three
different buttons by default here and I
want to show you what happens when we go
over here and we add the class active to
one of the buttons we can see that it
gives this dark background so our goal
should be to have this button bar show
an active State and remain active based
on which button you have pressed so we
are going to need to set up a scope
variable to accomplish this so we're
gonna do scope dot active section equals
one in our code and we're going to save
that then on each button we are going to
be adding a new directive and this
directive is going to be a little bit
interesting okay we're going to do ng
class and the value for ng class is
actually an object okay so we're going
to start by having our curly braces make
an object click here and the key is the
class so the key is going to be active
and the value is straight JavaScript
true or false some kind of thing that
evaluates to true so we're actually just
going to use our scope variable we're
going to do active section equals 1 so
if active section is equal to 1 it's
going to add the class active for us now
let's go through and add this to every
single one of our three buttons here ng
class and we will change this active
State to two ng class and
will change this active state to three
and as we preview this our default
section that's active should be one and
if I change this over here to two we see
that that active state switches over to
be two so now let's make this dynamic
based on an actual button click okay so
I'm gonna want to set up scope change
section is a function that takes in s
for section and we will set scope dot
active section equals to s now if
there's other things you wanted to do in
this function you could do that here but
this is just a really simple function
here that we are going to be able to
pass a variable to so back on our first
button I'm going to add an ng-click
change section to one okay and you need
the parentheses we need to pass the one
as a parameter okay so now let's go
through and add this to every single
button ng click change section 2 2 ng
click change section 2 3 and then what
should happen now is we should see that
active state whoop I messed up so we
misspelled something I forgot the letter
I in there save that preview and now we
should get that working so 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 we
have all fine and dandy here toggling
back and forth with that active state so
now what we want to do is we want to
actually show different content based on
what our active state is so let's drag
over 3 different paragraphs here and the
first paragraph I'm gonna do I'm let's
see I'm paragraph 1 second one we could
do paragraph two is the best and for the
third one we're gonna do champions are
born in paragraph 3 alright so on
paragraph 1 here we are going to add an
angular directive that is an ng-show if
active section
is equal to
and we're going to do this same thing
for both these other paragraphs so
ng-show
if active state is equal to 2 and
ng-show if active state is equal to 3 so
now if we preview this we can see that
we're only going to see one of the
paragraphs we should see paragraph 2 by
default now we see paragraph 1 now we
see paragraph 3 so this gets you you
know maybe I have an image up here and
some other content below it but you want
toggle blow content in the middle that
kind of acts like tabs this is an easy
way to accomplish that with just a few
lines of code now I also want to show
you just how to toggle content on and
off it uses almost the same exact code
here so let's add a page a blank page
here and I'm going to want to drag over
our toggle and I will drag over a
paragraph okay and let's just do here
scope show content equals false okay and
on our toggle this toggle can have a
value associated with whether or not
it's on or off and that value can be
tied directly back to scope using
ngmodel directive so ng - model is equal
to show content and that's going to tie
it directly to our scope variable we
just created now on this paragraph we're
just going to do an ng-show if show
content okay so now on preview we can
tackle this we'll see the content toggle
it back off so overall that's two quick
ways that you can use to toggle content
your applications I know this was a
pretty simple weekly workshop but I've
had a lot of people talking to me about
this kind of stuff so if there's
anything even if you think it's small
that you've been hitting a lot or that
you want to know how to do feel free to
let us know at onic creator on twitter
and we'll see if we can make it into a
video I'll catch you guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
