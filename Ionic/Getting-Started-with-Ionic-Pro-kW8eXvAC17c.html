ioniq team and I'm gonna help you get
your development environment set up on a
Mac so you can start building awesome
ionic apps let's dive in so the first
thing we are going to do is go to ionic
framework comm and let's sign up for a
new account if you haven't already know
I've already completed these fields but
go ahead and enter your name email
username and password and let's create
the account now we want to create a new
app I'm just gonna type in new F will
create that app and now we have a few
last steps before we get up and running
with our ionic application now before we
install the latest cly let's go ahead
and make sure that we have a couple
dependencies installed one of those
dependencies is going to be no js' and
make sure that you install the LTS
version this is recommended for most
users it's also the most stable so go
ahead and download that and let's
download the latest version of git for
Mac once you have git and nodejs
installed let's go ahead and install the
latest version of the client open up
your terminal enter NPM install - G
ionic latest this is going to pull the
latest version of ionic and install it
on your machine now if you came up with
an error like the one that you see here
don't worry this just means you don't
have administrative privileges on this
Mac simply type sudo and then rerun that
same command sudo grants you temporary
administrative privileges on your Mac so
you can run this command and now the
install for ionic will start let's go
back to the directions and let's go
ahead and start a new app this is the
app that I've started here as you can
see the pro ID matches the ID up here so
what I'll do is I will just start this
app copy and paste that into the
terminal go ahead and enter that email
that you just used to sign up for a new
account with so now you have the ability
to get started with either a blank
project a side menu project or a tabs
prod
direct I like to get started with tabs
because it has navigation already baked
in so now if you have an existing SSH
key pair and want to use it definitely
select this option however if this is a
new process for you and you want to
automatically setup a new one click this
so this is automatically setting up the
configuration for our get servers great
let's go back to the setup and see what
the next step is let's CD into the new
app now that we are in our new app let's
push it up to ionic pro by typing git
push ionic master this command uses git
to push up the latest changes you've
made to ionics get servers on the master
branch and as you can see in your
terminal when we're anionic start we
already did our first get add - a and
git commit next time you'll need to do
those on your own anytime you make a
change once it gets up to ionic we'll do
a full build of your app for you and as
you can see a new build log should now
appear in your pro dashboard and you'll
see that that commit happened just a few
seconds ago let's quickly go back and
see what that application looks like
since we're already in that new app
simply run ionic serve ionic serve spins
up a local development server which
launches right in your browser you can
easily and quickly view any of your
ionic projects by seeding into them and
then running ionic serve so here you can
see the tabs application that I built
just a couple minutes ago now let's see
what this project looks like on mobile
I'm gonna go back to my terminal and I'm
gonna run ionic serve - - lab now ionic
lab allows you to easily run and emulate
your ionic apps right in your local
browser but it gives you this awesome
view one of the amazing things you get
with ionic is platform continuity
out-of-the-box so here in ionic lab you
can see I have the ability to select
other platforms such as Android and
Windows and I can view what my
application looks like on their
respective platforms now I can also
interact with the application and I
think
click on different tabs and navigate
throughout the application on multiple
devices simultaneously so in less than
five minutes we were able to get a
simple development environment set up on
our Mac we built a tabs application and
pushed it to ionic Pro and we were able
to see what that application looked like
with ionic lab now if you're interested
in private view app sharing ionic
monitoring ionic package hot code
updates with Anik deploy team
collaboration and so much more
definitely check the links below because
we have so many amazing things that you
can do with in ionic pro thanks for
