video my name is Mike and I'm here to go
over a little bit about Cordova and the
sequel light plugin now the sequel light
plugin allows us to avoid the
limitations of browser-based storage by
embedding a full database on our device
now while this plugin is very popular it
can be intimidating for first-time users
so to help make this process much easier
we're going to be using the pouch DB
library let's go over to our terminal
and start our live reload server now the
app that I have set up is a simple
two-page app using pouch DB that allows
me to enter data on one page and then
have that data be added to our global
data store we can open up our editor and
check out the code that makes all this
possible if we were to go over this code
we can see that we're creating a new
database and then handling the data that
gets passed from our details page
controller
so when we go over to our browser and
enter some new data
we can refresh the page and see that the
data is persisted this is because pouch
DB is the managing the correct storage
type for us but we want to use the
native sequel a api's so let's go over
to our terminal and install the sequel
Lite plugin
we can head back to our editor and
navigate to where we instantiated our
database now pouch DB lets us pass an
adapter option where we can set the type
of database that we want to use in this
case we want web sequel we set this to
web sequel because pouch DB has a built
in feature that allows it to detect if
it's running inside of a Cordova app if
it is and the sequel Lite plugin is
installed it can write to the sequel
Lite database instead of the browser's
own database let's deploy this to our
Android device
we can see from our logs that the
database has been created and these logs
are actually coming from the sequel I
plugin so let's go through and add some
data to our app
if we exit out our app and close it from
the background when we start the app up
again we can have the data persisted as
it's coming from our sequel Lite
database this is a great option for
people who want to be able to develop in
the browser but also not have to worry
about a plug-in being available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
