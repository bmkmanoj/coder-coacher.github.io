form of tab bar interface in this video
we're gonna create one of those with
ionic ionic has the built-in ion tabs
directive that we can use in order to
build this directive create the gaion
tabs directive and now we can start
filling it with tabs the directive to
create a tab is just the ion tab
directive this takes a title and that's
this specifies what the title of our tab
will be I'm just going to call this one
home and in here I'm going to create our
content and some text when we save this
we now have a tab and it pops up with
the text of Home tab as we can see let's
add a second tab real quick because a an
app with a single tab is pretty boring
and I'm just gonna call this one about
and I'm going to create some content
equally interesting and we can now swap
between our tabs and see that things
happen now we may want to change the
color scheme of this tab and ionic ships
with several colors that are detailed in
the documentation or I'll post those in
the notes but if we would just want to
update that we can set a class on the
ion tabs now in the documentation the
classes are specified as being prefixed
with nothing so it's just the color so
if we want the blue color we use
positive however in the case of tabs we
want those to be able to be sub
customizable so you have to preface that
with the tabs prefix to the directive
when we say we'd notice we change this
to the nice blue color we have so let's
real quickly add a header bar a header
bar can just be added with the I on
header bar directive and from within
here we can set what we want that to
actually be so I'm going to set that the
class to title for our h1 and have our
title now this is pretty interesting and
let's just set a color on it once again
so the other color matches but what if
we want a different title for each
section of the application well you can
either use navigation bars for that and
that is detailed in a more thorough
formula and video series on
or we can create our header bar inside
of each particular tab so I'm going to
do that for the purposes of this video
and change these to home and about save
and we now see that we have a header bar
that changes with our tab if you want to
learn more about the ion tabs directive
and everything it can do check out the
documentation I've linked at the bottom
of the video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
