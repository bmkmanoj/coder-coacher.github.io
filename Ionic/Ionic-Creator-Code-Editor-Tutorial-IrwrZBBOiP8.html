team and today I want to do a deep dive
into our custom code support we're going
to walk through making a fully dynamic
to-do list back by firebase first we're
going to set up our app with a unique
theme using our custom theme support
then we're going to mock up the design
and layout then we can make our to-do
list function with a list backed angular
service finally we're going to utilize
route parameters to view item details
and link up that list based service
directly to firebase
feel free to follow along with me as we
dive in alright so let's get started
with phase one first you're just going
to want to start out in your dashboard
and you're going to want to create a new
tabs project we are going to name this
our to-do project we're going to create
that and wait for this thing to
bootstrap now I know we kind of released
a theming feature and we haven't really
talked about that a whole lot so I did
want to just do some minor tweaks to the
theme for our project here just to give
it a little bit more of a custom feel so
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to go to the top right here and
open up our theming NS CSS and I'm going
to change our header background color to
royal now if I wanted to change what
color this royal was I could also go
over to theme colors and literally
change the definition of royal to a
different hex color you also have the
option here to put in any custom s CSS
that we will compile for you and include
with your app so we're just going to
save our changes here close and we can
see that our header is now this nice
purple color we're going to do the same
thing to our tabs controller we are
going to select on the left hand side
all three tabs and we are going to
change that theme color to royal as well
so now when we go here and we preview
you can see we have our app is a nice
purple color now now we want to start
kind of rigging this app together so
let's do the first thing here and get
rid of this third tab we're not going to
need it we also are not going to need
the corresponding page for that tab so
here we are just going to name this -
dues
in the routing URL up top that just
helps with our export function we're
going to change the title to Do's now
our other page is where we're going to
want to store our finished item so let's
just name that finished and we could
have this finished items then we can go
down here and make these tabs actually
make sense so let's go here
call this one - dues here let's search
for list and we'll just do a niños list
outline some that makes sense and then
over here
let's do finished items and for that
let's look up some kind of check mark
let's do this one alright so that was
kind of easy we're just getting our
things set up here with the - dues the
finish items is your standard tabs
project now we want to do here is we are
actually going to have a list item so
let's just drag over let's do an icon
list item - this - dues page okay and
let's do let's change this left icon -
let's look for check mark again but
let's use this outline blank one these
are unchecked items okay now let's do
some small other formatting stuff let's
do this one we can go to the list over
here on the left change this list to be
full width so that does is even though
our page has padding the list is going
to go the full width right then we're
going to select a page you can do that
just by clicking the background and
we're going to disable the header margin
well that does move this item all the
way to the top so now when you preview
you see we have a nice full width list
item here okay now that's all fine and
dandy we click this it doesn't really do
anything it's not backed by any data so
now let's dive into a little bit of the
code feature let's open up this code
panel you can do that by clicking on the
bar at the bottom of your page and
you're immediately greeted with
different controllers for your page now
for those of you that know ionic or no
angular's might look a little weird to
you because all we're giving you is a
function we'll handle everything else
for you okay we will make sure that this
gets put into a file for you that it's
wrapped in doc
or all that fun stuff but just for a
lack of making everything function
correctly for you we give you access to
a function now this function already
imports scope and state params you can
import anything else you'd like in this
function you have full control over that
and we'll make sure that everything gets
injected properly so in here let's to
start having some fun just do scope
items equals a list of items here and we
can do let's do title testing item one
and let's make a finished state variable
so that the false and then we will copy
this make another one and set finish to
true change it to testing item to do
that and then we will save our changes
to the code it's important remember to
save your changes okay so basically we
have an item on scope now that we have
access to so for each of these items
it's a list with two different objects
in it that we now have access to from
our components so I'm going to click on
our item component again and I'm going
to add an angular directive you can add
any regular angular directive you can
add custom directives if you include any
of right now I'm just going to go ahead
and add an NG - repeat and we are going
to do for item in items and now this
items right here is directly linked to
scope dot items over here and we're just
going to iterate through that and call
it item so now if we preview you'll see
two of them with no data now the thing
we can do is we can use template tags
anywhere you can include text so for the
content we are going to use template tag
item dot title now when you're
previewing we're going to show you those
template text so you know exactly where
that data is coming from however when
you go to the actual preview mode now we
see testing item 1 and testing item 2
which is awesome okay so we
automatically have these two things
repeat from real data from our
controller now let's say we want to
throw the current ones on the left hand
side here and then finished items we
only want the finished ones over there
so what we're going to do is we are
going to take that icon list item again
again we will
move the header margin we will select a
list over here make it full width okay
select this thing here and for this one
we are going to want a check but this
one we will do an actual check in a box
and we'll add that same kind of
directive ng-repeat okay for item in
items and we are going to leave that now
here we've already encountered an issue
and we're going to solve it in the next
phase so we have scoped out items in our
to dues right our finished items does
not have access to that scope so even
though I did ng-repeat
item and items on these finished items
when you preview it we're going to get
nothing because that scope isn't there
so in the next phase we are going to
work on making this into a service so we
can have both sides of our tabs access
the same data all right guys let's move
on to Phase two so during this phase I
want to take what we just did and kind
of move the items into a service so we
can access them for multiple pages as
well as take this thing and give these
items each their own individual pages
where we can mark them as done or
uncomplete it so let's start off by
going to our built-in services j/s down
here now this is real simple we just
leave this here for you guys in case you
want to easily add some services that we
already include if you wanted to make
your own new service for this you could
just hit add we could name this to-do
zjs and now you can see here that we
have angular module my module so let's
name this to Deus okay now it's
important though that we rename this so
we just did and add the amount of module
to the angular modules above so that's
this button right here so we click
angular modules and we are going to add
to dues I suppose I should change this
to lowercase just to make sure we leave
everything safe like that
and so now once we save this that will
automatically be included in our app dot
J's file that gets exported so now let's
add a service here so we already kind of
comment one out for you so let's
uncomment that let's call this two dues
right and then
here is going to be a boilerplate for us
to get this service into our pages so
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
just going to create something local so
far items
equals and we are actually going to take
this from our page controller and copy
it right into here so there now we
already have our two items built in here
and we are going to do var to do x'
equals items we're going to set that
items to that and then we're going to
wind up returning that object okay so
what this does is it's going to set up a
service this is an internal variable
here we are going to set items equal to
this internal variable we set up here
and then we're going to return that so
what we can do now is save our service
we can go over to to dues here include
the art to dues service and we now we
can set scope items into - dues items so
what's that is going to do is if we look
at our - dues page here we are going to
have an item for each thing from our -
dues service instead of from art - dues
controller so if I preview this you'll
see we have testing item 1 testing item
2 both from art - dues service so now
the reason we did this is now I can go
to finishing items or finished items we
can do - dues and set scoped items
equals - dues items save that controller
and what we do now is in finished items
here you see how we had that ng-repeat
item in items which changed this content
to item title and as we preview you can
see we get these same two items in our
finished items so they're in both pages
now obviously we don't want both of
these in both places as one we have mark
finished and the other we do not so what
we're going to do is we're going to add
another directive to this list item
ng-show for if item dot finished equals
true okay we're going to preview that
and now we should only see the one that
is actually fit
so let's go back to our to Do's
unfinished page and also add an ng-show
here for if item dot finished
equals false now as we preview that
change you can see now item 1 is in our
to do list and item 2 is in our finished
items and as we switch between those two
tabs we can see we maintain that now
obviously we want people to be able to
complete items and another feature of
coding that I want to show off to you
guys is our brand new route parameters
so what we're going to do here is we are
going to add a page just a blank page
and we are going to call this page item
and we'll just name it
to-do item here and then what we're
going to do is we are going to say that
this page has a route parameter so this
parameter we're just going to call item
ok
and now what happens is when I go over
to - duze oh and you know what we're
going to need to give these a fake ID
since we're not connected to any
database yet I just want to make sure
that this has an ID of 1 this has an ID
of 2 we're going to save that and now we
are going to do link okay so we're in
the art - duze page here's our item
right and we're going to link it up to
the to-do item page and it immediately
knows look I need this item parameter so
we can use direct value here or a
template string so right now I'm going
to do item dot dollar ID just because
that's what firebase uses and we'll be
integrating that later and then I am
going to go to finished items and also
link this up to to-do item item dot ID
ok and now what happens is when I
preview this and we click on this one
you can see we go to a to-do item now we
didn't put any information in here yet
and that's because we haven't accessed
the variable so we're going to go to our
to-do item and
you can see we default includes state
parameters here so this means is we are
now going to have scope item ID equal to
state params item so that dot item right
here directly links to the item route
parameter that we're passing through for
each of those buttons so now since we're
not hooked up to firebase and we don't
want to do anything crazy yet we are
just going to throw a paragraph in here
and have this paragraph say item ID okay
and we will preview that oh and check
this out so if you preview something
that needs a page parameter and you
haven't passed the one because there's
no navigation it's going to ask you to
put one in so right now let's just do
three save params and now you can see we
are going to not get that three because
I did not save our controller so now
that we saved our controller preview
it's going to remember that three we
typed in save params and now we'll get
the three there so now the cool part is
if I go over to - dues and preview our
to do is page this was test item 1 we
click it we get it 1 we go to our
finished items test item 2 we click it
we get it - so that ID has been
dynamically passed through the list item
through state Bram's and into this new
controller now in order for us to get
functionality like adding and removing
these or completing them and uncompleted
them things like that we're going to rig
up firebase so we can get this back by
some real time data and also give us
some lookup functions so we can actually
turn this item ID into a real item from
firebase that we can then edit that's
all in the next phase
alright everybody it is time for phase 3
which means integrating firebase
directly into your to-do app and getting
that cert to do service we made hugged
up to firebase with a list synced
directly to their database so the first
thing we're going to want to do is we're
going to want to actually set up
firebase in our app so to do that we are
going to go to firebase google.com we're
going to go over to the docs site here
libraries
and angularfire you are going to click
that little link and it is going to
bring up their angularfire github which
is where all their documentation is
located now if we go down to getting
started you're going to see some
instructions on how to download
angularfire
so the first thing we need is angular
obviously creator already includes
angular but we do need firebase and
angular fire so we are going to copy
these two URLs they give us going to go
over to creator and open up the external
j/s pop-up down here ok we are going to
pop in that firebase j/s we are going to
come back over here and grab angularfire
copy that over to external as well pop
that in there personally I like moving
these all the way to the top of the list
just so we can kind of maintain an order
in our export here all right so we've
got firebase we've got angular fire
we've got the stuff we already created
here now let's look at the next
instruction here we can go over to their
quick start okay and the first thing we
need to do here I'm actually going to
jump to step four and then we'll do step
three so step four is include the
firebase module in your app here so what
we're going to want to do is go here go
to angular modules include firebase and
then the other thing we're going to want
to do is firebase is now included in our
main module which is that app okay but
because we didn't include app dot and
our to do service we're also going to
want to put firebase here so now we have
access to that firebase service in both
locations now we also need to initialize
the firebase SDK now you can see you
know it wants all these variables and
things like that
so if we go back to firebase google.com
you can go to your own console here and
I've already created an app for this
all right so I've got this testing to do
app and we can see here let's see if is
it going to allow us to pull this up
here project settings going to look
around sorry I did this once I'm not
quite sure where the actual link is okay
so okay project settings you can do add
firebase to your web app and it is going
to give you this section of code so now
what we're going to do is we are going
to copy this code right here this
initialize firebase okay we're going to
go back to creator what we're going to
do in our firebase service here is we're
going to do a dot run okay and this dot
run is a function that runs immediately
when our app is set up so this would be
a good place for us to get this config
in here so that it runs when our app is
started we do firebase 10 initialize
with all of our settings and it works
splendidly so now if we're going to be
working code a little bit let me make
this a little bit bigger now the first
thing we're going to want to do is get
this service actually backed by firebase
so we are going to comment out our bar
items dummy data that we included and
we're going to start out here by taking
this and inserting our firebase array
and then we are going to do VAR f equals
firebase database ref dot child to Do's
so this is doing is it's are taking our
main database location and looking for a
child call to dues and creating a
reference to that now that isn't
actually synced or anything like that so
we're going to want to do var items
equals firebase array that ref now this
firebase array is what is going to give
us a real time erase sync directly to
firebase so we have item set to items
again we're going to redo that to do we
are going to hit save and if I rigged
everything up correctly this means we
should start seeing some real data
all right so there we go took a second
but we load our data from firebase add a
new item here testing some finished
items we have four different finished
items that were already populated in
this database okay so that's step one we
populated some stuff from our actual
database we can remove that dummy data
now we need to add two different
functions to this to do services well
we're going to want to add item we're
going to want to pass that a title and
we're going to want to set finished
we're it's going to accept a new value
here this one's super easy so we're just
going to take item dot finished equals
the new value and we're going to do
items to save item and so what this is
doing is we're going to pass an actual
firebase object to this set finished and
it's going to say items this synched
firebase thing dot save that actual item
we passed to it and we're just all we
did was change the value finished now
for adding an item we're going to do
something a little bit similar we are
going to do items dollar add and for
that we're going to do title is the
title we pass to it and we are going to
do finished it is false so everything is
going to start as false there okay well
all right so that looks good to me now
our service should be rigged up to
firebase should be able to add and
remove things but we don't have any UI
for that yet so let's first of all
create a modal inside of our regular two
dues to add a new item now the cool
thing now that we have full JavaScript
support is that you can go straight to
our attic framework Docs and start using
some of our JavaScript stuff that might
not be included directly in creator yet
like modal's so I'm going to copy over
some code here from something I already
wrote this is literally almost taken
exactly from our documentation okay and
we are going to want to do scoped data
equals title this is just a little
function to hold a temporary title for
something all right so let's run through
this was taken directly from our
documentation so we do attic modal now I
didn't include that yet so let's include
an attic modal just so this doesn't blow
up from template and we have a string
template we just have a header it's got
a close button attitude ooh we've got
some content it's got an input with a
button calling add item okay show modal
just going to show that modal that we
just made up here close modal we'll set
the title back to empty and add item is
going to do to do add item that
temporary title and then close the modal
okay now that's all fine and dandy but
we still don't have any UI to actually
add this in so let's throw up a button
and let's make this button look good so
let's take this here and I want to
change that style we're going to do full
width I want to do an outline style I
want to make it green and we are going
to have it say add item and then down
here and that angular directive sections
we are going to do ng click equals show
modal that function that we had to
actually open this model we created in
our code so let's cross our fingers
preview this okay we've got our two
items we've got our add item dialog okay
now we are going to do a new item that
says new demo item we're going to hit
submit and that new demo item is showed
up and synced directly from firebase we
could also hit closed that would have
cleared out any data that we had put in
here now that new demo item is now going
to be persistent since its put in
firebase so if we go back to build and
we go back to preview okay that new demo
item is still there now we want to make
it so we got our firebase ID here we
want to make this firebase ID actually
pull in the title of that to-do item
that we clicked so we are going to go to
our to-do item thing here okay and here
is where we were going to want to use
this item ID to actually get something
from firebase so we're going to do
scoped
item equal to dou Z dot items now here
it's going to get a little weird - duze
dot items dot index for state params
item okay so that's literally giving us
the actual firebase object for that ID
okay
so let's take that hit save and then in
that item here instead of item ID we now
want to change this to say item dot
title so now when we go to our - dues
page when you preview that and we click
on that new demo item we created we will
not get anything because we didn't
actually what do we do wrong here oh we
didn't include - dues in our to-do item
portent because we're referencing it
here so now we will go preview this wait
for them to load new demo item and we
get new demo items now there's a
reference to that actual firebase object
straight inside of this controller so we
want to utilize our toggle finished is a
function okay and there we're going to
do if scoped item dot finished we're
going to want to do to do is that set
finished scope that item to false
otherwise we are going to take to do set
finished scoped item is set to true so
now we're just going to create a all
this thing did was toggle it from true
or false depending on whether or not the
item is true or false so we're going to
want to do here is have two different
buttons actually so let's just drag to
over all at once okay and the one of
these buttons is going to be to say I
completed this yay okay and this one
let's see here we can give this theme
balanced right
okay let's maybe give it an icon thumbs
up put it on the left there then this
button we are going to do sad day
this actually isn't done okay in that
one let's do I own said put it on the
left again and this one we will make red
okay that's great so now we've got these
two buttons but the thing is they don't
actually do anything yet so we're going
to want to add two directives to each of
these ng-click is going to be toggle
finished then we're also going to want
ng show for this one is item dad
finished equals pulse on this one we
will add those same directives ng click
is toggle finished and ng show is going
to be item dot finished equals true
alright so hopefully we see only one of
these buttons depending on what item we
have here
okay so add a new item here we only see
I completed this because we are in the
uncompleted page finished items we only
see the sad day this actually isn't done
so what we're going to do here is we're
going to go to to dues do new demo item
I completed this yay the button
immediately changed because we updated
that variable in firebase and we're
going to go over here new demo item is
now in the finish items list set day
this actually isn't done in that new
demo item is back in the regular list so
all that's accomplished with this simple
to do service that we backed by firebase
all we did was get that list set it up
as a firebase array included in items
have that add item function and then
update the object however we want in
this case we just set it to finished you
could for instance here at a note to
your to-do items or even multiple notes
but here we just set finished equal to
true or false and save it back to your
thing so our full app is now a working
to do list where you can add items
remove items it uses our route
parameters feature it's all fully sync
to firebase we even have JavaScript
modal's going on with some very nice
purple styles coming from our theme
support so all that we ran through in a
little less than 20 minutes here I hope
you guys enjoy the new coding feature
please let us know if you have any
questions and share whatever you guys
make in the comment section below
I will catch you guys later this
tutorial showed you how to use
everything in custom code support but it
just brushes the surface of what it's
really possible feel free to share what
you've made in the comments thanks for
tuning in I'll catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
