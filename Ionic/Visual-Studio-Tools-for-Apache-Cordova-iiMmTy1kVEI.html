going to look at the visual studio 2015
update and how they make working with
hybrid apps a lot easier on Windows
Visual Studio released a toolset for
Cordova projects that allow you to get
everything you need installed and
configured automatically this makes
setup a whole lot easier since you're
not downloading things individually and
then manually adding them to your path
we can let visual studio handle that for
us I already have my environment set up
but if we take a look at the Installer
we can see what options we have using
the free community edition of Visual
Studio we can select cross-platform
mobile development select Pachi Cordova
and have the Cordova CLI installed for
us then I can come down here to the
common tools and SDKs and I can select
everything that I'm going to need
specifically the Android SDK the various
build tools for all the different
versions of Android Java and then
finally no Jess additionally we can come
down to the common tools and install
things such as git for Windows and the
github extension for Visual Studio now
I'm not going to run the installer again
since I already have everything set up
and configured so I can come quit this
and come over to a brand new command
prompt I can check to see that I have no
installed as well as Cordova I already
went ahead and installed the ioniq so we
can check that as well and get the
latest version of the CLI now we can
start a new project I'm just going to
call it temp and use the default
template of tabs this will go out and
fetch everything for me from here the
development process would be the exact
same as if you're on a Mac or even a
Linux
everything is already configured for you
so you can go ahead and start adding
Android and working with the Android
emulator you could stay inside a visual
studio for all your development you
could hop over to Visual Studio code and
use the CLI or you can use whatever
editor you'd like the big win is that
you are all set up to start working with
Cordova and all the tools that you
needed were configured for you
automatically
there was no extra step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
