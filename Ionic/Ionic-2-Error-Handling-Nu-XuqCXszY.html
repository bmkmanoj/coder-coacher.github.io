super excited to share with you a new
feature that we recently launched in
ionic app scripts and also a sneak peek
of an upcoming feature that is similar
but different that I think you're going
to love and that I'm incredibly excited
about so first of all before I get into
it
ionic app scripts it is our new build
script package and if you're familiar
with with how we used to ship a gulp
file with ionic 1 and I had a - for a
bit
ionic app scripts basically takes that
gulp file in you know in theory and
makes an NPM package so we can update it
separately from all your projects we can
work on it without having to like tell
you to up create new projects and all
this stuff and we introduced this with
our C 0 and it was frankly we had some
other problems with it and I'm really
sorry about about that but the really
cool thing about it and we had this
vision for Apps scripts was once we kind
of got you know everything and all the
apps using it we could update and add
really cool new features to the ionic
build chain without having to have you
guys do anything except NPM it's sauce
so we're starting to really hit our
stride adding tons of cool new features
into the build chain and here are some
of the really cool ones so right now
when we with the recent release of Apps
scripts we added build feedback and
basically what that means is when I'm
working on my app and I'm writing stuff
like okay I have a console log here and
I saved I'll get a toast my app is
building and this is basic feedback from
the Apps Script server saying that we
transpiled we've bonded with webpack
it's we're good to go
so it's nice to kind of know while I'm
working that you know everything is is
working underneath you know like the
universe is alright
so every time I say if I get a bill to
update and and so that's that's cool so
this works for sass HTML and typescript
which is fun so I love the new build
feedback but the cool thing is to is
you mess something up you'll get even
more feedback so let's say I go into my
login page and I just do window.top
Lodge it's not valid type script window
is not a type that exists why it's not a
type on window
so you'll notice I got this really cool
air feedback basically app scripts is
telling me that there's a types of air
it went and highlighted the line in the
file told me where the file is and then
also printed me diagnostic informations
about what version of I on a framework
I'm using what version of ionic native
etc etc so this helps you pinpoint
errors and also copy/paste ins either
file an issue in your tracker or you
know god forbid it's an actual ionic bug
file it on our issue report so this
should really help you kind of narrow
down issues without having to go oh I've
got to go back to my CLI and look okay
there's an arrow here and that's
translated it's all within the
development flow you never have to leave
your app so we can close that if we want
and kinda get back to work so that's
build time errors and this also works
for not only type script but SAS so
let's say I have an actual SAS error if
something's up alex has immediately get
feedback that this property needs to be
followed by a colon or something I guess
whatever it doesn't make any sense but
snuff out immediate asks feedback for
errors I can also do it for templates
too so if I miss a tag and exactly I'll
get a runtime error that there's
template parse error so angular 2 is a
little more strict about templates so
this is really helpful because sometimes
you'll have an error like this you'll
refresh you have a blank screen and you
won't know what's going on your you've
been frustrated by it trust us we've
been frustrated by that so we're fixing
it one more really cool thing this
hasn't been launched yet hasn't been
launched yet where we're launching in
the next app scripts in the next ionic
because you need to add some code to
ionic to override angular's error
handler but let's say you have an actual
runtime error this is an error that
isn't caught during build time so
typescript doesn't know that it's
actually
it's it's happening at run time and for
example let's do window as any so it
becomes an any type we try to run a
function on it it's valid typescript but
it doesn't run so before as many of you
know you would get this wonderful blank
screen and be like you know what's going
on this is like so annoying I don't know
what's going on especially if that's
happening in an app on your phone like
you'll have a blank screen and not know
why so you know how will actually tell
you why it's because window dot bla is
not a function dude and then you'll go
and fix it so I'm really excited about
this one
we with this change coming will have
both builds feedback build errors in
runtime errors and this is something
we're gonna continue to improve but I
hope it saves you a ton of time and
you'll notice like I haven't had to
leave this session at all I've got my
text editor here and I've got my login
page over here we're just really trying
to make all your development stuff super
agile so you can work really quickly get
things done really quickly that's what
we're all about so stay tuned for this
and let me know what you think about the
build errors I and I hope to get this in
your hands soon thanks oh I almost
forgot
one extra thing that's coming soon as
well is a debug mating so we've got this
cool new debug menu that like let's say
you just kind of need to refresh your
app this isn't as useful in the in the
browser obviously because I just have a
reload button or a refresh button but in
an app you can actually shake your phone
and this debug menu will pop up and you
reload your app so we're gonna be adding
more stuff that menu but that'll be a
really fast way to kind of quickly like
okay something's not right or I made a
change I just need to reload it so
that's really cool that's all I got bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
