team and you're watching our weekly
workshop this week we're going to make a
searchable video library app that uses
lots of different features one of the
biggest things we're going to do today
actually doesn't really have anything to
do with the fact that we're making a
video lamp so I recommend watching all
the way through if you want to learn how
to make our search component actually
search through data that you have in
your app so today we're doing search
component we're using route parameters
and we're going to tie all that in with
a list of YouTube videos that you can
put in your app we also support Vimeo
but you could you know support kind of
any video content that you want to use
so the first thing we're gonna do is we
are going to start a new project and we
are gonna call this video library and
we're just going to start with blank
here do something a little simple and we
are gonna change the header color to
let's do red YouTube uses red that's a
good video color right okay so this page
what we want to start doing is this page
we're going to have all of our tutorial
videos so let's call tutorials okay and
then what we are going to do is copy
over some code that we actually kind of
use in creator which is a service that
shows us all the videos that we have all
of our tutorial content so you can find
this at github dot use creator com and
that's going to take you to our github
where you can open them making a
searchable video library section here
and open tutorials j/s and i'm just
going to do raw it's easier to copy and
paste here and we'll talk about what
this is in just a second here so we're
gonna start by creating tutorials j/s
over here and then we have to go to code
settings so here's this module right
let's paste in the content we just took
and that module is tutorials so we have
to make sure in our code settings that
we actually include the tutorials module
in our angular modules in order to
import this code we just wrote into our
actual app so tutorials is listed in our
angular modules and we have tutorials as
the module name in tutorials j/s which
is an other JavaScript file that we
added to our app now let's make this big
and talk about it for a second so this
starts off with a service that is our
tutorial service and its main job is
going to be able to just store in for me
about the tutorials okay so we start off
by having a variable that's a list so
each list item here has a key that's
easily accessible so here's our Creator
deep dive video with the key just deep
dive a description and in-depth overview
of the new Creator and then the YouTube
ID of the actual video and we do that
for all the tutorial content now we also
might want these accessible via this
easy key instead of being you know in a
list format so I also set up an object
called tutorial keys we loop through the
whole list and just set tutorial keys
toggling content equal to this whole
object and we do that for every single
tutorial then we're going to return this
service as a list of the list we made
and keys the keys we made so this kind
of just gets us to ways to look at our
tutorial video content you can set up
whatever kind of object you'd like with
/ whatever kind of data you'd like none
of this really matters this is just the
data we're going to use today and we're
going to search through both the name
and the description field alright so
let's go back to our tutorials page here
and let's do two things let's move over
our search component okay and then let's
drag over a list and the reason I
dragged over a list is creator likes to
be smart I actually want a thumbnail
list item if I drag over a thumbnail
list item here it's actually going to
append it to the form but I wanted these
things to be two separate things so
dragged over a list I'm gonna kill two
of the items and then we are going to
change this to a thumbnail and we're
gonna repeat this thumbnail based on the
tutorials so let's go back down to our
tutorials page controller and let's make
sure to inject the tutorial service that
we use now you see that's capital
tutorials because over here we're
injecting these service not the module
so include tutorials right and we are
going to do a couple different things
here okay so first of all let's do scope
dot narrowed tutorials equals tutorials
dot lists
okay and narrow tutorials the reason I
called it narrowed down is because we're
going to narrow it based on this search
container but
right now let's just get some content in
here and then we'll work on narrowing it
down so on our list item we are going to
want to add in here let's make this
small we are going to want to actually
don't want my video covering it up so
angular directives
let's do ng-repeat
let's do for tutorial in narrowed
tutorials okay so this is going to
repeat this list item we get the
tutorial so up here in content we can do
template tags tutorial that name on line
two we can do template tags tutorial
description and we are going to want to
allow word wrap on that description okay
now for the thumbnail normally you know
in your service you probably have like a
square image I didn't want to go through
and get square images for all of our
tutorials so I'm gonna you know take the
image right from YouTube it's going to
squish it a little bit because the
YouTube images are rectangles like I
said if you want square images just you
know add an image field to this service
and make sure that you have square
images so let me pull up here the URL
for this image so we're gonna switch the
image upload thumbnail to a text input
I'm gonna pay something in here which is
a YouTube URL with a max res default
thumbnail that they give us with
template tags tutorial dot and remember
dot ID is the YouTube ID so we're gonna
get a youtube video URL straight into
our thumbnail image so as you can see we
get a URL here that's nothing because
YouTube we don't actually have tutorial
that ID set to anything yet okay so
let's save this whole thing make sure
our code down here is saved
like setting arrow tutorials is going to
get loop through and hopefully populate
this so there we go we have all of our
tutorials listed here with their
slightly squished YouTube thumbnail the
name in the description so now let's
move on and start to get this search
field to work so we're going to want to
do a couple different things here the
first thing we're going to want to do is
set up scope data equals search which is
a blank string okay and we're going to
tie that
via ngmodel to our search component so
we're going to do data dot search as the
value there then what we're gonna want
to do is we're going to want to kick off
a search function every time that
changes so let's do scope dot search
equals function save that and over here
we're going to go back to our search
component and do ng change search and
double parenthesis so it actually calls
the function so every time the model
that it's attached to changes it's going
to call this scope dot search function
now in scope dot search we are going to
have a little bit of fun here so the
first thing I want to do is set s equal
to scope data to search to lowercase now
the reason we're doing two lowercase is
actually because you know if the
tutorial name has capital letters like a
capital the word creator we don't have
to requite we don't want to require
people to type in capital letters in
their search we want the search to be
case insensitive so throughout this
entire search function we're gonna make
sure everything is to lowercase so that
case doesn't actually matter when you're
running the search alright now we're
gonna do if s equals nothing we are
going to just literally take this scope
dot narrowed results set it to the
overall tutorial dot list and do a
return so if you've back spaced and
cleared your search this is going to set
it back to the original entirety of the
list now if we're past that that means
you have some search text so we can set
scope dot narrowed tutorials to
something else we're going to set that
to tutorials dot list dot filter and
with filter we're gonna pass it a
function and that function gets each
individual item from the list passed to
it now the way dot filter works is
you're going to return true or false
based on whether or not you want the
item for that iteration specifically
return to the new list so it's going to
call this function on repeat for every
item in the list and then it's going to
return a new list that we're going to
set to that narrow tutorials so in here
we are going to do if something if our
search matches we're going to return
true and if we didn't get past that
we're going to return false at the
bottom so let's write our search here
now you can have your search work any
way that you want like I said we're
gonna search through lowercase name and
description you might have keywords you
might have any other number of things
that you want to search through this is
where you write the code and return true
to do that so we're going to do tutorial
dot name to lowercase dot index of s our
search term is greater than negative one
which means we found that search term in
the name somewhere it's got a position
in the string of zero or more or we're
going to do tutorial dot description
that to lowercase that index of s is
greater than negative one to search that
description field so now whenever this
data dot search model changes were going
to call search and set narrow tutorials
to a different list so if I just typed
everything correctly we should preview
this and see that as we type our list is
going to change so let's search for this
deep dive by just searching for the word
deep so as you can see we're starting to
change already de e you know we got only
the deep dive there so our search is
fully functional now based on name and
description but we probably want each of
these things to when you click them go
to a separate page to actually view the
tutorial video so let's rig that up so
let's add a new page blank here and
let's call this page tutorial singular
tutorial ok and in here we are going to
want to set a route parameter called
video key no default because there's
never going to be like a default state
for this we're always going to want to
pass it some information now in the
controller for the specific tutorial
we're going to want to inject the
tutorial service and set scope that
tutorial equal to tutorials dot keys and
then we're going to take in state params
dot video key now the state params dot
video key what that links to is the
route parameter video key that we're
going to pass to it so we're just doing
that key based lookup and setting the
video strictly to that so now let's do a
couple different things here before I
get fancy let's
just dragging a paragraph and let's
whoops let's set this paragraph to video
dot description and let's do something
weird now
creator doesn't necessarily support
template tags in the title of the pages
because we generate the state and the
routes and all this stuff from your
title but that doesn't mean we can't
override the title of the page so I
actually don't want the title of this
page to say tutorial I want the title of
this page to say the name of the video
so let's go down to angular directives
and add a title as a directive which is
just a standard ionic property that you
put on an ion view and let's set that to
video name and let's open up our
directives view here and make sure that
that title is actually set on ion view
we're gonna save and close so what
should happen now is when somebody
visits this page and sends a video key
is a route parameter it's going to set
the title of the page to that video dot
name and show the video description so
let's go back and actually link up this
list item so we're going to link it up
to the tutorial page where the video key
is going to be this tutorial dot key
okay we can use template tags in those
so now when we preview we're gonna be
able to click on you know let's just
pick a let's pick forms we're gonna pick
forms and nothing happened because we
messed up so let's open up our inspect
here console console was cleared now
what did we do wrong okay tutorial dot
key was past tutorial is here video
description up we set scope dot tutorial
down here instead of scoped up video
like we've been using so let's do scoped
out video in our controller double check
that we have video description double
check down here that we use video name
alright that makes sense so let's go
back to our list preview and how that
we're setting the right variables we can
click forms and we will see forms here
and the description so this you know we
click a different one I click custom
code support cuz of code support the
description for that so now let's go
back to our tutorial page here and let's
drag over our video component now this
video component and you know what let's
actually get a little bit of space in
here let's move a spacer in between
these and said that spacer to ten
pixels now this video it's always going
to show default in preview but let's
choose YouTube here and we have that
YouTube ID that YouTube ID is video dot
ID here so video component YouTube we're
passing the video ID now when we preview
our app and we click on creator deep
dive it should load that video straight
from YouTube if we go back and choose
Google Maps component it should load
that video straight from YouTube so now
we're completely up and running with a
dynamic tutorial list using the Creator
tutorials or whatever tutorials you'd
like to throw in your video app where
you can search through name and
description or whatever fields you'd
like to program otherwise and open those
up with our video components using route
parameters to a detailed page so we
covered a lot of good stuff I'm hoping
this was useful to you guys yet again
we're always looking for more ideas for
our weekly workshops so let us know if
you have any until then I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
