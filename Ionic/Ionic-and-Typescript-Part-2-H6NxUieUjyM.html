build step to compile type skip down to
regular JavaScript now let's look at how
we can start to use typescript type
annotation system in that same code and
get code completion inside of our editor
typescript adds static types to code
using what they call definition files
these provide interfaces for many
libraries and adds code hinting inside
of the editor
to add these definition files we can use
a popular community project called
definitely tight
the project has definitions for a large
number of libraries and frameworks as
well as a CLI tool for managing them
let's install the definition files for
ionic and Cordova inside of our terminal
let's check to make sure that we have
the TST module installed if not install
it globally on your machine
then the install process works like any
package manager would
now that creates a TST JSON file which
is similar to a package.json for a node
it also adds a Taipings directory with
all the types we need for our project
since ionic is built on angular TSD
knows that we need the angular
definitions so it adds them as well this
makes managing those files a lot easier
now we need to add a reference point to
those definition files so let's open up
our editor TSD creates a base file for
you to reference this way you can
install any more definitions at a later
time you're not having to update all of
your code it will just update the base
file with these new definitions let's
add a reference path to that definition
file so let's go to our dash controller
and let's inject dollar ionic loading
now to annotate it we can type Cohen
ionic dot loading ionic loading service
if you're wondering where we're getting
this from you can check out the actual
definition file for ionic and see all
the available interfaces
now when we type ionic loading inside of
our - controller and hit the dot we can
get a list of all the valid methods for
loading
we can also start to annotate all of our
angular code as well such as scope
dollar HTTP and many more
in the next video we'll look at how we
can set up our code to use classes
instead of regular controllers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
