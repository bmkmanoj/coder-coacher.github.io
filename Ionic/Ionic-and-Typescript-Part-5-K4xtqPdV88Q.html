final lesson we're going to take our
ionic 1 app that's written in typescript
and convert it over to an ionic 2 F
first we're gonna grab the latest beta
CLI for ionic which adds all D necessary
build steps for creating an ionic 2 app
we'll come over to our terminal and run
npm install - g ionic at beta now
depending on how you have npm setup you
may need to run this command with sudo
in front of NPM install and enter in
your computer's password now from here
we'll CD into our high onic typescript
example and then we'll open this up
inside of our editor
from here we'll head back to our CLI and
we'll open up a new tab and head back to
the same directory and then we can start
a new project running ionics start B two
tabs and we're going to use the tabs
template and pass it the v2 flag to
tellus Elie we want a v2 version of the
project and we'll use the TS flag to
tell the CLI that we want to use
typescript
we'll CD into our project and then we'll
open this up inside of our editor back
in our terminal we'll start our server
like we always do running ionic serve
and we can see that we have a familiar
project with a tab bar at the bottom
three separate tabs all with icons and a
navigation bar with a title now I'm not
going to go over how to convert the
entire project but what we're gonna do
is create a class to load all of our
data and then we're gonna display that
data and be able to view a detail page
about each object in our array now
inside of our editor we're going to look
inside of our app directory and we're
gonna create a new folder we're just
going to call this services and inside
of there we'll create a new file which
we're just going to call chats dot TS
now inside of our chats TS file we're
going to create a class and we're just
gonna call this chats and we can go over
to our first project that we had look at
our services and we can actually copy
most of our constructor function and all
the methods that we have
now the last thing that we need to do is
we need to come up to the top of our
file and we need to tell angular that we
want this class to be injected into our
app so we're going to write import and
we're gonna import from angular 2 and
we're just gonna pull in from core and
what we're going to import is called
injectables so let's annotate our chat
service with at injectable and we can
finish this off now that our code knows
it needs to be injected let's open up
our app that TS and import that service
that we just created now we need to tell
our app decorator that we're going to
have a service available to us so we're
going to add a provider's property and
this is going to be an array of classes
so we'll just add chats now that we have
chat setup inside of our app decorator
let's open up page one TS now inside
here we're going to import that same
chat service and we'll come down to our
constructor and inject a new public
chats and this is going to be the chats
that we just imported and then we can
create a new property called messages
and it's going to equal this chats dot
all now to see the results of this
request we will open up our page one dot
HTML and we're just a near rid of some
of this
and we're going to create a list and
inside this list we're going to have an
eye on item and we're gonna use angular
2's new and g4 and we're gonna say for
each message of the messages array that
we have on our class and we can just say
message dot name and we'll save go back
to our browser and we'll have all the
data loaded now to see the detail page
of each one of these objects we'll come
over to our page and we'll create a
click handler using angular's new event
syntax and we're gonna call push page
and we're just gonna pass in the message
variable that we've declared here to say
when we push the page we want to pass
along this entire object now we're gonna
head back to our page 1 dot es file and
we're going to import nav controller and
we'll come down to our constructor
create a new public variable and then
we'll create a new method on our class
called push page it's gonna take the
message that we've passed along and
we're just gonna called this dot NAB
push and we're gonna push a detail page
that we haven't created yet now along
with pushing the detail page we can pass
along some parameters telling the detail
page what kind of information it should
have so we're gonna pass it in object
and this object is going to have a
property of message on it and its value
is going to be set to the message
variable that we are passing in here now
to finish this up we're going to come up
to the top of our file again we're going
to import a detail class from detail
and detail page I'm gonna open up my
sidebar and I'm gonna create a new
folder I'm going to call it detail and
inside there I'm going to create a new
file called detail dot TS and detail dot
HTML so we'll start off in the detail
dot TS file and I'm just going to copy
all of this over and I'm just going to
update this to reflect the details page
and I'm going to import nav params and
create a new public variable then we're
gonna come down
instructor create a new property called
this detail and this is going to equal
this stop params and we're going to get
the property of message I'll make sure I
update the class name to detail save
this and then I'll go over to detailed I
HTML and I'm going to create an eye on
navbar and this is just going to point
to a local reference of navbar inside of
our global app and this is going to have
an eye on title whose value is going to
be detailed dot name and then we can
come down here and write and I'm content
and inside of this I'm just gonna create
a pre tag and pass in the detail and
then pipe it over to the JSON format err
and then we'll go over to our browser
and we should be able to navigate around
let's load the data inside of our
content for this specific user and then
be able to navigate back and have that
data update every single time we go to a
new page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
