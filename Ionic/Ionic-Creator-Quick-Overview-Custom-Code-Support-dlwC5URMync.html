and today I want to talk with you about
my favorite feature and creator Pro
custom code support now custom code
support isn't just one feature it's
actually a collection of features that
allow you to build a fully dynamic app
using creator now the biggest thing
about this is we give you full access to
edit every pages controller including
dependencies and scope variables this
lets you really create dynamic
functionality with all of our existing
components on top of that you can also
include any built in angular or custom
directives on our components as well as
template tags anywhere you can type text
now let's say you want to take it to the
next step we also allow you to use route
parameters so you now have the ability
to pass additional information to a page
when navigating to it which you can then
have access to in that pages controller
we also allow you to include both
external and internal JavaScript which
you can then use to include any library
or dependency that you want on top of
that let's say you have a component in
creator that you'd like to modify
further than we allow with our built-in
properties you can now convert that
component to HTML to have full control
over it we also have built-in theming
support where you can change the header
color as well as any other theming
change with s CSS support that you'd
like for your app now all of this also
works in creator mobile so as you're
working on the desktop version of
creator you can be previewing your
changes live right on your phone on top
of that once you use creator package to
make an actual native IPRA APK file we
give you the option to add Cordova
plugins such as camera support straight
to your app now if you want additional
information about everything I just
talked to feel free to click the
tutorial link below to get more
information thanks for watching and I'll
catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
