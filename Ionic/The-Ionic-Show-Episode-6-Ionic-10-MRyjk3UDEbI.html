another Bionic show my name is Ben and
I'm x + 1 point 0 is out so we're going
to get into that blossom to do a QA I
posted on the forum a couple weeks ago
maybe a couple months ago ah asking for
you guys as questions and and said we
would answer them so we're going to
answer most of them today so we're going
to get into that whilst going to talk
about the antic playground which is a
new tool that we just released this week
it's awesome allows you to code iono
caps in the browser it's really really
cool we're also going to talk about
ionic and visual studio a new
integration that we're really excited
about and then the I like shop there's
no way to get swag and then last but not
least definitely a lot not least yeah
beer we're talk all about beer so stay
tuned for that let's get the show
started all right i'll point out oh it's
here made it survived we're alive cheers
to that here's to that sir one point oh
it's really really big deal it is and
we're super excited about it so let's
let's talk about it what what are we
getting with one point out well the
biggest thing about 1 point 0 is that
there's not a whole lot of new stuff but
it's super super stable and I think
that's something that we need to talk
about like we've it's been in several 5
release candidates have come out and
during most of those really what the
core team has been working on and has
been working super super hard on is no
cleaning up all the like remaining
little bugs or things that you know were
quite working right improving
performance you know we've been working
really really hard to make sure that
this version the last version this one
point 0 is just the most stable version
possible all right it's just going to
work we fix a ton of bugs you know we
polished a bunch of little issues and
it's ready for everyone to use yes which
is awesome we we could talk about a few
things in it a few news
yes so one of the one of the big things
we've done is we've added a native
scrolling is finally ready to be used
for most apps if you're not using
collection repeat native scrolling will
add a ton of performance to your abs
especially on Android especially on
Android right basically we don't use
JavaScript scrolling if you enable it
you can do you know really long list you
know fast-growing everything's a lot
faster so definitely check out the
native scrolling in one point out and
not to drive the point home any further
but if you're using an Android device
try out native swelling yeah it's so
awesome please for your sake and ours
and ours so some windows phone support
oh yeah we scared of the wind yeah we
through the windows phone developers of
bone we hear you we hear all of you you
tell us that you want Windows support
we're working on its it's hard to solve
but we're getting there so one point oh
definitely comes with a lot more windows
windows phone support so I think you're
going to really really like that um
we're really excited about it i mean i
think that the thing about one point 0
is that there really isn't that like you
said that much to really yeah we want to
make sure that like we got a simple
release out that was stable polished so
we can start focusing on what's next
some crazy stuff ahead so you could you
could rely on this version we can go and
work on some some more experimental
things exactly and we have a lot of
exciting experimental things in store
right so we will be doing a ton of post
about one point 0 so this is not the
last you'll hear about it but definitely
check it out especially if you are
waiting because it was in beta r see
like now is the time to use ionic for
sure oh and support for it we will we
will be supporting one point out for a
long time yeah so yeah just so that's
clear um okay I think we can we can get
into the QA yeah because there's a lot
to get into I feel like we just wanted
to talk about one point I'll make sure
we celebrated a bit and and went through
everything that's new trust me we're
celebrating we are celebrating so let's
let's get into the question answers yes
so I posted on the forum a little while
ago and I basically asked you guys
what do you want to know like what
questions do you have for us we'll hang
out and answer that and go through them
so are you ready yeah I'm ready I'm
ready all right let's do it all right
first question should you provide some
stickers t-shirts for people will make
presentations on program or conferences
about I own so basically will we provide
swag for people to distribute at
conferences yeah or people who go and
speak about on behalf of line yes there
are a lot of you who do that so we've
done that before and I think we'd like
to support it where possible I think you
know shirts and stuff are expensive
they're wasteful on the you know
environments we don't like to just print
monster shirts we don't have to but I
think you know we want to send stickers
you know cheaper items that are a little
bit more friendly we'll probably end up
doing more of that but we don't have an
official policy yet but we'll definitely
definitely keep that in mind yeah and if
you are going to be speaking on on ionic
just get in touch with us and shoot us
an email hi at ionic framework calm and
we'll get respond back to me yeah one
thing I just forgot we want to do like
meetup starter packs so if you're
starting a meet-up we want to give you
like a starter pack up swag so that I
think is is probably higher up on the
list right now for us for sure cool jinx
jinx so alright next question is what
are your plans for windows mobile and
other mobile platforms will we see a
common code base that can run
transparently across all major platforms
um kind of went over windows well let me
die cut you off it's a good I'm gonna
cut you off we have when basic basic
windows support is in one point oh so
we're really proud about that and happy
about that but we can do way better and
we can do way more in the future
versions of my yeah I mean you working
on what we have today in Windows Phone
is not like Windows Phone look and feel
so that will come later on but I think
the question about common code base is
more interesting and I can't you know
spill any beans but um we would like to
expand on what ionic and
ooh not just on mobile and not just on
the major platforms so it's definitely
something we're thinking about I don't
have any official information to release
just now but we we are thinking about
how we can pull that off so stay tuned
yeah we have some exciting things in the
works but yep we're not going to let the
cat in there yet so next question any
desktop GUI to replace the command line
no no definitely definitely not never I
don't think that's I don't think that's
something we ever going to do I don't
see that ever happening maybe probably
not ever yeah cool okay uh next question
how have you seen ionic grow in the past
year this is a fun one yeah um it's been
kind of crazy no the framework itself
has reached over 16,000 stars it's
number 37 I think on github most popular
repos we are seeing people download and
install the SDK like over a hundred
thousand times every single month there
have been over 600,000 apps started from
our SDK is just like that it's crazy my
mind yeah we're seeing lots of traffic
to the site the blog is kind of blowing
up so we are kind of blown away I think
ionic is uh is proving that web
developers rule the world and we are so
humbled by all the support all we want
to do is make your life easier and we're
so glad that that's what you want to so
we want to do more of it so it's been a
wild ride I don't think any of us ever
expected to be where we are today and
honestly we won't really be where we are
today without all of you yeah but you
are also the reason why ionic is what it
is and is as successful as it is and
will continue to be so thank you choose
that that's right lots of cute cheering
going on today as well makes up for the
tea from last time that's right sorry I
don't want to talk about that
okay so next question um what part will
be free / charged and what's up with the
backend stuff this is a loaded question
basically if you haven't heard yet we
are building this suite of back-end
services and tools for ionic like the
idea is that we want ionic to do
everything that you needed to do from
the front end to the tooling to services
like push notifications things like that
so we've been working on the push
notification thing we've you know had a
ton of people use it it's it's the most
mature service and we're actually going
to be releasing that soon in a more open
beta so push is really our first major
one you know if people that keep asking
about pricing uh you know we we aren't
really pushing pricing just yet it's
still going to be in beta so can be free
but we are planning on keeping it in
line with a trailer push service for the
most part so I don't think there'll be
any surprises there yeah no surprises
there and I think it's worth mentioning
like you know we're never going to
charge for the framework and I feel like
we sometimes we get that question a lot
like are we going to when are we going
to like flip the switch and make ionic
costs money to use that's never going to
happen we are never going to charge for
SDK with framework it'll always be free
and open source and available to all of
you if we do charge us for kit anyway so
why would we even try there you go so
that's not going to happen so don't
worry about that but the back end stuff
you know what will we are going to
charge for the backups yeah yeah we do
plan to and that's how we'll make money
yeah so we we will announce all that
stuff way ahead of time so right now
everything's just free and we'll keep
you updated cool so I like this question
how performance performance and
performance did they ask about
performance
yes okay performance yeah so performance
is obviously really really important and
I think you know we get acid a lot and
like to be honest like we are the ones
focusing on it more than anyone else
like we are very very focused on
performance so what's on ya what we've
done recently is the native scrolling
stuff so we drop JavaScript scrolling at
least at least as the only option so you
can use the actual native scrolling of
the webview so this is a huge plus on
Android the only downside is if you're
using collection repeat it doesn't work
with native scrolling just yet so if you
want to use collection repeat you'll
you'll need to enable nod the JavaScript
scrolling which is easy to do but beyond
that that will have a huge impact yeah
we've also tightened up a lot of the
animations we are we have improved some
of the you know pull to refresh other
things like that so going forward and
thinking ahead a little bit as we look
at ionic 11.1 and then ionic to in the
future performance is like the number
one concern it's one reason why we're so
excited about angular 2 it's just a lot
faster and it does a lot less so that's
one reason why we are so eager to move
to it because you know being a hybrid
app framework we can use all the
performance we can get so it's our
number one focus and you'll see a lot
more of in the future at the same time
like all the phones are getting faster
so it's it's a good time to be doing
hybrid development and we're incredibly
excited about you know performance
trends that we're seeing on the phones
yeah so to be clear to distill all of
that down we absolutely are always
working and trying to improve
performance we care about it a lot and
it really it's only going to get better
over time so um I think that answers
that was about performance right that
one I think was about perform okay cool
let me answer did I think cool cool good
um so what's the future of ionic I know
this is a very broad question but I
would like to know your plans about
maintaining version 1 point 0 and what
new awesome feature is to point on my
brain
and along with that angularjs stupido so
we kind of just talked a little bit
about that but I could I could basically
give you the lowdown it's just going to
be way faster we're going to add a lot
more platform continuity improvements us
probably to add a lot more windows phone
support although we do already have
someone basic windows phone support
future plans for the framework are
basically just continuing to like we
just talked about improve performance
and again integrate angular 2 we're
already working on a lot of that behind
the scenes right now in terms of
maintaining version 1 point out we did
talk about that earlier I mean we won't
be maintaining one point is the only
version that matters right now it's the
only one people are using it's why
people like ionic so it's the most
important thing to us and that's never
going to change at the same time like
the the space is moving quickly and
angular's been out for what like five
years its exact like okay version 2 is
coming after five years of development
like that's pretty natural and I think
what we're seeing from version 2 is that
it's going to kind of level us all up
with web standards and es6 and we're
going to have object-oriented code it's
going to be a lot easier for people to
write angular apps and ionic gaps which
is the only thing we care about like we
are the we are focused on being the
easiest way to build mobile apps so we
will do whatever it takes to go further
in that direction um I will say that
when it comes to some of the future
plans that we have for the framework I
think we actually want to keep the core
pretty simple and small um you know
where we have a core component set much
like you'd see on the iOS sdk you know
there's only a core set of buttons and a
lot of the custom components are built
from the community well we could talk a
little bit about the add-ons idea yeah
I'm working women so we want to make it
easy to build add-ons build new
components and add them to your app so
we have a simple stable core with a few
solid components that we have now and
then you can add on all these different
components use all these different
templates that's where we want to go so
without fear of potentially upsetting
someone what type of stuff do you think
might not make it into the core version
of ionic 2 point 0 what stuff might make
sense to be an atom because I think
there's a lot of like potential for us
to make ionic more plug and play you
take what you need but it's not this
massive like conglomerate of like
components all like shut together into
one massive thing you know what what
sort of stuff you think might be like no
add honorable I think the slide box is
one where it kind of solves some
people's problems but a lot of people
are looking for like an image carousel
so something like the slide box makes
more sense as a third party component I
think that's kind of the main one you
have a few of these like custom tab
style interfaces that are a little bit
more specific to certain apps tinder
cards things like that those definitely
fit as third-party add-ons and the nice
thing is you can you can work on them in
parallel with the framework where like
if a component has a problem it doesn't
actually break the framework for
everyone else so it improves stability
over the long term which is which is a
really big win umm yeah I'm excited
about yeah I'm really excited about it i
will say last but not least uh we want
ionic to run on a lot more things and
that's all I'm gonna say we have a ton
of plans to go in that direction and I'm
gonna cut you off that yep so next
question is what is your opinion on
react native um I think it's super cool
it makes it easy to build native apps
with JavaScript you know I think it's
going to be quite popular tool a lot of
people going to use it it's well-made
it's got some really interesting
concepts if you're familiar with
titanium appcelerator titanium or native
script or things like that you'll be you
know very familiar with react natives um
I think when it comes to ionic it's
definitely a different vision than we
have it's not a web framework you know
it uses JavaScript but that's kind of
where the similarities end um we are
trying to make it easy to build high
quality apps using the standard web
stack html5 JavaScript and CSS so we
want you know any web developer that
knows how to build websites to be able
to build high quality
apps for the app stores and this is kind
of a departure from that which is which
is totally awesome because they are
validating building apps in custom
third-party SDKs so it's just better for
all of us that they're adding more
validation for not building an iOS app
for not building a android app with Java
it just kind of further proves the point
that nobody wants to do that it's so
stupid to build an objective-c app a
Java app you know a Windows app and have
all these different code bases it just
doesn't make sense so they are a in many
ways we share the same vision in the
aspect least so we have the same vision
in that respect I think how we get there
and the tools that we use are just
different so ionic wants to be the
easiest way for web developers to build
mobile apps and I think we are going to
exist in perfect harmony cool so next
question is how about material design
support yeah so we've been getting a lot
of questions about this we are working
on integrating it and we're doing it
slowly I think it's going to be
something that comes after more
officially comes after one point OS out
yeah the challenge is really that
material design the spec is very very
broad so implementing it perfectly is
difficult and also in flux it's also in
flux so as we are starting to think
about two point oh you know we have to
discuss whether it makes sense to kind
of enhance our current component set
with material design or actually use
something more dramatic like
re-implementation like material design
or ionic material which yeah we should
call out ionic material is an awesome
project that exists right now into euros
ionic material calm I'll double-check
that but uh you can go to it and this is
a guy building it and he's basically
taking ionic component sanic one point o
components and turning them into
material design components so it's still
I onic under the hood but it visually it
looks like ionic material or material
design just double-checking yeah ionic
material comm check it out it's really
awesome we were really
buy it I think when some of the team was
at ng-conf we actually met the guy who's
building it that's snappy yeah it's very
snappy Zach Fitzgerald Fitzgerald hope I
didn't butcher that you butchered it
check it out I think when it comes to
actually ng material we are currently
trying to fix some issues with gesture
support between the two projects and
we'll see what happens there no timeline
yet but you know I think when it comes
to ionic 2 material design will be a
much bigger part of of what we what we
offer there so stage out yeah ok so I
think this is the last question it's a
bit longer one I found it we can just
kind of that summarize we can summarize
so basically the question is I found it
at being new to java script and angular
I found it difficult to get up and
running with the framework what's the
future of learning with ionic look like
basically you know how i learned to use
ionic clicker what resources are
available to me this is a great question
and there's a ton I don't even know
where to begin one thing we could talk
about quickly is the new book that's
about 20 yeah I Jeremy Wilkin which is
ionic in action and it's the the preview
version is available you can look at it
now it's not quite done it's almost done
I'd say it's almost out but Jeremy
Wilkins writing it is awesome ionic
developer and it's being published by
Manning great publisher and we've been
working fairly closely with them and
we're really excited about this book it
basically goes over everything you need
to know about I about using ionic one
point of you build I think three apps
all the way through and he covers
basically all the things that you might
need to know yes that is a really really
awesome book that's coming out soon yeah
we need to mention the other one which
is developing an ionic edge by bleeding
edge press that one is actually out now
um and you build this really great
instagram style app so definitely check
that out we will post the links in the
video here um and we hope that that
helps you get up and running yeah um but
kind of speaking at a higher level
going forward you know a lot of people
ask us about you know how does ionic fit
in with the rest of the ecosystem how
much JavaScript do I need to know how
much angular do I need to know and i
think our ultimate vision is that ionic
doesn't stay just a framework for
angular you know that's how we started
that's how we got off the ground our
bigger vision is that ionic is really
the easiest best fastest mobile
development suite for web developers and
in the future even people who don't
really know how to build websites yet
and we have a lot to do to get to that
point and some of the things that we're
going to do in the meantime are
dramatically improve our documentation
and simplify it because right now it
kind of assumes a level of knowledge
that's too high so simplifying our
documentation building much simpler
tutorials so we're working on a whole
new developers own we're calling it that
has bite-sized tutorials guides
everything you need to get up and
running the playground tool that we'll
talk about in a second yeah you should
talk about that soon because one of the
biggest problems with using ionic is
installing all the dependencies and if
you haven't ever built a mobile app
before it's daunting you know some of
those things are out of our hands like
we can't make installing Android and iOS
easier because we don't control those at
all and they have different licensing so
the playground helps you get up and
learning ionic wait before you have to
go and install anything so we are going
to be doing a lot more when it comes to
tools and in features that can be a
better part of the educational process
so we'll talk about the playground in a
second yeah I think another thing to
note is videos we're going to be making
a lot more videos on how to get started
with ionic on the mac how to get started
on windows you know how to build like
your first app basically and using
videos as a means to teach is like a
great option a lot of people really
really like that i myself am one of
those people i like watching videos and
following along someone who's like
teaching me how to build something so we
are investing a lot of time and i'm also
making just a whole ton of new videos
and those will be coming up pretty soon
as well yes several
big educational sites are working on
ionic courses right now and Linda think
is work alone definitely yeah so also
there's a plural psych course out there
so we just need to do a much better job
of actually telling people these things
exist and actually having official one
so we have we've helped make and we'll
put all this all these links all this
information in the description of the
video so you can just go down there
click them and look around and see for
yourself last but not least the forms a
great place to be as well ask questions
IRC there's always people hanging out
there talking chatting and are always
willing to help so I think we should
talk about plank let's talk about
playground that's oh that's all the
questions I sends it up we had a lot
more questions but things got a little
wild we couldn't answer every single
questions so we hope that the answers
mostly maybe we'll do another one oh
yeah for sure we'll do it again cool all
right let's move on playground let's
talk about it alright so the playground
we just launched last week it's funny
because we actually kind of had been
working on so we didn't so little secret
the playground used to be called the
scratchpad and we built it almost over a
year ago internally and we were using it
on some of our learn websites to embed
embed yes orbit embedded tool exactly
and so I think recently you pulled me
aside you're like hey I think you know
there's really something interesting
here I think we need a better way to get
people to give people the ability to
build ionic apps just in the browser
where it's faster and more efficient
they don't have to install anything it
knows ionic well so so on that note
going back to the question about react
native one of the biggest advantages of
ionic and tools like dynamic that are
based on like the browser is that they
you can build real applications in the
browser without installing anything on
this like totally open platform and we
should be using that to our advantage
because it's a huge advantage so the
playground lets you do that wrap it at a
platoon of element without installing
anything it's probably the fastest way
to build a mobile app that we know of so
we're going to be adding a ton of
features for starting projects testing
them in the view app all these crazy
things
many of the ideas that you post in the
comments we're going to be doing a lot
of that we're so excited by how excited
you all are about the playground so yeah
it kind of it kind of blew up yeah it
did and I'm really happy about that
we're really proud about that so yeah
next steps is is is adding a lot more of
those things that you guys all were
asking for so we're going to get to that
the coming months so keep an eye on for
playground stuff it's an awesome new
tool if you haven't checked it out its
images play ionic I out coal pretty
simple so let's talk about visual studio
and ionic integration this is a big deal
and it's been a long time coming we did
work on this behind the scenes for a
while now with the visual studio team in
order to get these ionic templates added
to visual studio I think ever since they
added Cordova support into Visual Studio
not too long ago we were kind of piqued
our interest and ever since then we've
been working with the team to make sure
that the experience on Windows was as
awesome as possible specifically in
visual studio and I think I think we're
actually there yeah so when I tried it
out on Windows I was blown away by how
easy visual studio made it's stalling
all the dependencies so probably the
number one problem that we deal with and
we love we love you windows developers
but the number one problem is installing
the dependencies for ionic on Windows
it's it's a pain the ass there's no Jas
there's ionic the command line tool
there's Cordova you have to install
android java like it's just a lot of
stuff and visual studio has this awesome
dependency installation you literally
click the buttons you hit next and all
that stuff installers for you yeah so we
want you to use visual studio if you're
on Windows because it will save us the
heartache of just not being able to help
the dependency installation of Windows
very passionate about I'm very
passionate about it because I want it to
be incredibly easy and this makes it
easy and beyond that like actually
developing and testing in the tool is
very very fast so you know and you can
still use a command line I think there's
like a healthy balance where you use
visual studio
to develop and debug and install
everything and you can still use the
ionic command line to do the like longer
term development testing on the device
and then when you go to a Mac for
testing on on uh on iOS all that stuff
so we are incredibly excited about it we
have an official template in the visual
studio template gallery we will be doing
a lot more we will be working a lot more
closely with the visual studio team at
Microsoft which by the way has been
really really fun it's been awesome to
work with them awesome to get to know
them they're doing big things they
really care a lot about the developer
experience and developing hybrid apps so
we're just really excited all around
yeah cordova's getting some major love
over there so we are excited to help out
cool uh so the ionic shop yeah let's
talk about it we just we just put it
live a couple weeks ago yep and people
are are grabbing stuff from it a lot
actually we're gonna have something here
here we go this is on the ionic shop and
it's the most comfortable t-shirt I
think I've ever worn and this isn't the
only one that we have on there so so why
don't we get some backstory we wanted to
put this up because a lot of people want
t-shirts and they want my onyx leg they
want I on a trance wag so we had all
these t-shirts made and continually
being made all the time every time you
order a t-shirt and we knew there needed
to be just like a great way for people
to come and get these t-shirts whether
you're putting on a no event or
organizing some sort of group meetup or
you just want to sport ionic or I'm Tron
you come to the user support he doesn't
need your support it's it's shop tonic
that I Oh check it out we do ship
internationally finally that is why we
set it up that is yeah we can drop ship
through this one company print faction
that makes it incredibly easy for us to
actually ship internationally which was
very very difficult before so they
helped us out with all of that we're
really excited if you ordered we are
doing a print and ship here very soon so
yes give us give us a little bit of time
because we're just getting it set up
we're moving quickly so you'll have one
of these amazing
shirts seriously if you're not
comfortable shirt I think I I don't know
why I'm not wearing and that's a good
question our cameraman Brody is wearing
his right now bright and film in real
quick so you can see and let's see that
shirt say hi Brody yeah so you guys can
get your shorts hopes of stickers we
don't have stickers on there yet we're
working to get stickers added we will
add stickers at some point in the future
I'm thinking we will we would like to we
would like to whether we do or not i
think that's that's a good question
maybe it's up to the community let's see
what you think let us know if you want
stickers you will happen um so I think
that sums it up for her for this for the
shop all them paying things we want to
talk about let's start let's move on can
we can we get to what everyone's been
waiting to us to talk about beer beer

company called mob craft and they do
crowdsource brewing basically you vote
on these crazy flavors crazy beers and

them so today what do I so I'm having
via the bat crazy coffee al just an
english-style brown ale brewed with milk
sugar and flavored with coffees from a
local coffee shop on just coffee and i'm
having a little bit more of the Don
Dario's filthy mustachioed made with
