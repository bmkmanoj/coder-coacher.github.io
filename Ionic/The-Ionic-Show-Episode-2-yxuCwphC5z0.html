of the ionic show I'm bad and I'm ex
today we have another awesome lineup of
things going on in the ionic community
so I'm going to be talking about texture
which is an app that lets you chat in
real time with your friends chef steps
which is an app that helps you become a
better cook waffle io a project
management tool for github issues that
we use here at ionic and really really
like the ionic creator new tool that
we're building for ionic we're going to
share some previews of that and then
lastly collide which is a new really
simple JavaScript animation engine that
we're building for ionic we're really
really pumped about that so oh we also
have a new home brew we'll get to that
later let's get the show started all
right first up texture so texture is an
app that lets you chat in real time with
your friends yeah so you can invite your
friends chat with him like other message
apps but with some fun different
features yeah so basically when you're
chatting with your friends they can see
what you're typing as you type it in
real time so when you like make a
mistake or literally as you're typing
letter by letter you can see what the
other person's typing where they can see
what you're typing which is pretty sweet
it was kind of I was not expecting at
first when I down onto the app I like
spam message to you and and everyone
else here and had you guys download it
but the thing that the thing that I
really like about it is that you can
delete messages after you send them yes
the holy grail of text messaging that is
right how many times have you sent a
text and then immediately we're like
 I wanted to leave this every single
time well you can do that with this F I
don't happen to do it every single time
but yeah so definitely check texture out
it's a really sweet app it's really well
designed I like it a lot of people here
at ionic like it yeah so next up is chef
steps so chef steps is a company that is
the whole mission is to help you become
a better chef so they have like a team
of cooks and like award-winning chefs
that are curating these like tutorials
recipes that you can build really
complicated stuff that or at least it
looks complicated at first but what they
do is they kind of like demystify how
complicated it actually is by showing
you step-by-step how to how to build it
which is really really awesome yeah like
I like to I like to say that it's
teaching you how to be a real chef which
is a little different than like others
recipe sites where you're just learning
to cook at home I there are some
tutorials on here that are really really
serious making like you know top quality
stuff that you normally wouldn't ever
learn how to do at home so they have
this niche for really making you a
better chef mm-hmm and they're
absolutely really really well-designed
I'm like I'm in love with their app it's
really simple you just scroll through
different recipes click on them it
slides over it gives you like a either
video or a few pictures of whatever it
is that you're making can change the
amount that you're making you can do
step-by-step instructions with photos
it's really really sweet so definitely
check it out it's in the app store it's
just called chef steps most of most of
us here have it think so sweet check it
out so next up is waffle yeah so waffle
is this really cool service that's
basically project management for github
issues so we started to use it ahead
ionic mainly because we just have so
many issues I not bugs but like you know
there's a lot of discussion going on on
github and it's hard to manage that
especially since ionic has gotten so
popular that we have enough github posts
that we need to kind of manage it
elsewhere so waffle lets you basically
put all your github issues into like a
Trello board mmm it's really fun you can
drag things back and forth we've got
like a backlog things that we're working
on stuff that needs or reply from a user
so this helps us categorize everything
in a way that labels don't really this
is more visual we love waffle if you've
got to get help project that that's
getting a little bit hard to manage
definitely check it out it's waffle I oh
yeah we really really like it here we
were use the note all day today we like
yeah we got rid of like almost
go fifty hundred issues or something
just put into waffle yeah something
crazy like that awesome yeah I
definitely check waffle off so next up
is the Creator which we're really really
excited about you want to talk about
that a bit yeah so the ionic crater for
those of you that know our history is a
throwback to kind of our roots we have a
history of building visual development
tools like drag and drop you know drag a
button on the screen and like you've got
a working app so creator is kind of a
throwback to that you can really quickly
prototype and mock up iono caps you can
drag buttons in you can drag all these
different components in we have a set of
ready-made templates for you for setting
up different pages and once you're done
you can export a ready to go cordova app
or a binary for iOS and Android and
Windows that's coming later but it's
basically a really really quick way to
just build something and then have a
working app ready to go you'll be able
to share it with with anyone around the
world and also preview it in different
phones so we're super excited about it I
think it's going to help people get into
ionic a lot faster and also let you try
out different designs and and it's also
like our third and array iteration on
making a drag-and-drop tool like a
visual creation tool and actually this
time around angular has been like a
massive help to us yeah so having built
these tools in the past I know like you
know the impact that angular's had is
just insane like something that would
have taken four to five months if not
longer took less than a month with
angular so it's had tangible benefits to
us just getting this thing done faster
which like you can't really put a price
tag on that like it's going to get in
your hands faster it's going to be more
performant it's going to be more fun to
use angular kind of shined with the
Creator and we're really excited about
it so do we want to give an ETA we've
been like really sensitive side this
time sensitive we've been sometimes we
give out etas and then we don't meet
detain and we feel really bad everyone
else feels bad but I feel like we could
give an ETA yeah I think realistically
the end of August
people will be using it at least at
least beta at least beta yeah definitely
September it's coming along it's really
coming together we just got to put the
polish on it that's the hardest part so
I expect it in a month maybe a month and
a half you always get like ninety-five
percent done with a project and it's
that five percent that you think is left
that's actually like takes you the
longest yeah yep we're in that five
percent right now I feel like yep so but
it's coming along it's going to be great
so lastly we should talk a little bit
about kalan yes so collide is basically
our take on a better animation system
for mobile and web apps basically we
came to the conclusion that I think a
lot of people have come to that CSS
animations just aren't good enough
they're really good for like simple
things but once you start building more
complicated animation driven you is
they're pretty unwieldy they don't have
the same flexibility like you for
dragging a side menu over and then you
stop it halfway with the CSS animation
it like it doesn't know really how do
you act right you can't really like send
the velocity through with the drag you
can't do things like physics animations
that are more complicated than a
standard easing curve so with with
collide which we're working on right now
and hopefully we'll have out another ETA
end of august early September you'll be
able to do really complicated animations
but do them very easily so you can do
physics animations so things that feel
like Springs gravity so you can you can
kind of model gravity and then also
things that decay over time based on
velocity so perfect for gestures that
you know you flicked something and then
it slows down so we were really inspired
by Facebook pop which is a animation
library that Facebook put out that came
along with their new facebook paper app
that made it really easy to do
animations that weren't just simple like
easing curves but had physics properties
to them I'm east we felt like the same
thing should exist on the web and that
people would actually be able to build
more compelling applications if they had
a little more control over their
animations so collide is definitely
inspired by Facebook pop we're big fans
of it
and I think it's important to say that
like you know we explicitly chose to go
the route of something more simple
because I think it makes more sense in
this context I mean we we actually built
out full-fledged physics engines yeah
and we realize that it was just so off
rails and and a bit more complicated
than what is even necessary to achieve
most of the effects that say like ninety
nine percent of the effects that people
are looking for with their apps it just
made more sense to go with something
that was a bit more not on rails but but
simplified yeah so I mean if you look at
UI kit dynamics which came out in iOS 7
which is basically like a little mini
physics system you lose control of your
animations really quickly like if a box
is colliding with something it's
bouncing around flies off the screen
yeah so collide kind of came from the
physics roots of of what we did before
uh it's just unwieldy it's it's too hard
to build an application when you have a
full power physics engine at your hands
and people don't really want that as
proved by Facebook pop so we decided to
simplify and go that route instead yeah
so ETA we're thinking yeah so like we
said ETA looking at about end of August
that's coming along nicely so I think
you'll really enjoy it awesome I'm
excited yep should we talk about the
home real quick sure sir so we've got a
strawberry blonde ale perfect for the
summer got a little hint of strawberry
in it served right from the keg here so
I hope you like that and we'll have the
recipe at the end awesome why didn't I
wraps it up for this episode yeah yep
sweet well then hopefully you will join
us for the next one see you next time
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
