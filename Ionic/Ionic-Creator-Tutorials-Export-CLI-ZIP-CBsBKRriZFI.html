creator team and today i want to talk to
you a little bit about exporting using
the CLI and our zip export functions so
I've already created a little export
test app using the side menu with a
simple login and signup page linked up
to that menu and now that I've kind of
finished this app I want to go ahead and
export it so I can start coding so this
is the export icon right here and all
the different kinds of exports we're
going to go through CLI and zip today so
now the CLI export is traditionally used
by developers that have a full ionic
development environment setup on their
computer and the zip export is
traditionally used for you to just
download a severe product and maybe hand
that off to a developer that has the
Foley onyx set up on their computer
already so first things first with the
ionic CLI you do need at least version
1.7.10 to in order to use this creator
function so this NPM installed dash G
Cordova ionic you're going to want to
make sure to run that so you have at
least one seven ten the way you can
check that is if you're in your console
and you just type my onic info and we
give it a second here attic info is
going to have this attic CLI version I'm
on one point seven point eleven so I am
already fully upgraded now that I know
I'm fully upgraded we can run this annex
start the name of our app creator and
then our ID here to get going so we can
just copy that switch back to our
console here and I'm gonna replace app
name with the actual name of my app so
for this we're going to do this is just
export test and this is going to run
through the entire ionic bootstrap
process and download our project into
that WWWE so that we can start working
on it right away now it's important to
note that in order to use the CLI export
you also need to make sure that you're
logged in in the ionic CLI so before you
do this if you're not logged in I
already am just type in ionic login and
put in your username and password from
creator
and that will allow you to download your
project just for security reasons we
don't want just anybody you'd be able to
down your load your project if they have
your project ID so this is still
initiating this project real quick here
I can show you guys how this exported
while we're waiting let me talk a little
bit about the other two real quick
so ionic package allows you to get apk
and IP a files directly these are going
to use for testing so remember there's
no code behind a creator project yet so
this is just if you want to hand an apk
file a native Android or iOS file off to
someone to test it you can use this
you'll have to set up your security
profiles and stuff first but I'll have a
video on that later and then the Creator
mobile app you can download if you are a
paid user which is on the App Store and
Google Play that will allow you to not
even go through any of this export
process and still test it immediately on
your phone right away without waiting so
okay so our CLI export is finished and
as we can see here we are still in the
base directory so we can CD into that
export test and there's all of our files
so I actually want to show some of these
to you guys and open them up in our code
editor so here's our WWD we've got image
JavaScript Lib templates as you can see
we have one template for each page that
we've generated so we have a login a
side menu and a sign up template we've
automatically downloaded the library
ionic for you and then we also have our
app controllers directives routes and
services so now's the port in time we're
like if you wanted to start making some
of this dynamic you might pop into your
log in controller and start hooking that
up with a back-end data service as well
as this login template to make sure that
everything works correctly that your
back-end services work you've put a code
in here so now is the part where you
start actually coding so this is the CLI
bootstrap process we just ran that
command it gave us an entire project set
up a lot of this other stuff the
platform's folder plugins all this stuff
is required by Anik for you to develop
locally
and the CLI export does all of that for
you now let's say you already have
somebody working on your project or you
just want to hand off the WW file to a
different programmer what you can do is
download this zip file ok so we're going
to download the zip file real quick and
I'm just going to move it to this folder
and we will extract that and as you can
see the contents of this is only the WWE
so you can't just click this index.html
and have it work it's not going to
function properly because it's not
running behind our ioniq back-end so in
order for this zip file to function what
your developer would do or you would do
is copy this contents of our zip export
and you would actually paste it into the
WWE of an existing ionic CLI started
project so here I'm just going to
overwrite this whole thing with that zip
export and everything should work fine
so in order to test this on my browser I
can do a onyx serve and that's going to
give us our full app already working
with our side menu everything rigged up
now you can see before I click that
index dot HTML file and it didn't work
now that we've used ionic serve it works
perfectly you can also do ionic emulate
iOS ionic emulate Android or any of the
other CLI functions that you want
straight from here at this point in time
you're outside of creator and you're in
a full ionic environment so if you want
to learn more about you know what to do
here or what's available to you hit up
ionic framework com and that's going to
give you more information on not only
the CLI but other components that you
might want to add code that you might
want to use if you're still new to
angular I recommend getting started at
App camp or not angular angular and
ionic I recommend getting started at App
camp tile that's a site that we have set
up that will run you through how to do
the basics angular user interface
networking all this stuff using ionic
it's completely free to learn here and
then specifically on the ionic framework
site another resource resource that you
can use
is our getting started page if you don't
have your CLI set up this is a great
place to get started please note that
you'll have to actually follow the
Android or iOS specific stuff or Windows
users you know here's some extra stuff
for you so go through this to set up
your CLI if you haven't yet and then
you'll have that full development
environment set up so you can get
started coding right away if you have
any other questions feel free to comment
on this video or hit us up thanks for
watching I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
