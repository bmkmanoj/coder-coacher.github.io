team and you're watching our weekly
workshop we recently released a new
feature that allows you to convert an
entire page to pure HTML that you can
edit freely or add a new HTML based page
right from the get-go and what this
allows you to do is almost anything you
want with a page because you have access
to the entirety of the HTML for that
pages template so you can do things like
make a complex grid system or set up
buttons and headers now some of that
stuff may be coming into creator in the
future but I wanted to create a video
tutorial for you guys real quick that
shows you how to add both a button in
the header and use the simple grid in
creator right now using our HTML based
pages so the first thing we're going to
do is go ahead and create a new project
here I'm going to call this project cat
pictures and we're just going to do this
blank it's going to be real quick and
easy projects here now the first thing I
like to do is set up my different pages
get my header color that I want so we're
gonna change our header color to
positive save that in our theming and we
are going to name this page cat pictures
then we are going to add a new blank
page name that add a picture and we're
not going to design this page I just
want this page to be here so we can
navigate to it using a header button
later so like said we're gonna put a
header button right here to navigate to
that other page but we're not gonna do
that quite yet because since this page
has a convert to HTML button we can do a
lot of work before we convert okay so
let's first of all turn off padding on
this page and then begin to upload for
cat pictures here just to give us
something to work with
so I've already found these cat pictures
over on the Google so we're just going
to upload these one by one here and make
sure that they are full width we had
that padding set to false okay there are
two of them down okay let's keep going
two more to go
and what we're going to do is we're
going to put these in a 2x2 grid after
we convert here so that they kind of
look like a standard grid picture app
that you would see on any of the native
features here all right so we've got cat
pictures padding is off for pictures so
now that we've got that set let's
convert this whole page to HTML now you
cannot go backwards so what this is
going to do is show you in advance what
the HTML it's going to generate will
look like so you can look and say ok I'm
ok with this convert this page day HTML
like I said once you click this button
you will no longer be able to use drag
and drop for this page so we convert
this page to HTML and it's automatically
going to open our code window and show
us the HTML that we currently made here
so the first thing we're going to want
to do is add that header button so
normally in creator we put everything
that you drag in inside I on content
however header buttons actually go
outside of I on content so I know that I
want to put something here now
through looking at the ionic framework
documentation I found ion nav buttons ok
and INF buttons allows you to have an
ion view like we have next to that I add
content they have ion nav buttons here
you can use side so you can set it to
primary secondary left or right and then
put button based content right in there
so what we're going to want to do here
is have an ion nav buttons ok I'm gonna
have a button class equals button
I want this button to be an icon and
then I went over to IANA cons comm so
that's your ionic ons comm and this is
the icon set that we build into creator
and I looked for an add icon and found
the icon plus round so we're going to
make that an icon ion plus round for
that icon and then we woops
apparently I spelt button rod and we're
gonna save that and we are going to get
a plus button on a primary side now if I
wanted to do side equals secondary here
and save that it's going to move it over
to the right for us now right now this
button doesn't do anything so if I
preview we have a nice button that gets
background color and press but it
doesn't do anything so one of the other
things we could do is use UIs ref from
within code to navigate to other pages
so if we go to add a picture we see this
state s ref and the properties of this
page is called add a picture we're gonna
copy that state over to the first page
here and on this button I'm gonna put
you I - s ref equals the state from the
other page now when we open that and hit
plus it's going to navigate us to the
add a picture page nice and easy
just like we're used to so now we want
to get each of these images into a 2x2
grid so the first thing we're gonna do
is set up our rows and columns now if
you go to the attic documentation here
and you go to CSS components and grid
you're gonna see all the different kinds
of stuff you can do with grid we even
have vertically centering evenly spaced
we have explicitly space content all
this stuff on how to use our grid system
it really is awesome and it uses flex
critten so let's go back here ours is
just going to be pretty simple but you
can get as complex as you want so we're
going to add div class equals row and
then I'm gonna get rid of this here
we're going to tab two of these images
over and and Dave there copy our row put
a second row tab over these two and end
that row then on each of our image div
containers we're going to add class
equals call take this and put it on all
four of them and when we save we're
going to get a nice evenly spaced grid
with those four pictures so now with
really simple HTML based editing we have
unlocked everything from that I on view
for your page giving you access outside
of iron content sad ion nav buttons and
then also it gave you access to do
things like grid and basically anything
you want to do if you can find it in I
addicts documentation or somewhere else
in templating you can make sure that it
works with our HTML based templates now
the other thing I wanted to get is just
mention for part of our documentation is
if you look at CSS
components buttons headers and footers
you can kind of see some of the classes
you might add to make your button look
different so if you're looking for a
text-based button for instance one of
the things you might want to add to it
is button clear which is going to make
the text a little bit bigger because the
button doesn't have any kind of outline
around it so just want to let you know
spend some time and Attucks
documentation and it really could do
anything you want creator now with these
HTML based pages so until next time you
guys always let me know if you have
ideas for more tutorials and I'll catch
you later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
