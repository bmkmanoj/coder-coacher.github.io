would like to announce a new ionic dev
app we noticed a lot of people were
using ionic view for local development
by honestly ironing view did not fit
this use case perfectly because it is we
decided to split ion view into two apps
the new ion a few which allows you to
deploy your apps to friends family
co-workers and clients with a lot more
new features and ionic dev app which
allows you to develop locally on a
device would not only Cordova plugins
support but also live reload all without
having to setup Cordova itself or the
native SDK tool chains let me show you
how it works
all right as you can see my terminal
we're in an ionic app also as you can
see we have the ionic dev app started on
all these devices I am now going to run
an ionic serve and as the build process
finishes you will see the ionic app
pop-up on the dev app I'll now open the
app
and is the app starts to load on all
these devices you'll see they're all
running the ionic conference app all
right let's make a change so we're going
to change the theme color to a nice red
let's save that and as you see there now
all auto updating now I'm going to
change it back to blue all right and
there's a nice ionic blue so as you can
see I use the ionic dev app to develop
an app on multiple devices
simultaneously for more info check the
