framework for iOS development ionic
framework is a front-end framework for
developing hybrid mobile apps with html5
to start using ionic with iOS
you will need Mac OS X with Xcode the
Xcode command-line tools and nodejs
installed instructions for installing
these prerequisites are in the notes for
this video
once you've finished installing the
prerequisites and salt ionic from the
node package manager if you are new to
node.js NPM is package manager for
nodejs that will resolve your
dependencies install ionic now with NPM
install - G ionic Cordova iOS sim these
modules are the bases for working with
ionic on iOS the ionic module itself is
the primary command-line tool you'll be
working with Cordova is ionics
underlying platform for building native
mobile applications using HTML CSS and
JavaScript
finally the iOS image allows us to run
the iOS simulator from the command line
we can now begin building absolutely
onic ionic ships with several templates
but we will start with a tabbed app you
can learn about the other templates and
the getting started guide in the notes
for this video to start a new tab based
application type ionic start tabs app
tabs
this will create a folder called tabs
app so change into that folder when we
look at the folders contents we can see
there is a lot happening in the next
video
we will break down the structure of an
ionic app and change our application for
now we will just get it running in the
iOS simulator an ionic application does
not ship with any platforms installed to
turn our app into something runnable on
a device we need to add specific
platforms we want to use in this case we
want I oh s in the terminal type ionic
platform add iOS
once ionic resolves its dependencies we
can run the application type ionic
emulate iOS to run the iOS simulator
once it's running we can now see that we
have a working tabbed application in the
next video we will talk about the
structure of an ionic project and begin
customizing our app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
