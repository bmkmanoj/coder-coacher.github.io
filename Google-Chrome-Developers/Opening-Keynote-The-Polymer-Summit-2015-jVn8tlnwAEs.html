to the first ever polymer summit my name
is Taylor savage i'm the product manager
on the polymer team it's going to be an
amazing day we all just can't wait it'll
be a whirlwind tour through everything
that we do on the polymer project but
right off the bat I want to say thank
you so thank you to our incredible Dutch
hosts in this beautiful city of
Amsterdam in this incredible venue thank
you so much as matt said to the polymer
team to the chrome team to all of google
everybody who's put in so much work to
make this happen and you can really see
how passionate the whole team is that
everybody's out everybody's here to
answer questions we're so excited to
meet all of you and hear what you have
to say and finally thank you all for
coming we have developers here from
every single continent except Antarctica
we're going to work hard for the next
summit to get some folks out from
Antarctica but I want to kick things off
first before we dive in to the really
hands-on talks to kind of give a little
bit about where polymer has been in the
recent past and where we're going in the
near future so just the other day it was
Chrome's 7th birthday and polymer is
part of the chrome organization at
Google we are the official developer
library of the web platform at Google
and we sit next to a lot of the blink
team who actually works on the chrome
render up in a beautiful Google San
Francisco office so for chrome 7th
birthday we had a nice toast with the
whole team it's really exciting to see a
product come so far in seven years and
if there's one thing that you should
know about the chrome team and the web
platform team is we really really really
love Legos and who doesn't Legos are
awesome polymer team as well we really
love Legos to and Legos are a great
metaphor for the kind of things that
polymer lets you build and that web
components that you build their
composable their modular they were
usable you can use the same kinds of
pieces to build really really incredible
things and so as a nice little diversion
from preparing for the summit we had a
lego building contest for Chrome seventh
birthday across the entire office and I
am very very proud to say
that the polymer engineering team won
the lego building contest so these are
their creations or abominations the
challenge was to build the craziest 74
chrome seventh birthday but instead of
building 7 s our engineering team really
should have been building threes the
master branch of the polymer library is
about to turn three years old next month
so our first commit was on October 10
2012 back then the project was called
tool kitchen and the very early spec of
web components was just kind of getting
started and polymer and web components
were evolving in tandem so this is from
the first commit on the the readme of
github and what I really love about
these early tool kitchen commits is how
both foreign and familiar they are to
today's polymer so the names and the
api's have obviously changed
dramatically but the fundamental tenets
of what makes polymer polymer have
remained exactly the same so you can see
on this first read me says emphasis on
modularity and encapsulation via a
component model be declarative say what
you mean there's another reason we
should have been building threes instead
of sevens the 10 version of the polymer
library just turned three months old
that's really amazing to see how far
it's come and how far the community has
come in in just a short three months now
we've been seeing incredibly exciting
and exponential adoption and innovation
on on the one point o library so there's
been exponential growth on the public
web for applications built with polymer
1 dot o over a hundred and fifty
thousand public facing production web
pages are using polymer today actually
when I landed in Amsterdam this slide
read a hundred thousand and I have to
update it huh since that we were here
starter kit has been downloaded sixty
five thousand times and the paper
elements are used on thousands of
different websites and some major
companies are also really seeing and
buying into the component model that web
components and polymer now now lets you
build with so this is a quote from a
recent article about ing direct's
adoption of polymer and this is from the
IT head of strategy we no longer build
applications we have and are enriching a
module market sourced from industry and
the ing global community
modules are assembled in applications as
the business requires and I think that's
just a really elegant statement of this
new world of web components polymer 1
point 0 internal adoption at Google has
also been growing spectacularly so over
300 projects internally at Google are
now using polymer 1 point 0 and we just
launched you know three months ago and
as everyone here knows it can take a
really long time to build applications
and then ship them out into production
but we've already seen some pretty
exciting production-ready launches
Google products using polymer patents
google com recently launched and then
even more recently the YouTube gaming
site launched in production on the web
using polymer 10 so you'll see more and
more of these coming out in the coming
months as the products that are building
with polymer go into production so now
barely three months old we are here at
our first-ever polymer developer summit
in beautiful Amsterdam I've gotten a lot
of questions a why Amsterdam why did we
pick Amsterdam to have a conference so
first why not it's a beautiful city
there's an incredibly strong developer
community here and in broadly in Europe
it's a beautiful location it's a
beautiful venue amsterdam in san
francisco are also very similar in a lot
of ways they're these both gleaming
cities on the water relax policies
toward recreation just a lot of fun
cities to be in and the polymer
community is also spread out across the
entire world so this is a map of where
we held polytechnic events last fall and
as you can see again every single
continent there is a group of develop
devoted polymer developers to hold these
polytechnic events except antarctica
again there are holdouts but we're
working on that there's another
connection though between the
netherlands and web components so about
four years ago alex russell first
introduced web components at the
frontiers conference right here in the
netherlands so the web components in
netherlands go go way way back and on
web components they've come an
incredibly long way from alex's talk
just four years ago and recently there's
been some pretty significant steps
toward broad browser adoption on web
components so i want to give a little
update on
where we are as a quick recap there are
four specs as part of the kind of web
components umbrella there's the template
which is native side templating on the
web there shadow Dom which gives you
these really nice scoping and
Composition primitives custom elements
which lets you create your own Dom nodes
and Dom elements and HTML imports which
lets you load web components so loading
HTML with HTML and of these four specs
you know they're all critical this is
the foundation upon which polymer is
built template and shadow DOM and
protect in particular are really the
hardest to polyfill and they're also the
ones that really give you the true
encapsulation and reusability and
composition that that is so wonderful
with web components and I'm really
really pleased to say that we've made
incredible progress across all the
different browser vendors on getting
closer and closer to shipping broadly
with template and shadow Dom so browser
standards conversations can be can be
really subtle and delicate and I really
don't want to put words in anyone's
mouths so i'm going to use direct quotes
from the other browser vendors on these
specs in particular so Wilson page from
Mozilla recently published a great state
of web components article that ends with
this quote web components have been in
planning for over three years but we're
optimistic the end is near all major
vendors are on board enthusiastic and
investing significant time to help
resolve the remaining issues that's
really exciting the Microsoft team the
edge team has also been working really
really hard to get web components in the
new edge browser which we're still
excited about so this is another quote
from a recent article by Travis and
Aaron on the edge team there where they
wrote we are happy to announce that we
are starting development to add HTML
template element support to Microsoft
edge today this is just the beginning of
our web components journey the next goal
is to implement shadow Dom so you can
actually check up on the status of edge
implementation of shadow Dom with this
link on the bottom right and also from
Microsoft Daniel Buckner on the
Microsoft team is working to actually
build out Microsoft specific web
components using the ex tag library and
so we've actually demoed a polymer
components and X tag components working
together on the same page with no
problems at all it's kind of the
beautiful story of interop of web
components so we're incredibly excited
about this too and the WebKit team has
also been to contribute
really deep and fundamental innovations
to the specs including the latest slots
API for shadow Dom so we're really
excited to be working with the WebKit
team as well so as you can see it's it's
a really incredibly exciting time
browser vendors are all working together
they're all we're all making
contributions this is kind of out of the
ordinary you know what web standards
processes can be slow and arduous but I
really really think that we're in one of
those Renaissance periods of true
innovation on the web platform and
specifically around web components so
web components have come a really long
way polymer library has come a really
long way it's being used in production
on some of the biggest sites on the web
it has enormous momentum it has enormous
investment but we're really just only at
the beginning now today's conference is
going to be all about building things
this is a developer conference through
and through I will be going deep into
the practical know-how that you need to
build really great experiences on the
web with polymer which is our whole goal
so be touching on three main themes
today the first is developed so how you
can use all of the features that polymer
gives you and the polymer elements give
you to be able to build end-to-end
applications using polymer the second is
design so how you can make sure that
your paw lower abs look and work great
for all of your different users and then
finally deploy so how you can make sure
that your app is fast and production
ready on the web and we don't want
today's conference to be about big
splashy announcements this is a
developer conference and we want to be
hands-on and help building apps from
start to finish but i would like to
paint a picture of where we see polymer
going in the near future so our mission
as we've said before is to help web
developers just build great experiences
on the web and you are all out on the
bleeding edge with us you know polymer
is not just another framework it is a
massive change it is a sea change and
how we do web development and we need to
make this easier for developers that
aren't as brilliant or awesome or
good-looking as all of you and all of
you on the live stream as well so there
are three ways that we want to help
developers in the near future work and
build with polymer we want to help you
decrease your developer friction achieve
great performance and then build complex
apps using polymer so how are we going
to do that
decreasing developer friction using HTML
with web components is is a revolution
in how we do front-end development but
it could be even more awesome and there
are a couple of sticking points in
particular that I'm sure all of you have
faced at some point another when
building with polymer that we think that
there there's big opportunities to make
improvement so the first is managing and
using elements and elements are great
you know that our whole mantra there's
an element for that you fly you have a
problem that you're running into when
building your application and there's an
element for that on the web that solves
your problem that you can just use and
the problem today is that this isn't
necessarily true you know there might be
an element out there that solves your
problem but to get it in your
application first you need to install
Bower and then you need to install the
element and then you might have to
resolve some dependency conflicts it's
just not really an elegant process to
even use that element for your first
time and we really think that this
should be as simple as this should be
using element you should just be able to
import the element and then use it on
your page it should be like loading it
from a CDN you should never have to
think about these dependency problems so
we're working on a tool Google is
working on a tool called poly gate to be
able to load and deduplicate all of your
element dependencies in the cloud on the
web so this will make getting started
with new projects easier it'll let you
use elements in environments where you
might not necessarily control the server
and it might even give you CDN like
performance in production applications
so we don't necessarily see polly get
like tool as blowing away client-side
dependency management but we do think
it'll provide a much smoother on-ramp to
getting started building applications
using polymer and these elements the
second the second developed time
experience that we can help improve is
actually writing code and actually
editing code so when we're developing
the polymer core library there's a
mantra that we kind of keep repeating
which is that every bite has a cost
every bite has a cost polymer is so lean
that we don't include error message
strings inside of the actual library so
it can be a little hard to know you know
what's going wrong when you might have a
bug and this lean asst is really great
in production it's what you want but it
can kind of make the developed I'm
experience tricky and hard so you might
have run into this problem the dreaded
blank page problem where you're editing
your text editor yes some people have
run into this and you make save and you
refresh the browser and you just get a
blank page and there's no error in the
console nothing showing up you just kind
of have a blank page and it's you know
this can be really frustrating and more
than likely it's just a small typo or
you forgot an import somewhere but still
it's it's that kind of grinding feeling
when you run into a wall with this blank
page and we don't think this should ever
happen so we're working on a tool called
poly lint polymer is lean and light and
we want to keep it that way so we're
going to move all of those developer
error messages into this tool called
poly line which will help you at
developed I'm constantly lint your
application and make sure that you're
not making these kind of errors so you
can catch them before you even refresh
your browser and run into that blank
page and polymers mo is all about
composability so I'm talking about a
bunch of different tools you know Pauly
get Pauly get Pauly lint and these are
you know it's a lot of different tools
that's that's absolutely true it's a
bunch of small tools but the beauty of
polymer is is composability so we want
to build the tools in the same way so
you can compose these tools into bigger
tools to build exactly what you need for
your workflow and so we'll get into a
little more on this with the talks later
this afternoon the second big thing that
we want to help developers with is
achieving great performance so polymer
is a Swiss Army knife you can build
really awesome cool things with it you
can also build slow things with it it
lets you do whatever you would like so
we're working on a number of different
tools to help you get deeper insight
into the performance of your application
and the polymer elements that you're
using so the major cost when you're
building an application using polymer is
using lots of elements elements are
super great you know they let you do all
these kinds of cool things but they're
not free just like if you were working
with basic HTML if you're using tens of
thousands hundred thousand elements on a
page it's gonna it could get slow and so
the big problem is that knowing the cost
of your element is really critical to
achieving great success with your
application and polymer and so we want
to make this element cost much clearer
as you're developing the application so
you can kind of optimized throughout and
know where your bottlenecks are so we're
working on a tool called poly dev to
help you measure what we call kind of
the atomic mass of a particular element
so what a single elements cost might be
and then more broadly how all of these
elements
contribute to the overall performance of
your app so you can really see where
your bottlenecks are when you're
building with elements will be using
these tools to constantly be slimming
down our own elements so we focused on
performance of the core library with the
10 launch and we'll be using this as a
major effort to slim down all of the
elements that we released with polymer
and it really speaks to the great part
of reusing elements is with we making a
performance improvement to one of the
elements and you Bauer update your just
a bower update away from getting a lot
of these performance improvements so
keep your elements up-to-date and if
you're developing elements same thing
you can constantly be improving the
performance of your elements and your
users are just a bower update away
finally in the performance bucket is
HTTP two we've seen some really
incredible games with with the brand-new
HTTP two standard I can achieve in terms
of loading cost I would love to tell you
about it because there it's really
amazing but Eric is going to talk a
little bit about them this afternoon and
he would kill me if I spoil the surprise
but suffice it to say that with HTTP two
and poly get we're starting to really
see this radical simplification of
building web applications out of
components and we're working to make
this feasible and possible really really
soon so the final thing that we want to
help developers with is in building
really complex apps and we talked a
little bit earlier about how the polymer
team is we're big fans of Legos and
Legos are a great metaphor for the kind
of things that we build and one of the
ways that the Lego analogy really really
works is you can build incredibly
complex things all completely out of
just Legos you don't need anything else
you can just use Legos and build
incredibly complex structures and this
is because all Legos can form to the
same basic format this is great because
you can totally mix and match Legos from
different sets you know you can buy a
set over here you can buy a set over
there and you're guaranteed that all the
parts are just going to work together
and again this is because they are all
using the same basic format so I looked
this up this is the original Lego patent
and those little nubs on the top of the
Lego are called studs and the holes in
the bottom are called tubes and no
matter where you go to buy a Lego you're
going to have the exact same stud height
and the exact same tube with and this
simple studdin to model is what gives
you this powerful interoperability so
you can use all
these legos together guaranteed and
they'll all work together and you'll be
building really strong structures out of
it the stud and to model for the web
platform is dawn you have nodes and you
have events and polymer directly lets
you use this platform at the metal to
help you build elements and when you're
building elements right on the platform
when you're building right down to the
metal the performance improvements the
browser vendors make and the permanent
improvements that come with browsers are
reflected right away and immediately in
the applications that you built so we
think that the best way to build web
apps on the web platform is to actually
embrace the web platform we don't
necessarily think that the future of web
development is going to be throwing away
the platform and building your own kind
of platform and user space on top and
then throwing away that platform when a
new kind of user space platform comes
around it's a bit like building a Jenga
tower on top of a base of Legos elements
benefit directly from the consistency of
the platform and are fundamentally of
the platform and you get all of the
benefits that come with that so we
focused our element product lines that
we build on the polymer team on solving
really really minut and specialized
problems for specific use cases we built
the iron elements the paper elements for
material design the Google web
components for wrapping Google API in
elements platinum elements for the
cutting-edge web platform features the
gold elements for e-commerce and we're
going to continue expanding this model
you know dramatically increasing our
reach in e-commerce vertical and
potentially the publishing vertical as
well in additional to new verticals but
the one major set of problems that we
haven't really tackled on the polymer
team yet with elements is how you
structure an entire application
end-to-end and we get a lot of questions
about this you know I want to use an
element how do i do a play out how do i
do routing how do i do lazy loading and
our answer up to this point has been you
know their legos you can put them
together however you want you can use a
library that you want for routing you
can wrap it in element the world is your
oyster when it comes to elements polymer
is again a Swiss Army knife it doesn't
enforce the kind of app level
architecture or hierarchy every little
piece of how you need a structure your
application it leaves it up to you the
developer
but the problem is that there's a little
bit of a paradox of choice here you know
if there's so many different ways to
structure your application it's hard to
know where to start and that can be
frustrating so I'm really really pleased
to announce that we are working on a new
set of elements tentatively named the
carbon elements that are all focused
around solving these application-level
structural problems when you're building
with components so things like routing
layout lazy loading and everything you
need to kind of build an entire
application now I want to be clear these
are definitely not the only way you can
solve these problems with elements
obviously if you like a different
routing library you like a different
lazy loading solution you can swap these
in and out there just elements but we
will build a polymer idiomatic and
framework oriented set of components
with the carbon elements we think that
the best framework can sometimes be the
platform itself and so these elements
were really reflect our philosophy here
so this is in its very early stages will
announce more as these ideas develop and
we're obviously going to open them up on
github very early so you can kick the
tires and start playing with them giving
us your feedback so there's lots of new
and exciting things in polymer on the
horizon will be decreasing developer
friction with cut with code hosting and
code linting tools will be making
performance easier with all kinds of
element measurement tools will be
providing a well lit path to structuring
kind of end-to-end applications using
polymer components so we're just
incredibly excited for the next steps of
the polymer project and to continue
working closely with all of you as these
tools evolving bro so to stay up to date
with the latest you can follow the
polymer blog we will keep constant
updates there you can follow us at
twitter or on google+ at the plus
polymer projects but enough talk enough
promises let's get down to actually
building stuff so I'll throw it back to
Matt to introduce our next speaker thank
