the show so today I want to talk a
little bit about how we do keyboard
support in custom controls follow me
over here to my laptop I want to show
you this radio group that I've been
working on so on my page here I've got a
regular just native text input I've got
some custom radio controls that I've
created and I've got a regular native
button down here at the bottom and I
want you to watch the the focus behavior
that happens here so I'm gonna hit tab
and that's gonna focus my my text input
I'll hit tab and that will move focus
into my radio controls I can press you
know down or up to focus different items
inside of there and select them and I
need it tap again to move out to that
next that button I can also hit shift
tab and when I moved back to my radio
control my focus lands on the previously
selected item and I want you to look at
what's going on over here in the dev
tools as I do this so I've got this this
current item selected you can see it's
tabindex set to zero and when I press
the up arrow key now the the element
that came before its tabindex is set to
zero and it's tabindex is set to
negative one if I hit up again we're
actually gonna wrap around to the bottom
of the list right so our last element is
now to have an X zero all the others are
negative one so this technique that I'm
showing here is sometimes referred to as
roving tabindex or like a roving focus
and the idea is you want your users to
have as efficient and experience as
possible when they are navigating your
application especially if they're using
a keyboard so you want to treat complex
controls whenever possible as a single
tab stop so these are can tab into it
they can use their arrow keys to
interact with it if they would like
otherwise if they want to just sort of
bypass it they can hit tab again to move
to the next control if they were
interacting with that that custom
control that you built they tab away
they tab back you want to restore the
focus to whichever item they've had
previously activated so to do this we're
gonna use this roving tab index
technique where we basically are kind of
creatively toggling tabindex 0 and
negative 1 on our children to our user
is kind of a nice continuity to their
experience so follow me over here
to my my code editor and I'll show you
how we did this now you may have noticed
that the the HTML that I was using here
these were not native tags or something
you might be familiar with
I've actually defined my own HTML
elements and I'm doing this using the
new custom elements spec so these are
custom tags that I've created which
inherit from native HTML element
I'll give you sort of an example here so
looking at this first radio button that
I've created let's go and look at its
JavaScript and this is kind of the the
typical boilerplate to create a custom
element so I've got a class called radio
button which extends HTML element so I'm
extending the native HTML element this
is the sort of the the primitive class
that that all HTML tags can hear it from
I've got a constructor here where I'm
not really doing anything I'm just
calling super to make sure that I've you
know properly set up my my parent class
and then I've got this connected
callback and every custom element has a
set of life cycle callbacks that you can
hook into to run your own code during
various you know phases of that elements
life so for instance connected callback
gets run every time our element is
inserted into the Dom either like via
JavaScript or the the parser hits it
maybe because it's already in our markup
and it goes through and it upgrades it
and the first thing it's gonna do is
it's gonna call this callback so this is
a great place for us to like stamp out
our templates or you know query the Dom
for something for instance because we
know we're actually in the document now
so in this case what I'm doing with
these radio buttons is I'm just going
through and I'm sort of setting up some
initial State I'm setting a roll of
radio and I'll talk about where that
comes from in just a minute I'm sending
the initial tabindex value to negative
one because I don't necessarily want
this thing to be clickable I know that
it's gonna be you know part of a larger
set so I'm gonna set its initial to have
an X to negative one I'm also going to
set this aria-checked value to false so
where did those roles and and
aria-checked and all that stuff come
from well if we go and we look at the
the aria authoring best practices doc
and i've referred to this in a few prior
episodes this is a super super useful
doc that just sort of lists out design
patterns UI patterns and
basically the the keyboard support in
the Aria support that they need to have
so over here I've gone ahead I found
radio group inside of this document and
down at the bottom it tells me the Aria
roles and states that should be
supported by a radio group so it says
that our outer container should have a
role of radio group which we'll get to
in just a sec but for individual buttons
they should have a role of radio and
when they are selected they should be
set to already check true they're not
selected they should be already checked
false so in this case our radio is
defaulting to already checked false it's
got a role radio so it's kind of set up
and then we're gonna let that parent
control really dictate its state the
other thing that's really useful about
this dock is it'll tell us the kinds of
keyboard support that a radio group
should have so for instance it tells us
that if the user is focused on this
control and they hit the up arrow or the
left arrow that it should move focus to
the previous radio in the radio group so
imagine you had like the center one
focused or something someone hit the up
arrow you want to go you know to the to
the previous one you want to go up one
if they hit the down arrow or the right
arrow you want to move down what's
interesting though is that it also says
that if focus is on the last item and
you hit down focus should wrap around to
the top
you know similarly it focuses on the
first item and you hit up should wrap
around to the bottom so we're gonna
accomplish all that using this roving
tabindex technique let's go and look at
the parent element the radio group and
this one's got a fair bit more code to
it but it's still you know I don't want
you get overwhelmed there's there's some
of the stuff that you can kind of you
know ignore if you want to you the main
thing we're gonna focus on is just that
up and down arrow key behavior so what
I've done is I've gone ahead and I've
defined a few constants for the key
codes that we're gonna care about so I
need to know when the user hits the left
key or the up key the right key or the
down key because this is a custom
element I'm just extending from HTML
element just like we were doing with
radio button again we're just sort of
setting up our constructor and then in
our connected callback we're setting
some initial state so we're setting the
role to radio group and this is you know
going to make sure that our screen
reader announce this is control properly
I'm using a a query selector here to
query all of the radio
children and I'm keeping those inside of
a little property I've got called radios
and then there's a little bit of code
here where this is just me kind of
getting a little fancy for a second
where I'm just checking to see did
anybody create a selected attribute on
this tag and maybe specify an index for
one of the radios that they would like
to have selected in advance and if they
did then we're going to do a little
setup work here so we basically we have
a selected attribute that is mapped to a
selected property and when that changes
we'll just change which item currently
has the right tabindex which one is
marked as aria-checked true so let's go
ahead and actually define the selected
property in a bit more detail what I'm
going to do since we're working with a
class is I'm going to create some
getters and setters
so getters and setters if you're not
familiar with them these are functions
that you can define on a class that
basically dictate how properties on that
class work so for instance when someone
sets this property if they were just say
you know radio group dot selected equals
you know some number like two it's
actually going to run this function and
inside of this function I can do all
sorts of cool interesting stuff to react
to that change
similarly if they ask for that value you
know if someone says console.log radio
group dot selected then it's gonna run
this get function and here what I what I
probably want to do is just return my
selected value so what I'm gonna do is
I'll actually have a stored value which
will be called underscore selected and
whenever someone calls you know set
selected or get selected will actually
be manipulating this this underlying
value so when someone gets the value the
colored getter will just return whatever
selected currently is when someone sets
selected now we actually want to react
to some changes here because we probably
want to change which radio button is
currently active so I've got a bit of
code here and I know it's a little it
seems like a lot but but hang in there
with me for just a second the first line
here is just checking to see you know if
we already have a selected property so
this is actually calling our getter it's
saying is anything already selected the
getter could return some index it could
return zero if maybe the the the very
first radio button was selected
in that case because zero is a falsie
value we want to check that you know is
actually the number zero so we can use
this is finite method to see okay do we
get a numeric value back from selected
if we do that means that we need to move
the tab index from one of our radio
children to the next okay so we'll say
all right the previously selected item
let's just look in that list of children
that we have which is stored in this dot
radios we'll grab it by its index the
selected value I will set it to negative
one and we'll remove its aria-checked
state then for the new value right
because again someone's calling our
setter here so they've passed in some
value they've said you know radio group
dot selected equals two for the new
value now that we've set the previous
item to negative one we'll say all right
find that new element at that index set
its tabindex to zero so now it is in the
natural focus order focus it call its
focus method and then set its Aria check
state to true I'm also going to just
like reflect the selected value the
selected index back to my my radio group
container which is just kind of like a
nice thing to do and then I will set the
underlying sort of private selected
value to that index so again that way if
someone calls our getter later on it'll
return that value to them now we know
how to set the selected value for our
control the next thing we need to do is
modify that value using our keyboard so
when someone presses up or down we want
to increment or decrement the selected
value so up here I've got a a key down
listener right you can see I sort of set
that up up here in my my connected
callback so I'm listening for key down
events and I've got a pretty simple
little switch statement here where I'm
just checking the key code using those
constants that I defined up here at the
top so if someone hits up or left then I
want to take one action I want to
basically a decrement in the currently
selected item if they hit down and right
I want to increment the selected item so
I just got a little bit of code that
I've already written so to decrement the
selected item when they hit upper left
we're actually going to
by preventing the default event behavior
because we don't want them when they hit
the up key we don't want to scroll the
page up we actually just want to sort of
handle that inside of our control we'll
figure out what the selected value is
we're calling our getter there if it's
zero meaning we're at the top of the
list then we're actually going to wrap
around to the bottom of the list so
we'll just set selected equal to you you
know whatever the length of our children
is minus one because this is a zero
indexed array so we'll just set the
selected value to the last child index
otherwise we can just you know decrement
it we'll just remove the one value from
the the index we're gonna do a similar
thing when someone hits down or right
but this time we will be incrementing so
we're going to say all right again
prevent default this time our little
safety check here is to see are we on
the last item if so we'll set this
selected to the first item otherwise
we'll just hang for a minute I think
we're actually ready to try this out so
we go over to our browser refresh the
page and we'll keep an eye on our tab
index is here so I'll tab down to that
control right we've got our first
element but the tab index zero so it's
focused at the down arrow key and I can
see that we are incrementing our tab
index here so you can kind of watching
the console and kind of watch over here
in the browser at the same time so I'll
be incrementing incrementing
incrementing we get to the very last
item we hit down again and it's gonna
wrap around to that top item so you know
we can also go backwards we can hit up
it'll wrap around to the bottom if we
need to we can always tab out of this
control and tab back in and focus
remains on that that previously selected
element so that about covers it for
today roaming time index is a super
useful technique to have in your back
pocket if you're building custom
controls maybe you're building something
like a tree view where you don't have a
native browser analog so you've got to
go custom there but you want to make
sure that your user has a really good
keyboarding experience if you have any
questions on what we did today you can
always leave them for me down below in
the comments or you can hit me on a
social network of your choosing
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
