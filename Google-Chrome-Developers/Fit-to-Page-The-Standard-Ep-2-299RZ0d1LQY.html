will solve common web problems with
standards these techniques are part of
the web platform and work with any
framework or library all right let's go
you're working on your site and it looks
great on mobile on desktop but one of
your pages doesn't actually have enough
content to fill all the way to the
bottom so your site just kind of ends
which is not very good we can fix this
by manipulating the body element so body
and HTML work together to frame your
whole page your body tag just contains
your content the HTML actually extends
forever if you set the min height of
your body tag to be 100 view height
which is the size of your users browser
viewport it'll always fit you'll also
need to set position relative so you can
place absolutely positioned elements
like a footer at the bottom of the page
finally you might also want to clear the
margin of your body if you haven't
already since the default margin will
make your page just a bit too big and
your users will have scroll bars when
they don't need them one more thing to
remember the HTML element is what you
see when you scroll or drag over the
ends of your page so this is your
opportunity to give it a nice background
color such that when they go over their
edge they get a nice color that matches
well with your site remember to use men
height of 100 view height on your body
tag and remember to set an awesome color
on your HTML element for users who over
scroll your page this was fitting to
page the standard way see you on the
next hip yeah sure
you got me laughing now so I'm all happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
