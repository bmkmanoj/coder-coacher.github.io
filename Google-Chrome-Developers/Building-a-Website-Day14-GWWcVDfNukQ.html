has been exclusively Paul and now I'm
here I kind of snuck into the series
because I actually built something on
the chrome dev summit website
and I wanted to show you what I did
because I think it's really exciting so
the last few weeks I've been playing
around with VR and web they are a little
bit I'm just dabbling I'm you know just
trying things out and probably thought
it would be a really cool opportunity to
build like a 360 image of the s of jazz
center into the chrome dev summit
website for that people if they are not
able to join us live tomorrow they could
actually at least see what the venue
looks like and hey get more of a feel
for the space and it's available to us
and that's exactly what I did so if you
go into the little chrome dev summit
website developer dot chrome dot-com
slash dev summit and go to the location
sub page it saw us before still awesome
same web site that Paul built but you
have this tiny cardboard button and if
you click it we load the 360 view of the
s of jazz Center on a desktop with just
normal desktop you can just use your
mouse to pan around and get a feel for
what the surroundings look like if
you're on your phone you can actually
just hold the phone in your hand and
move around and have this as a like a
magic window into a different location
and you'll also have a cardboard button
that if you have a cardboard you can put
your phone inside it and actually move
your head around to actually feel even
more like you're there and if you have a
proper VR device you can actually use
that get into the location use a proper
like an oculus rift or the HTC vive or
whatever you have and use that to
actually take a look inside so as I said
this is sadly ajust a stereoscope edge
just a 3d 360 image so many acronyms 360
image it is not a stereoscopic image so
the perception of depth won't actually
be real but you will have like this is
basically a big 3d sphere with a texture
on the inside that you can look around
and to give you at least the the feel of
you looking around but not actually a
feel of of depth
so how do I do this how this this is
actually a good example of how a new
progressive enhancement with web PR
because if you don't have anything it
still works with Matt with mouse and
panning and you can just use your mouse
Lagaan it's already a pretty good
experience so let's dive into the code a
little bit
mostly I'm working with VR View which is
a great library that a colleague of mine
wrote which uses the VR polyfill and the
VR boilerplate so we are polyfill
basically polyfill to the web via our
API for your browser while the VR
boilerplate does the progressive
enhancement story to go from just a
canvas where you can pan around to
cardboard to to actual VR devices so if
you go into the component sections where
Paul has written different things like
the video hand on the desk the fading
the moving in and out of big picture
mode to small picture modes for the
video I wrote a new VR component and
it's actually mostly a lot of animation
and class JavaScript but most what it
does is it checks if you are on the Deaf
summit location sub page and if so it
will fade in the button or rather if
you're not on the dev summit location
sub page it will just not do anything
and then we hijack the masthead to
inject our little button and do
transitions and all of these kind of
things it's not not rocket science right
here and the interesting thing is
basically the two lines of the onclick
handler if you click on that button we
will hide the button because it needs to
go out of way and also will load the
script so that means we will load a
script on click this is usually not
recommended because it will take it mean
that if you click it there will be
especially if never loaded the script it
will take a lot of time until action
takes place however I thought that it's
probably not gonna be every single
visitor on the website instead it's
going to go into the VR experience
so both forcing the data onto the user
and loading it ahead of time just
because didn't seem like a good idea so
I just wanted to load it on demand and
the MEF the our script is again mostly
about hijacking so this is where
I used the our view the library and I
hijacked the master to inject a new
iframe we're inside I'm gonna have a
canvas with a 360 image and everything
this is all the things that the web BR
does for me and it's basically one call
so what I'm doing is I'm saying create a
new player from your web we are police
put it into the the our view Aidid
elements and use this image that we have
and that's basically all I have to do
and with this code it already worked and
after that I took a little bit closer
look into web yeah because the amount of
data we were transferring was was quite
big and it turns out that web we are
actually bundled the chakra player now
which makes sense because it also have
support for playing videos in what we
are or in a the our space and chakra
player is a module that basically does
adaptive streaming it Tunes down the
quality depending on how much bandwidth
you have at your disposal but we're
never gonna play a video here so
delivering that code of the user is just
going to waste so I'm basically ven
during the entire VR view into a third
party or a third party folder here and I
commented out thought of requires that
were in there and just recompile the
entire thing and shrunk the code down so
I think at this point when gzip we are
now delivering a hundred kilobytes of
code and 250 kilobytes of image data
which i think is it's still a lot of
data about it's acceptable most of the
time on mobile and it will not quick
enough most of the time other than that
it's very basic code I did find a nice
pattern which is creating functions that
create promises for both
requestanimationframe and transition end
so trends calling transition and promise
on an element will give you a promise
that resolves when transition end is
fired on that element and it allows you
to just do these changes chains as in
chain to chain promises together so I
call transition and promise on the
masthead and what is when that is done I
append a child I do a double wrap and
then I do again a class adaptation and
do a transition and promise again so
this is basically how I can just more or
less declaratively do any
sequences without using the actual web
animation API which is somewhat of a
nice work on it's not as powerful but it
makes stuff a little bit more readable
than having multiple levels indentations
because if you double arrive and all
these kind of things if you like this
let me know if you have questions let me
also know I am at the Surma on twitter
if you want to join us tomorrow at the
SF jesseman Center in person come by
it's gonna be great if you can't use the
features on the chrome summit website to
get notifications when we're going to go
live everything is going to be live
streamed subscribe also in this YouTube
channel because we have more great
things here that are going to come out
regularly so thank you for watching and
hopefully see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
