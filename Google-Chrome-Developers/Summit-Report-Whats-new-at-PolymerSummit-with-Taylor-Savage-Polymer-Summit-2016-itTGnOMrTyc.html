my inside voice because we are here at
polymer summit in the lounge area this
is where folks are going to kind of like
decompress in between sessions we got
foosball and polymer beanbag chairs and
all sorts of other crazy stuff back here
we're also streaming all the talks for
everyone to catch I'm here with Taylor
savage right now Taylor you're a product
manager on polymer just gave the big
opening keynote and you covered a bunch
of stuff in that keynote but you want to
give the folks watching maybe something
like a quick summary of some of the
highlights that you touched upon yeah
absolutely so overall we're a really
exciting moment right now web components
v1s Mellon C one shattered on v1
shipping natively across multiple
browsers in Safari in Chrome which means
that we can take advantage of these new
really great low level API in polymer so
we're also working on the next version
of polymer polymer 2 dot o I which will
take advantage of custom element v1
shadow Dom v1 and everything built with
polymer 2 dot a will be a truly native
low-level custom element so the other
big thing is you know community starting
to grow around web components we're
starting get a lot of excitement we're
exciting about other people building web
component libraries that going to
frameworks web components themselves and
so I'm really excited that we got to
roll out then new beta that web
components dot org catalog where anyone
can submit a web component it'll show
inline demos it'll show documentation
and so just a really exciting place to
share web components cool cool all right
so you mentioned there's new new catalog
and so is this I know that like polymer
has its own catalog and then there was
so how did these two are we reconciling
these worlds or how does that stuff work
yeah yeah totally so we have had the
elements a plumber project org polymer
element catalog for a while now but
that's just the polymer elements we've
gotten a lot of people asking can I put
my own on there and it's tough because
we shipped those and we work on those
elements as the plumber team and so we
want to have a certain kind of level of
quality and support for those elements
so we can't just kind of start putting
all the elements in there but that's a
bummer because we want all the element
in the same place we want everybody
looking for custom elements to going to
the same place get all the traffic on
the same place I'm so totally so right
now it's baited up when plethoric we're
still working on it actively lots of new
features to put in it's all open source
so please do send your contributions
start working on that catalog with us
but as soon as it's ready to ship we're
gonna move over all of polymers elements
they're actually already on there
from the polymer element catalog to that
web bonus that our catalog and that's
where you will go to get all of your web
component documentation all your
downloads searching for new components
setting up collections of components all
that stuff will be on that catalog right
on right on I'm very cool okay so for
for folks watching if there's like you
know one thing you could have them go to
you what would that one thing be yeah so
I'm gonna cheat on Lego two things one
is kick the tires on polymer to Dino
it's in a branch polymer two data
preview on the github slash polymer /
polymer and then the other thing is
start building opponents beta web
components that org is live it's open
right now you can submit Komodo
components right now you can check out
all the cool features you can build
inline downloads for your components you
can get really great structured
documentation so start building really
great high quality components to minimum
to that catalog I can't wait to go on
there and see all the cool new
components going up right on right on
alright so Taylor thank you so much for
being with me today I thank you all for
watching again if you're if you're
watching at home right now ping us on
the live stream or on Twitter with
hashtag Elinor summit you know keep the
conversation going there I hope you're
catching some some Polly Mon at this
point and I'm Rob Dodson coming at you
