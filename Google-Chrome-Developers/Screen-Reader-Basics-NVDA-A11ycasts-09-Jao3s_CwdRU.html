welcome back to the alley cash show so
today as promised we're going to be
doing an episode on NVDA the free screen
reader for Windows so to get started
with NVDA follow me over here to my
laptop and I have already gone over to
Envy access org this is the official
website of MBDA NVDA stands for
non-visual desktop access and what I
want to do here is just go click on the
download button and there's the the nice
thing about NVDA is that it is a free
and open source project and so they they
get their money through donations and so
if you have the means to and you you
like in VBA you can consider donating
before you download so as you go through
the download form there's a little
option here to do a donation if you
would like and then you can just click
this download button and I've already
gone ahead and downloaded NVDA so I'm
just kind of ready to rock so what I'm
going to do is fire it up using ctrl alt
n welcome to NVDA dialogue welcome to
NVDA so I'm gonna hit the the caps lock
key to tell it to to chill and stop
talking for a sec similar to a voice
over on the Mac NVDA has kind of like a
special NVDA modifier key which normally
is mapped to the insert key but this
dialog also lets you map it to the caps
lock key which is quite helpful if
you're on a laptop there's a few other
options in this dialog like you know
always show the dialog when it starts or
start NVDA when you open up windows
begin to fire it up you hit ctrl alt and
that's how you start the thing I'm gonna
hit OK though because I think I'm gonna
miss okay okay then here is nope and
then again I can hit caps lock whenever
I want to tell NVDA to stop talking so
what I'm going to do is give you sort of
like a brief tour of how to navigate the
page using in VTA so I've got a a spin
that I've created that just has a few
simple controls on it and this will get
us familiar with some of the basics of
moving around in the screen reader so
I'm on this page here this page just has
a few headings some paragraphs of text
and an input field with with a sign up
button next to it right so simple button
element so we know that most screen
reader users when they land on an
your document are going to navigate by
heading and to do that in NVDA we use
the H key so let's try that out 2nd
heading heading level 2 third heading
heading level 3 so the H key moves us
forward through the headings shift H is
going to move us backwards 2nd heading
first heading heading level one we can
also move by line by pressing the up and
down arrow keys so if I hit the down
arrow key we'll just move down in the
next paragraph text the first plummet
mouth is full of introductory content
this is web right we can also move by
individual character too and this is
useful for screen reading your users
when they land on a word that maybe the
the text-to-speech software pronounces
poorly select the word Udacity it'll
probably pronounce it in kind of a weird
way and so they might navigate through
the individual characters to see how
it's actually spelled so to do that we
just hit the left and right arrow keys h
e space if I write pretty easy now what
separates NVDA from a screen reader like
voiceover is that Mata is a modal screen
reader meaning when you're in voiceover
you're kind of always in the same mode
you're sort of always browsing around
you can kind of just interact with
things whenever you want and that's
because voiceover uses kind of an
elaborate set of keyboard shortcuts to
move around the screen with NVDA because
the screen or because the shortcuts are
sort of more abbreviated right they're
just single characters and things like
that it means that when we land on
something like a form control we need to
tell the screen reader to switch into a
special mode so we can interact with
that form so let's try that out so I've
got some form elements down here if I
want to jump to the next available form
element on the page I can hit the F key
and it does also completes the world so
you can see that put me on this text
field I can jump to the signup button by
hitting it again
sign up okay and just like we saw with
headings shift F is going to move us
backwards and it's also completes to the
world
now if I were to hit the H key to start
typing in this field what it's actually
going to do though is just move me to
the next heading because we haven't told
the screen reader dinner forms or focus
mode yet so to do that we'll use the
NVDA key which remember is caps lock and
the spacebar and you hear that little
tone right a little sort of typewriter
sound that tells the string reader user
that hey now you're in forms mode you
can start typing text kind of freeform
so I could say hello world
WP
because I have the caps lock key on it's
typing in all caps but you get the you
get the idea right you can type into the
text field whenever you want now to exit
forms mode we basically do the same
thing with the NVDA key + spacebar caps
lock + spacebar to get out and again
it'll play a little tone to tell us that
we're exiting forms mode now the the
last thing I want to show you is
application mode so sometimes when
you're interacting with a more complex
control you know something like a tree
or a tab panel or something like that
the Aria roles that you have on that
element instruct the screen reader to
enter application mode and in that mode
is just going to pass through all the
key presses that you uh that you hit
right to the control and that way the
control can handle all those keyboard
events and you know sort of implement
its own handling to give you an example
I'm going to go to the very useful Aria
authoring practices guide and I'm going
to find a pattern of a sort of a complex
controls I'm going to find a tab panel
combo box toggle to point final top with
with these complex illness often times
the the authoring practices guide
provides an example implementation so if
I scroll to the bottom of the tab panel
will give me an example I can interact
with well a bullet to the top ten to
fifteen Alecto open an example time okay
so here's an example tab panel on the
open Ajax site I'll stroll us a little
bit to make it easier to see right
that's all in frame all right so what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to start
interacting with this control
application just clone it at once
application tab control cluster tab
selected 104 and so it told us it's a
tab control it told us that it's a tab
selected one of four and because we're
now in application mode even though it's
not playing like a special sound or
anything like that we can actually move
through these elements using just the
arrow keys on our keyboard so for
instance with the right arrow key event
is top selected County whole time
believe I beat Thomas right that's going
through and selecting different tabs I
could also hit up and down arrow keys
across the top County Bowl top selected
so far so good and if I want to move
into the contents of the tab panel
itself I can hit the the tab key on my
keyboard County for property page select
on the boat and then we can just tap
through these and hit spacebar to sort
of check or uncheck the checkboxes as
needed taste its face checked and then
shift tab to get back to the tabs yep
tom control county whole time meant
trust time select right so far so good
let's see the last thing that I want to
show off is kind of a really cool and
useful mode I think it's called like
elements mode so you hit caps lock + f7
so what this is going to do is basically
go through and if you remember from the
voiceover tutorial we talked about the
rotor and how you can jump to headings
and landmarks and and links using the
rotor so you don't have to navigate
through every single thing in the page
manually the elements list is basically
the exact same thing for NVDA so we can
see a list of links if we feel to my
adult left tab and get down to a filter
field so we could filter down to one
particular link that we're looking for
we can shift tab to go back to the top
treat type grouping link slip use the
arrow keys to move to for instance
headings headings radio button checked
alt + H and then we can use the up and
down arrow keys to select one of these
headings link radio button checked all
headings read over three you open and
level one examples at mail and market
intervals and I'll take us to that
portion of the page now similar to a
voiceover sometimes you you might not
see the page scroll as you're navigating
using NVDA that's totally fine it's just
kind of a quirk of the screen reader but
it's not something to be sort of alarmed
or freaked out about so yeah I think
that about covers that we've touched on
a lot of the basics of working with NVDA
I'm going to include a couple links down
at the bottom one is - a web in guide
that has a whole bunch of shortcuts for
NVDA kind of like a really useful cheat
sheet
the other one is - my friend Marcy
Sutton's egghead Oviedo which goes a
little bit more in depth on NVDA and
actually shows how to navigate a real
page on Wikipedia so both of those
resources are super useful for getting
started especially if you're new to
these screen readers otherwise if you
have any questions you can always leave
them for me down below in the comments
or you can hit me up on a social network
of your choosing
as always thanks so much for watching
and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
