engineer on the polymer team if you
manage to pick up on my accent in the
last five words
I am indeed Australian and it's honored
to be followed up by Trey my fellow
Aussie as well
prior to joining this team I'd worked on
the beloved chrome dev tools one of my
smallest but maybe my greatest
contribution was adding the ability to
rearrange tabs in dev tools there's
probably the greatest five lines I've
ever written I did work another five
other features so if you find me
afterwards feel free to ask me about
them and I might share dev tools trickle
to more recently I've had the humbling
experience of building web components at
all and witnessing all the incredible
components that all of you have built
and published for example the one and
only Pokemon selector and if you're the
person who says but there's a Hanyu only
151 pokemon in the original set
well there's even an option that lets
you set that too so all kudos to Sammy
for this it was however in the process
of building web components at all which
brings us to what we're here to talk
about today so first I'm going to cover
my story of how I came to encounter this
SEO problem while building web
components our dog will then look at how
I used have less chrome to solve this
before diving into all the details of
how that actually works and how you can
use it so I'm going to take a step back
for a moment and talk about what I
learnt in the process of building web
components a talk the first thing I
learned was how the platform supports
encapsulation through the use of web
components with this encapsulation comes
with inherent code reuse which leads to
a specific architecture I also learnt
about progressive web apps and how they
can provide us with fast engaging
experiences I learned how the platform
provides api's such as service workers
to help enable those experiences
as I learned how to compose web
components to build a progressive web
app we've heard from Kevin yesterday
about the purple pattern
push render precache lazy load as a
method of optimizing delivery of this
application to the user and one of the
architectures which enables us to
utilize the purple panel is the app
shell model it provides us with instant
reliable performance by using an
aggressively cached app shell you can
see that for all the requests which hit
our server we serve the entry point file
which we serve regardless of the route
the client then requests the app shell
which is similar but because the same
URL across the application we can
combine that with a serviceworker to
achieve near-instant loading on repeated
visits the shell is then responsible for
looking at the actual route that was
requested and then request the necessary
resources to render that route so this
point I'd learned how to build a
progressive web app using client-side
technologies like web components in
polymer and how to use patterns such as
the purple pan to deliver this
application quickly to the user then
there's the elephant in the room SEO for
some of these BOTS they're basically
just running curl with that URL and stop
right there
no rendering no JavaScript so what are
we left with
with this PWA that we built using the
app shell model we're left with just
your entry point file which has no
information in it at all and in fact
it's the same generic entry point file
that you serve across your entire
application so this is particularly
problematic for web components which
require JavaScript to be executed for
them to be useful this issue applies to
all search engine indexes that don't
render JavaScript but it also applies to
the plethora of link rendering BOTS out
there there's a social BOTS like
Facebook and to
but don't forget the enormous number of
link renting BOTS such as slack hangouts
Gmail you name it so what is it about
the app shell model that I'd really like
to keep well for me this approach pushes
our application complexity out to the
client you can see that the server has
no understanding of routes it just
serves the entry point file and he has
no real understanding of what the user
is actually trying to achieve this
allows our server to be significantly
decoupled from the front end application
since it now only needs to expose a
simple API to read and manipulate data
the client that we pushed out to the
application that we pushed out to the
client is then responsible for servicing
this data to the user and mediating user
user interactions to manipulate this
data so I asked can we keep this simple
architecture that we know and we love
and also solve this SEO use case with
zero performance cost so then we thought
what if we just use headless chrome to
render on our behalf so here's a
breakdown of how that would work
we have our regular users who are making
a request and they would like a cat
picture because who wouldn't and as part
of this approach we ask our robot and to
answer this we look at the user agent
string and check if it's an own bot that
doesn't render in this case the user can
render so we serve the page as we
normally would the server responds with
the fetch cat picture function and then
the client can go and execute that
function to get the rendered result by
the way this is one of my kittens which
I fostered recently which is super
adorable now when we encounter a boss we
can look at a user agent string and
determine that they don't render and
instead of serving that fetch cat
picture function we fire for a quest to
headless Chrome
to render this page on our behalf and
then we send the serialized rendered
response back to the bar so they can see
the full contents of the page so I built
a proof-of-concept of this approach for
web components rock and it worked
I wrote a medium post about it and
people really interested in this
approach and want to see more of it so
based on this response I eventually
decided that instead of my hacky
solution that I would build it properly
but then came the most challenging part
of any project and I know you've all
experienced it as well naming so I asked
on our team chat for some suggestions
and I got a tongue
so these are some of our top ones
there's some great ones in their power
renders use the platform as a renderer
however today I'm very pleased to
introduce render Tron let me render that
for you
Brenda Tron is a doc arised headless
chrome rendering solution so that's a
mouthful so let's break it down
first off what is docker and why did I
use it well no one knows what it means
but it's provocative in all seriousness
docker containers allow you to create
lightweight images and standalone
executable packages which isolate
software from its surrounding
environment in render Tron
we have headless chrome packaged up in
this container so that you can easily
clone and deploy this to wherever you
like
so what about headless chrome it was
introduced in chrome 59 for Linux and
Mac chrome 60 for Windows and it allows
chrome to be run in environments which
don't have a UI interface such as a
server this means that you can now use
Chrome as part of any any part of your
tool chain you can use it for automated
testing you can use it for measuring the
performance of your application
generating PDFs amongst many other
things
headless chrome itself exposes a really
basic JSON API for managing tabs with
most of the power coming from the dev
tools protocol all of dev tools is built
on top of this protocol so it's a pretty
powerful API and one of the key reasons
that headless chrome is great is that
now we're bringing the latest and
greatest from chrome to ensure that all
the latest web platform features are
supported with render Truong this means
that net your SEO can now be a
first-class environment which is no
different
the rest of your users so just a quick
shout out this all sounds really
interesting to you and you would like to
include headless chrome in some other
way in your to a chain there's a brand
new library node library that was
published just last week that exposes a
high level API to control chrome while
also bundling all of chrome inside that
node package so you can check it out on
github at google chrome slash puppeteer
so we've looked at the high level of how
headless chrome can fit into your
application to fulfill your SEO needs
now it's time to dive to how it works
but I've been talking a lot so who wants
to see render tron in action alright so
this is the hacker news PWA created by
some of my awesome colleagues and it's
built using polymer and web components
it loads really fast and all-round
performs pretty well we can see that
there's a separate network requests
which loads the main content that we see
and we can guess that it's affected by
this SEO problem since it uses web
components which require JavaScript and
it pulls the in data asynchronously
so one quick way to verify this is by
disabling JavaScript and refreshing the
page and once we do that we can see that
we still get the app header since that
was in the initial request but we lose
the main content of the page which isn't
good so we jump over to render Truong
the headless chrome service that is
meant to render and serialize this for
you so I wrote this UI as a quick way to
put in a URL and test the output from
render Tron so first off what are we
hoping to see because these bots only
perform one request we want to see that
whole page come back in that one network
request we also want to see that it
doesn't need any JavaScript to do this
so take a look I'm going to put in the
hacker news URL and tell render Tron to
render and serialize this and that
using web components and it renders
correctly I'm going to disable
JavaScript and verify that it still
works so you can see it's still there
and it all comes back in that single
network requests render tron
automatically detects when your PWA has
completed loading it looks at the page
load event and ensures that it has fired
but we know that's a really poor
indication of when the page is actually
completed loading so Rena Tron also
ensures that any async work has been
completed and it also looks at your
network requests to make sure they're
finished as well in total you have a
ten-second rendering budget this doesn't
mean that it waits 10 seconds though
it'll finish as soon as your rendering
is complete if this is insufficient for
you you can also fire a custom event
which signals to rent Ron that your PWA
has completed loading serializing web
components is tricky because of shadow
Dom which it straps away part of the dom
tree so to keep things simple rennet ron
uses shady Dom which polyfills shadow
Dom this allows render tron to
effectively serialize the dom tree so
that it can be preserved in the output
so let's take a look at the news PWA
which you've all seen and it's also
built by some of my other colleagues and
we'll plug that in to render tron will
then ask render tron to render this as
well and that I'm also using web
components and then we have it so what
do you need to do to enable this
behavior with polymer 1 this is super
easy and render tron doesn't actually
need to do anything simply append
D'Amico's shady to the URLs that you
pass to render Tron and polymer 1 will
ensure that shady Dom is used with
polymer 2 and with web web components v1
it's recommended you use web components
loader jeaious which pulls in all the
right polyfills
on different browsers you then set a
flag to render tron tell it that telling
it that you're using web components
and it will ensure that the necessary
polyfills that it needs for
serialization get enabled so another
feature of render Tron is that it lets
you set HTTP status codes these status
codes are used by indexes as important
signals for example if he comes across a
404 it's not going to link to that page
because that will be a really poor
search result now server though it's
still returning that entry point bar
with a status code of 200 okay so it
looks like every URL exists rena-chan
lets you configure that status code from
within your PW a which understands when
a page is invalid simply add meta tags
dynamically is fine to signal to render
on what the status code should be render
tron will then pick these up and return
that status code to the bot so this
approach isn't specific to polymer or
even web components let's plug in
Fahnestock google.com and sees what
happens when we serialize it so that
looks pretty good
who can guess what javascript library
was used to build google fonts angular
render Trond works with any and all
client-side technologies that work in
Chrome and whose Dom tree can be
serialized the render tron endpoint also
features screenshot capabilities so that
you can check that headless chrome and
the load detecting function are
performing as you expect
unfortunately this service is not fast
for each URL that we render we spin up
headless Chrome to render that entire
page so performance is strictly tied to
the performance of your PWA Renat Ron
does however implement a perfect cache
this means that if we have rendered the
same page within a certain cache
freshness threshold will serve the
cached response instead of rear-ending
it again so how can you get your hands
on this today and how do you use it well
first you need to deploy the random tron
service to an end
you'll need to clone the github repo at
Google Chrome slash magnetron and it's
built primarily for Google cloud so it's
easy to deploy there but if you remember
this is a darker container so you can
deploy this to anywhere which supports a
docker image so to make things simple
for you to test our we have the demo
service endpoint which you can hit at
render - Tron appspot.com
and that's the one with the UI that we
saw earlier it is not intended to be
used as a production endpoint however
you are welcome to use it but we make no
guarantees on uptime having this as a
ready to use service is something we
might consider based on the interest
receive so just in case you're wondering
my boss's twitter handle is at met Matt
s McNulty just in case you want to tell
him how awesome I am so once we have
that endpoint up you're going to need to
install some middleware in your
application to do the user agent
splitting that I was talking about
earlier
so this middleware needs to look at the
user agent figure out whether or not
they can render and if not proxy the
requests through the render tron
endpoint if you're using purple server
which is a node server designed to serve
production applications using purple you
simply need to specify the bot proxy
option and provide it with your rennet
on endpoint if you're using Express
there's a middleware that you can
include directly by saying app don't use
render on top make middleware with the
proxy endpoint and whether or not you're
using web components if you're not using
either of these check the docs for a
list of community maintained bit aware
there's a firebase function there as
well as a list of existing middleware
that render China is compatible with if
it's not listed it's also fairly simple
to roll your own middleware by simply
proxying based on the user agent string
and that's it that's all the changes you
need to make to use render tron today
and all these bots can now be happy
Brenda Tron is available to use today
compatible with any client-side
technologies including both
polymer 1 and polymer 2 thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
