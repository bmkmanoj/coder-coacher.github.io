web series about solving web problems
with standards these tips are part of
the platform and work with any
frameworks or libraries these are quick
tips so let's go if you're building a
single page application a website that
changes its content without reloading
make sure the browser's sack and forward
buttons do something not just send you
back to your favorite search engine
let's see how when a user click
something or changes the state you can
call history push date to set a new URL
without changing the page you also want
to add a prop State handler if we user
presses back or forwards you'll be
called with the URL and any state you
passed so you can reconfigure your page
that's actually it but when you're
setting new URLs remember this if you
use a load that URL in a new browser tab
it should be able to bring up your
expected state the key here is these
URLs can't just be imaginary there's
another option if you don't want to
worry about lots of real URLs you can
also set window dot location dot hash
that's the hash bit at the end of the
URL and add a hash change handler to be
told when it changes this lets you
change the URL without needing a real
page under the hood remember use push
state and a pop state handle that
configures your page to keep your users
back and forward buttons doing something
sensible that's back and forwards the
standard way
everyone stand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
