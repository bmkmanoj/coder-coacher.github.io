can be very useful information because
lazy load images once they come into
view you could stop playing a video once
it goes out of you or you could save to
your analytics how much of your blog
post was actually read by the user
intersection observer are a performance
API that notify you when element enters
or leave the viewport intersection
observers are very efficient to work
across iframes and a perfect to react to
scrolling to use intersection observer
create a new intersection observer by
passing it a callback function for each
element that you're interested called or
observe on the intersection observer
from now on whenever any of the observed
elements enter or leave the viewport
your callback will be called with
details about what happened and to which
element intersection observer offer a
couple of options one of them being the
thresholds option you can set the
threshold option to an array of numbers
between 0 and 1 to get multiple
notifications per elements for example
if you set the threshold option to 0.33
0.66 and 1 you'll get notification not
only on entrance and exit but also when
one-third or two-thirds of the elements
area are in view for more information on
the use cases and options read my
article in the description below bye I
am a true artist and my work just
convinced you of that so if you want
more you should subscribe to this
channel and if you want to watch the
latest supercharged live stream you can
