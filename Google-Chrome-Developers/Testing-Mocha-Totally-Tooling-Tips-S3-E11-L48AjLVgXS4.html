on see some people say that we have
tooling fatigue in the JavaScript
community I don't know what they're
talking about not everyone I really
don't so let's see we have Q unit back
in 2008 it was pretty popular still
people still use it that's the one that
runs in the browser yeah just
popularized I think by the jQuery
project ran well in C I didn't have
amazing support for async testing back
then or headless testing support yep
then we had Jasmine yeah come after that
it looks super similar to mark it up
yeah required to using karma or a
Jasmine node for your test runner had a
headless testing setup out-of-the-box
lots of CI support BDD nice then you had
maka which you wanted to talk about
today so MUC is like so main reason I
like it you can run it in node you can
run it in the window you can run it in a
worker which at the moment I'm doing a
ton of stuff testing across browsers
which helps with node ton of stuff where
I'm testing like caches in the window
and then service workers which are
workers so having maka run in all three
things is like super nice and basically
the way it works is you just call
describe function bus in a string and a
callback string defines the test suite
and then the callback is just the thing
that gets caught by maka and then you
start running your tests so a single
test is basically call it passed in a
string of describing what the single
test should do and then another callback
which is like your actual test you do
certain things and then you'd use like
an assertion library to then basically
say this is the thing that I expect to
happen make sure that this is it and
markers got like async testing helpers
like done but you don't have to use that
no so so you can pass it down to your
callback and when you call it that's
basically telling mark oh hey I finished
the test move on to the next one but you
can also just execute like synchronous
code and it will just figure it out or
if you return a promise it'll figure out
what to do based off of that
sure normally what you'll end up seeing
is people using it with
thing called chai which is an assertion
library which basically chai has two
modes you either use expect or you use
should and the difference is meant to be
the kind of testing you do I don't know
enough about that to really comment on
it generally I use a thing called should
from try and basically what that means
is whenever you get a value from a
function or something should like adds a
ton of stuff to the prototype so in the
stupid example of two plus two equals
four you do two plus two you get a value
and then you go value dot equal four and
that's basically the assertion bit
because if value doesn't equal four then
the whole test will fail and then maka
will go it doesn't make sense
you're stupid so maka Choi Jasmine it
sounds like you need a lot of caffeine
to make it in this industry yeah I kind
of want us to do our own test runner and
just call it like triple venti half
speed camera macchiato Jas you nearly
messed up
I nearly did but you pulled it off so
why did I feel good I feel good about
that I want to get the top of hacker
news without being be great okay just
the five you said that statement means
you're gonna get down but it did heavily
most likely but you're assuming anyone
actually watches this show that's a two
so frameworks generally usually some of
the tools that we talked about just now
so like and some don't um amber people I
think still use ember q unit
okay stuff do these like just have
helpers around it's just helped us
around it mostly okay
the angular team for angular 2 I believe
they're still using like jasmine and
karma for their stuff in polymer we're
using mocha and chai still with web
component tester yep it's on the whole
that's not entirely all crazy and then
there's Sid there's new one the Ava Ava
Ava Ava is like a concurrent so that I
think that's the nice thing about Ava's
is a clear like selling point there is
the fact that it'll run multiple tests
simultaneously I was actually gonna try
that out but I hit enough problems with
service workers that I wanted it to do
bit by bit yeah but I am hoping that I
can kind of switch to Ava as soon as it
kind of gets browser support it's got a
beautiful logo but Ava's
able is also good for like when you when
you're working with
tests are particularly io heavy it just
deals really well with those nice
yeah we've probably not covered all of
the test runners and libraries ever
created in the Java community 23 more
probably being invented while we've been
shooting just make sure you use one of
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
