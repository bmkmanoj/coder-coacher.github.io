something that product managers don't
normally talk about I'm going to talk
about operations and not going to follow
the subject in that is in your in the
the scheduled before I before I dive in
a lot of my talk is is it's related to
web RTC but it's also about the bits
around WebRTC about the things that are
required to run a web RTC service and I
want to talk a little bit about some of
the lessons we've learned oh just quick
about twilio if you're not familiar well
we've got really bad resolution here if
you're not familiar with twilio we
provide a cloud platform for building
communications apps of all kinds carrier
connectivity all over the world we have
over over 750 750 thousand developers on
the platform and our processing more
than 50 billion interactions with our
API a year so I think you know if you've
been working with Weber DC for a while
you know that the simple case you know
it's a testament to the strength of the
Weber to see API is that it's easy to
get something simple up and running
quickly a peer-to-peer call between two
instances of chrome is is not
challenging but the complexity of web of
a WebRTC service scales very rapidly and
it does not scale linearly it gets
you're introducing more variables into
the equation and more things can go
wrong you know it starts when you just
want to talk to another browser if you
want to talk to Firefox your client
needs to get thicker to deal with the
differences in the Weber to see
implementations if you want to have more
reliable network connectivity or support
mobile devices you need to introduce
turn and you need to get whatever to see
compiling for mobile apps then if you
want to support multi party like a male
talked about you need to introduce media
servers and at that point you'll
probably also want to separate signaling
from media and two because they have
very different scaling properties and
move your the state of your your
application out into a separate service
so now we've got even more boxes running
here and then someone like me a lousy
product manager will come along and say
well we want to connect to sip devices
too so you introduce a sip gateway and
and then you know next thing you know
you're calling
stn phones and at each at each step here
we're introducing more things that can
and will break and we're introducing
them in a multi-point network all over
the world you know things things will go
wrong networks fail services fail hosts
fail something will break something's
breaking at twilio all the time and we
hope you don't know that we hope that
we've built a system that can protect
customer applications from those
failures so we don't have perfect
solutions for all of this but I wanted
to share just a handful of the tools
that we've created over the over the
course of running a web RTC service for
a few years now and and hopefully
they'll be useful to you things break
for a bunch of reasons you know you've
got in a cloud service hosts fail at
random networks degrade you have you
have to deal with people on on the
internet trying to do bad things sending
traffic to your servers that you may not
expect and you you also have human
elements things you can control things
like operational miss mishaps and just
inadequate testing in your code bugs
you've introduced because we're human
beings as I mentioned these things are
happening all the time at twilio you
know we have tens of service failures a
week something you know some alert is
going off something is paging someone is
looking into something because it is
such a large network but we've been able
to deliver one hundred percent up time
for the last two quarters and we'll have
ninety-nine point nine five percent up
time for the year in our web RTC service
so the first thing and most important
part of our of our strategy for dealing
with failure is to test constantly we we
have a set of what we call end-to-end
testers if you're ever talking to a to
Leon they might even mention them they
might say our ed-e tests or end end
testers and these are a set of
applications that are continually
hammering our service like a customer
would they're they're continually
testing the the cloud the same way the
customers will now we learned a few
things when we when we built these our
first attempt was to build
using the node WebRTC project so these
end n testers by the way these are
running on servers running on servers
either in Amazon or in another cloud and
they are making requests into the twilio
cloud our first approach was to use a
server based project like node WebRTC to
try to you know act like a browser
client we found that that was just
really really difficult it's hard to
keep WebRTC running well on a server
right now just server-side WebRTC isn't
quite isn't quite there yet so we what
we ended up doing overtime is we've
actually separated separated these
things we we broke out our signaling
tests from our media tests and so we
have a set of very light weight fast
tests they're continually making sure
that the the signaling infrastructure is
available and and that's that's really
key because the the lot of the
application logic will is of course
living at the signaling layer and so so
we have a set of tests running a node
that are simple WebSocket clients of our
gateway that are constantly exercising
various application functionality then
we have a set of Robo callers we call
them these are basically headless
browser tests running on using the
latest version of Chrome using Chrome
Canary as well and and Firefox and any
other browser that comes along with
WebRTC or ortc support to to act like a
browser will when it's interacting with
our service these tests run less
frequently maybe once every five minutes
but they give us the combination of
these tests give us a full picture of
the availability of our service at any
given point in time we aggregate events
from these tests in a product called
roll bar roll bar is a great tool if you
are operating any kind of service or
application I highly recommend it so we
we pull all these things into roll bar
it gives us the ability to aggregate
events to look very easily identify
changes in event patterns and set off
pagers if necessary when things go wrong
we also have a bunch of end-to-end
manual testing tools so you're just a
handful of them and there are others
that i haven't depicted and that the the
idea here is that automated tests
always catch everything you you will as
as browsers change as we release new
versions of our SDKs as we make changes
in the cloud you you sometimes you miss
things and so we have a infrastructure
in place that the minute we can the
minute we identify that something's gone
wrong we can jump into a set of tools
that allow us to very quickly exercise a
very specific scenario so for example we
want to connect to a conference mixer in
the twilio cloud or we want to connect
to a PSTN n point where we want to make
a call from a sip endpoint to a WebRTC
endpoint or we want to make a call
between two WebRTC endpoints these are
all scenarios that are kind of big
locked and loaded and ready to go and so
we can figure out when things have gone
wrong very quickly one of the one of the
things that we've started doing more
recently that I think is pretty cool is
we're also using chat as a control plane
for this so you know we are using
hipchat and but this is this can be done
in slack as well we have a set of a very
easy BOTS set up so that we can just
issue commands in our hitch in our
team's hip chat window and run a set of
end-to-end tests against the entire
cluster and moment's notice and then get
a report back with which tests Pat's
past which tests failed at the end of
this we end up with a with a sort of a
layered approach to service monitoring
so we've got end-to-end tests running at
both signaling and media layers we have
an anomaly detection service that is
looking for changes in behavior and
generating pages or alerts if anything
seems seems to have changed we have your
typical host monitoring tools through
nagios and we have this set of manual
tools that allow us to very quickly test
so you know there's the I already talked
about how things fail but you not only
have to plan for things to fail you have
to plan for what happens when you
recover from a failure here's what I
mean you are a simplified view of a
portion of Toledo's architecture looks
like this we have we have a DNS
have a DNS name pointing to our gateways
that actually does DNS distribution to a
number of load balancers in a given AWS
region behind that we have a set of
gateways for signaling and then further
back behind that we actually have a
registrar if you're not familiar with
the concept of a registrar this is just
a database that keeps track of where
users are connected right now so if
someone tries to call them you can ring
their phone this isn't important if
you're doing sort of a room based WebRTC
app but if you want to have a persistent
connection so that you can reach someone
quickly we like to have a phone call
sort of use case you need a registrar to
keep track of where everyone is so you
know obviously we've built redundancy
into this architecture if if we've got a
client connected to load balancer a and
they were routed to Gateway if gateway a
fails well they can be redirected to
gateway be they can reconnect if the if
load balancer a fails that client can
connect to load balancer be and get and
get connected to a gateway be and but
what happens when this in this scenario
what if it's not just one client but
thousands or hundreds of thousands or
millions of clients connected and you
have a load balancer just go away
because that happens sometimes in the
cloud well this is first-hand experience
here what will happen is that all of
these clients will start hammering load
balancer a and in a way that you might
not have thought of this happened this
is this happen to us a couple years ago
and caused a cause some significant
problems it led us to think about this
failure case of okay what happened let's
look at our peak number of connections
and let's consider what would happen if
all those peak connections had to move
from one balancer to another or one data
center to another at the drop of a hat
would we be able to handle that handle
that shift it ended up with us putting
in extensive rate limiting both on the
balancers and the gateways you also have
to think about when you're under that
when you're recovering from that failure
what happens to your database layer do
you how do you handle locking in your
database for because you'll be getting
hit with a bunch of registration
requests very quickly and you have to
know you have to be able to make sure
that your registrar can write all those
record
down without getting bogged down so next
I think you know we've already touched
on this a bit in hippo did a great job
of talking about some of the ways some
some great web urgency apps are working
around lousy networks we found that you
know as we started using WebRTC on
mobile we needed to get more effective
at testing in in poor quality network so
that we can understand various
trade-offs we're making should we use
what it what does it like to use h.264
versus vp8 on an iOS device and how does
that shift based on you know various
Network conditions is it are we getting
much more out of out of hardware
acceleration in a typical network
environment this is there's just some of
the questions we asked and we needed a
way to inject various Network conditions
into into our environment and measure
the results you know you can do this on
one machine if you're using a mac apple
provides a network link conditioner you
can go download this it's great if you
just want to do a test through the
simulator it doesn't it doesn't scale
well though so what we actually did was
we another another node app we created
we created a note app called network
throttle or you can go see this on
github if you're interested this is just
a nodejs service that run that basically
issues commands to net em and it runs on
a Raspberry Pi and so we have a Wi-Fi
interface on a Raspberry Pi running this
network emulator and we can do things
like simulate a 3g network simulate a 4g
network simulate high loss at various
levels and so we have a kind of a closed
environment that we have set up in our
office in Mountain View where we can run
tests under various Network conditions
and and really get a sense for how how
WebRTC and how our customers will
experience situations under typical
Network conditions and on that point the
next the next major tool we use is weber
disease get stats API when we I think
anyone
who's operated a communication service
of any kind and a bunch of you in this
room have done that you know that you
will always have complaints about call
quality you will always have reports of
one way audio you will always have
complaints about video quality because
networks are networks are hard and
they're not reliable and so about about
a year ago we started aggressively
gathering statistics from get stats on
all of our chrome endpoints and and
Firefox as well we pull the get stats
API we take the statistics we get back
we bundle them up in a standard format
and we push them to amazon kinesis if
you're not familiar with Kinesis it's a
great product for dealing with large
sets of data and kind of subscribing to
different data streams to process them
in various ways we pump the data out of
Kinesis into some real time monitoring
tools so that we can see changes in call
quality for various customers and we
also pump them into redshift for
historical reporting so we have a long
term reporting and real-time monitoring
of call quality via the get stats API
some of the stats we capture you know we
look audio input level audio output
level all the typical things you would
see in the get stabbed say P I I know
this is a kind of a moving get stats as
a moving target in all the browsers and
you have to you have to kind of roll
your own if you're dealing with WebRTC
natively but it highly encourage you to
take a look at this here's some of the
patterns we look for you know kind of
obvious ones for it for a given customer
we just if we see packet loss drop off
for a customer that we know is working
out of a single office location well we
know they're probably having really bad
call quality right now if we see spikes
and jitter or latency some of the other
more complex ones calls that are greater
than five seconds but have no audio or
have an audio or have a low audio input
level or if we see calls that are set up
for you know 30 seconds 50 seconds but
there are no packets sent from the
browser these are indications of one way
audio and a good story here is this we
were able to use this tool to identify
some an issue
you i think it was in chrome 41 there
was a very very weird i think actually
the fellow from Wix mentioned it was a
very very unusual scenario where if you
were using a USB headset on a Mac in
chrome 41 and it was more likely to
occur if you were if your app was served
over HTTPS you would have a frequent
occurrence of one way audio the HTTPS
thing wasn't really a factor in getting
access to the microphone but it was
because you weren't calling get user
media all the time that and prompting
the user that it was less likely that
you would get get corrupted audio stream
so using using some of these heuristics
we were able to identify hey look we've
got a pattern of the number of one way
audio calls just increased from
tremendously based on the latest release
of chrome we should probably dive in and
do something there we also look we we
look at all these things by very you
know by various vectors you know we look
by twilio account by the identity of a
given endpoint what browser are they
using so we try to identify changes in
behavior the last thing I'll say is that
operational excellence kind of building
these tools thinking about these tools
Carrie caring about service up time is
an issue of culture it is a it is a team
effort it does not come for free and so
some of the things we do at twilio to
kind of build this into the way we work
we write the SLA or we try to at least
we don't always get this right but we
try to write the SLA first when we're
designing a new product or service we
start with the service level we want to
deliver to our customers when i started
at twilio there was an old saying right
the api first that came from our roots
is an API common company and we've
modified that over time to not only
write the APAP i first but write the
service level first as well we also have
a culture where the teams that build a
service operate that service in
production there is no ops team we have
we have people who are in support but
the people who build services operate
them so there's a very personal a sense
of personal ownership of service quality
five wise analysis I probably don't need
to talk about what that is regular fire
drills actually creating incidents
either in a development environment or
even in a controlled way perhaps even in
a production environment and responding
to the fire drill making sure that you
have the the well-oiled machine so you
can respond to an incident etc so last
thing I'll say is communication tools or
only as good as their availability you
know we we've all had that experience
where we go to use a communication
service we're going to use a product and
it just isn't there something doesn't
quite work so this is this is key
hopefully you find some of these tools
useful Thanks good thanks Rob that was
really interesting when we take some
some questions quick anybody I'll look
in the back first yeah maybe I'll start
robbing maybe uh yes what would you say
is the most common issue that you see
with WebRTC um I think we still see up
right now we still see a lot of one way
audio problems for various reasons you
know could be anything to do with dtls
changes ice failures etc that's probably
one of the most common audios yeah air
did you come across any best practices
for injecting streams during testing no
that's something we're still working on
I think our media testing is is you know
we're still improving but we have we do
a set of things where we you know play
audio through the browser and we try to
play it back but but nothing too
complicated there what percentage of
your customers using all University
video calls almost all of our calls are
audio right now so twilio giulio did not
have a video product we were using web
RTC since 2012 we've not had a video
product in the market until earlier this
year so do a lot of WebRTC calls but
they're all audio
that last one so what tools are you
using now to identify those patterns of
when you see there's flaws is that the
browser is it yeah like I said roll bar
and some of our own anomaly detection
tools are really key I think the key
thing for identifying issues in the
browser is for us we use get stats a lot
we use the automated tests selenium
based on beta Channel and canary of all
the of each of the browsers those are
those are the key things for us awesome
thanks Rob thanks all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
