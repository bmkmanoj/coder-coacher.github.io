those kind of back-and-forth and like
train the designer is just someone who
just paints on little bit or tweener
developers just someone who is like a
very robotic make this exactly without
having any kind of whole emotion well I
guess leave the ultimate thing is to
feel included right yes and the time
suppose that's work for me is when I've
been brought in early but even if it's I
am at an agency between parts of the
product pitch you can just sort of
hiding in the back of the room or
whatever I was there for the very starts
where the sort of ideas are being talked
about that might you know after some
negotiation actually convened something
I will end up developing here the agency
I works ideas very well whether you
would have all the designs would be on
the wall so I would be able to walk up
to them in sort of see you know what
would become my job very soon how did
you find our work I mean to that change
the way you develop the approach design
stuff for that relationships I mean when
I first looked at the agency I kind of
when I walked in as for all of these
printouts from the wall it felt very
low-tech
I was like what I mean are we work
digitally why we got you know printouts
of things but just being able to sort of
have an overview of everything like that
seeing the project like the map of the
project woman yeah yeah and to be able
to sort of just sort of glance over it
as I was walking past and go oh hang on
like I heard that bit is going to be
particularly difficult and I know a
slightly a very similar thing that's
going to be so much easier or say
something and go all that looks exciting
I've got ideas about we could animate
that I do something and I can go
straight to the designer and say you
know I felt like I was in so it's part
of the project a it's always saying my
honest move these things around like
animates over the design over like check
that terrible height again if it don't
ever talk to me or my children ever
again but they but then sometimes it's
like oh yeah this is a hint of a good
idea in there let me work on that we
advocate like a process called design
sprints which is all about getting
everybody working together so you come
up with an idea or everyone shares like
the challenges and you come avoid is to
give us like developers but engineers is
that designers working together like or
is that the
working together if everybody involved
in in the product itself so and
typically other stakeholders from
finance from marketing from developer
from design from research everyone and
the big boss and and everyone's kind of
sharing and going through this like
typically four to five day process where
they learning about the challenge coming
up with ideas and voting on it praying
approach I've been testing it and we
find that this kind of doing things
collaboratively and also the part of the
process you're in a room where you're
walking able to come to warn you
lots of sticky note paper and and allows
everyone to emphasize each other's
position and also respect the authority
of the knowledge that everyone else has
in the world otherwise what happens is
you just have this conveyor bill that
marketing will come in and say no you
don't know what you're you're just a
painter you're just in whatever a
builder just do these things that I wear
they may not necessarily have the
expertise to kind of know like how UX or
behavior or performance or accessibility
works well I think in the same way that
they're talking about there's a benefit
to a designer knowing you know some of
the development tools and I think it
cuts both ways I think a developer
should know their way around like
Photoshop sketching you know especially
whichever tool that designs it the
product manager needs to know both right
they need to have an appreciation for
both systems and that it's not just you
know off you go in a room and come back
with a blank piece of paper again so go
away and you come back with gold you
know like since joining give one this is
for you and say Paul Lewis like
performance is I really be horrified of
like my god all these things I've been
creating which is about you know really
badly performance that's like how would
you know well how would I know rather
boys I guess it's it's more than sir the
developer isn't in that case I think to
I because it's not like things don't get
slower the more colors you use or
necessarily those more complex shapes
are it I think it is down to the
developer to sort of identify maybe that
for some reason that some parts of this
design altogether is resulting in some
things relevant so if we remove that bit
there we are 90 you know we're like
twice as fast or something knesset can
we can we do that and then it's a
negotiation from from that point so I
suppose how we can solve this
appreciation also lack of appreciation
and it's working closely together I
guess I ultimate is always
it sounds very obvious but we need to
talk more well yeah yeah and sort of
being together from the start so then
you know do I work with seeing a design
I can see how a designer got there I saw
that sort of process I was able to catch
things you know early on because I know
that this all ideal is for everything to
be sort of iterative development but in
so many like especially agency life I'm
busy working on the other projects yes
like finishing one all the designs work
they're still having some sort input or
conversation before and yes so by the
time I acting's work on it it's like all
right you feel a part in it yeah and
I've seen that develop and I've
influenced that bit and I kind of come
forward
well maybe it's kind of a spectrum you
know like on one side you have no
processes and no data to validate your
ideas and on the other side you have too
much of it
maybe now the whole UX world is doing
slightly more so I was too much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
