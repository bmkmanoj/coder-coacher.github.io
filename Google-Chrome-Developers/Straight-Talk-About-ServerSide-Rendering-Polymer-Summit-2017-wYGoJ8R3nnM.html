I'm an engineering manager on the
polymer team and today I'm here to kick
off an hour worth of content on
server-side rendering or SSR for short
I'll get the ball rolling with a brief
introduction and then Sam Lee and Tre
sugar will follow me with a couple of
different approaches to server-side
rendering web components sound good all
right let's dive in so over the next 10
minutes we'll ask and answer a series of
key questions about SSR the first one
being why are we even talking about
server-side rendering here at the
polymer summit in short because you guys
asked us to SSR is a hot topic and web
dev and frankly we've seen there's quite
a bit of confusion about what exactly
SSR is why it's important and how it
relates to web components specifically
so our goal is to answer that call for
information clear up some of the
confusion and let you know about some
recent developments specifically related
to web components to start let's
establish what we even mean by SSR so
for the moment I'd like to define it
very broadly we're going to say that
you're doing SSR if your web server ever
delivers meaningful renderable route
specific HTML to browsers or other user
agents so for example given a URL like
this if your server sends something like
this to a browser or a bot then you're
doing SSR on the other hand if you only
ever send an empty HTML shell more like
this then that's not SSR so this may
seem overly broad but stick with me
we'll get more specific soon with that
definition in mind the next question is
why would you want to use SSR turns out
there are two major reasons now if
you've been building apps for production
or paying attention to public
conversation on the topic you probably
know these but let's quickly spell them
out the single biggest reason is to
maximize your reach to have any kind of
impact to your app of course needs to
have users and the best way to reach
users today our search and link sharing
both of which rely on non
browser user agents called BOTS search
BOTS crawl the web and populate search
indexes while link bots visit URLs and
produce appealing visual snippets to
encourage sharing sadly many of these
bots don't run your client-side code if
you don't serve them any meaningful HTML
your site might as well be invisible
okay I need to pause here for a second
before we move on to reason number two
because I just like us to recognize how
messed up it is that here in the year
2017 we're depending on services to help
us find and share information that
basically see the web like their
browsers from 1997 now for anyone who
embraces the idea of the web as a
dynamic and capable platform and I'm
guessing they're probably a few of you
in the room I think this is an
existential issue so let's fix it all
right okay without off my chest back to
our regularly scheduled talk so the
second reason you might use SSR is to
maximize loading performance now we all
know that performance is a critical
component of user experience and in the
mobile era loading is almost certainly
the most important aspect of performance
the port for the performance based
argument for SSR is pretty simple
serving renderable HTML is generally the
fastest way to get something on screen
since the browser can paint right away
before loading parsing or executing nav
or JavaScript makes sense right so now
we've reviewed the two key benefits of
SSR but I'd like to look critically at
each one first do you really need SSR
for search and sharing honestly this is
a question you need to answer for
yourself based on the nature of your
site and your business but that answer
feels a bit like a cop-out so we're just
going to say most likely yes let's note
the exception first though if you don't
rely heavily on sharing and if you're
satisfied with the reach that Google
search gives you you may not need SSR
that's because Googlebot uses a
rendering service based on Chrome and
therefore sees your site very much like
your users do
there's a caveat googlebots version of
chrome isn't entirely up-to-date and it
has a few features disabled so it's
rendering they differ from your users in
subtle or sometimes not so subtle ways
the details are out of scope for this
talk but I encourage you to check out
these resources on developer Google calm
for more information in general though
you'll be happy to know that Googlebot
runs your client-side code such as your
data and renders your app very much like
a real browser the problem is that
Googlebot is not at all typical as we've
already mentioned many BOTS don't
attempt to run your code at all and many
that do do so in very limited ways so if
you care about non Google search engines
or you depend on link sharing for much
of your traffic you'll probably want to
use some form of SSR we'll see how you
might do that in a minute but first
let's ask the same question about
performance that we just did about
search and sharing the answer to this
one is even more nuanced and frankly
starts creeping into some political
territory but what the heck I'll just
say it no you don't need SSR to achieve
excellent loading performance using
patterns like purple you can deliver a
great loading experience without SSR
we've shown this with our own example
apps and developers of real-world
polymer apps have done the same the
polymer version of the hacker news PWA
is among the fastest to load despite not
using any SSR but while it's nice to
know that you can build a fast loading
app without SSR what's more important is
actually the converse that is using SSR
is by no means a guarantee that your
loading performance will be good or even
adequate
so Kevin Shaw built this slide to
demonstrate a problem known as the
uncanny valley SSR helps you get
something on screen as quickly as
possible
but if your app isn't interactive within
a few seconds your users probably aren't
going to be happy and SSR doesn't do
anything to get you interactive faster
so whether it's more important to paint
quickly or get interactive quickly may
depend a lot on the nature of your app
but the bottom line is that SSR should
in no way be viewed as a magic bullet
for loading perform
with that said can SSR help with
performance absolutely so you should try
hard to get interactive as quickly as
possible but for however long that takes
your users would rather be looking at
meaningful content than at a blank
screen and ultimately I think the best
user experience will probably come from
combining some form of SSR or the
technique like purple alright so now we
can move on and talk about SSR and web
components specifically as I mentioned
in my intro we see quite a bit of
confusion about web components in SSR
and this is probably because certain
features of web components do pose
challenges for one very popular flavor
of server-side rendering we'll discuss
what those challenges are but the key
takeaway is that web components are
absolutely compatible with SSR let's see
how starting with a common pattern that
works with virtually any form of
server-side rendering specifically
reusable web components like UI controls
and embeddable widgets can be used in
any server-side rendering scheme the
same goes for a class of elements will
call presentation components as
illustrated by this example from
Electronic Arts these are components you
build yourself to standardized patterns
for presentation and navigation each
component has its own semantics and
encapsulates styling and behavior to
ensure consistency across your site or
even a family of sites now you can use
presentation components in UI elements
with any form of SSR so you might craft
your HTML by hand generate it offline
server render it at runtime whatever you
just include custom elements in your
markup being sure to place meaningful
content like links text and images in
the light DOM wear BOTS can see it now
one quick note is that this pattern does
lead to rendering in two stages your
document will paint immediately but your
custom elements won't render fully until
they've registered and upgraded so it's
a subtle point but something to keep in
mind but what if you're not just
integrating components into your site
but building your entire app out of calm
web components from top to bottom
what if you don't have an existing SSR
solution to lean on in this case you
need something more let's look at two
possibilities one option is to delegate
bot rendering to a standalone service so
let's assume you're doing something like
this user shows up request one of your
apps routes and following the purple
pattern you serve an empty HTML shell
and just enough JavaScript to handle
that first route and let the browser's
take care of the rest but now suppose a
bot shows up and requests that same
route before responding you send that
same HTML shell and JavaScript to a
rendering service service returns your
rendered HTML and you pass it along to
the bot and everybody's happy so all
things considered this is probably the
best way to implement SSR for a pure web
components app today the integrations
lite
you don't write any server specific code
and BOTS and users need to get what they
need now the approach isn't new it's
been used for multiple generations of
Ajax and single page apps but there's
always room for improvement and family
will be up on stage next to tell you
about a modern web components friendly
rendering service that he's built using
head headless chrome now you may have
noticed that a rendering service doesn't
address performance though since you're
only sending HTML to BOTS for that
reason you might want to explore another
approach called isomorphic JavaScript
this is a form of SSR in which your
front-end code is explicitly designed to
run on both the server and in the
browser so instead of rendering an empty
shell or returning an empty shell you
run just enough code on the server to
render your initial HTML which you then
serve to both browsers and BOTS along
with your client-side JavaScript once
the browser loads your code and the app
boots up it reclaims those pre-rendered
Dom nodes and then runs just as if it
had rendered on the client to begin with
this is super elegant and that can be a
great solution but as always there are
trade-offs so your code gets a bit more
complicated and you end up doing more
work on the server for every request and
as we mentioned there are those couple
of web components Pacific challenges
first because web components rely on
platform AP is you need to either
include a full browser in your server
environment which sounds expensive or
use an abstraction layer that provides a
lighter-weight implementation of those
same platform ap is and the thickness of
that layer may vary depending on how
many platform api's you need to render
your initial app state now if your
components use shadow Dom there's an
additional wrinkle after you build your
Dom tree on the server you need to
serialize it into HTML markup so without
shadow Dom as in this case it's pretty
straightforward
but unfortunately the platform doesn't
currently give us any way to represent a
shadow root in serialized HTML so our
simple task becomes a tricky problem now
there are ways to work around this
limitation that they require inserting
placeholders and running a bit of
client-side code during your initial
render so trace you GART will be on
stage shortly to share his work on
isomorphic JavaScript for web components
and take a closer look at all of these
considerations and with that we've
wrapped up our brief intro to SSR I hope
it's been useful to you and I'm sure
that you'll be excited to see what both
Sam and Trey have in store for you next
so thanks and enjoy the rest of polymer
