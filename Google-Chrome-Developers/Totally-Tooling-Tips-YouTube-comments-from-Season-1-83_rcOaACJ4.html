and it starts and I hope it like works
of like jQuery and maybe like other libs
promises as well the guy on the right
you had were speaking problems in the
guy on the left me to be honest I try
not to use those filler sounds even if
it makes me sign up for a couple of
seconds or make me speak more slowly
because those arms and likes are super
annoying well Victor is going to enjoy
you know first episode of season 2 i'm
tastic um like um like like um like this
is just like like everything um see you
I did that like where the heck are links
for all this stuff he's looking for
staffs he's looking for staff okay so to
be fair we did actually suck at doing
this we were really good for the sublime
text steps you had like we had the teeth
what was the URL TTT dot totally tooling
gut tips so that links to a page where
we actually had all the videos we had
like a big document of super awesome and
then we stopped doing it so this time we
gonna be better I heart in these how
Matt Gordon has a great idea ideas money
always tops them with something even
greater and Matt's final comment of okay
good works for me brilliant almost
comedy almost comedy almost were almost
funny that's the best reading I've ever
had this one's all right cuddly ogre I
didn't know about the say command you
have destroyed my productivity sorry we
love you but get back to work this is
where people who should watch season two
we change everything lomites everything
is different cliffhangers every episode
so what's in season two we are gonna do
some more sublime stuff shortcuts are
snippets window stalling command line
