summit again and i'm joined by sabine
and agee who have just finished their
talk on sign in and credential
management so Sabine you're largely
focused on the best practices of signing
I think how does the credential
management API what's different about it
why is it a good best practice so it
really helps users to get through these
sign and flows that are full of friction
today like people can drop off
everywhere they have to remember how
they signed in last times I have to
remember which password they use they
create duplicate accounts and session
exploration is really fast on the web so
people are frequently automatically
signed out and and that's really a pain
basically especially on mobile devices
when you have to type type your
credentials so the credential management
API helps here because it can
automatically sign the user in right on
the homepage it's gone any page to use a
lens on and without needing any
injection so 80 you covered a ton of
code during the presentation I tried to
pay attention but I also missed a lot of
it so how does the credential management
API differ from the usual overflow that
I'm probably used to yeah so if I were
to say credential monument credential
management API is also going to owe us
so you can use them together right for
example if you are trying to log into a
website using the third party identity
such as Google or Facebook or Microsoft
etc you can use a protocol like open ID
connect or which is which allows the
user to use those accounts or
third-party identity to sign win so the
credential management API can remember
those accounts for the user so some
websites has multiple of those right if
they have like Google Facebook Twitter
github and so as an option people forget
which one they have used to sign
language so credential management API
have users to remember which one which
sort but the identity they have used to
assign me with awesome so be sure to
check out the talk it's going to be on
our YouTube channel which you can
subscribe below otherwise follow with
chrome dev summit and thank you for
watching I
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
