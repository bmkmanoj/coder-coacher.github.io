developer advocate working on at Google
and I work on the open web and
especially chrome dev tools and later on
stage with me will be Paul Irish and
Seth Thompson together we're going to
talk about three things
offering application and JavaScript all
those three things are categories that
we cater to in dev tools and we have a
lot of improvements coming in 2016 and
some of the ones that we had in the last
couple months so I'm going to kick off
this first of all by saying that we're
going to talk about the weather wonder
app there's an app that we've built but
it's not completely finished it's a
mobile first responsive progressive web
app and we want to do a few touches to
it and we have a few errors that we want
to fix so first off there are a couple
new things that were showing there are
not yet in beta and in stable so please
use Chrome Canary for the very brand-new
features and enable the dev tools
experiments in chrome flags and then
head to the settings and click on
experiments to enable any experiment
that we're showing all right let's start
with authoring so when I talk about all
thing I talk about the actual crafting
of a website not just debugging or
front-end ops or performance up
diminutive optimizations but actually
building the website now the first thing
I want to talk about is the device mode
we've added the device mode more than a
year ago but we did some heavy
improvements recently because of the
mobile first story that becomes ever
more popular with responsive design we
felt that it was kind of backwards that
we were building a page first in desktop
with the chrome dev tools and then had
to enable mode that is pretty
overwhelming at times so you want to
disable again sometimes and so instead
of going desktop first we wanted you to
go mobile first and actually have that
mode enabled and feel that it's fine to
have it enabled so how does it look like
well same thing device mode toggle is in
the sidebar here next to expect if you
toggle it to see a very streamlined UI
that focuses on responsive design so
resize freely but
also have shortcuts that give you the
most common mobile resolutions right
there under the actual line that extends
now you can also just manually change it
and so that's the responsive story
that's relatively easy to use and just
figure out on the fly if you want to go
more advanced you can also emulate a
certain device so for instance in this
case I'm going to switch to the Nexus 5x
yes and as you can see there's some
Chrome that we emulate but it also
shrinks our viewport to fit in
everything on our device on our screen
I'm going to show you what that means
and why that's useful in a bit
you can also trigger certain chrome UI
so for instance the keyboards light up
we can go to landscape and now it
switches back to 100% because it
realizes that the viewport has enough
space to display it is a display it as
at 100%
so that's device emulation but you can
go even one step further and this is
something we just added recently you can
immerse yourself with actual device art
so you can go to the settings and show
the device frame of that device to
actually give you a real impression of
the actual device now double dot not
only that you can capture a screenshot
and that screenshot includes the actual
device frame so you can share it with
your with your co-workers and with the
designers thank you
now you can also customize that mode
it's pretty bad done in the first place
but you can edit the device list we
shipped with a lot of configurations for
all sorts of popular devices but you can
also add a new one and just add a user
agent string some values in there and if
you want to customize more you can add
the you can click the three dots and in
for instance if you want to debug images
you go to the device pixel ratio if you
want to simulate network throttling you
can do that in the network panel too but
sometimes you want to look at it in
device mode and so if you want to go
offline test a phone fortunately or just
a slow connection you can do that right
there so that's customization and
there's more stuff now I I talked about
mobile first and that I want you to have
that mode enabled but some people have
been asking well what about desktop I
mean I still want to build desktop sites
well that's a very good story here too
and something that's actually even in my
opinion better than what we had before
because of the zoom that I showed you
before we can now change the zoom level
to something that's much smaller than
the actual resolution and the page still
functions as before by going switch to a
resolution that we don't even have on
this device on this actual laptop now
can enable the device type as you can
see is now a touch device by default but
we can switch it back to desktop and now
everything becomes selectable again it's
just a normal desktop you know a
viewport again but it it has the whole
responsive story so now we're going to
use that we are also going to show media
quiz and turns out that my weather one
app looks pretty crappy on that
resolution and if I resize it well yes
doesn't look exactly good we are missing
a media career so let's add one now I'm
gonna add a media career for
approximately right right point is or
gonna use flexbox I want to have two
boxes next to each other and if I switch
back to Chrome here I could see that I
worked I can resize my viewport again
with a responsive handles and and as you
can see the actual media query that's
not used at the top fades out so only
the ones that are currently used
highlighted and if you I want to see it
in the dev tools what I just did I can
right
click reveal in source code and go to
exactly the thing that I've written
right there it's a really nice way to
iterate on media crews and that's the
new device mode now moving on let's talk
about colors now we've added we did a
lot of improvements to color picker
recently so if we're looking at the
header right here I can click on the
color picker and what's built and now
our color palettes the first one are the
page colors the page colors are
generated from your CSS on the fly to
just give you all options that you have
in your actual CSS but if I want to do
custom colors I can do that too and any
kind of color to the custom palette and
that's available across all of my tabs
but then to me my personal favorite is
the material design palette because
those have really nice colors out of a
box but I can choose for a header and
most of them will just look pretty good
so that's the color picker but I
actually think we can do a bit better
than that because this is 2016 and we
have a new feature called CSS variables
that's a emerging standard that we
actually support in dev tools so let's
see how we can use that to add a dark
theme to a light theme to our weather
one app so first I'm gonna paste some to
speed this up I'm gonna paste some
variables into the HTML those are all
CSS variables as you can see it actually
is smart enough to realize that that's a
color that I have in there it could be
anything right but it's passing it as a
color I can use the color picker I'm
gonna change the variables or where they
need to be changed so in this case on
the header I'm going to change to the
header color I'm just gonna speed it up
a little and gonna use background color
here card background color on the actual
card and then let's see yes that's
missing it's a faded color on the text
and I think we have final one and yeah
actually coming back to the card as you
can see there's no text color define on
the card but we do have quick actions in
the bottom now that are actually pretty
nice to add a color
you a class right there so you don't
have to type in color background anymore
and just can add it right there
so that's nice I'm gonna use it to just
add the card text color here okay and
now I'm gonna switch back to the HTML
tag to actually create our dark seam we
just have that's just our preparation
we've done so I'm gonna copy the block
of CSS variables here and then I'm gonna
use another new feature in the actions
the quick actions below and the little
plus I'll actually add a new style rule
right in that file below this I drew a
top and I'm gonna call it dark gonna
paste it and now I'm not gonna use
another new feature which is the class
toggle in the side panel if I do that I
can insert a new class on that element
it applies directly and I can even
toggle that I'm gonna use that right
right a bit so now I'm gonna bring up
the color picker again and now if I long
press on one of those colors first of
all I'm gonna choose yeah let's do that
looks good but if I a lot wrong press on
one of those colors I can count come to
all the shades of that color which is a
really nice way to just pick a palette
that works nicely so I'm gonna use all
sort of shades of that same color to
drive our theme here um which which
makes things so much easier for me
and finally the faded color and there we
go I think we have a pretty good dark
theme and now I can use that toggle
right there to toggle the class on and
off very easily and this works for
pre-existing classes as well on any
element to preview what we have so
that's the color picker and the building
actions
thank you now let's talk about
animations now in the best sense
animations are not just flashy things
but they will add they will for instance
visualize a state transition in a in a
really nice way and if you like most of
most of you and me
you don't usually if you create complex
animation it's not just one dumb element
but it's a set of Dom elements so we
thought long and hard what we can do
here and how we can develop a solution
that works well for an animation
workflow now I'm going to switch to a
different demo here for a moment because
we don't have a lot of animations on the
weather one app this is actually a
pretty cool demo because this is a web
prototype that actually is built from
the chrome team by the chrome team and
and is a UI prototype for the actual
system UI so we actually use that to
build our system UI in chrome so let's
take a look but first thing I'm gonna
take take a look at the ER bar and it's
gonna bring up the keyboard but the
keyboard doesn't ease really nicely
I think the easing is pretty off so I'm
gonna click on the keyboard I'm gonna
bring up the new Bezier curve editor
so the Bedok bezier curve editor allows
you to quickly switch to any kind of
easing curve that works as you can see
we just improved it quite a lot by
choosing a different using curve but
again this is a complex animation that
consists of a group of elements so I'm
going to use the new animation inspector
to capture those groups of animations
it's actually smart enough to figure out
that what you're looking at is a complex
animation that consists of various Dom
elements so now we can scrub in that
animation and go back and forth and look
exactly at what I'm look out exactly how
it looks like I can slow it down to give
a give it me an even better preview but
I mean that this is not just a preview I
can shift things around I can add a
delay to the keyboard and make it appear
later here we go
and now this there's a bunch of other
animations in here back to full speed
I'm just gonna click around a little and
this there's even more here as you can
see all that is captured in groups those
groups even have screenshots that are
animated little gifts that we capture
and and so you can go to any of them and
then click on it and just check out what
I just recorded and scrub back and forth
so we think that's a really nice
improvement on working with animations
and that's animations alright so I
already showed you quite a bit in a
ready to be short time but when you want
to feature when you when you want to
find a new feature and dev tools and I
did in detail every step to enable those
features if you like me you sometimes
lost and you do kind of search in the
settings you should somewhere else but
there's tools are very complex product
and sometimes it's just not super easy
to find something so we have a solution
to that too we think and we were
inspired by sublime text here I mean a
few other editors and what we added is
command shift P to bring up a command
Mayo so that command menu can really
easily allow you to switch to any action
any panel right on the fly just on your
keyboard
for instance here showing the dark theme
or I could go offline right in the
command menu without actually clicking
anything and I can also adjust for
instance ya go back online or show media
trees in the device mode so almost every
category within dev tools is supported
here and it includes over 60 actions
more coming and we think it's a really
nice way to to jump around things and
discover things now I'm gonna call up
Paul I wish to talk about something
that's brand new so new that we need his
computer to demo it
thank you all right so we you're hearing
well
yeah first my name is Paul I work on the
chrome dev tools I'm gonna show you a
little bit more stuff Paul is showing
you a bit about how we work with styles
and some of the new tools to manipulate
them and I want to dive into that a
little bit more because there's this gap
between kind of the styles that we see
in the dev tools and then kind of like
how we write them and we always have to
kind of mentally map between things and
kind of work it out and it's always a
little bit rough we've been thinking
about how to kind of smooth that over
all right so I'm gonna switch screens
over here bring this up so I'm looking
at the weather wonder app now I'm gonna
make a change to my Styles here I'm
looking at just this header across the
top and it looks like we got this color
which looks pretty nice I wanted to make
a change we'll switch it over to
goldenrod because I am like totally in
the goldenrod of these days that looks
good now one thing that we've always
actually done is being able to map what
you're doing here in elements panel and
then show you over in sources kind of
what it maps to so if I click over here
we actually have the goldenrod kind of
just carrying over right here so it kind
of already keeps track of things but
let's say I want to make a few more
changes I'm gonna get rid of this
z-index and I'm gonna tweak the font
size just a tad and I think that looks
good now one thing I want to make sure
is just make sure that over here in my
settings everything I need to make this
look as sharp as it should all right
without another way we should be able to
click in and make just a few more
modifications that seems nice yeah yeah
all right let's tweak that back again
I'm feeling good about this feeling good
yeah all right
so things are looking good to me so far
I need more things yeah bottom border
border bottom one pixel solid any color
recommendations papaya whip is that
coral Coral said oh yeah Thank You coral
oh that is nice yeah no oh yeah won't
get that awesome nice
alright I'm into that alright so I'm
gonna drop over here and one thing that
you'll notice not only are the changes
there but we're also making sure that
we've annotated alongside the changes to
show you a little divot is new down here
and what has been changed so this just
keeps track of all the changes that
you've done in even if I wanted to say
for instance get rid of something I'm
gonna add a little bit of space up there
and turns out I actually don't need a
background no I don't need these guys at
all like we'll just wipe them out we
keep track of deletions modifications
additions so this is a nice way that we
can kind of keep accounting for all the
things that have happened in the page
alright so got those changes underway
but it is true that I'm like switching
back and forth between these you see it
kind of messed me up a little bit you
kind of want to have that understanding
be here without switching contexts so
we're like maybe we could just bring
that information over into this view
I'll show you a new new panel very very
new and it's down here near the console
now you can click these little dots to
reveal it but I'm gonna use a command
menu because I'm just feeling it so I'm
gonna type in quick source so quick
source is just like the sources panel
but with a little bit less and now I
have the exact same thing over there
just in line here the nice thing about
having this here is that as I click
around in my positions in the Styles
it's also going to make sure that it's
jumping to those locations down in this
area so as I move around I can kind of
keep track of my position between the
two files so this has given me a lot
more context for how what I'm doing in
the elements pane matches with my
original source file
and so that I can like take these
changes and then carry them back very
easily to what the work that I was doing
so feel good about this stuff I like it
but there's another thing that I want to
show off because like I'm showing this
with CSS right there's a lot of great
tooling in here for CSS but what we're
offering in and our projects is not
necessarily CSS it's usually something
that compiles down to CSS right and so
that's another kind of mapping that we
have to make in our heads of like okay I
made this over here but I'm going to
copy paste and then I need to put it
here and here and and it's a little bit
of work and so this has always been
something that we wanted to kind of ease
the transition form so that we can keep
things a little bit in sync so you might
have say for instance used CSS source
maps before so I'm gonna flip those on
because I had a just turned them off for
this part I'm just gonna reload the page
make sure that I'm looking good that is
nice that is nice but I'm gonna get rid
of those Goldenrod changes just for the
moment
okay so I'll bring this back and good so
I've turned on CSS source Maps right and
if you've done this before you might
have noticed that over here on the side
it says loader CSS looks that's the SS
right and so that's good because I can
click over and see like where is this
selector where is this rule over in the
source and so yeah okay I guess it's
over there and this is my sass file like
I have variables in mix-ins okay so this
has been something that is that we've
had for a little while now just to ease
things I'll bring back quick source well
I'm gonna go a little bit quicker here
now okay so I'm making some changes and
let's see yeah so one new thing is that
now that I have quick source and my map
in place not only can I just follow
around the position of yes background is
there
and position is there you can see as
they click on the value for this color
it jumps up immediately here so I get
instantly get the feedback that these
are actually coming from variables
whereas these are properties in this
rule I like this a lot because it gives
me the contact for like what what am I
looking at here is this from a mixin
these guys are from a mixin ok good good
ok good now this is alright this is ok
but like our job is not just to look at
the relationship between these things
like we got to do work we gotta like you
know change how it looks get some more
goldenrod in there you know so let's
change something I'm gonna go in and
this background color again tweak it
needs to be a bit more green open up my
color picker switch it over so what we
just did right here is this color green
we actually didn't just change it for
the header we changed the original color
value here I'll switch it to red to make
that a little bit more clear check this
out
so not only did we change it for the
variable value but you can see we update
all the places that are using that color
so not only the header but you see that
the footer 2 is using a variable for the
same thing so we're keeping it all in
sync and we think this is really really
cool what do you think like it
I'll show you a few more things here so
now that it's okay red it's red it's a
bit too much I think you know the green
was a better choice
yeah like it there that's good all right
so so we got the we kind of changes on
variables and that's working out nice
I'm gonna make a little bit more of a
complicated change we're gonna go in
here and it looks like this these icons
right these icons we have with height 32
pixels and it looks like I left a
comment for myself I really wanted to
update those to use a proper variable as
well just like this larger one so I'm
gonna go in I'm just gonna make the
changes directly in here because it's
not really something that I can do up in
the files
so we'll just update those this becomes
32 and we drop in those guys right there
right and we can get rid of this now
nice my my diff keeps up with me keeps
track of what I did
now chained to my sass file I want to
make sure that we can bring it into the
project now what I could do is I could
kind of copy it out of the page I could
also right-click and just save this to
disk but I have set up the workspaces
functionality already so I could just
hit command s now before I do that I
want to point out I just have a gulp
task sitting behind the browser window
just like a typical gulp task it's just
compiling when I save to disk so when I
save this file it should kick in and we
should be good so command S yeah cool
okay so no visual changes so far but let
me just check one thing when I clicking
back onto the icon and we're looking
like 32 up here uh yeah okay so as I
click on the 32 up here it is mapping to
this variable value so does that mean
that I can just update this guy will go
like two sixty pixels and you see not
only does it update this but also that
all uses so we're keeping it all in sync
all right now
one other thing because we have not only
the bidirectionality between CSS and the
originally authored styles we also have
this direct bidirectionality between my
dev tools here and my editor so I'm
gonna come over here and look for that
icon size and it looks like it's here
everything looks to be in place and I'll
tweak that and bring it back down to
let's say well just shrink it down a lot
10 pixels as it save the sass should
kick in and there we go
so this is nice I can edit open this up
in that style span up here I can make
changes in here or just come back in my
editor and we're gonna keep it all in
sync alright just so you guys know that
this is real this is the repository for
my project and I was gonna hit get diff
and we're looking here at the diff of my
sass with my green and I wiped out that
thing and so all these changes are now
in my project looking good cool so
there's a bit of magic to pull this off
like we're kind of keeping track of
things in different places right just to
make this work what's actually happening
I just want to kind of explain it's
gonna get a little nerdy this right here
is a visualization of a source map now
source maps is the same thing from
JavaScript and CSS now so what I have on
the left is CSS and on the right is a
sass file so this border color for
instance you see these margin border
color it's just highlighting on the
right hand side what that map's to what
the source map knows about it but you
can see that the variable value over
here is actually mapping excuse me it's
mapping right there so here you can kind
of see what's happening the mapping
already kind of helps us identify the
different strings and how they they fit
to the other file and so we're in the
dev tools just using these this
information to allow us to kind of
update what would make sense
all right so I should put out a
disclaimer or two this is really cool
functional you know we're working on it
still it works great with sass with all
the things that you would expect it to
in variables and mix-ins and nesting and
things like this we're talking with the
teams behind autoprefixer post CSS and
sass I'm sorry unless to make sure that
things are working great with them
because one one we want to make sure
that everybody has this kind of
best-in-class Styles editing experience
so you can play with this now and we're
making sure that it's gonna be even more
robust regardless of how complex your
your style chool tool chain becomes cool
all right so with that out of the way
I'm gonna switch back here because I'm
gonna move on kind of shift gears well
you talked a little bit about
application development and specifically
progressive web app development I mean
but working hard in the dev tools to
kind of bring some new functionality
that makes things a little bit more
clearer because these things can get
hairy now one of the things that we like
to do in the dev tools is change things
like just change things you thought it
was over there we moved it down there
like that's like what we're going for
right and we thought you know it might
be nice if we just you like chain like
kind of remove one of the panels that
you've been using just it make it
disappear completely well all right we
didn't totally remove it but you'll
notice there's no resources panel up at
the top resources panel is now
application okay so let me give you a
quick preview of what application looks
like so there's still everything that we
didn't remove anything everything's
still here storage and your application
cache and cache storage and frames so
you can still navigate that but up at
the top we've done some new things so
this right here is a visual
representation of your manifest of your
web app manifest so everything this is
the the actual Jason as it was received
but we kind of parsed it out visually to
make it a little bit more clear so you
can see your colors your icons and if
you want to test what it looks like when
chrome promise
user to see if they want to add this to
the home screen you can do that here so
it just would trigger the same thing
that Chrome would be doing and it looks
like actually this one's not going to
work because something about the display
property and my manifest isn't what it
needs to be so I'm getting that feedback
here about any errors and warnings that
we're discovering far before I realize
it just doesn't work on my phone all
right so that's what it looks like for
manifest but when it comes to service
workers we want to make sure that you're
getting the information that you want so
there's been some functionality in here
before but it's been a little bit of
confusing so we want to make sure that
it's very clear how things work so here
I'm investigating my service workers and
I want to make a few changes but I also
just want to see what's happening so we
have here a listing of the service
worker that is a touch of the page looks
like it's up and running I'm really
attracted this checkbox around off lion
at the top I'm going to click it now I'm
going to reload the page and looks like
it it went offline that makes sense but
I thought I had a I thought I would like
with it was everything was off fly I
didn't was cached not really sure let me
make sure that things are up and running
yeah this seems good pretty good
I mean roughly good now I'm gonna check
that offline again reload yes okay where
does it ignore this down there so the I
reload the page the page is still up
this is what I expect because this is a
progressive web app without errors and
it is supposed to work offline right but
if I on the right hand side if I
unregister the serviceworker and i
reload the page I would expect to see
our dinosaur friend yes good offline no
serviceworker we're done so this offline
checkbox is the exact same thing that
you're used to over here with the
network throttling and it's just here
conveniently for offline development so
let's try out some more things so let's
switch over and my editor
- my serviceworker and it looks like I
have some logs coming in for my service
worker in a nice goldenrod yellow hmm
it's so good so what I've done is use
some styled console logs some quality
quality stuff and I want to change the
color so I'm gonna change it to blue and
I'll reload and I see a little bit of it
I see some blue and actually so I have
the the one with the blue text is here
it's waiting to activate
but the goldenrod is still there and I'm
like okay cool but I won't blue it's
important so I'm going to skip waiting
I'm gonna force it to be the active one
and so that's all good but maybe I
wanted to make another change and so as
I'm iterating on my serviceworker it
works but then there's continuing to be
waiting to activate because this is kind
of the workflow and the life cycle of
how they work because this gets a little
annoying the update on reload checkbox
allows me to basically always update the
serviceworker definition whenever I
reload the page so that way I don't have
to go 3 and click this step skip waiting
every single time so as I change this
and save it and reload
it's just instantly pulling that one in
and I'm running the latest so this is
great for doing a serviceworker
development for literally editing the
serviceworker code but there's other
times when you have a page and you're
playing around with the plate pages
styles or its functionality and you kind
of want to just pretend like it's not
being cached so that is what this bypass
for network checkbox is it's pretty much
the disable cache of the serviceworker
generation it's like just serviceworker
don't attempt to like overtake these
these requests and like provide one from
the cache just ignore the serviceworker
for all the network requests and this
allows me to make any changes for the
page and just see it directly alright
sometimes you get in kind of interesting
situations and you just want to you know
clear it all away so the brand-new clear
storage pane allows you to just take all
of the service workers the storage the
cache and just wipe it it wipes it just
for this one domain
so you're pretty good able to clear it
out kind of like start from fresh all
right so feels good
some I wanted to show you one other
thing while you have this information
available to you kind of real-time in
manual debugging you sometimes want a
little bit more information to help you
guide you and make sure that you're
getting all the things that you need to
and we've been thinking about how to
bring this functionality and we started
a project that allows you to investigate
kind of what is the checklist of items
that you need to build a successful
progressive web app and so so this is a
project that we're calling lighthouse so
lighthouse is a standalone validator
that allows you to identify what is
necessary to build the progressive web
app and so what it does is it
investigates all the things in the page
looks at your service worker and your
manifest and all sorts of things to
identify one of the things that you
haven't yet done so I want to show you a
quick demo and I just have up this page
this is a Firefox is a page where they
communicate about what they what
features that they have but it's a
progressive web app and so I get to try
it out so I'm going to kick off the
white house Chrome extension and
generate a report so what this is doing
is it is emulating a mobile device it's
actually throttling the network
condition because it so it can get more
accurate network performance data it is
reloading the page and doing a lot of
tests to understand about the how secure
the pages what is cached if it redirects
from HTTP to HTTPS and of all these
things it's running kind of a battery of
tests and it takes a few page loads to
really get it right but when it's done
okay good yes all right so this is the
report that you get so this report gives
you an idea of where you're hitting the
mark and some places where there's
opportunities so it gives you
information on if the page is
successfully cached offline if it has
everything that it needs so that Chrome
can prompt repeat users to add it to
their home screen is it going to launch
off the home screen with a splash screen
things like that and even gets into
things like
accessibility security other UX issues
so kind of test the whole battery of
things now this is available here we've
prototyped it's exposing this
functionality through a Chrome extension
but it's also available on the command
line so over here this is just a command
line module written in nodejs and you
can see this is the same kind of report
just here so this is nice we can also
output it as Jason in case you want to
run this in a continuous integration
environment and make sure that there's
no regressions across any of these
variables so this is a really exciting
thing and we're happy to kind of move it
forward it's still early days and you
can imagine have seen this thing and all
sorts of different places in your
development lifecycle whether you want
to see it in the chrome dev tools or
available and could in continuous
integration so we're working hard to
find out the right places for it to live
so if this is of interest to you it's
just on github and feel free to come by
get involved in the community we're
looking to expand the coverage start
getting into more testing and security
and accessibility gathering performance
metrics so I encourage you to drop by
and check it out all right I was a lot
but Steph is gonna help us out and took
over the next part and I think he's
gonna tell us a little bit about
JavaScript debugging good stuff like
that cool
okay hi everybody
let's see I think we're all set up here
okay
my name is Seth Thompson and I'm a
product manager on Chrome I work on the
dev tools team but I also work on the v8
team now v8 is Chrome's JavaScript
engine and today I'm gonna tell you
about a project which spans both of
these teams so chrome dev tools is great
for debugging your application but
normally when we talk about using chrome
dev tools we're talking about debugging
the front-end of your application but
many of you are web developers that are
full stack engineers and you're not just
debugging a front-end you know you're
also interacting with the backend which
maybe exposes API is that the app
interacts with so how many of you have
seen this this is so so so much of a
hassle to get when you're in dev tools
on the front-end it's a status code that
shows that there's an error in the back
end which is returning a request to
chrome and the front-end and what's
what's tough about this is when you see
something like this you often have to
completely change mental contexts and
your workflow you have to leave chrome
dev tools working on the front-end you
have to often go over to another
codebase where your back-end is running
you've probably got a kill your app
start up a debugger for the backend make
some changes there try to identify what
the problem is restart your back-end
service and then switch back to chrome
dev tools to continue working from the
front-end with a fixed API call but let
me ask you another question how many of
you guys are no js' developers ok maybe
have worked on some node.js applications
well on Chrome we love nodejs and so
many web developers use both of these
technologies together so you know nodejs
is powered by the v8 JavaScript engine
and dev tools can introspect and debug
v8 when it's running in chrome so we
thought why isn't it easier for dev
tools to debug v8 in a JavaScript
context and note
well I'm really happy to announce that
the as of this week we've submitted a
pull request to node core to integrate
proper out-of-the-box dev tools
debugging of nodejs so this is a this is
a big deal and it's been a collaboration
of the Google cloud platform nodejs team
the chrome dev tools team and the chrome
v8 team allowing you to use the binary
that you're using to run your node JSF
and hook it up to chrome dev tools
so the reason this is different yes it's
a it's it's a really big it's gonna call
now you may have you may be familiar
with other similar tools there do exist
UI tools for debugging nodejs some of
them even based on parts of dev tools
but the difference about this is win
this if and hopefully if this pull
request is submitted in a node core you
will be able to use the exact same node
binary that you're using to run your app
already and you'll also be able to use
dev tools in any Chrome window so this
allows you to it takes away all of the
machinery between the node server and
dev tools and allows you to pick up
immediately
when either node or dev tools adds new
features new debugging contexts new ways
to introspect your app so enough talk
let me give you a quick demo here I'm
going to switch over to the same screen
you've been looking at before and I'm
also working on some changes to the
weather wonder app it's actually a
pretty complex app and we needed three
three people working on it with a bunch
of different branches it's going to be
good when it's done but you can see here
I'm actually working on adding a feature
that humanizes the date I think in the
version Paul was working on you've got
this long time stamp there so I want to
humanize that and say put relative time
now weather wonder is architected right
now as a progressive web app on the
front end that makes an API call to the
backend to query for the updated weather
content and that back-end is a node J
so let me quickly show you that right
here on the left side I've got a gulp
task running the front-end progressive
web app and on the right side I've just
got this simple node service running a
quick backend that you know requests the
forecast data and and responds with it
so what I want to do though is is I
notice that there's an error here and it
says that my app was most recently
updated 46 years ago which is definitely
not the case
none of these technologies were around
46 years ago so there's definitely an
error and when I would when I would be
using a dev tools normally in the past
and and highlighting this trying to
figure out where that numbers coming
from
I would run into this this place where
you know I query for the query for the
response here and actually I'm gonna
make one one mention of something that
came up earlier here because I'm
debugging the backend in the front-end I
don't care as much about the caching
behavior of the progressive web app so
I'm going to come into the application
panel and toggle bypass for network this
means that every time i refresh the page
it should hit the back end again with a
new response and request so now when I
come to the network panel I can come in
and see my New York JSON on let's see
this was a request to localhost that's
where my node application is running and
I noticed in the the preview here that
the time is actually responding with the
improper relative time from the backend
and previously this would be the point
where I've reached the boundary of dev
tools I have to switch into this other
code base this other this other
JavaScript debugging context different
tools to try to track that down but with
this change with this pull request and I
have a specially built version of that
pull request but hopefully if it's
accepted it would be the same binary or
using normally my special build is
called node 2 I just pass a command line
flag that's it inspect and after I do
that the exact same app gives me back a
simple URL paste this in to dev tools
our excuse me to any Chrome window this
is just a new window here
and now I have a context which is
showing me my node application this is
so cool this is totally new and it's
right available in Chrome right now yes
it's it's great and just to prove it to
you so I'll quickly show you what we've
got here we've got all of the features
you usually use in dev tools you've got
a console to prove that this is actually
no js' I've got my global node object
and on it and you might have done this
to feature test what version of node
you're using and go to process
environment and version oh no I think
that's I guess we can test the v8
version what's on here well this is the
other fun part you get to see what this
object has where is it version that's it
V 7.0 point o that is the most recent
version of node so this is really cool
it's actually a node environment that
you're debugging here says no js' main
context we've also got the sources panel
so the sources panel is where you're
probably used to debugging front-end
JavaScript and dev tools has added a
bunch of new features to this recently
you have things like async call stacks
to be able to traverse the control flow
of your application across asynchronous
boundaries like a set timeout
you've got proper support for es6 I
think I've got an arrow function in here
somewhere maybe not we also add inline
values you'll see that a second when we
step over things so all of these
features I just want to reiterate all of
these features that we add to to dev
tools on the front end immediately work
out of the box with no js' when you're
debugging on the back end so as you can
see here I've set a breakpoint for and
actually let me let me get back up one
more time that Java the JSON I showed
you was coming from this route here and
I've added a breakpoint on my back end
where I have the logic for that route
city JSON and just that I actually had
already happened when I tried to request
that JSON object it hit my breakpoint
that I set earlier and you can see here
that what I really want to figure out is
why my
moment.js conversion isn't working so
stepping works like normal you see that
data currently dot time which is coming
from this forecast api that does have a
timestamp and i pass it through this
conversion using the moment node library
to turn it into a relative time but
something's messing up there well you
know what I really need here because
this data object that's coming back from
the forecast API has so much stuff on it
I really want an interactive environment
to see what's on that object and the the
console here actually updates and gives
me the context of where my breakpoint is
set so if I type in a moment I've got my
moment library and if I type in data
I've got the response that was came back
from the forecast API on my back-end
here so let's quickly figure out what
was the issue here data dot currently
dot time does indeed give me the wrong
thing actually that's because it already
went through the step here let me set
the breakpoint one more time and hit it
before I reach the conversion okay now
let me set it a little bit earlier here
how about up there
great continue that one and reload my
response okay did that go nope
great so hit this breakpoint here I'm
going to continue or just gonna step
over that error and now I've this is the
data object as it was returned by the
forecast API data dot currently that
time has nope
currently I spelled wrong has the time
scale okay now here's example of
something that's usually really
difficult to debug I think the issue
here is something around the fact that
the time stamp coming back from my
back-end is different than a time stamp
that the moment JavaScript library
expects normally if I had to figure this
out you know why is my back-end
timestamp different than my front-end
timestamp it would be so hard but
because this is the same dev tools
JavaScript console I can just check and
say okay well date now returns it's
under returns a slightly longer time
step I think what's going on here is the
backend is returning a UNIX timestamp
which is in seconds and the front end is
returning a JavaScript timestamp which
is in milliseconds that makes sense that
would mean that the relative time is
older than expected the fix is actually
pretty easy
it's just multiplying the timestamp the
unix timestamp by a thousand to convert
it from seconds to milliseconds now
you'll see I did one other thing here
dev tools has live at it this thing
updates on the fly and it actually hot
reloads the function that I'm editing in
dev tools into the node process I don't
have to kill my node server and restart
it again multiply by a thousand I think
that should do it
I'm just gonna hit save I'm gonna remove
my breakpoint continue that execution
and I'm gonna move back over to my
front-end hit refresh cross our fingers
it fixed it a few seconds ago yeah
so as you can see it's just it's just so
much faster to debug both of these
environments with this combined and
integrated support so I'd like to thank
all the teams who helped work on this
you can get access to it on a special
build if you choose now but we're
crossing our fingers that the pull
request is accepted by node and this
works out of the box and now I'll invite
Paul Bacchus back up at the stage to
give it outro thank you very brief
wrap-up so we talked about authoring
application in JavaScript and to make
this really quick device mode command
shift P colors or variables real-time
sass and authoring take a photo if you
want to all right yeah we need to move
on
sorry manifest service workers installer
it's and and we hopefully you can see
the recording afterwards and also note
and inline various here's six black
boxing there's a couple things we
haven't shown but that's about it
what's next check out our documentation
follow us on Twitter on chrome dev tools
and enjoy the show thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
