while and and and I apologize but I
thought we probably have seen enough of
Paul's face for a while so I thought I'd
just swoop in and you know do a video of
my own for change so here I am and I
thought I'd show you simple HD b2 server
it's a tool that I've written a long
time ago for a Udacity course I did
about HTTP and HB 2 I I should probably
put the link down here or in the
description you'll probably find a link
to the Udacity course there and it's a
tool that you just download and start
and it serves the current directory over
HB 2 so it's very similar to Python
simple HB 2 server just python simple HP
server but my server does hb2 and it
needed a new tool because HTTP 2 by
design is always encrypted and always
needs a TLS certificate and because
generating these certificates is really
annoying and really time-consuming I
just pull it straight into the tool so
it does it right away for you and just
start it and it spins up and there you
go with HB 2 and I really didn't go
because go was very early with support
on HB 2 and because I just love go but
back when I wrote it they didn't have
support for push and I was one of the
big things that I wanted to play around
with so what I did is I basically
grabbed the code from the Senate library
put it in my project and monkey patched
support for push in there but now just a
few weeks ago go 1.8 came out and well
you know there's loads of improvements
there in terms of performance and
garbage collection but also they now
have native support for push so I could
finally throw out my monkey patched
version and I used the opportunity when
I was working on the tool anyway to
basically do a whole refactor to just
you know split the code up it was really
messy really grown and making our nice
little files and modules and make it
more accessible for all of you out there
who may want to contribute to this tool
because you want a feature or something
so now the code is hopefully much more
modular much more readable and I thought
I'd just dive in and explain a little
bit
on how it now works so before I had a
so-called push manifest and this push
manifest was just a way for you to
define which resources are supposed to
be pushed when a certain request comes
in and Eric bidelman and I kind of came
up with that and we kind of wanted to
make an industry standard but it turns
out that most people already had a
solution and those were actually be link
headers so now I kind of threw away this
manifest idea and went back to basically
allowing you to specify headers because
that's something that people wanted to
have anyway because sometimes you want
experiment with caching headers or you
need to set custom headers for whatever
reason when you do Service Worker work
for example so I added that and sketched
upload config because sometimes you
wanted to do single page application so
you need to do rewrites and I sketched
on a config and in the end I kind of
realized what I had was pretty much the
same as firebase has on their static
hosting so I decided to basically just
adopt the entire firebase convict which
is pretty cool because while firebase
does have a tool to allow your offline
development for the static hosting they
don't support HTTP 2 or push and so with
simple HT new server you can kind of do
that now I mean it's not a hundred
percent high fidelity the implementation
I wrote but so far it's work with every
project that I have on firebase and I
thought that's pretty cool so yeah that
I bet you just got implementing and
that's what I want to kind of talk about
so if you want to start by getting the
code you would have to go on to github
it is in the google chrome org in the
repo called simple hdu server who would
have thought and the readme has
hopefully all the information you need
how to get it how to install it but also
obviously it has the code and so the the
entry point to the code the main
function literally the main function is
in simple easy to server let go and it's
in a way it's straightforward it's just
a lot of manual confit because I'm doing
some some tricky stuff which I'm going
to explain later but I do flag parsing
except the server and then I have one
function which is going to be called
forever request that comes in so and
this function gets
pretty similar to Express actually gets
a response object where you put in your
response and your headers and the
response and the request object it has
all the request data and I basically
wrote a function calls process with
process with config that takes both
these objects and just mangled them
according to the config so if the
request matches a rewrite rule it will
just rewrite the request if the request
matches a header rule that will add
these three these headers to the
response and then just returns and what
you get back is you figure out if you
have to redirect it because then you
stop or otherwise you will push the
resources if there's any link headers or
you will grab the files from the file
system that you need and just push them
out to the client and I have one bid I
used the gzip implementation from the
New York Times they have a go
implementation for gzip not for use it
but for an HTTP compatible version of
gzip where as long as I'm sure that the
contents of the file are text-based I'm
gonna run through gzip and I think a lot
of local development tools are missing
out on this feature because in
production you almost always want to
have gzip enables especially for CSS
because there's so much who wins if you
enable gzip for CSS and a local
government you kind of miss out on these
gains and so you might spend time
optimizing things that don't need
optimising so but simple if you say we
always have gzip enabled for locally
permit which i think is pretty important
and if it is gzip then I just put up a
fault and that's basically the whole
request response cycle so I've been
mentioning push but I said I remove the
push manifest so how does it work now so
most CD ends use a link header the HTTP
link header and if it has a rel equals
preload the city ends like CloudFlare or
Akamai will turn this header into an
additional push so if you look into the
read may further down you will have an
example with a Harris down here where I
say the key is link so I'm specifying a
link header and the value is the file
that I want to push in angle
brackets and then I say RL preload
because only rel preload will be pushed
there's also prefetch which will
actually make the browser download and
parse the entire file so preload is a
little different and and usually it's
also a good idea to specify what this
file is if it's an image or a script
because the browser might prioritize how
much bandwidth to allocate to that push
but that stuff that this tool allows you
to play around with an experiment so
this is now how you do pushes and
another thing I want to touch on which I
thought was I felt a little bit smart
after doing it but then it turns out a
lot of people do it already but still I
I totally thought I came up with it and
is the hijack I should be listening that
I wrote um if you look into the HTTP
detect don't go what I'm doing here is
for web server usually you open a
listener on like port 8080 or some port
that listens for incoming connections
and then it gives a connection and
usually that connection is handed to the
web server and the web server reads from
the connection does the HTTP protocol
parsing all that kind of shenanigans and
sends back a response violet connection
this hijack listener basically is a
wedge in between the web server and the
listener because the problem is that if
you bind an HTTP web server which heb to
practically is to port 8080 and you type
localhost colon 8080 in your browser the
browser will attempt to connect using
HTTP plain text and it's just gonna fail
because the the browser sends a plain
text request but the server is trying to
do a TLS handshake and it's just gonna
fail miserably and it's gonna close the
connection so what i'm doing here
basically is I'm taking the connection
before it gets to the server
implementation and checking if the first
byte on the connection is the number 22
it's a check I'm doing right here if
it's the number 22 I can be really sure
that it is an HTTP connection because
the first byte of the TLS handshake is
by 22 so if that happens then I say I'm
fine continue go to the web server if
it's not however I basically just ignore
whatever the server is at the client is
sending me and just dump
redirect response to the web to the
browser so the browser knows oh I have
to reconnect via HTTP and now it will be
an encrypted connection so now even if
you forget to type in HTTPS it will
redirect you and you won't even notice
so it always works which I thought is
super helpful because I didn't have it
before and it was super annoying so this
is like a really neat little trick that
I found and I thought was kind of cool I
guess we could talk a little bit about
the the firebase config basically and go
you usually take any kind of JSON file
by defining a struct and that's what I
did here so I just wrote down what the
jason looks like as a struct and the go
jason powers are just will fill in the
fields for me so it's super easy and go
to read jasonfults and then i just take
as i said with a process function take
response and request and go through all
these rules and do whenever I find
something that matches this request the
only problem here is that fire-based
shows it not an art format but the way
you define patterns to limit rules to
only to certain requests they use
globbing so I expect rec exists usually
but they use globbing and globbing is
what you usually use on shells so if you
type something like star J s it means
every file that ends in dot J's you
probably have encountered this and these
are extended globs which add a few more
capabilities to this so called globbing
so while star only matches files in the
current directory star star means all
the files in this directory and all
other directories below this you have
syntax to group multiple file endings
but the problem is that this is kind of
a very node specific syntax and there is
no package for it and go so I had no
choice but to write my own and I thought
I'm not gonna explain how it works okay
what I'm doing is I'm taking the glob
string and using sing simple string
replace functions to turn the globe into
array X and I'm gonna leave it as
let's call it an exercise for the reader
to read this code and understand it and
explain why there is a pig emoji in the
middle so and enjoy that but basically
what it allows me to do is to compile
these extended globs and turn it into
reg X's and then I can use the old reg X
matching functions to see if a request
should be mangled with this rule or not
so I thought that's kind of like in neat
little detail and something I want to
touch on in the end is that in the repo
you find all the instructions on how to
install it on your system so if you have
go installed you can just type go get
and install simple h2 server if you
don't have go install you can find
binaries in the release section which
I'll link to here is you just click
there and you'll see for every release I
upload binaries for Mac OS Linux and
Windows so whatever system you're on you
should be fine I also have Linux on
binary so you can use it on your
Raspberry Pi if you are into that I have
it running at home I respect Pi which is
kind of cool I also added a brew formula
which makes it really easy if you're on
Mac OS to just tap into the into the
brew keg I think they call it and
install advisor and keep up to date
because automatically updates with brew
and also recently I added a docker file
which I thought was pretty neat because
you don't need to have anything
installed on your system
except docker and can surf the current
directory via simple hd2 using the
docker image and then if you wanted to
you could even push the docker image to
cloud platform and you know share it
with a colleague however I just want to
mention simple HTTP server is not a
production ready web server it's meant
for local development so I didn't do any
profiling performance optimizations I
didn't even think about security I think
by default it's completely course
enabled so it just opens up everything
to the world don't use it in production
it's for local development but if you
want to fix something up then I feel
much more comfortable now inviting you
into the wrapper because now the code is
actually you know more approachable so
if you want to do that feel free to go
the repo I'll put links to all of this
in the description so you can just click
and go there
maybe star it that'll be nice also if
you liked this video and what bothers
you you should probably subscribe
because then you'll get notified about
new videos and I think I think that's it
for this video and um it hurts me to say
but I guess the next video it's gonna be
Paul again well stick around if you want
to see that see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
