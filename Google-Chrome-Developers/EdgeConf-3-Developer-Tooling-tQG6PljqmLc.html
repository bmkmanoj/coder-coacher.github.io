developer tool no longer a phrase that
was used to bully me in the schoolyard
it's the key part of web development
it's difficult to imagine how we survive
through a period where you know all we
could do is pick play a game of higher
or lower with with alerts mean that's
how I first start debugging and browser
error messages were you know at best
industry goose indistinguishable from
stone of philosophy you know things like
undefined is not defined yeah thank you
brother Oh too many arguments just
everyone everyone chill out but what of
the future you know where can we can we
can we take this well i'm joined by this
panel of developers developing developer
tools with developer tools for
developers they are kenneth ehrenberg
started debug and effort to unify remote
debugging tools Henry Burris i'm going
to pronounce your name wrong already
sorry a founder of no flow the
kickstarter based visual flow based web
development environment and we got NJ
the instigator of brackets Adobe's code
editor built off the back of web
technologies representing the browsers
we got Joe Walker who's working on
Mozilla's new and shiny developer tools
we've got Pavel Feldman who's working on
the chrome developer tools and to start
us off with some words about things a
man who needs no introduction okay big
up to my chrome boy it's Paul Irish rad
thank you so I want to give you a brief
overview of kind of where we're at web
developer tooling if we can get my
slides up will be good there's been a
lot of iteration and movement lately but
I wanted to first kind of bring us back
in till I kind of the history of just a
moment it's not no it's not me it's that
it's that computer
yeah oh yeah it's right insane love it
all right thank you guys i'm gonna give
you a quick overview of where we're at
with propel for tooling um but to do
that i want to head back and talk it out
of the history back is down in six hixxy
the editor html5 spec he was kind of
testing out how html5 our HTML is parsed
and he kind of he he wrote a tool and
this tool came out to be first he was
like diagramming how dom is constructed
based off of HTML is like you know i can
create this live Dom viewer and so here
is the dom view of what we've
constructed with you know in this case
just a quick p tag right that's our dom
and then it just so happened that only
three months later this guy basically
debuted just three months later joke
hewitt released these initial screen
shots of Firebug kind of leading us to
this the angle brackets representation
of the Dom that we know and love and see
every day now i do want to shout out to
the more OG the OG developer tool this
is Venkman the JavaScript debugger
inside of Firefox this is debuted 2001
so it's really kind of the first thing
but since then there's been a lot of
movement so fast forwarding now I want
to show you where some of the developer
tools are these days so first over on
firefox there's been some fantastic
things happening i'll show a quick
preview of what things look like with
the WebGL shader editor so we have here
is a WebGL scene and we are live editing
a glsl shader i'm kind of changing some
dimensions of this one of the really
nice aspects i like about this editing
environment is as we live at in it and
make some mistakes we actually get
feedback on invalid validation errors
that are
that we are triggering in the glsl now
moving outside of that there's been a
lot of fantastic work this is a screen
screen shot of some new upcoming work
from the memory tooling inside of
Firefox developer tools heap snapshot in
and showing what what's going on inside
of the memory you might have seen this
this is an nice visualization of what's
happening with with CSS transforms
really fantastic to understand how
exactly the original shape is being
modified through transforms also this
fantastic or query was stopped here at a
breakpoint but we understand the various
scopes that are active and see for
instance how a certain variable may have
been available in a previous scope but
has now been overridden so it gets
striked out and then this was a
fantastic experiment that I don't think
is landed yet but I like where it's
going it's audio break points so
basically kind of like hearing when
different points in your code get hit I
really like this approach all right so
over on chrome devtools there's been
some fun stuff happening you might have
seen screencasting so this is an effort
to say hey we can actually take what's
on the screen of your device and show it
inside of your desktop browser not only
can we show it but also have
interactable so if because typing on a
phone is pretty slow we can just type on
your keyboard click around and all those
clicks will be translated into touches
on to the device then a few more good
stuff this is a flame chart
visualization of the JavaScript profiler
giving you good insight as far as how
across time your javascript is executing
understanding what is sort of the
pattern in rhythm of function execution
inside the browser this is a device
emulation so emulating a not only screen
resolution but device pixel ratio the
view port configuration touch events and
doing that all right inside of desktop
so that we don't actually have to even
go over to the vice and this is a new
upcoming feature asynchronous call
stacks so we can actually see from where
we are where we how we got there across
an xhr and across
time out so we can trace all the way
back in that full line the i-team has
been trucking ever since the new release
of their f12 devtools they've done some
fantastic work this is a quick
screenshot of where the new network tool
is really good looking waterfall and a
lot of detail in there too also new to
the f12 tools is a proper memory heap
snapshotting and memory profiling so
here we could take two snapshots we can
compare them see what's going on and one
of my personal favorites is their new UI
responsiveness panel which gives a lot
of insight as far as the operations that
are happening inside the browser how
that relates to frame rate so we can
help identify how exactly we can improve
the performance of the page and reduce
the jank so Kenneth here from the remote
debug project showed this fantastic demo
over full frontal remote debug is a
fantastic way to basically bridge the
gap between different browsers that run
times and their brows and their browser
developer tools so we actually have
Chrome's developer tools interacting
with the Firefox browser not only can we
know inspect elements but also change
the Dom of Firefox using the chrome
developer tools and there's a lot more
where that came from NJ from brackets I
wanted to show this quick and fantastic
demo brackets has long been doing kind
of live CSS development where you can
just change things on a fly but this is
the live HTML development so as you know
there isn't a one-to-one mapping mapping
HTML to DOM is not a trivial thing here
we are moving around our HTML our DOM is
updating and we do a quick view into the
CSS that applies for this h2 and make
those changes on the fly make it hot
pink because that's the right way to go
all right another fantastic thing inside
of brackets is the Theseus JavaScript
debugger really powerful work so here we
actually see a log across our code of
how it actually executed we had four
calls that meant entered into the fetch
and we can also see of those whore calls
that entered in the fetch two of them
went into the air handler and then we
can actually see oh we went into air
handler what was in the air object we
can retroactively really look inside an
objection Henry from no flow is here and
I want to quickly show what no flow
looks like it's a new kind of flow based
visual paradigm for for writing
JavaScript applications and see if we
can get that video backup bitterly well
but it kind of turns the the idea that
of looking at code on its head and and
introduces a much more kind of
revolutionary idea for building together
rich experiences all right so beyond
kind of what's represented here on the
stage there's a few other things that
are happening inside the ecosystem of
browser developer tooling I want to
quickly show the tracy GL project came
out a little while ago but said you know
weird is going to log absolutely all the
operations that are happening in this
case we are logging not all this but we
inspect retro actively what happened
here and we can actually see these if
statements there in red down at the
bottom because these conditions were not
met so visually we see oh these all
failed we skip those conditions and we
skip the associated context blocks with
them spy chase is a similar kind of
thing this has since been acquired by by
the web storm and kind of consumed by
the web store my IDE but over on the
left hand side we have all the run loops
for different events and then the call
sex that they triggered and then we can
identify how exactly we met those call
section to the code really nice usable
experience this is a project called ear
horn but you might have seen a similar
thing from the light table IDE here we
map in the runtime information of what's
happening inside the browser and
bringing that right into the code so we
can see on mouse move all these you know
our client X our client wise live
updating we can get a good idea of how
this while looking at code what the
state is in the browser is a quick shot
of
looking at / statement based JavaScript
profiling heat map so we can see by at
the statement level or even expression
level where our code is is most
expensive Adobe's been doing some
fantastic work inside the browser this
is an experiment for a GUI for editing
CSS shapes so we can move around inside
the GUI and we update the CSS shaped
polygon that's defined underneath it and
we've seen a fantastic amount of
innovation when it comes to all the
JavaScript frameworks that are creating
better tooling for themselves so this is
a react Chrome extension on the it looks
like kind of standard dev tools but it's
actually completely representing their
kind of applications state of the world
and in all its properties and similarly
this is embers chrome extension they
have a fantastic view of all the
promises that are active and fulfilled
inside the browser and this is inspiring
a lot of browsers themselves as far as
how we can better supply a good
information around some of these new
things like promises inside the browser
so to me like what is the role of
developer tools these days you know
allowing us to develop fast at the speed
of our thinking letting us go as quick
as we want making debugging suck let's
none of us want to be debugging
hopefully tools can help us avoid the
situation when we are debugging but when
we when we're there it should be easier
for us and web development is hard tools
can keep help keep us on the Golden Path
make sure that things are performing
make sure that things work great across
devices and tools can help fill in the
gaps of our of the knowledge that we
don't have enough things that we forgot
so I think developing for the web for
JavaScript can be better everyone on
this on the stage believes that has been
developing tools and I'm excited to see
what's next thanks
so Paul's gonna duck out now cuz he's
he's got the dreaded illness I can hear
a few people in the room have so we've
got his stunt double Pavel's gonna fill
in on the panel for him I yeah I can
hear a few people coughing I had it last
week as well I've managed to trace it
back talking to some of the employees of
GDS who took a trip up to Newcastle and
I hear that that's where that's where
this illness first that came from so
it's another valuable addition to the
world from Newcastle thanks for that
guys I'm kidding of course I love Greg's
right first question before we start the
these guys are developing the tools that
are supposed to make your lives easier
so if they say anything you disagree
with for there's anything you want to
elaborate on then you know use on slide
if that's not working for you please
just raise your hand and I'll i'll pick
you out for a question the first
question comes from Sebastian TV was
Sebastian over there we go sebastin
microphone
in the future can we expect to do all of
our development within the browser will
browser devtools become our full ID or
should we should browsers concentrate on
interfacing better with IDs so
macromedia brought a rendering engine to
their ID 17 years ago but now it feels
like browsers are bringing IDs to the
rendering engine and now we have code
editors that are written entirely in
browser technology Joe I'd like you to
come home on this what do you see
Firefox's devtools becoming a full idea
so I think nobody would like us to say
you're not allowed to use sublime
anymore or whatever your editor is for
brackets or brackets here so that's not
going to happen on the other hand there
are things that the browser knows about
how it's laying stuff out and what
values are inside the JavaScript engine
that you can only know by being a
javascript in or by being the browser so
there are times when you will want to
edit stuff inside the browser as well so
the answer I think is both what NJ yours
there's also a browser right I wouldn't
call it exactly that I think our goal is
to time were directly close more closely
to browsers I mean exactly what Joe said
which is that there are things that only
the browser knows about and browsers in
my opinion should focus on what they do
really well which is inspection right
there inspecting the runtime they can
tell us all this information that
information i think for quick stuff or
you know when you're really focused on
the browser it makes sense to have tools
in the browser and obviously you know
that's a great workflow for that but
there's times when what you're really
focused on is your coding right you're
not necessarily you don't want to live
in the browser when what you're doing is
writing a bunch of coding yours trying
to get stuff working and you're
iterating rapidly on your code the
browser isn't maybe necessarily the best
environment for that so i think what we
should really be focusing on for that
aspect is to make it so that the browser
information is exposed to code editors
and other kinds of tooling in a no flow
whatever so that we can provide a much
richer development experience outside of
the browser as well working with the
browser I I agree with you that's the
whole reason why i started below
debugging and Joe I actually disagree
with you because because the browser
today has a lot of information that is
not exposed to the outer world but I I
think I think that's a problem of the
state way and right now and because
frankly what NJ is building with
brackets is that
he would love to have that information
available to write better JavaScript
debugging get any information about the
dawn the network stack all the kind of
thing he I assume you would love to pipe
them into your editor but he's not
allowed because he cannot get the
information so i think the
responsibility of the browser windows is
to expose that information and that's
why i think we need to do start an
effort like remote deep up to unify and
build an interface to up to our browsers
so other tooling windows like brackets
telemetry benchmarking tools can start
accessing that information that right
now only privileged tools like building
live tools and bouncers has access to so
there's two different things there
Firefox developer tools work remotely
they log in through a TCP sockets I know
yeah all of that stuff you can get out
as well as I can so we're not keeping
anything private at all and there's a
self documenting API to get a list of
everything that we are talking to
there's a second part to it and um I'm
sure is coming into the question on this
which is should there be a standard
protocol by which we debate do we want
to I don't again that's the question is
feeling coming and we'll get there well
it's the browser as a because it has it
has the runtime all built-in is it in a
bad position to do things I even even
with code like like or complete I mean I
watch games developers work and it seems
to me that they just right you know a
comment to do make half life free and
then from then they just hit the tab key
you're the best games developers are
also the best at track and field the
arcade game is a browsing the best
position to do stuff like that yes and
it so we've got some stuff that does
fairly deep analysis of JavaScript now
and we'll do some fairly clever
completions that is just landing I mean
that to be honest most of that
technology is static which brackets
could do just as easily but I think
there is actually value and we did some
experience really on we haven't really
done it in brackets around it's as
requiring the run time for writing like
if you're stopped at break point you can
just ask it what's available now and
there is more stuff there
again we could do that from a coder as
well as long as it's exposed to the
runtime here I guess the other point i
would make i don't know if i'm getting
away from what you're asking but is that
you also want to write other kinds of
code be light besides browser code often
and so having one environment for here
i'm going to browser stuff and now i'm
gonna do my note stuff and i'm going to
do my ruby stuff or whatever seems a
little funny of course if you were just
doing JavaScript maybe you could
retarget the browser developer tools to
note I mean you can already do that with
no to inspector and things like that but
i think you know this room for lots of
different kinds of tools people have
lots of different workflows they have to
work with local command line tools they
do this and that in terms of you know
the browser sort of has its role as a
kind of sandbox place where you do
browser stuff and I think that again I
think the solution is you have both
kinds of tools then they talk to each
other yeah like that I don't think like
having a consensual divot tool with
building to the browser its ruling out
having another tool like your editor but
the kind of problem i think by having
really specialized browser tools for
each browsers that is a developer i need
to learn a new dev tool when i'm
targeting another browser so that means
my workflow is kind of broken because if
i develop the chrome i need to use learn
how to use chrome devtools navigate the
source code set breakpoints if i do the
firehouse animal in their tool and to me
that's just this kind of my productivity
so there's a lot we can do to help there
so you'll notice that in Firefox dev
tools now the key sequences the same as
in Chrome's in our box model highlighted
has just landed then all of the colors
to denote borders padgett paddings etc
they're the same colors and I ease
exactly the same as well so the stuff we
can do to help there if I don't but I
think there are many reasons why I just
saying there should be only one tool is
hard but that's that old question again
we're going to compare to object well we
move on to the next question I'd we've
got question from the floor from
everyone's favorite shaver Remington
sharp on the point
kind of you know welcome to Firefox dev
tools work the chrome devtools working
with IE tools so I I haven't used the
f12 tools yet and when I look at the you
our responsiveness I wonder whether or
not that's going to give me more insight
to the responsiveness of my web page
across all the browsers or if it's just
for that browser and that's something
I'm unsure if I I mean I'm quite
comfortable in chrome and I can navigate
dead to it very well but am I debugging
for Chrome or am ia debugging across the
play in most cases it's bugs yeah sure
before things like performance and
responsiveness I've no clue and do we
need all these different tools for each
to target each browser well actually
leads into my next question so I'm going
to get hurt Shane Hudson to three Dow
because it kind of expands on that
microphone you rewrote my question for
this initiatives like remote debug look
to unify developer tools is this a good
thing or could it have the diversity of
to work that's so that's this question
that idea so some people would like to
just have one tool and obviously many
tools are being created it and there's a
there's a ton of ways in which our tools
are specific to what we're doing so you
know there's new AP is that we're
experimenting with we need developer
tools for that and we wouldn't expect
the chrome team to provide us with those
tools so and there are thing you know
there are optimization techniques that
will work on one browser that won't work
on another you know I think there are
good reasons why we have an obligation
to tell you about the stuff that is in
our browser that's we are the only
people that can tell you about it is us
we have that an obligation to do that
and so that's what we're doing yeah so
on that if there was a standard way to
get that info out of the browsers there
is some third-party interested in
building that kind of profiling tools
specifically given task could easily go
and grab the same data feed the same
HTML Javascript whatever to ie Firefox
Chrome grab all of those statistics and
show okay you know here's how this and
this thing performs yeah in that browser
yeah absolutely right now that's
something we don't really have we
definitely don't to kill innovation I
mean it's great that you guys are doing
different things you guys are different
doing your things but as you mentioned
just now to you know you're trying to
make some things the same right because
you want the noise of exam and for just
basic functionality I want to set a
breakpoint I do this one do that even
the more inspection stuff it seems like
it would be valuable to have at least it
at least even if the like highest
shallowest level some kind of just
basically common protocol just to make
it so that we can talk the same way and
then you know this browser might have
certain extensions for the stuff that it
does and you know the browser might have
different extensions for those things
but on places where there really doesn't
need to be a huge difference at least in
the core functionality why not regulus
well well i would say Joe first of all I
don't I don't just one one tool I really
like that we have multiple tools
available but as a developer I don't
want to swap between multiple tools just
because I'm targeting another browser I
don't want to change my workflow as a
developer while I'm crafting a debugger
my application and learn new workflows
because I'm tired in multiple browsers
and that's the reality as front-end
developers a days that we have bunch of
different browser specific tools that we
need to learn and it's counterproductive
so my hope is that your workflow isn't
that different you know sitting a
breakpoint you know that kind of thing
is basically very similar so I'm hoping
but why do I need to do it twice once
and Firefox dev tools and well in
another one in chronicles right so two
different use cases here there's what
brackets are trying to do which is to
log into our dev tools so the
breakpoints inspect the variables that
sort of thing that's one level of
difficult there's a whole different
level of difficulty which is make chrome
dev tools work on against Firefox I know
that support type of there is a massive
massive difference between those two and
you know what you're getting into trying
to do that is all sorts of complicated
problem about object lifetime in the
browser and you know etc there's a
multitude of progress that simple now as
far as the the case for simple debug
goes so I mean just think about right
an add-on for a browser right so you we
started off with you know Firefox
add-ons which will do absolutely
anything and then there's a new API
that's safer that comes on top of that
and you know then it looks like we're at
a state where maybe we could have the
the chrome API and the Firefox now
jetpack API this some similarity there
maybe we can extract out standard don't
feel sign up with grease monkey right
that feels likely lets us write that
that kind of proach of you know giving
people what they want you know
everything filtering it down to what
they need standardizing it that feels
like a good approach and I'm I'm for
that kind of process so but it's hard is
there so it seems like we're all in
agreement so it's boring right we need
to compete to innovate and nobody's
taking that away regular sorry 60fps is
going to be different on firefox from
chrome you need to use different
timelines you use is timeline at least
for now because those pipelines are
entirely different the idea see you on
see with the firefox still so if you are
going for high-tech if you are going for
performance you need to stick with the
tools for the browser as of today now
talking about the baseline that we will
discuss for a single ID or whatever that
will use that baseline I think that ve
bowl is on your side at this moment most
or all the browsers are exposing their
protocols as of today they are different
if you try and bridge them on your site
and prove that there is a value on
bridging them and talking to multiple
browsers there will be an incentive for
us to standardize otherwise as browser
vendors who would always want to
innovate first and standardize later can
if this kind of standardization effort
that you're doing is this something that
you see going to a standards body such
as the to be free of the water VG well
we've been discussing that and I think
it's too early because frankly right now
we don't know how to build for the way
we don't know how to build with
components we don't know how to build
both the dev tools I think what we need
to start in a green upon is the baseline
like is our remote debugging it's that
going to use HTTP is it a bit socket
what what is the very front end
protocol and then we can discuss all the
API details like how is the Firefox API
how is the chrome API but the problem is
like if you are a funeral not a dev tool
developer you want to interface with the
browser that is so goddamn hard and what
I see when I look at what visual studio
or Adobe are doing and then they're
sitting and inventing ways to to do the
instrumentation to extract information
out of the web app so they can protect
that information putting it into into
their editors and frankly I think that's
a complete waste of time because that's
the responsibility of the browser
windows you guys are building the
platform you should enable the ecosystem
of tooling windows we have out there to
build tools for the web right now you
only allow yourself to go for the web
and and I think that's not good enough
so can I suggest a way forward and that
the way forward here is that we start
off with something like a JavaScript API
which allows you to do debugging in a
browser whether that's remotely whether
it's from one web page to another I mean
that we pretty cool though right the
debugger in a web page to look at the
other web pages security issues
obviously ignore the protocol to start
off with do it via JavaScript API that's
the way forward and that is our what's
something that you can build on bit by
bit but that's going to take time on the
relationships objection ok the next
question from a rainy sharp again so we
get Romeo microphone can we just watch
Remy up so my question was rewritten as
well I just made them more extreme to be
more interesting right currently our
ease currently features launched before
they have depth or sport EG promises
service and events web audio and so on
is a spare to developers should we be
ensuring we're developing features that
in our inherently debuggable I don't
actually agree with the question will
you easy over those of you well it's
experiments come before standards right
it has to announce the
in progress so it should be debuggable
but I want to be able to get in there
and debug it whilst the browser's catch
up with me as a developer so so you're
saying it so you just answered your
questions that's well no service and
expense is a really simple example we've
got tools for debugging WebSockets we
don't have taught of debugging those
events you know is that it's hard for us
to go ahead and debug that and why on
browsers making it easier for us which
is that question I don't think we have a
well-established process of dipika
bility for new features we tried to have
everything debuggable by the time it
leaves experiment or is no longer behind
a flag so shadow DOM is probably a good
example that shadow Dom appeared typica
bility was there also behind the flag
and promises are already there but
there's no built-in support for them yet
we're working on it so for us the
measure is future heating stable that's
an absolute requirement for us but
there's no sort of platter process and
it's gnarly driven by our customers so
if you file bugs about lack of typically
of experimental features it gains stars
we will definitely look into it the
promises but is really interesting
because there's a huge thread in the in
expect discussion about promises where
they were saying we're not going to have
a done method that love of a promises
have because if that method is just
there for debugging and we shouldn't be
putting things into the spec that I just
there for debugging said something is
how are you looking to what was your
plan for debugging things like promises
or something you're looking at yes so
we've got this thing called tanks tanks
which is that the thing that you see in
chrome looking back through a sink
things I think would be good to have
some way of listing all promises that
would have been unfulfilled in some way
that will be extremely handy yeah we
want we'd like to do this just I mean I
mean our dev tools are written in
JavaScript we'd like it for our own
purposes if nothing else
you know so we're working on it I don't
know what more I can say than that so do
got a question more for the audience I
guess they've given given all these
tools we have like you know variable
watching break points who here still
uses console dot log as their first
first bit of debugging right I find and
I do this as well and I find this crazy
because just writing debugger is less
characters and Africa and that would let
you inspect it's like is like shaving
with a knife you know when there's a
perfectly good razor blade there for you
units is why do people why don't we
think people like get or debugging well
I think it's because you don't have to
Negev it navigate an interface right
it's like I know the piece of
information I want so let me just put in
the log statement ever have to like goat
whirling through things right the flip
side is you have to know in advance what
you want so it was kind of idea behind
Theseus and I think you know this is
like what some of the other devtools
stuff is doing and this kind of
omniscient debugging thing that's been
around i think it's been in the Java
world for a while is that you don't have
to think in advance about what
information you need you just get it and
you can get it afterwards you just
reviews it and then you figure it out
and I think that's a really powerful
paradigm the problem is they have to
capture lots and lots of data so it'd be
interesting to see that go farther
another thing to remy's point is and
this is something Theseus does and I
think other things to do is I think
there's actually a lot of power in
building debugging tools through
instrumentation right is that you
instrument you instrument the JavaScript
and you can you know like promises you
get instrument the problems library and
figure that stuff out so actually having
like a common library for doing that
kind of instrumentation for debugging
just purely in jobs every party browser
support would be kind of nice and
Theseus has like the beginning of that
has like a generic instrumentation like
right the aliens are trying to contact
us I'm just ignoring I know that I what
is the owner if it's entirely that did
the you I think I mean it reminds me of
a dog and I go into that school there
was no typical of my sense of humor
their spirit because about you Ryan
Wilson I find out that the design flaw
of urinal it's that they're they lend
themselves to a certain amount of
splashback I said this is something we
should fix and and he said to me no no
like if you don't get the splash back
how can you tell you're pissing hard
like a real man
and this is someone who doesn't enjoy
being showered with his with his own
death Lewin but he finds it it affirms
his masculinity and it is is that what
we're seeing with console dot loggers is
young like yeah I'm just using the bare
minimum of the tools to prove I'm a
great coder I'm not going to use all of
it you know it's proving I'm not a good
coder if I have to use all the browsers
hell I'm gonna stop using hutsell don't
like I don't know Bolin I don't know
what this console log thing is you know
there's a lower thread maybe that's a
good time to move on to thee O know
we've got question in the audience is
the element of a synchronicity so is
sometimes it's quite hard to know when
what all the things i triggered in so if
you've got events and things like that
and we find that often that is just
makes it easier to see the flow and the
sequence of things so maybe it's the
element of everything's a lot of things
are in synchronous in the browser and
that it's hard to visualize dyin to
reason about that is their way to make
that better in tools wouldn't it be nice
to have kind of this map where you can
see let's blow in the browser I don't
know I mean that is an interesting thing
about the flow based approach I mean
there's been flow based program allows
for a long time but it's a kind of
interesting that we haven't seen it for
JavaScript and when you're dealing with
large amounts of a sink reducing this is
the number one source of bugs so I think
we have in brackets and generals just
dealing with asynchronous crap right and
so having visual ways of traits that
stuff is very important theses does a
little bit of that but one thought here
what if we enable on a platform level
like new development approach like this
to surface Rock right what if we allowed
external developers to build new kind of
tools for the platform so wouldn't only
be the dips full teams we do have a
question about that coming up so we'll
say that now we got the question of the
back now it's just an extension on the
same thing really I find for mobile
development a lot of the time I don't
want to jump into the dev tools because
I'm working on a very fine grain
something to do with focus and blur
events or touch start and various things
like that and jumping into devtools
actually interrupt that flow so having
being able to look back in as to what's
happened in the last
second to be really useful so thesis
that kind of thing built into devtools
just a snapshot of what has just
happened many of you guys like ended on
this is why i don't use debugger most of
the time group in the dev tools that you
guys not about looking internet by
capturing state so we outside of
devtools tracing has this feature it can
record what's happening and it shows you
sliding window what's just happen it is
not traced into the content world though
so we we've got a braid nodes and
javascript Thea and in devtools we
haven't started doing it we go to the
next topic we got a question from canal
where are you there are lots of
deprecated API sand bad practices that
browsers could detect and warn about how
can tools guide developers towards
better code without expecting developers
to run this but a specific profiler or
manually interpret the results I really
like to fire book for this actually cuz
it has always always visible a little
error counter at the bottom and knowing
that over 50 users would see that too
spurred me on I don't imagine the shame
of it you know is this a useful patent
so yeah I said one of the things that we
are putting serious thought into doing
is to splitting the web console in two
so one part of it would be logging at
one part of it would be JavaScript and
then so we're putting lots and lots of
extra warnings into the console at the
moment there are there are all sorts of
security things like that cause errors
in there etc and I think we should be
having more of them and that basically
encompasses what you're saying but it's
going to make a complete mess of the web
console if we do that so we have two
panels that's what we do I say that's
what we're doing that's what we're
probably planning to do where you know
we've not yeah it's it's not it's not
cold yet that's what the planet we are
not quite splitting the council's but we
are also working on more warnings on
deprecation and knowledge applications
but the performance issues and potential
bottlenecks or everything
I would I would love to see some limping
tools built into the dev tools that is
that our contextual right so while the
app is running then it could take hate
this API is being used as deprecated
this is this likely so they hate you
doing something for that is causing jank
they'll be nice to have an ongoing
checklist of seeing stuff right instead
of just a warning in a console right so
and one of the things we have I think
right now on Firefox OS is on top of the
display on top of your webpage you get a
little a little thing floating over the
top with tells you about JavaScript
herbs it tells you about jank tells
about that sort of thing and there's a
bunch of local things that won't do so
there's also a lot of things could be
done using instrumenting codes we have
an prodigal API that allows installing a
preprocessor that would instrument all
the content JavaScript and chase it log
it and do whatever you want so we expect
a lot of innovation to come from there
from the outside that would we analyze
and promote the tool itself is that
shipping already it is it is there for
quite some time do we see the users on
we've got tools like timeline tiny house
and chrome house as well we are we
seeing users use that or we do we want
to be in a better position where we want
to tell people hey you have layout
flashing going on without them having to
go to that and might say that this is
what layout flushing is this is how you
can find out where it's happening but
we'd know just from a small little test
it is happening it wasn't the question
it was the answer right yeah yeah okay
can we have that and when can we have it
no but I I think that is the solution to
to proper bit performance better
information to developers just like why
slow delivered for big performance right
that you had a most of those do is just
want to have a checklist to see hey I
need to have complete these 500 issues
of what I have in my app and then I'm
good right yeah what do you want to make
timeline more popular we want to draw
attention to it and we will do that and
you will see warnings that's cool right
everyone thinks question this is from
Kyle Simpson where's Kyle over then
right so disclosure of bias a couple
years ago I worked with Joe Walker on
the Firefox developer tools team so you
just have to keep that in mind when I
asked these questions first is what's
stopping every browser from providing
headless access and automation kind of
like phantom j/s but for testing
processing and then it's not just
JavaScript that's the entire stack with
HTML and CSS but sort of headless into
the tool so their shifts us away from
what's happening in the browser to
happening outside the browser puffle
joke ship it and so the very short
answer to your question is nothing
what's stopping us nothing there's a
fire my question will actually do you
want from headless is this yeah what's
the what's the question behind it from
the browser so expire ok so it's testing
ok so yes there is a Slimer jayus which
is basically this sort of thing it's not
100-percent headless it nearly headless
it's kind of maybe here so yes I mean
that's as much as I can say I mean I'm
kind of out of my depth here a bit
because this is a lot of this the answer
this question is kind of like deeper
browser engineering then as devtools
engineering we've had new api's recently
that look like they should make this a
lot easier and I'm fairly sure that
slimer is working on those AP ice and
select add that more yeah we have a new
version of webdriver is implemented on
top of the devtools prodigal so you can
actually drive things in the browser and
there's also a telemetry API that allows
headless operation
that's actually how chrome team is
testing against regressions so whenever
you have a condom that you don't want to
regress in scrolling you're using
telemetry to implement a perfect test
for it so it is there it is publicly
available you can use it but it's not
centered iced and it's Chrome well my
web driver is enough of a standard right
i mean there's that inside firefox now
some internal firefox tests use that so
that's becoming more of a cross-browser
stands so i mean let me come back to
your know why headless you want to be
able to run it without touching it as
opposed to you don't want to see it
right because nearly headless is okay if
if it's not a visual problem if what you
want is automated testing you don't
matter if the screen flicks briefly
right there's the testing side of it but
there's also a functionality side but
people use fan of Jay us to spin up a
headless browser that they can render
screenshots from or things like that
that's the sort of thing I'm talking
about being able to in the build process
spin up a total for regression testing
or pulling out rendering you're
analyzing the way things are working all
yeah and how the problem really is is
that phantom jse is not you know you
think it's grown or something but it's
not you know it's kind of chrome from a
few years ago with some other weird bits
and minus that yes I think I think it
would be nice if we were better at that
well we know the developer tools
actually do matter when you do that for
the testing purposes a lot of times
want to extract information currently
available in over tools as a part of
those components because it is the part
of your test title might want to audit
that things would not happen trey's
right yeah yeah so it should be for that
idea yeah was that something I promote
Eva would be able to help it but we had
a headless version of these browsers
could then I I see that as a natural
extension right if we had a generic
interface to the Barisan no matter if
you had had this instance of Chrome or
Safari and then we would be able to
interface with the browser we would be
able to take a tool like Chrome's
telemetry and use it across browsers to
do comparison of browser performance and
it would be enabled a different
generation of tools as I see it and
things that we now do specific to
phantom case and specific to Slimer and
I just want to interface with the
browsers and web driver is not enough
because VIP drivers focused only on
automated testing I want to create the
information our timeline events and all
these other things that the browser
currently has right question from the
audience over here this is more a user
perspective kind of question but with
windows arabic so flaky is it possible
for like the browser's full of devtools
when they record iñárritu actually
like ping an end point somewhere which
would so you would make specified and
head this on error ping my server with
the error details in the stack trace so
that way there is complete jayus vonage
in cause or some other unseen event that
you had an automated it's kind of the
browser would tell you this and kind of
give you use metrics and statistical so
you want to get that information from
the few or you want to dipping one
you're running locally i can gather no
say it say you you've we had an era
where we put cross-origin anonymous on
google maps script and basically Google
deployed a new version of maps which
completely broke all the judgeship
nothing could run so there was no error
reporting no nothing basic poem said we
don't want to run this because it's
there's our schools here so it would it
be possible for the browser to
actually paying so say if you have like
a meta tag exciting on arrow king who my
error or 40 and basic you just send the
stack trace it's all this I bake around
us this is well this is one of the
things that native people say native is
way better than the Weber this is
getting metrics on what the hell is
going on out there we should be better
at this well it's going to make tonight
a point before about like do we do we
build features that have debugging built
into them I mean we saw that that
promises didn't but I think what you're
referring to CSP has as a specific
feature whatever log in fact do we need
something like that for error logging
boom question from the audience and just
so back to that what's actually your
problem with window on error because i
think i only do exactly what you say and
we worked perfectly alex is a cause you
will never get somebody to basically
saying so something something to pipe
what you would see as an error in
console yeah what's our two years over
the whole of Yulin panel to redirect the
whole of that log back to you you know
that wouldn't seems like a reasonably i
feel like this there could be some
privacy issue or something I you need to
think about it
this healthy privacy photographers scary
question of the front here and can't
microphone hi sorry kind of tried to
push around buggy as we see it the
performance of the tour group to do
exactly what you guys were talking about
it's great repeated chromic acid
instrumentation and telemetry vp is so
my question is Melissa call to action so
try to push it in the group but so far
in both of those groups the tooling
group until I performance group so buddy
so long so far nobody was really
interested going forward visitors if you
guys have it and why just don't put a
first version together but we will have
there and try to drop the boot camp is
stabilized what cannot be standardized
and start working on it then we were
just waiting for it to prove itself
usable and user-friendly and for now
we're just innovating and moving rapidly
there and so we just need time and we
need more initiated from you from your
side you're pushing for it that was my
first way of pushing years well we're
gonna move on to our last question which
is a good question to end on and it's
from Remy sharp again so we can get Remy
a microphone strap it to him okay so I'd
like to contribute to development talk I
would like contributing to developer
tools we've made easier not just adding
a panel or tweaking current between yet
tweaking functionality how can I get
involved and I had originally tax on
this things like grease monkey made it
very very easy to hack the page and make
it improve for me as the the visitor or
the user or the developer I'd like to
see that kind of like super low barrier
of entry for all of the dev tools except
the Apple because they don't play ball
yeah so what do we need if a developer
wants to get involved in in chrome
devtools what what can they do we're not
particularly good at that so if you want
to contribute to core dev tools the
entry bars fairly high because we are a
part of blank source tree so it's not
good the extensions a guy is not rich
enough for your main straight and it's
not reach for for a reason we don't want
people to fight for resources and break
each other so we're just trying to get
better that and in both ways in
contributing decor and providing more
richer extensions api's but for now you
get a wiki or something if follow the
instructions and you manage to applaud
attach it a bit sorry for you but that's
about it is wrong as of today so it's
bad so we can do I mean Firefox you can
hack anything on it you can you know
it's all JavaScript in a diff tool so
you you there isn't a limit to what you
can do the downside is next month it'll
break we are trying to create some api's
that are more standardized that won't
break and we spent some time with you
and the guys working out what they would
like and we've done stuff too with
angular to try and you know have custom
extensions there if there's something
that we're doing that you that is not
doesn't help you then share to us and
we'll thing is that's that's more kind
of like high leveled about that they
experienced developer can do that kind
of thing I'm talking about grease
monkeys a really good example people
could just pick up a greasemonkey script
and install it for themselves to make I
make my banking site readable using
grease monkey yeah I want to be able to
do that with like dev tools like like
being above the font was a huge deal for
me because I don't like tiny fonts and
now that both firefox and chrome
but before I had to tweak a style sheet
which was a liberal or a barrier of
entry it's about making them and so you
lazy a greasemonkey script to plug into
devtools in effects sort of until I'm
ready to work under the low barrier van
goe to make it easy for anyone here to
to make their dev tools better Ronnie so
what do you want a better deployment for
it or you want it for your for myself
because yeah well aren't you kind of go
right here's greasemonkey acts that type
access then yes in a bit complete
cluster yeah but I'm talking about for
the individual to be a hack their own
dev tool so what we want to fix things
and made comps and make photoshop things
and there is anything work but whenever
a greasemonkey script and send people to
being a result they saw the page change
and basically interact with the change
already right so a scriptable interface
to the developer tools would allow me to
do that as well we don't want to
reinvent greasemonkey anything is as
easy to show that means that would look
like or a tutorial how G button works EF
Java safeway of scripting the dev tools
would be really useful so one thing
we're trying to do this is a road and
with some way down this road what would
be very cool is if you could simply
clone a repo on gates which is our dev
tools and you could now say in your
browser don't look inside yourself look
over there and it's all just tech files
we're not I'm actually there's quite a
few bits of that that work already like
you can already say don't look inside
yourself look there right nan said you
could always do that with Rome today
pine to trial is over there chrome has
it for for a couple of years but it's
not sort of getting traction it uses it
helps the adoption that helps getting
more contributors because it's easier to
set up that environment and hack on dev
tools but people don't use it for like
on a regular basis it's just too
inconvenient but if you fertilize it
yeah I think so it's a it's there it has
been advertised quite some when the
remote debugging appeared because mu
debug it was proved by the external
front and running as
web page externally but we could rather
we could do something like that yeah
because that's that's a big starting
step being able to just say okay instead
of loading up the internal dev tools
point it's the copy that I've got it and
they're like you start hacking you ever
been in devtools that's like fork dev
tools and it spits all the code out for
you and it's the other directory and you
get it well and that is unfortunate at a
time I can see a lot of people have have
extra questions but the very best of the
people on this panel will be in the post
this evening the people who go home
early don't really care about you
without that brings us onto onto a break
so you have a coffee before the next
step which is build process but thank
you very much to the panelists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
