errors are gonna happen and so help me I
should write code that says when an
error happens what actually happened but
I was I didn't in my Python I had this
template not found and now you can see
here on the cardio she says like
template not found and the template is
looking for and then which file is
actually requested by if you look at the
the code before this it said not found
and that was it
that's all it said and what I found was
that the the build script the Travis
build script was not working it was
failing and I was like bababa but why so
I in a previous video I mentioned I
couldn't get the Travis stuff working
the build files weren't the Travis image
wasn't working and a bit of a Google
around and someone else that color fled
said you just want to restart your
default docking machine so it's like
docker - machine stop default and then
document doctor - machine start default
and what that does is it restarts the
default document which is kind of we
expect given the name of the command and
after that I could download Travis right
I downloaded the Travis image which was
about a gig and a half I think in the
end it was pretty pretty sizable this
thing so that took a while to do so I'm
sitting there kind of like mm-hmm got
the file got it the Travis image booted
up and I went in and I run each command
command command because this what I was
saying on seen this on the log further
Travis it goes blah blah blah do
anything and it says it said why was
saying not found that this is the
interim version which was still not
billing it says template not found
sections home and I was like what why
why
what so anyway I get this get it running
duplicate all the steps that this is
going through on the on that Travis
image and it turns out that because it's
a fresh clone even after the NPM install
I haven't actually run a build so I
don't actually
bake-out the styles and the JavaScript
as part of the Travis script and so now
you can see in the Travel Channel the
last thing it does is an NPM run build
to actually make the JavaScript and CSS
work and I've learned something you know
relearned
an old lesson which is if you actually
output what the actual problem is then
you will actually discover what the
probable solution will be rather than
just writing not found I actually have
slightly more meaningful messages here
probably won't be the last time it bites
me but it did and it took me probably a
good couple of hours last night to try
and get to the bottom of why it was an
embarrassingly long time but that's what
happens so there you go yeah
subscribe to the channel if you want
more of these thank you so many thank
you so many no try that again Paul thank
you for all the comments and all the you
know questions and all that kind of
stuff you can get the code on github and
you should definitely go and take a look
you know you can see what I'm doing I'm
just committing stuff in as I go and it
is it's really fun to share all this
with you so thank you for joining me as
I say subscribe if you want to get more
and I'll catch you in the next entry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
