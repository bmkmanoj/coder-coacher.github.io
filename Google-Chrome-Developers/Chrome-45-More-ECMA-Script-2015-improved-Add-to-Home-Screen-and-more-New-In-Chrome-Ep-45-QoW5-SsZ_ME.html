Atmos Crypt 2015 functionality
improvements to app install banners and
a new security feature to ensure that no
one is messing with your code from the
Empire Hotel in New York City let's take
a look at what's new in Chrome over the
past year we've added a number of new
JavaScript features defined in the Atmos
crypt 2015 specification formerly known
as es6
in chrome 45 we've added support for
arrow functions beyond the shorter
syntax they eliminate the need for dot
bind or the VAR self equals this hack
necessary for anonymous functions
because they lexically bind the this
value arrow functions may take some
getting used to but once you've played
with them they become second nature
jason Orndorff has a detailed post on
arrow functions on hack stop Mozilla org
you can find the link in the description
below there are new methods on the array
object like from of fill find and find
index that make dealing with arrays much
easier on Android you can now defer the
add to homescreen banner and show it at
a more convenient time when it doesn't
interrupt the application flow simply
prevent the default action by calling
prevent default on the before install
prompt event and save a reference to the
event for later then when you're ready
we trigger the prompt by calling prompt
on the stored event we've also added the
ability to install native apps directly
from your site it works in much the same
way as Add to Home screen your site
needs to be served over HTTPS have a web
app manifest file that includes
information about your name
then if the user visits your site at
least twice over a two-week period
they'll see the banner check the link in
the description below for full details
Oh perfect um could I get the fruit cup
please
awesome now we're okay right to help
protect users sub resource integrity
provides a mechanism for the browser to
verify that a fetched resource has been
delivered without unexpected
manipulation you can use this to
mitigate the risk of a compromised
server or ensure that only carefully
reviewed third-party code is executed
this helps to ensure that the expected
resources used not just any resource
that lives at a particular URL the
current spec and implementation covers
only script and link rel equals
stylesheet elements once the file has
been retrieved the browser compares the
hash of the file to the hash provided by
the integrity attribute of the element
if the hashes don't match the browser
won't use it
Oh perfect uh hey this isn't what I
ordered
oh well to learn more about sub resource
integrity check out the link and samples
in the description below these are just
a few of the new features in chrome 45
for developers you can get more details
in the links below I'm Pete LePage and
as soon as chrome 46 is released I'll be
right here to tell you what's new in
Chrome but for now it's time to grab a
drink and sit by the pool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
