opinionated workflow for creating
beautiful compelling web applications
yeoman tries to help with many of the
pain points we web app developers have
today such as keeping your libraries
up-to-date avoiding authoring
boilerplate code and putting together a
thorough automated kick-ass build
process they can keep your apps fast to
get started with you omen let's get it
installed to get yeoman set up I pasted
the line currently on screen at the
moment into my terminal this will go and
fetch all the dependencies yeoman needs
to get installed this process takes
between 10 to 15 minutes so we recommend
grabbing a coffee while you wait I can
now kick start off a brand new
application using the yum in a nick
command this will ask me a number of
questions about what I'd like to include
in my app such as Twitter bootstrap the
Twitter bootstrap plugins require Jas
and one or two other pieces once I've
confirmed it'll go and fetch the latest
version of all of these dependencies
they'll then scaffold out my application
so i can start coding right away it'll
also include scaffold out unit tests
using mocha we can preview what this is
generated using the yeoman server
command and there we go I can see that
my basic application is working and um
it just confirms all the different
pieces that it's included now what if I
were to make a simple change to this
page let's go to over to the source so
let's say I wanted to make a change to
deadline as we can see yeoman is gone
and refresh the page automatically
without us having to do anything the
reason for this is that Yeomans using
live reload functionality to
automatically reload the page whenever
changes are made to market files scripts
or styles now this is great I have a
basic application scaffold in place but
let's say I want to do something a
little more fancy let's say I want to
create an app that lets me see what the
weather is like at my mom and pops place
so there's a jquery plugin that i want
to use for this there's a weather plugin
but I can't remember the name of it so
let's see if yeoman can help me with
that if i use the yeoman search command
and just type in jquery this will go and
query the twitter bauer package
management registry which is a registry
containing a bunch of libraries
frameworks and plugins now i see that
it's actually got the weather plugging
i'm looking for so to install it locally
so i can use with my project all i have
to do is type in yeoman install and the
name of the plug-in and there we go it's
gone and it's installing the plugin i
also want to use the handlebars
templating library and we can use yeoman
install to get that to the next thing i
need to do is add references to the two
packages i just installed so one for
handlebars j/s and another for the
jquery simple weather plugin next I want
to write some handlebars template code
that actually consumes the data being
returned by the jQuery simple weather
plugin here's some I wrote earlier
finally we just need to write some
jquery plugin code to configure simple
weather and we're off i'm going to save
the page and it should automatically
refresh which it does your mom and pops
place in sheboygan is partly cloudy with
a high of 83 and a low of 67 I can now
build a production-ready version of my
application using yeoman build this will
go and optimize my scripts my Styles
concatenate minify them and perform a
number of other optimizations to things
like image files and so on I can then go
and preview the final version of my
application using yeoman server once
again with the disc profile
now this is great but my own
applications are a little bit more
sophisticated how does the omen help me
with this well if we go back to the
yeoman and Nick command and this time
pass in help a number of options will
show up let's go through some of them
we've got Chrome apps ember angular
backbone backbone boilerplate to stack
Uhler and others these are actually
called generators and they're a wave
scaffolding out boilerplate code for new
application let's try using one let's
create a new backbone application so
yeoman init backbone what this is doing
is it's going in scaffolding out a
completely new backbone application
including backbone jquery lodash as well
as your first set of views models
collections and routers if I wanted to
generate a new backbone component I can
also do this from the command line using
a sub generator so yeoman init backbone
and then model followed by the name so
let's say cars will go and create a new
cars model let's go to our app to take a
look at this so scripts models cars
model and there we go the very basic
boilerplate for a model has already been
written up for me yeoman comes with a
number of generators out of the box and
anyone in the community can also create
their own certainly check out the docs
on yo ma IO and we'd be happy to get
your feedback and involvement on github
we're also on g+ twitter and the yeoman
channel on freenode thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
