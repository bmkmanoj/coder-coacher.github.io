to the show in the last episode I was
showing off polymer starter kit to one
of our new polymer CLI generators today
I thought it would be really cool to
demonstrate how you can actually build
your own generator for polymer CLI so
follow me over here to my laptop and
where we want to start is over here on
the yeoman website a polymer CLI
generator under the hood is really just
a yeoman generator and if you haven't
heard of yeoman before it's a little
utility for scaffolding out projects for
you so it'll stamp out your files it'll
do a little bit of variable substitution
and renaming for you and it's generally
a very useful tool for just kind of like
getting up and running with a nice
boilerplate so the first thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna go over to our
terminal and we're gonna run NPM I'll
bump this up a little bit so you can see
it in PM install - G so we're gonna
globally install yo which is the command
for yeoman and this thing called
generator
- generator and that's actually a yeoman
generator that will generate yeoman
generators for you so you can run that
command it'll take a second to install
and then I'm gonna go over to my desktop
and I'm gonna make a new directory and
every polymer CLI generator needs to
start with the prefix generator polymer
in it and then you can give it whatever
name you want for your own generator so
I'm gonna call this template seed so
it's a bit of a long name there but that
prefix is really important because that
prefix gets picked up by polymer CLI
after you've installed the generator and
and that's how it actually can tell you
hey this is the thing that we want to in
it so I'm gonna make that directory I'm
gonna CD into generator polymer in it -
let's see now I'm gonna run yo and it'll
give me a few options for things that I
can generate I've got a few other
generators already installed but the one
I want is this one that's just called
generator so I'll do that and it's gonna
ask me some questions I'm just gonna fly
through here and just take all the
defaults right skip all that stuff and
it'll take a second it's going to stamp
out a bunch of files for
me it's also going to in p.m. install
all of the dependencies to make yeoman
run so wait a moment for that to do its
thing
NPM install takes a very long time
alright so we're done we've installed
all of our dependencies and I'm gonna
open this up in my code editor so over
here in our code editor I will I'm gonna
begin things a little bit so you can see
it created a number of files for me
package.json readme bunch of stuff the
one that I really care about is this
generators directory inside of here it's
got an app directory it's got a
templates directory which right now
contains this one file called dummy file
txt and then it's got this index.js file
so let's open that up we'll look at the
index J s file there's a lot of
JavaScript here but most of the stuff
that you don't really need to worry too
much about basically there is a little
section here at the top in this
prompting function where it will sort of
speak to the user in their terminal ask
them questions about the project that
they are setting up this is a good place
for you to create variables that you can
then use elsewhere in your templates so
for instance right now it's just got
this default example prompt here
it's a confirm style prompt so yes or no
prompt and it's gonna ask you you know
would you like to enable this option
just sort of like made something up in
our case what I want to do in our
generator is I want to have like a kind
of a default element that the user uses
sort of like the root of their
application so we'll change this to an
input prompt we're gonna change the name
of the variable to element name the
question is going to be what would you
like your root element to be called and
we're gonna give it a default value of
my dash element so now we've got this
element name property this just
available to us throughout the rest of
our our template now there's also this
writing section this is where it's going
to copy all the files from this
templates directory on to the users
computer so in this case you can see
that it's copying that dummy text file
from the the template path and stumping
it to the destination
path which is basically whichever
directory the user is currently in so
what I want to do now is actually
instead of just using this one dummy
file I'm gonna have a few real project
files and I'm gonna go over to polymer
starter kit and just steal a few things
from here so we know we want to
bower.json so I will open this file up
I'm gonna grab its contents and because
this is like a pretty simplified
generator I'm just going to really slim
this down so I'll say the name of my
project it's just gonna be you know my -
project you know authors are whoever the
dependencies I'll just say right now
that the only dependency is the polymer
itself maybe this is like a really tiny
generator to get people up and running
really fast so this is like the world's
smallest bower.json file that we could
have so we've got that now let's also
create an index.html file I always when
I have one of those again we'll go over
to polymer starter kit and maybe just
steal the one that is over here so we'll
say all right give me the index file
okay dump that in here I can actually
remove some of these things that I I
don't care about as much so I'm not for
instance going to maybe I'm not gonna
import a bunch of elements or anything
like that so kind of let's see well get
rid of these these critical Styles maybe
you don't don't care about those the
element name we're actually going to ask
for that name from the user so instead
of just having a hard-coded element name
right here we're gonna use some of
Yeomans templating syntax so it actually
uses these sort of the syntax kind of
looks like this where if you want to
expand a variable you say bracket %
equals and then variable name you know
whatever that is and then you say % and
you close the bracket right so this is
how you do variable expansion in yeoman
what I'm gonna do is dump that into this
tag here so I'll say alright I want this
to be that element name then I'm gonna
prompt the user for and and then we're
just going to close it and also say hey
that should also be the element name and
we want to steal this and also
use it for our import up here so source
directory we're gonna have whatever
element name they want in there let's
see what else we have here we've got
this little bit of JavaScript that is
going to lazy load the web components
polyfills that's good normally we would
be you know if you want to build a press
web app you might ship a serviceworker
to keep things really simple I'm
actually gonna remove this little chunk
right here so we won't we won't worry
about service workers right now we're
just gonna have like a super bare-bones
polymer app otherwise I think we can
leave pretty much everything in this
file and get rid of this dummy file
don't need that get rid of that the last
thing we want to do is want to create a
source directory and inside of here I'm
gonna create a file and I'm going to
call it underscore element dot HTML okay
and the reason why I'm doing this is
because remember the element name is
something that the user is going to pass
into us as one of their prompts and so
we don't want to hard-code
a file name for that element instead
we're going to also take that file name
and generate it based on the the prompt
that the user the answer that the user
provides to the problem so the contents
of this element are going to be super
simple we're actually just going to grab
some boilerplate code here and dump that
in and what we're doing is we're
importing Bower components we've got our
element name element name for the is
property only name for the value down
here so this is just sort of like a
really really basic polymer element it
doesn't really do anything it just sort
of like says the value of one property
inside of an h2 the cool thing that
we're going to do though is we're gonna
go back to that index.jsp file remember
this is the one where we we prompt the
user for the element name and we have
this little writing block here and I'm
going to replace that writing function
with a custom one that I created earlier
and I'll walk you through what's
happening here so inside of this inside
of this writing function we are taking
the element name which we got from our
prompts this is this is stored inside of
this props variable here so we're
creating a reference to that and then
we're saying that we want to copy our
template files over to the users machine
we're using a regular expression here
though to say hey anything that starts
with an underscore like that element
HTML file that we just created
hold off don't copy that just yet
instead just copy everything that that
doesn't have an underscore over to the
user's computer that stuff that we're
not gonna worry about template in or
anything like that and then we're gonna
specifically tell it to copy that
element HTML file from the template path
and then to the destination we're going
to use an es template literal string to
actually generate that file name based
on the element name property that the
user passed in so I think we've got
pretty much everything we have or
everything we need to test our generator
the next thing that we want to do is
actually kind of like hook it up now
normally what you do is you would
publish this generator to NPM a user
would globally install it and and then
they could start using it using polymer
CLI but before you do that you probably
want to test that the thing actually
works right and so to do this we can use
a handy little NPM command called in
qiyam link so when I run this command
it's actually going to create a symbolic
link on my system for this generator
it's as if I globally installed it but
really it's just linking to this
directory on my file so this is really
really useful anytime you're testing any
NPM library that you're working on you
can kind of pretend like you've got it
installed on your computer make local
changes and it will just update
automatically so now it's as if we
globally installed it so I can go over
to my desktop now and bump this up a
little bit I'll make a new directory
I'll call it you know poly foo something
like that just CD in here and I'm gonna
run polymer in it and we should now have
this option down here for this template
seed thing because remember it's taking
that prefix your generator polymer in it
it's chopping that part off and it's
just using the last part of our module
name which is template seed run this
puppy it's going to ask us some
questions hey what would you like your
route element to be called by default it
says my element I'm gonna call it
instead like my widget or something like
that and then it's going to copy that
file
it's going to run Bower install and
install polymer forests and our web
components polyfills so as that's
running see it looks like it's finished
now we could open up this project and we
can see over in our code editor that we
have our index.html file we bump this up
a little bit so you can see it you can
see that it is pulling in our my widget
element right we've got my widget down
here in index.html I've got my widget in
the source directory so the last thing
really is just to run polymer serve
we're gonna cross our fingers and we're
gonna go over to localhost 8080 and we
should see right there boom hello my
widget just as we were expecting it that
about covers it for today I would
encourage all of you if you want to go
start creating your own generators put
them up on github put them up on NPM
ping me let me know when you create them
I definitely want to share them out to
the world and get as many people
building these cool CLI templates as
possible if you have any questions for
me as always you can leave them down in
the comments or ping me on a social
network of your choosing at hashtag ask
polymer as always thank you so much for
watching I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
