sorts of backgrounds trying to make a
website that no fulfills their dream and
one of the thoughts from that is that we
have a lot of support support is very
important to our business we have a
hundred agents spread between a call
center in san francisco as well as in
miami and when you have a lot of people
talking on the phones passionate you
know web builders you get a lot of noise
and this was kind of the one big feature
that actually drove us towards WebRTC
with flash the auto compensating
sensitivity for the microphone was just
causing lots of echoing dropped calls
even just issues with users than they
weren't satisfied and we have to users
in all these interactions you know we
have a user that is the support agent
providing support and then the user
who's on the phone you know trying to
get their website built and so at the
time we were actually using twilio and
they added WebRTC as an option and we
were you know one of the first people
use it we wanted to use it right away
and as soon as we activated that we
noticed we complete we do surveys we
send out a survey for every call that we
do and we immediately got better
feedback from users about you know
they're able to solve the issue faster
they can understand the agent better you
know it's just a much better interaction
for both sides of the table and so once
we started you know kind of moving
forward with WebRTC we really started to
notice a lot of these other benefits so
it's a nice open platform we are agents
at least used chrome and they can also
use firefox or did very well in this
browsers and the user just needs to
schedule a call or call us inbound and
they can get right to speaking with an
agent and what Tullio actually allowed
us to do was to build out a custom ibr
solution that house has inbound calling
that gives you an estimated wait time
prompts you for a support pin you to
associate with the call before you talk
to the agent and all these features we
were able to build really quickly and
really easily with twilio spy thon sdk
in particular we're Python application
at least for our call center and
it's worked really well for us using
that as well as the Django twilio helper
library as well makes it very easy to
create an IVR you can do alert messages
downtime all sorts of custom routing we
have multiple languages multiple queues
and using the abstractions that twilio
provides it's been really easy for us to
kind of build up our own call center
solution it's tailored to you know what
we're doing so as I was saying it's
really easy for us to get up and set up
we don't even really have to dig too
much Envy internals we're using just
voice right now we're considering using
video but we aren't at this point so for
right now we just use the video SDK and
it's really easy to work with WebRTC
we're actually looking at customizing a
little more for screen sharing that
we're looking to adding into our
applications it's very easy to do that
so we've been really happy with it it
allows us to you know have a great user
experience with users with the most
minimal amount of you know developer
attention and monitoring that we need to
pay to it there's no Adobe plugins to
monitor you know just keep chrome up to
date and it's been really smooth so our
applications a real-time client-side
application we have a socket connections
open to twilio and stays open for calls
and then we have a another socket
connection that handles updates to calls
notes userinfo surveys and all the
interactions inside of WCC our call
center application so it's been really
efficient really easy for us to to use
that and we've as I said earlier we
gotten directly correlated the results
to an improvement in customer
satisfaction and one thing that's nice
about WebRTC at least with the Julio's
implementation is it's very easy to roll
back we do sometimes have issues with
big chrome releases or big Firefox
releases and you can easily through a
user profile we have a toggle and you
can roll back to flash very quickly
fortunately notice right away
you know the user will say hey I spoke
to you last week and it's not nearly as
clear right now I can barely hear you
what's going on and you notice the
result right away but it's nice to have
a fallback definitely a piece of advice
I would give any other advice I would
say WebRTC is kind of different in
chrome and firefox so definitely try to
test for each environment you know don't
expect exactly the same thing in in both
environments one thing that also really
led us looking at web RTC to really
driving factor was flash has been pretty
much removed from mobile browsers now on
Android and on iOS whereas WebRTC is now
supported very well in Firefox and
Chrome for Android as well as the Bowser
browser for iOS so it seems like it's
really moving forward and if you want to
be evaluating mobile as well as tablet
solutions and other clients web RTC
definitely seems like the way to go and
yeah we've been pretty successful with
it helps so are there any questions yeah
under what circumstance what
circumstances do you need to fall back
to flash sorry just a very good question
i would say the the biggest one is a
large browser update like update from
chrome 42 to 43 for instance when they
introduce new AP is especially at scale
when we have a lot of people using
WebRTC we definitely notice issues and
it can be kind of difficult to trace
them back to have our TCS that's one of
the first things we try usually is if
there's any issues with the calls we we
try using flash and see if that solves
the issues but there's a lot more
latency there's a definitely especially
in our office we have a little bit of an
echo and you get kind of hearing someone
else and flashes is tries too hard to
compensate for that and we haven't found
a way to kind of customize that as you
can with love RTC a lot more easily yeah
pretty loud is there a possibility of
having
a chat thing that we can buy for
wix-users wooden others look you allow
people to build their own websites this
is for diagnosing building websites but
if I wanted to have a website with a web
RTC chat or voice thing on my website
would I be able to do that I have to
contact folio directly that's something
we're definitely looking into doing we
do have an app market that allows you to
extend your site with this functionality
right now we're doing a little more on
the html5 media player side of things
with that but that's definitely
something people have asked about you
know they want to be able to have the
video chat embedded on their site and I
think we're going to do it it seems to
be very easy to do with WebRTC just it's
a native JavaScript as you know it's
very simple and easy to work with so if
it's well with the Wix platform yeah one
more question one more question so you
said your agents are using the chrome
yeah whatever customers using are they
on if they are not on Chrome my they
contacting your phone line or most of
them are calling in we have an inbound
line we also call users outbound to
contact them about issues and a lot of
our traffic also comes from a support
scheduler so it's a bridge from phone to
your chrome yes using twilio to do that
and we're looking at adding video and
screen sharing into that but we would
need to obviously have like a web portal
for support integrated with that yeah
thanks all right well thank thank you
Peter so I think I'm we're getting back
on time thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
