themselves just say your name say where
you work and say what one technology or
possibility around all the things we've
seen over the last few days that you're
really excited by but really quickly so
and Rik's go
you already know me I work for a
software I'm Andres Bothans and I'm
really excited about some of the server
just showed you ambien badging and pop
back into browser look yeah I'll just
shout I'm Jake Archibald I'm a developer
advocate on the chrome team and I'm
really excited about streams as you
heard yesterday hi everyone I'm Emily
Schechter I'm a product manager on
Chrome security at Google and as most
you probably imagine from my talk
yesterday
I love HTTP and TLS and secure
connections and all that good stuff
hello everyone i'm zhang jian working
working on samsung internet team i'm
editing service workers i'm alex from
Rossi I'm a product manager on the
chrome team and I'm excited that the web
still has that strength of no
gatekeepers hide an Apple quest also
working at Samsung and WCC tech co-chair
so two hats on this panel and I'm I
think I'm really interested in that the
experimentation going on some of the
stuff that andreas presented around how
how what the lifecycle management of
progressive web apps are how they get
installed how we might be exposed to the
URL all that kind of stuff hi I'm Alex
Russell I'm a software engineer on the
chrome team and I'm most excited about
how much faster you're going to make the
web this year with all the stuff that
we've just built I'm tall I'm a product
manager on the chrome team and I'm most
excited about
PageSpeed module and how you can use it
to help users save data hi I'm Ben Kelly
from Mozilla on the dom team and
currently i'm probably personally most
excited about streams because that's one
I think it's cool hi everyone I'm Ally
al-abbas from the Microsoft edge team
and I'm really excited about service
workers I'm Cal Tran I the partnerships
for Chrome in the web platform team and
I'm most excited to have everyone's
phones
the combination of native and web apps
and it doesn't matter to the user nice
ok so my name is Jeremy work at a little
agency called clear:left I'm a web
developer and something we sometimes do
when we're kicking off client projects
is we'll have what's called a pre-mortem
where we say ok it's nine months out
with the project finished and it was a
complete disaster what went wrong and
I'd actually like to do that in terms of
the web and where we are yes it's a very
exciting time but maybe it's good to get
out and see open what the stakes are and
what are the worst-case scenarios if we
fail with these progressive web apps
here and particular interested in
hearing from not just Google but also
from Microsoft and from from opera and
from Mozilla so Ali actually I mean how
important is all this stuff I think it's
very important actually if you guys
aren't aware Microsoft has this concept
of a hosted web app which is something
that we had started back in 2011 as part
of our Web Apps journey and just
recently we have this thing called a
hosted web app which is basically just
manifest that you can publish the store
which points to your URL and then you
can basically run your app inside of
Windows whether that's the phone or an
actual desktop and it it runs it in its
own contained State so we do have some
kind of history there with with apps and
the web together and we're really
excited with these new technologies such
as service workers and and the cache and
fetch and whatnot to really bring
forward some of the technology that will
help us get to apps that are more like
their native counterparts ok Ali that
wasn't what I asked Ben for Mozilla how
the hell what's at stake here well how
does the web look in five years time if
this stuff doesn't City
uh that's a good question I don't have a
crystal ball but I mean I think all the
data is suggesting right more and more
people are using mobile to start and I
think is Alex's point out a lot a lot of
people are spending the majority of
their time and native apps so creating a
more compelling capability on the web
for people to build useful sites that
people want to spend time in is really
important because there has to be a real
value there for people to use the web on
the mobile and if we don't build that
value for people and allow it to be -
and allow people to get locked into the
silos again I think we lose a lot of the
value of the open web in terms of being
able to share information freely being
able to not just consume an information
be able to share it freely and have an
open marketplace where new ideas can
come in not just in content but also
from browsers and whatnot but in case of
you know Microsoft and Google and Apple
you know they've got backups cuz you
know not betting on the web and drapes
opera is pretty much all in on the web
right it's it's all you do so what does
the end game look like here if if the if
these technologies don't take off yeah
it is a bit it's a bit scary of course
especially because we've invested so so
strongly in the web so it's because we
believe in in in it and it's you know
it's open nature its power and so on so
it is it has I've been concerned or
increasingly concerned about you know
sites or services that just use a
website to channel to download the app
and so it's really exciting to to see
less of that and more and experience
fully in the browser then you know
handing off everything all the exciting
stuff to native apps so yeah it wouldn't
look so pretty
I think if mobile was completely
dominated by by native app native app
frameworks and and and and formats
Daniel and Yankee in your case I mean
Samsung you you own the device why do
you need to bet on the web because you
you know native words for you guys
actually
well web ecosystem is really important
to Samsung as well because we have all
the devices deployed out there and we
made our own browser and also it's in
Niko's ecosystem to us added to those
Android and Tizen ecosystems so we see
our opportunities they are together with
you
so it's well the reason why I'm here to
just say that it's it's not only Google
but we are here together as a team web
yep I'm Alex everything's gonna be fine
isn't it I mean five years out this
stuff doesn't take off I flip the
question I know you're gonna he's gonna
put the question later we start with the
dystopia then we go to the okay well
then I'll wait but so okay what are the
stakes my belief is that large stable
platforms don't actually die they just
sort of passed quietly into the night
and so the web could do that that could
be a thing that happens and more and
more of the experiences that you want to
spend your time in just aren't available
there especially as you switch form
factors form factor switches tend to
exacerbate those existing tensions and
so if we want to continue to have a free
and open interoperable cross-device
cross-platform ecosystem that any new OS
could show up and play in or any new
browser could show up and show a better
way I mean Andreya showed is incredible
right the the UI innovation that comes
from not having a single gatekeeper like
Alex said is is what mate has made the
web so powerful and if the platform
can't support the experiences people
want to build that that momentum will
slow okay so I'm one with Jessamine cuz
a lot of questions are coming in from
that document you're filling in and
there were a lot of questions about
Apple you know when will Mobile Safari
do this when will Apple do that there's
no point in me asking those questions to
any of the people up here because they
don't work for Apple I guess it is a big
elephant in the room they were invited
but they're not here and they generally
don't tend to come to any events like
this but some people might thinking well
you know even if mobile safari doesn't
support service workers that's okay
because I can install Chrome
i OS and I can install Firefox in iOS
and Ike install opera on iOS would
anybody from those companies like to
explain exactly what those browsers on
iOS are clarified Ben Andreas sure I
believe the store the iOS store has a
canoe a contractual constraint that they
don't allow you know the execution of
JavaScript or downloaded content that
hasn't gone through the review executed
code that hasn't gone through the review
so you can't put up a generic browser
the Downloads JavaScript from the web
and run it and you know their
explanation for this is to prevent
malware you know they don't want people
to there are other side effects I guess
you could say so that means that chrome
I believe opera and Firefox are all
essentially wrappers around safaris
engine inside and there's different ways
of doing that which I'm not an expert on
but and we try to add value at the
product layer and and at the network
interface layer it you can do some some
things but intercepting the network
requests but it's not the same gecko
engine or blank engine running there so
okay so do you have so that you cannot
install any other browser basically
other than Safari on to iOS right
web web UI view I believe but there is a
mode where you can switch to press
server-side press to rendering but then
you know the engine lives on the server
not really on there on the client right
and even if you can it won't support
service workers either because that's
sort of a different you know it needs to
live on the client so it's kind of a yes
but but in action not really ok so so
but but none so let's say on Android
where I genuinely do have a real Opera
Mobile installed and a real Firefox for
Android installed and if it's a Samsung
device then I've got Samson browser
installed as well as Chrome alright so
maybe I am trying different browsers
let's say I visit a web site that is a
progressive web app in Opera and I add
it to my home screen or maybe I visit
something in Firefox I add it to my home
screen now each time I open one of those
things I've saved my home screen am i
opening the browser again or if my
preferred browser is let's say Chrome or
do they open in Chrome how does this
work opening up in the browser that you
used to add it to the home screen and
that's the same that if you've got like
chrome and chrome dev and chrome bita
installed and you add to the home screen
using one of those it will launch in the
one you added home screen using ok
is that because with progressive web
apps the storage is done with the cache
and each browser has its own individual
cache it's actually it could be quite
confusing if you tap on a thing and you
forgot that you know it's a that you
added it with a different browser and
then you clear out the cache and now you
find the thing that you added your home
screen maybe you even forgot was built
using web technology no longer works so
that moment when you add to home screen
we are increasingly seeing as sort of a
special moment when you mint these
things into something that feels more
like an app ok so it's a storage is
basically at the browser level because
it's individual caches isn't that the
best idea I mean we see push
notifications happen at the OS level
should storage be at the lowest level
but let me ask you a question how many
people besides like us web technologists
in this room like have like five or six
different browsers on their phone that
they use all the time
I mean most people have one browser that
they use on their phone and that it's
because it's the browser that shipped
with the phone or it's the browser that
their that the people that you know that
that they know who does something about
this told them to use or they saw an
advertisement for Chrome and they saw
they saw something so then that they're
gonna stick with that so actually I've
been thinking about this issue too
because you can have multiple
progressive web apps from the same web
app installed onto your phone
simultaneously
actually that's not it's actually a good
thing for testing I'm not so sure if
it's a real user experience problem
because again I don't think most people
use multiple browsers okay a one dive
deep in how I would interact with
progressive web apps on different
browsers let's say I go to example.com
it's a progressive web app and I install
it to my home screen now later I'm
surfing the web in a web browser and I
follow a link to example.com now I take
it that's just gonna open in the browser
but could it perhaps pop open like an
app it's almost like web intents right
where instead of at the protocol level
now it's at the URL level yeah Alex you
look like you're thinking about this
sure yes so we have a technical
limitation today because of the way
Android works other West's could do a
significantly better job here by the way
we've designed the technology between
manifests and service workers to give
you this idea of the scope for the
Service Worker which joins up a bunch of
different URLs so we could say if you
navigate to example.com slash singer
that that is actually a navigation that
should be handled by the example.com app
and we can send it there and we can open
it in new UI today we have a system
limitation on Android that prevents that
we can't know whenever progressed web
app has been uninstalled from your home
screen and that means that we can't
reliably decide to send you to a
full-screen theme because the home
screen icon is basically the permission
to run something fullscreen that prompt
that you're saying yes to it's adding a
capability to the website which is the
ability to run fullscreen and so if
you've revoked that capability but we
don't know it would be bad for us to
just open it fullscreen again but I
think there's a future in which that's
exactly what happens potentially where
if you navigate to URLs that are handled
by an app just exactly the same where
they work in Android you should be able
to do that you mention permissions there
and it seems like a lot of what
progressive web apps are doing is seeing
what works on native and
doing that so oh nice having your icon
on the home screen launching full screen
all this kind of stuff so small like
native is looking at what the web does
with permissions and copying us I was
just gonna say I mean we should we be
looking to native apps in the way they
handle permissions well no I mean and so
we've always gone with the model of ask
just in time that you knew that we need
the permission and and we're sticking
with that we're looking at other ways to
innovate there but it's very much things
like Android or switching to a model of
they're just just in time thing so you
know we're ahead on this well I've got
you know speaking of native looking at
the what the weather's doing and kind of
imitating that what's the deal with the
streaming apps native apps thing on
Android yeah instant - there we go
yeah so slap across the face to the web
right there I don't see it as quite a
slap across the face I guess and I think
Google often tries to make sure that
developers on different platforms can
have be successful and I think
historically when you look at web you've
had low friction which is due to this
incredibly powerful security model that
we've honed over the past 25 years
collectively which is quite an
accomplishment this low friction but
also locate abilities and native apps
have historically had high a
capabilities but also high friction and
so a professor Web Apps has been a
multi-year effort from multiple browser
vendors bringing working on service
workers push notifications to bring
those high capabilities to the web and I
think that the Internet of snaps is kind
of similar and then it's a multi-year
effort to bring lower friction to to
native apps as well but well I think
it's cool that progressive web app says
we've worked on this together you've
seen a bunch of different browser
vendors who are either have already
shipped a bunch of these capabilities
that you can use today with more on the
way
and so that's why I think is really cool
is you can go out as a developer and use
this stuff today with progressive web
ads so alex is how do you feel about
streaming web apps
screaming native apps you wanted to
succeed you behind it so I think it's
great that like lower friction allows
users to be exposed to a diversity of
experiences and I honestly good not what
I asked so I think I think it's good for
that native apps are also learning for
some of the things that web has done
well just like I think it's great that
the web has learned about some things
that like robust offline
push notifications and other things that
we learned kind of from native I think
that's great you're on a panel together
it was in in Brighton and it was kind of
at the time where some people were
saying should should the web stop adding
features for some amount of time should
it stop developing and the case I made
then it's like no we should look at the
things that are successful on native and
we should take those because you know
what they're coming for us they're going
to do the same and this is part of that
they're coming for our best features so
you know we should we should go for that
yeah this is the kind of dystopian
five-year outlook I was looking for Jake
we think about whether we want it to be
successful I think at the end of the day
it's about developer success right and
so like making sure that developers have
access you know if you if you believe
that your business is going to do much
better on native then I think we want
you to be successful there and if you
think your business is going to do
better on the web we want you to be
successful there as well right so I
think for us it's really about making
sure that people like developers like
yourselves have like the best tools
across both platforms yeah
first day we had great talks from you
and Alex talking about you know
comparing numbers between native and and
web and there's some great numbers in
there like the average number of apps
installed perma or added you know to a
home screen and native apps as zero well
if that's the case why are we chasing
after the home screen how will we know
we've succeeded if if people install an
average of zero web apps to their home
screen then we have treat peritoneal
thing that's important with this is with
native apps today there's is all or
nothing choice I haven't met this thing
before I don't know what it's gonna do
for me and I have to decide dwell want
to add this to my home screen well not
anymore with streaming native apps right
I think that's after sighted the
direction they're trying to get to to
something that as well but that's why I
think with press or web apps it builds
on that that progressiveness that's one
of the reasons progressivism the name is
that as a user you go to it as you use
it as you build a relationship with it
you can compressively build a better
experience with push notifications
homescreen and all the rest and that you
you spent time with this thing so you
feel more comfortable giving it more
permission to do extra things for you
right yeah it's not a cold call you're
not like saying hey would you like my
yeah it's more like you like this you
want
and if you and if you don't want to if
you if you do if it's something that
you're only gonna if it's an airline
that you're only gonna ever use once
right and or you don't think you're
gonna fly them again you're probably not
going to put them on your home screen
you're just going to use it from the
browser and that should be fine and the
whole the whole application should work
fine within the browser within a regular
tab then you find out next year actually
I'm going to be traveling a lot to Riga
I better you know put this on my home
screen okay at that point you can make
that decision right it's like it's up to
the user and I think that that's an
important aspect the data usage is a
huge thing that we hear over and over
and over again even from users in you
know wealthy Western countries the
storage constraints that devices have
ignoring even the data cost or the fact
that you need connectivity to install it
in the first place just create a huge
difference in the accessibility of even
trying something out for the first time
and so I think we do need to both go in
each direction but each has something
that it's geared towards so if you're
building an experience that is really
targeting users who are just coming
online a native app might not be the
right choice and a web app is probably
the right choice to remove some of those
barriers but there are other situations
where it might be the reverse and the
user shouldn't have to pay the price as
developers should pick what's best to
give it a we talk about in the next
video what kind of devices are the newer
things older devices there there are new
devices and that they're being built new
and they released in certain years but a
lot of their specs are ones that we
associate from sort of previous years
and some of the more developed markets
so in the US or in the UK or Europe will
they'll be devices that we think of from
several years ago they may be shipping
jelly bean on the device the device size
might be a lot smaller amount of storage
space and RAM will be a lot smaller
people rely a lot more on SD cards which
means they can also remove it and hand
it to someone else and so how people are
actually interacting with data and
storage constraints just varies pretty
drastically yes I guess I mean the
responsibility is on us to be
responsible with what storage and a
piece of something Alex in New York your
talk yesterday you were showing the amp
demo they were - Washington Post and you
click through and there
Washington Post amp thing and it was
able to install the serviceworker with
that custom element but I was looking at
the URL bar and that wasn't Washington
Post it was on the CDN from from so I
talked to Paul back to the explain it's
an iframe and using an iframe you can
install serviceworker from somewhere
else
emily's it that seems to violate the
principle of least surprise to me right
I thought the whole idea with service
workers was it can only you know same
origin and I realized I frames kind of
are just a browser window but I mean we
could abuse that's pretty badly right
and fill up a device with 20 service
workers when you've only visited one web
page with 20 iframes so service workers
require a GPS and I explained some
little reasoning behind this yesterday
it's absolutely like one of the reasons
is because service workers sit between
the browser on the network right and so
that means that any person on network
could be managing the requests that are
sent back and forth and that's actually
why we require HTTPS but is the iframe
thing a bit of a loophole they're about
the same origin and that I feel like I'm
visiting one URL and yet it's installing
service worker or service workers for
another URL so one of the things about
this is actually if you embed an iframe
today in another page and it might store
stuff in indexeddb you can do the same
you can have the same kind of behavior
and so actually one thing to clarify is
that serviceworker is using the same
storage that the website would have been
using by using other technologies index
to be the cache others and the browser
reserves the right to evict those under
certain conditions and so it's similar
actually in practice to what's been
possible today that specific demo the
amp install service worker element on on
the CDN hosted version of that document
that element is a little canning it
looks to see if the canonical URL in
that document is the target URL that
you're trying to install for so it won't
let you install them willy-nilly it has
to be the same document there so that's
built in am this all servers are cool
but I could I mean I could put on my
website a bunch of iframes that load
other web sites that have to absolutely
and this is actually part of the web's
most powerful second most powerful
feature the first one is URLs of course
but we do runtime composition like no
other platform ever has or ever can in a
safe and trustworthy way like we are Oh
because of the safety that Alex
mentioned earlier because we've actually
honed the security model where we are
relatively good compared to other
platforms about user privacy and
security that's the only reason we can
do anything
across origins are with mashups so I
mean yes but that's the status quo and
it's also an incredible power that we've
got and nobody else can get they know
that we saw earlier storage abuser thing
that that is using iframes it's not
using serviceworker it's just my frames
and index TV and everything so it's not
a new problem
that's night frames now also the there's
room for browsers to add some features
here like you can go and turn off
cookies and third-party iframes it's
very similar to that and currently in
Firefox if you turn off third-party
cookies and iframes we don't allow
service workers in those iframes either
or indexdb or any other storage nice and
so I might be wrong by think Safari has
that turned on by default it'll be
interesting if and when they implement
if they make a similar decision and
speaking of the things that browsers can
do differently we're all familiar with
the chrome algorithm I guess for adding
to homescreen right it's got to have
HTTPS but have a serviceworker you gotta
interact with a couple of times
andreas what is it pretty much the same
for opera tweaking it and install banner
you mean yeah for now is the same yes
okay the same logic simply for
consistency but we could tweak it it's
it's like that there's other you know
could be under conditions but it seemed
pretty reasonable I'm currently Firefox
doesn't do you have any automatic we're
still looking into it like the the
experiment that was run was very you
know if you visited five times in a
period of time we would show up but I
think we we need to have a designer look
at what's right there I am a little bit
cautious just because this is a
heuristic that's not SPECT almost I
think it's on purpose to allow some
innovation here and at the same time we
do see some convergence on a single
heuristic so far and the feedback I've
gotten from developers is they care a
lot about it they're trying to meet that
heuristic it so concerns me a little bit
okay I'll leave Microsoft gonna have an
automatic banner pop-up yeah
looking at a few options we're still in
our planning phase for this specifically
but we want to be as we want to not be
as restrictive as we can so for example
if you have a responsive application you
have a web manifest we think that's
enough for you to declare that your an
application mm-hmm we've also talked a
little bit about in that post that Jacob
Rossi had about the progress of Web Apps
how we're looking at maybe leveraging
Bing to crawl the web to find any
manifest that we want to ingest as apps
into the store so that experience would
actually allow you to install with the
store onto your machine and the other
thing that browsers can do different is
I guess what you should stay with the
ambient badging it's like shots fired
offers taking the lead here beat that
other browser vendors any any plans and
the idea is when it shares with the rest
of the class well first of all I wanted
to answer your previous question about
the heuristic because actually Samsung
browser have this habits have have more
like what Ali was talking about it's
just purely needing the manifest file so
you sound HTTP is not a reporter in HTTP
as a requirement okay
yeah a requirement because I really
require service workers yet but there's
a history like we shipped number three
see manifest in our 3.0 and we shipped
service workers in 4.0 so by that time
we shipped directly see manifest we just
wanted to deploy it and we found it that
some of some of the content providers in
Korea actually use it as a like hosted
web app and that's why we actually
started from there so we are still
experimenting that what would be the
extra actually better user experience
also distributing this progressive web
apps in a better way so we're still just
working on inking and Emily I think that
that that progress whether at home
screen is a nice carrot for you to
dangle
to people and say this is a reason for
moving HTTP sure you could say that I
think there's a lot of different reasons
why we want people in moved agency do
you tend to prefer carrots or sticks do
you like to threaten people that they
should move that HTTPS or entice them to
move to HTTPS I think both could be
useful in in certain situations but I
think we like to think of HTTPS is
actually one of the things that enables
the web to be so open and so low
friction and so it's actually a very
positive thing okay so on the ambient
patching if anybody has got any other
ideas just shout them out you know I
think it's awesome to see what opera is
doing here and I think it's gonna be
really interesting to see what other
browsers do because it's not 100 percent
clear what this should look like and
that's one of the awesome things about
having multiple independent
implementations that are looking trying
out different UIs and seeing what works
best in actus so we've I think another
thing I want to emphasize is that we've
heard a lot of developer feedback from a
lot of folks and that's led to us
changing some of our heuristics right
now and one thing that we've seen again
and again is there are some use cases
where the very first visit you know as a
user I want to add this to my home
screen and you want some way some
affordance to do that or know that it's
a special thing and so we've also
exploring some ways to do some ambient
badging
the for us well apps as well something
else that comes up Noah Daddy of
discovery or reengage ability a
progressive web app says di-did we need
a progressive web app store or now we
see Microsoft are actually gonna treat
them like regular apps right first-class
citizens in terms of other apps they'll
be right up there with other native
applications in the store so when you
search for the app you'll find it like
any other application but do we need a
progressive web apps daughter I mean
it'll be the same thing hey but this
isn't bing.com of a progressive web app
store kinda I think about this in terms
of distribution you make an experience
and you want to get it in front of users
and what's the way that you can do that
most effectively as a developer you're
trying to get users into your experience
and as a platform we're trying to make
sure that only experiences that are
worth keeping are things that you're
actually sort of in your face that has
to be kept so that's where the
heuristics come from but discovery can
happen in lots of different ways search
is a great
I'm so excited that Microsoft is doing
the store route we've talked a lot about
that on the crime scene I think the
ambient badging that opera is leading on
is is outstanding and I think we're
gonna see all of the above really
because we're here to try to help you
get your experiences in front of users
when they like them the most I think I
would like to see as tightening iseman
their personal opinions tightening the
heuristics from what we have now in
chrome and because we detect a service
worker now but I want us to get to a
point where we're detecting an offline
experience I mean at the very least the
fallback page like I really want us to
be able to build user trust in the
things that end up on the home page and
I think if we end up showing browser
error messages that's there's no trust
there and so understand you're in you're
prompted home screen you also don't
accept display browser for adding that
prompt yeah I think we do actually also
in the yeah we do accept display browser
as well as far as I know at least I have
to check but yes yes we do because in
the Guardian it works so opera takes the
lead again all right but but I think
it's I think this you know having this
strict curious or like a strict rules
for when it's shown both in terms of
technical capabilities and and user user
engagement
they're pretty crucial at first you
would think well let's try to make this
as easy as possible for developers and
just show it as soon as possible and so
on but then aside of this maybe not not
being ideal for the user it sort of also
I think makes everybody bit lazy like
well it will work and I don't have to do
much just include one file and it's like
this magic file you put in the in the
root and suddenly everything you know
it's you get all these banners for free
and and and you know add possibilities
to to add to get user settings to the
home screen I think it's good to start
with pretty strict requirements and
maybe even make them more strong over
time just to sort of make the web better
and make it really worth it like because
adding something to the home screen is
like a special thing right it's like
privilege you know it's a privilege
right it's like you know
certain KPI if you will like a kind of a
conversion event or whatever you
whatever you call it and and I think
that's that's important to keep them
apart from Samson all of you that make
browsers so you also make browsers for
the desktop as well as mobile
how does Add to Home screen look work
feel on desktop I mean I use slack and
it's a desktop app but I know under the
hood it's actually web technology so any
ideas on how we're gonna cross that
uncanny valley so you've heard my answer
you guys have seen probably the what's
app for desktop which is basically just
a webview inside of an application that
you could put on your desktop so as far
as you're concerned it's an app and
that's sort of the same idea with
Windows but the install process there do
you go to the store so for that the
whatsapp example is you go to the site
and the install from there but for what
I've described earlier you'd actually go
to the the Windows Store and you'd
search for the application and then you
can install it okay
well I'm in a browser I'm at a URL it's
progressive web app I'm on a desktop
browser
I want this installed we've actually
launched an app to add the shelf but a
butter bar inside of Chrome for Chrome
OS so that exists today so if you load a
progressive pop out there you should get
it with the same heuristics
we're still looking hard at what that
would mean or what the UI would mean
desktop is you know we supported the
bunch of desktop os's
and there are a lot of differences in
getting high quality system integration
actually it's a little bit easier when
you just have one activity at a time and
Android than it is to sort of like
handle all tab and all the rest of the
details of the desktop OS I'm again
extremely excited that Microsoft is
gonna lead in this yeah Chris I'm just
to check because I'm running out of time
do people in the audience have questions
eager we have we have a couple ok well
let's get Paul to throw the microphone
where's that where's Paul gong it's got
two microphones Tamika didn't throw it
over there meanwhile I just want to be
setting up well while you're getting the
microphone now yesterday we're hearing
from and a lot of a lot of disdain for
documents and a lot of excitement for
apps and we've been talking about
progressive web apps
I wondered if anybody here could tell
what an app is anyone as opposed to you
know the rest of the web it's a
marketing term nobody's thanks yeah I'm
gonna be the fool who tries it's not an
app on Android because it's made with
Java it's not an app on Android because
it's made of C++ it's not an app on
Android because you distribute it one
way or the other side load an apk it's
an app because the overall user
experience is set by the OS about what
is the first-class citizen and what
isn't and so being an app is simply
meeting the users expectations of all of
the other things that the OS has given
privilege to you and all the other
affordances that you're gonna grate it
into and that's what an app is is that
we're seeing tile and you you know
looking at native looking at web do
people generally think like it doesn't
matter it's it's just an app I will come
from a non technical perspective on this
I mean when I think about an app it's
just people just think a better user
experience on mobile I mean that's you
know what so we often describe
progressive web apps as like these act
like experiences so think about it just
more like like native access to probably
the OS access to the device being able
to actually feel like a rich fuller
experience so I think about in terms of
what the user is able to experience
unless so about kind of the distinctions
in terms of technical specs except so is
it isn't an app when it's still in the
browser I have not added my homescreen
yet is an application that you interact
with to achieve some goal is is an app
wait long enough yeah yep Google Maps on
my browser is a what it on week eating
my compute well yeah I think so
you know yeah
I know it's like we can divide the whole
web into apps and documents isn't that
something yes all right up to your mouth
please don't look it but close to the
mouth well you are browsing in the in
the App Store you see how big an app is
and we're trying install it you haven't
don't have enough space well it says
sorry you can't install it and then you
have to choose what you've removed but
when a progressive web app you install
it and you don't have enough room the
browser decides what to remove and then
the user loses might loses an app that
he likes to keep how do you think about
that so so this is part of the the
storage API is that we saw earlier this
this idea of being able to request
persistent storage and if you're granted
that permission then you can store as
much as you want and the browser will
not remove it and and the hope is we can
get to a position where if the device
does come under storage pressure then
you'll go to the menu you go to where
everything's listed with the biggest
thing at the top but it won't just be
Chrome sitting there using you know
gigabytes it will be origins like all of
your persistent origins will be there
separately so you can decide you know
what that game can go but all of my
offline videos can stay you can catch
the the request with the serviceworker
can you upgrade that to a persistent
storage just clarify we've pulled the
world's largest bait and switch at
application installation time right by
the time you get that that prompt at the
bottom in chrome today we've already
done all the work of storing everything
right you've already got all that's the
that's the best part right you're
already using the thing the question
isn't do you want to install it it's do
you want to keep the thing Europe you've
already got right we're doing the upsell
we're not like trying to get you into
the car in the first place it's like do
you want leather seats there was
somebody else had a question right
behind your thing okay just throw the
microphone back there won't heart and I
think it might have to be the last
question because hello
I have a question it's too loud now have
a question related to the future of
native apps so some years back everybody
wanted to have an app because it was the
app boomed so everybody invested money
developers invested time learning new
stuff and now we see with progressive
apps that we are moving towards a
different paradigm so in the future if
these things really like it's a thing
what will be the future of native apps
why would I want to install a native app
if I get the same from this this is
brilliant because there's pretty much
ties into the how it's going to wrap
this up which was instead of the the
pre-mortem would have the five years out
we've succeeded progressive web apps
people are using them but this is a
great addendum to that what what are
people using native apps for in this
beautiful utopia of progressive web apps
who wants to talk about this future
games that require high CPU and high GPU
will be the load the last the last
things to sort of come to last bastion
okay games what yeah well in my in 2006
I posted a vision of kind of a future of
web I am a future of mobile basically
and because I saw that a lot of people
were starting to this pre iPhone a lot
of people were starting to download
Internet connected apps for photo
sharing and all this kind of stuff and
and my view which I still hold is that
native apps are gonna play a role in
that but more and more the web and
alongside of the web sorry the web and
native apps are or should play should
both play a role and we want the web to
where wherever possible to become the
vector for whatever experience the user
gets for whatever applications the user
is using so whether that's a native app
or a web app so I think that's the
future that I see because I think that
we're never going to do away with native
apps and nor should we really seek to do
that but I think that the if we make the
web as
a platform as it can be then we're gonna
make everybody's lives easier including
users and and develop and Ally you have
a vision I think we shouldn't think that
think of this as a competition I think
it's more about providing options for
developers so whether you're a web
developer or C++ developer you have
options okay tell paint me a picture
five years out for the next billion how
does life look well I think there's
always gonna be a next billion at least
given our population growth around the
world at this point there will probably
be a new next billion hopefully the the
billion we're currently thinking about
will be online and ideally if we do
everything we've talked about here able
to access really great experiences even
under the conditions they're in but I do
think we'll see probably devices that we
think are top of the line today that
might not be considered top of the line
in three five years and while we're
seeing a really a lot of improvement in
network connectivity around the world
and I know there's a lot of ambitious
goals and making that the case globally
there will still be people who are
coming online for the first time and
don't necessarily have the context of
that we all have with the internet and
have their different contexts who knows
what form factor will realistically be
you know maybe it's gonna be like I
don't know some crazy thing you wear on
your toe who knows but there'll be
people who have never interacted with
anything so as soon as we're sort of
looking at these transitions there's
always going to be a next billion I
don't think it'll be solved and we're
gonna be needing to adapt and just I
think the biggest takeaway is just think
about people who come from a context
different than your own and figure out
what that context means for how you can
make sure that the problem you're trying
to solve can be solved for them as well
brilliant okay
I'm gonna wrap it up I want to thank all
the panelists I want to thank Paul
Kinlan actually for asking me to
moderate this because I thought I was
pretty brave of him but ladies gentleman
we're having a lunch break next but
please give it up for all these
panelists
