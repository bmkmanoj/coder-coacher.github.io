at pipe and this is a little bit
different in that like everybody else
has been super deep techie really kind
of this is a little bit more user
focused and maybe tiny bit less more
aspirational I don't know anyway so I'm
going to show you how to build a simple
secure private webcam with WebRTC on a
cheap device because well why not
so but first but first but first
congratulations
we're buddy sees five it's it's actually
like I don't say this enough I always
get up here and grumble about things
that are missing but actually really it
is fantastic we've achieved a big
success billions of endpoints high
quality good security standards are
nearly there so it's actually you know
it's something to be pleased about but
you know there are things that could be
easier and and they're working on them
but there are still things that could be
easier anyway so the feature of the
story today for those of you who want a
little nap before the the reception is
then you read this and you'll know what
I'm doing
it's just get a build use WebRTC to
build a webcam on a Raspberry Pi and the
net result would be there will be no
open ports on this webcam I say web
camera it's an IP camera it's like a
classic mistake everybody makes but I'm
just going to keep making it because
everyone does so there are no open ports
there'd be a minimal central service and
they will use no passwords and I will do
a brief code walk through that you can
sleep through so it's fine
you going to ddos it for me
it can still beat us you but not the
other way around anyway
so how did I get started on this well
I'd like a lot of my life it's kind of
accidental I there was a hackathon
challenge couple of years ago in Paris
which the parrot guys were offering
quite a nice prize was like 600 euros
worth of drones for the first person who
could make what could control one of
their Roli drones with WebRTC and we
kind of Neil and I talked about it and
and we didn't do it because we were busy
and then nobody else did it so they
reran the competition two months later
and Neil and I looked at each other as
if we've got to do this so we sat down
and spent about a week and we wrote this
thing but controlled one of their Roli
drones over WebRTC and it looked like
this and if you can see that diagram
yeah probably so it we took the meat
echo janus gateway and we embedded we
took the plugin that they had already
that handled GStreamer and we kind of
did stuff to it so that instead of
talking to file it talked to the AR SDK
which comes from from parrot and that
generates a stream of lets you control
the drone but it also generates an M
JPEG stream which we then fed into
gstreamer pushed up out into vp8 push
that back up into the Janus gateway and
then communicated that out over the web
to a WebRTC browser and it actually
worked surprisingly well I mean wasn't
desperately stable but anyway we want
and I now have a drone at home which
they that you don't know what to do with
but they go so the thing is we did this
and I published a blog about it which
you can see their link to there and I
got a bunch of people who would email me
on a fairly regular basis can I say
we're building something a bit like that
like how how about we use your code how
this work can you help us kind of stuff
and I had very interesting conversations
with them over email and voice and video
and whatever and I realized that
actually what we'd built was totally a
typical of what you would expect in a
real real device and the big thing is is
to do with the fact that I'm an old guy
who has who's old enough to have a slash
24 rooted to his house right so I have
my IP addresses to spare how public IP
addresses despair and I have a bunch of
old stuff lying around so it's no
different not difficult for me to scare
up a machine with a you know enough CPU
to do the transcoding and yes difficut
swell you know that's kind of thing I do
and spinning up a web service no big
deal and you know another Wi-Fi card no
big deal but when you look at that and
you say that's the bill of materials for
my IOT gateway it stops making any sense
like you can't expect any of those
attributes for the gateway to your
washing machine your webcam any of those
things this just not going to happen so
what you find is that the people who are
building these things who talk to me go
away and see what they can't build that
architecture that's just not something
that's practical which is fine so what
you find is the current best practice is
looks a lot like this it's you route
everything through the cloud you take
your device your everything up to the
cloud you have a cloud service that does
all this and then it routes it back down
to the views and there's a variant of
that where the cloud service is actually
just a VPN it doesn't have a huge amount
of intelligence it just does some
validation in terms of authentication
with keys or whatever but basically
that's the kind of classic and this is
actually is best practice and the thing
is that it's hugely costly for the
vendor right because I'm particularly
for something like a webcam they've got
to support five years worth of video
streaming they're going to build that
into their budget the bandwidth for five
years worth of video streaming and
they're going to run this cloud service
for five years or however long they
think the life of the device is and
you've got a budget for that so it's
kind of scary thing to do and then the
there has to hold all the off keys now
that doesn't sound like a big burden
except that particularly in Europe but
there a privacy rate regulation which
means that when they lose them they get
slapped with fines so they actually have
to have an ongoing defensive strategy to
try and protect the earth keys and
what's more all the traffic's is going
through their service and it's probably
not encrypted end-to-end so they're
actually they've got a effectively got a
webcam into your kid's bedroom or
whatever and that's kind of that's an
expensive thing to to protect yourself
you know the lawsuits that you might get
if that went wrong quite expensive and
the whole thing is completely useless if
the cloud service goes down right cloud
service goes down you're done and you
end up with a high latency because it's
going through the cloud and it may not
need to and there's this I mean this is
arguable I had a long argument with a
guy from Missouri about this but but
there's an argument particularly with
the VPN version of this architecture
that once you've broken one of these
devices you're actually on the inside of
the VPN to some extent and you've
probably got an inside track into
breaking the rest of them so it's a it's
a scary architecture and it's expensive
to maintain basically so what you find
that the IP webcams do is they go the
other way
they have a local service that runs on
the device and then they use the router
they either put the device onto it onto
the DMZ or use pew PNP or somehow expose
that through to the IP they push the IP
address up to down DNS or somewhere like
that so it's findable there can be no
certificate on that because it's like it
probably doesn't have a domain name and
or if it does it's well it could be a
certificate in possibly even with
something like let's encrypt you could
do it but generally they don't it has a
local authentication running on on the
device so your password is stored on the
device and it works quite well on the
LAN I mean if you're on the same LAN you
get the best possible performance but
and this is the big part
the ports are available to hackers so
you then have a device that has to be
reasonably secure and um there's also
the problem that the user has put the
password in and what tell or hasn't
actually quite often so you end up with
something that is got a weak password or
a default password how topical like so
this thing right you know we actually
you're on the wrong coast to have
actually felt the pain of this but you
know these webcams allegedly were
sufficiently involved in the attack the
DDoS attack that the firm was shamed
into recalling them now it's a big
moment because that's actual serious
money that's money it's not just
embarrassment it's actual money when you
recall stuff because your suppliers
expect you to pay something I mean you
know you're the people who are selling
your your your devices expect you to
repay them for the stuff that you've
you've taken back so this is starting to
become a commercial issue and not just a
embarrassment or a security issue so
what you actually want is combination
you want a combination such that you've
got this device service on the device
that's cheap for the vendor so what you
know is you run a little web RTC service
on the device but that it's reachable
it's findable it's it's there was a
rendezvous server out on the big wide
world sitting in a cloud and you want to
trust that as little as possible so you
don't want it to do the auth but you do
want it to do just the kind of finding
and joining things up and you want to
make it so that you're using you know
ice to get through the router instead of
UPnP because it's a much more one-way
thing and then you want to use DTLS SRTP
because you've then got into ending
cryptid thing and the vendor doesn't
have to care about whether they've got
your secrets or not because they haven't
and ideally you want both the passwords
and the ports to be closed so that
they're less hackable at least you'll
never get
fate but you can get better so little
history lesson here um I I was involved
I did a start-up in 16 years ago doing
web security and it's actually just been
sold I got out a while back but it's
just been sold to a big UK company and
what we learn in that space was very
similar that you know the web original
websites were all handcrafted and they
were fantastically and insecure and then
slowly because there aren't enough
security trained engineers and they
never will be right
and then slowly what happened was that
people published solution and solutions
in the form of frameworks so you do
there will be a framework that had the
right security behaviors and if you use
the framework then most of the common
errors wouldn't happen because you using
the framework that was reasonably well
designed and then you'd have things like
best practice guidance and then you'd
have testing on the other side so some
of the vendors would have a you know you
you couldn't for example use credit
cards on your site unless you passed a
PCI test that kind of stuff so you have
a level of testing and then what you
ends up with it so you no longer need a
security engineer to build this stuff
you can use javascript engineer's and
there are many more JavaScript engineers
and actually they tend to build better
more usable products in the sense that
they're much closer to the users mindset
than the security engineers often are so
it's it means that it's a win all around
so that informs where I ended up with
that pipe I mean so rude you kind of
mooch through all this and I realized
that actually there was a thing here
that needed doing
and that actually somebody might pay for
so as an example of that I'm going to
show you the code to build a
see if we can get this into a mode where
you can actually see what it's doing
presentation mode gone completely oh
there we go right so this is 60 lines of
HTML and JavaScript which is a complete
web cam so we start off with you need a
canvas you need somewhere to put this
image at the end so we create a canvas
of some size and we also create an image
because we're going to store an image
somewhere and do some manipulation on it
and then once the page is loaded we need
to find out who we are so we go and ask
the what actually will become called the
pipe SDK but at the moment is called EPS
Arama for historical reasons and once
you know who you are you then go off and
do something and what we do is do a
little bit of setting up we associate we
go and find a graphics context that's
associated with this camera element we
created down here and we store it and we
associate also with the image when the
onload comes we'll draw into that
context that graphics context so we've
done that now we'll go off and talk to
the rendezvous server just open a web
socket so they won't rendezvous so once
we've got it on every server we go and
talk to the let's say pipe API and say
hey here's your connection to the
rendezvous server and this is my
identity and then you ask it who are my
friends now the nice thing is that my
friends are stored locally
I'm not asking their only receiver who
my friends are I have stopped them
locally in the local DB so I can ask
them privately who my friends are I'm
having found this list I'm not actually
Simplification I'm going to say that I'm
going to speak to the last spoke last
one I added so end of the list because
that's you know a nice example so
we done that and this is actually the
most interesting line in the whole thing
having done that we asked the pipe
service to create me a link between here
and the other guy with the attribute of
a camera so what I'm saying is I want to
talk to the camera on my Raspberry Pi
and having done that I'm just going to
send it a command which says read so I
send it a read command and when I get a
message back I'll pause it add a little
bit of magic on the front which says
that it's a JPEG and set it on the
setting on the image and then I'll go
and ask for another one and that's it
that is the webcam so with any luck we
can show you that if I can remember how
to get out of this mode so so this is it
running that page and with any luck we
are going yes we're going to go through
and there we go we have a webcam so this
is a very dark webcam somewhere and not
my on the right network yeah let's do
that again
let's move this webcam so it's not
actually facing the lights
oh I'm the wrong way up there we go
anyway so we now have Raspberry Pi doing
it should be doing about four or five
frames a second but it seems to be they
seem to be on different networks so
we're getting a bit of round tripping
there but anyway so we have have that on
there on the webcam so uh what next oh
yes yes yes little clean up so oh and I
can show you what it looks like on the
device as well I think there we go so
that's the so there's that there's the
Raspberry Pi in focus and I've just just
resetting it there okay cool so back to
me which is that one there we go so so
so so so so you can see that that's he
there wasn't very much of that right it
wasn't a hugely complicated piece of
code that something you could get a
JavaScript engineer to build and build a
much better user interface around you
much better user experience but actually
entirely doable so what was it the other
end as I say raspberry pi PI cam the
pipe software which is our own
lightweight data channel stack data
channel only stack which is anything
less than a quarter of the size of the
of the build that would be on arm and
some scripts to generate the M JPEGs
which are just basically either AV kampf
if using a classic web camera or a spry
vid if you're using the Raspberry Pi of
a webcam which I am here and now a
little site think the the pi is capable
of doing h.264 but in the run-up to this
I could not get the SDP right like I got
a whole of the rest of the stack right
no problem I've got all that fine I
could not get the right STP incantation
last week so it's not working yet
there's no reason why it shouldn't on
the PI some devices won't have h.264
encoders on them this one actually does
so in theory it should do h.264 but for
the moment it doesn't so I thought this
was a secure thing but you wasn't any
security in that show at that bit at all
I didn't mention it right um and there's
a reason for that I mean our users
actually they generate two x.509 RSA 204
8-bit sha-256 self-signed certificates
they exchange them securely and they
verify them by proximity and they create
a persistent distributed web of trust
PKI which is kind of like the
resurrected duckling paper which was
written by Ross Anderson and that sounds
like a really tedious thing to do but
actually it turns out you can do all of
that just by scanning a single QR code
when you take the box the device out of
the box so I'll show you that I should
add though at this point that this
actually works much better on a mobile
device than it does on than it does on
here that's not good my camera's not
come on what was that bug
I'm not gonna be show you this my
camera's not come on let me do that just
one more time no I have a locked camera
yeah well so I'll do that at the end I
will reboot it and do it at the end but
I'm not rebooting in the middle of a
presentation that's even I'm not that
brave right so anyway it turns out you
can just do it by scanning this QR code
and it immediately connects you I will
do that in a minute right so um actually
yes right I need to do this on a mobile
I have a we have we like a little peril
don't we little mild peril right so you
see there's the QR code and here is my
you read that yeah there's my phone so
we do claim a new device we show them to
each other like that and we're connected
that was doing the full PKI
exchange the whole thing these two now
exchange certificates they are no
irretrievably about each other whew
right so what that's done is it created
a simple secure private IOT pairing and
transport which isn't just for webcams
you can do other things for there right
the end the connections are eetu
encrypted the authors distributed so
each of these devices easy its own off
server right so you're not trusting
something in the center and it's only
this connects with its owners it's using
standard web RTC there's no magic here
right that's a standard that was in
chrome there's a minimal untrusted code
server at the cloud server you don't
have to trust it it doesn't hold your
auth keys it doesn't have a picture of
your child's bedroom the traffic is
direct where possible because it's where
do you see and this is stuff for WebRTC
does there are no passwords that that
all of the earth is done with that key
exchange there's no passwords to set
it's a strong earth based around x.509
certificate exchange I'd say there are
no open port it's ice
there are only open ports that on when
it's necessary and they're created
through ice and the code for this that
webcam demo is is on github and pipe
slash webcam
let me put myself back to v2 that one
here we go
yeah so that's where the the code is so
the API the magic of the API is really
only that it creates a pipe from from
one end to the other with a really
simple API and the semantics of the
pipes depends on the label that you give
it so this particular one was just like
a camera with empik with MJPEG but it
could be our logger digital inputs and
outputs from an IOT device or it could
be a local socket so you could run some
service on the device like a you know
nodejs agent or a link to a bluetooth LE
or something and then it can proxy that
up to your web browser you can access
local data you can write stuff to the
screen and you can add custom extensions
and it works on the Beagle bone it works
on the PI works on our ticket works on
Edison the I hope will work on this
haven't read it on the chip yet but I
now have one so I can try it
I'm pasting closed beta anyone wants to
play with it would be really happy to
particularly if you got a Raspberry Pi
you can work through the instructions
and try it out see what you think now I
have one more thing I need to do at this
instant two things actually the first
one is to turn that off and the other
one used to warn my friend that he's
about to get a call ok so that's all
kind of cute and and it's a little bit
small right so this thing is a sculpture
by a friend of mine debbie Davis it's a
15 foot star with 700 LEDs in it which
are all individually controllable by a
BeagleBone we put the Piper what you see
software in it mostly because you can
but actually practically it was kind of
interesting because it gets to do remote
monitoring right you know I can monitor
that thing from my from my home I don't
have to try got out to Reno to find out
how it's getting on and in fact we had
it in we had it in Burning Man as well I
can remotely control it which hopefully
touch something and we'll do in a minute
and I could do red oak updates so when
they built us they built a second one of
these they put the stars in slightly
different places and they were slightly
different numbers off them so the
software it was wrong so I just remotely
updated it from five and a half thousand
miles away which is kind of fun so let
me show you the ability to do
so let's see which one so this guy that
one there that was the one that went out
to Burning Man and it's been sitting in
my garden actually most of the summer
collecting data for my solar panels so
I'm going to connect to it it's now it's
currently sitting at home on my desk
which is five plus thousand miles away
and I'm querying doing-doing about 300
database queries against a local
register base that's storing that stores
the historical data for an NCI I'm
asking for the whole of the month of
June July July so in a second it will
have finished that and I'll draw a graph
and the point being that you don't have
to know what it is you're going to ask
the IOT device you get the API right you
can just ask it kind of random questions
in this case 300 random questions about
what the voltage was on a given day as
you can see like there were days where
it basically wasn't sunny in England
which is no surprise to anyone so so
that but that actually turns out to be
really useful right you can I can
monitor that thing from wherever I am in
the world and it's secure it's only
going to talk to me alright it's not I
don't have to log in and use it it just
knows so now we're going to try and do
something dangerous
mmm let us see whether the man in Reno
is in the cold I need to be on Google's
Wi-Fi for this to work
Oh
this is nerve-racking
right well whilst he doesn't answer
we'll talk to the device that's sitting
on my wall so I have the prototype
sitting at home so well let's look at
that it's nothing like as pretty as the
real thing but it lets me test the
software so there we go so this is my
this is the device sitting it that's
sitting on my wall at home twinkling
quietly it has about 1/10 as many stars
as the real device and what we're going
to do is I'm going to talk to it from
here and I'm going to ask it to change
so I can send it a command from here to
do its little dance
oh no that's another one I didn't mean
that
I meant
I won't
so if we click on that
I think we're getting okay so we've made
a single star light up and it'll go back
into its stance mode and again that's
from 6,000 miles away so let's see if
that's Android calling yes except
so where is the video why have I not got
video no that isn't doing what I wanted
how frustrating one more time
so why am there we go hey we don't have
audio you're just gonna have to turn it
if you can turn this round and there we
go up a bit yes excellent right now so
if we move him over here and I redo this
so let's connect to the correct one
which is that one so this thing is 15
foot high and this goes 700 LEDs and
it's sitting in Reno what's that a
couple hundred miles away and I am
controlling it from here with any luck
so one of them it's just stop twinkling
and one of those is lip pink and I
cannot see which one it is
let's try that again anyone see the pink
star no I can't either let's do that one
more time because we're supposed to be
able to make it you can see that it's
definitely flashing yeah there we go
yeah there it is got it right so I'm
controlling this thing from 400 miles
away yeah me so one more thing one more
thing if we have a volunteer who would
like to make a wish and has an Android
phone they would like to come up and
browse to that URL I can give them
access to it so we got lend borrow
semantics so we need a I need a foolish
volunteer who will will come and come
and borrow the device Android phone
okay so if you browse to that I did
actually think about bringing a physical
web beacon so you could just like waft
near it but that's that's hard okay
sorry we have a we have a winner here so
with any luck I just need to hold it
steady enough let me actually let me can
I show let people see what's going on
because it's like it's otherwise it's a
bit bit confusing so we'll do this and
we'll do that one right so he's got a QR
code which I am scanning on my phone or
trying to oh okay you that's interesting
that's an interesting bug huh that's
actually not gonna work
because the edges are black there's not
enough bevel on that that's funny
I haven't okay it won't shrink no no
it's a bug it's my back it's my back
it's my back whoa that's interesting
that's a good bug right so that didn't
work but that's annoying it's not the
size of the screen the problem is that
the black edges it's not reading the QR
because it's not seeing the edge of that
black edge all right double do that'll
do that would have done okay
it's not reducing greedy no mine anyway
so in theory the land borough semantics
work but if I built the right web page
but actually no nevermind okay good I'm
gonna hand it hang off an Andrew because
he's sitting in the cold there but um
and thank him right so there we go
so thank you for putting up with all
that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
