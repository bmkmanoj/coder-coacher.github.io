back to our series on how to create an
element in polymer 2 in this video we're
going to get to know our projects layout
when we left off last time we had a live
environment of a demo running let's open
up the project in our editor and take a
look so you can see here we have the
pollen cast checklist slash demo and
this just simply has demo code let's
look at the actual project itself and
look at the code in this demo so gonna
navigate to my desktop open up polycast
checklist and here we are setup and in
this demo you can see slash demo the
demo directory and in there you'll see
index dot HTML here you'll see what we
have over here you have hello polycast
checklist and you simply just have
polycast checklist a new element that
has been created by our project and so
here you'll see a demo snippet and a
template and things are inside so now
let's take a look at the polycast
checklist file so this is where we
actually define our element in here
you'll see a bunch of different things
like HTML import where we import polymer
a module a template where we actually
display things so here you can see hello
prop 1 and over here you see hello
quality cache checklist this prop 1
right here with the double brackets
around it is what we call a one-way
data-binding a one-way data-binding
all it does is inserts a property into
the template and you can see here in the
properties section we have a prop 1 and
the default value here is polycast
checklist key changes to whatever we
want so should just do like polycasters
save that go back over to our project
refresh
hello polycasters how's it going and
then you'll also see the definition of
this element it is a class and it
extends polymer element and below that
you'll see window custom elements define
then you have a bunch of fancy stuff
there alright let's go through what the
fancy stuff means polycast checklist is
just calls this getter and returns
polycast checklist so this is just the
same thing as saying define the element
called polycast checklist and then you
associate it with a class which is this
definition right here for now let's go
back and leave it alone all right
now let's look let's look at what else
is in our in our directory we have this
Bardot JSON and in here we have a
dependency on polymer and you can see in
the Bower components which is where the
dependencies actually install you'll see
the polymer directory right here and
you'll see a bunch of different files on
there so in the polycast checklist you
see there's an HTML important for a
polymer which is the polymer directory
right here and then you can see right
here in the poly cast checklist an HTML
file we import the polymer element file
from the polymer directory and in the
polymer directory we have a polymer
element file which defines polymer
element and is then used right here so
those are the basics of how a polymer
element is laid out in the next video
we'll mock up our element insert and
proving it using polymer see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
