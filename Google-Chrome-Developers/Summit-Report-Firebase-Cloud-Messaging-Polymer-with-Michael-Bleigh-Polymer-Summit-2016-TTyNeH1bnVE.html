back to the polymer summit I am joined
here on the couch by Michael Bly a
software engineer on the firebase team
Michael you just gave a talk on polymer
and firebase can you maybe tell the
folks who haven't seen that talk yet
what are some of the highlights that you
covered yeah sure so basically I wanted
to talk about how web components with
polymer is a great way to sort of build
all some front-end applications by
composing these simple elements together
and firebase is sort of the same thing
for your back-end so you take these sort
of simple things like a real-time
database and an authentication system
and you put them together into a nap and
I was also really excited to be able to
announce that firebase cloud messaging
for push messages is now available on
the web and was just released today
right on awesome okay so yeah so you
mentioned the cloud messaging stuff can
you maybe go a little bit deeper on that
and talk about you know some other
things that that'll help folks do yeah
so with with firebase Cloud messaging
essentially you can send messages to
users of your web app whether or not the
app is open so the same way that native
apps get push notifications you can do
that on the web and it's been possible
for a long time but firebase cloud
messaging really makes it easy cool
awesome ok now for for folks watching
you know if you could have them go to
one thing what would that be I'd say
check out polymer fire it's the official
custom elements for firebase that's a
github com / firebase / polymer fire and
also check out firebase Cloud messaging
thank you so much for being with me
thank you all for for watching we're
going to continue shooting live from the
polymer summit so so please stay with us
and also you can always pick us on
twitter at hashtag polymer summit again
thank you Michael I'm Rob stay with us
see ya
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
