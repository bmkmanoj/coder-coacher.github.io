much for coming today my name is Alex
sica and I'm a product manager working
on web payments hi I'm Russell muckin
I'm an engineer on the chrome famous
team today we're talking about how you
can provide your users on the mobile web
with an amazing checkout experience I
want to start with talking about mobile
commerce a little bit in general it
probably comes as no surprise to anyone
here that a majority of traffic is
coming on mobile devices what is
surprising is that if you look at all
mobile purchases sixty-six percent of
these are happening on the mobile web so
it's imperative for you to create an
amazing mobile experience if you're
going to engage with your customers in
recent years we've seen a ton of
improvements to mobile websites better
more responsive design better mobile
optimization but these improvements
haven't really translated into what's
important which is increased commerce
conversion so how far does mobile have
to go to equal the kind of conversion we
see on other platforms turns out that
the answer is actually pretty far in
fact consistently across the web we see
mobile converting at about sixty six
percent lower rate than desktop this
means that every visitor to a desktop
site spends about three dollars and
every visitor that same site on mobile
only spends about one why is this before
I reveal our thought I want to ask
everyone a question so I want to see a
show of hands how many of you have ever
abandoned a purchase because of the
checkout form pretty common problem so
this question actually kind of gives
away our thesis a little bit but we
think the fundamental reason why
Mobile's lagging so far behind other
platforms is this checkout form there's
just no getting around the fact that on
a small mobile screen it's an incredibly
painful process to have to tap through a
checkout form yet the checkout form
today is still the predominant way that
we engage with our users and collect
payment on the mobile web so let's talk
a little bit about check out forms
they've gotten a lot slicker since we
all ordered our first packages online 20
years ago but what hasn't changed is I
still have to manually type in the same
information my address my shipping
address and my credit card information
so it's incredibly manual it's also
incredibly tedious to have to do this on
every subsequent website you have to
type in the same information on every
website third check out on mobile is
slow especially in areas of low
connectivity and as we've seen in some
of the sessions talking about the web
this week you know if it takes more than
a few seconds to load a page you know
there's a very high opportunity for your
users to bounce yet it's still the norm
to put them through a multi-step
multi-section checkout process that
requires lots of taps to complete so
before we talk about how we're trying to
tackle these problems and the products
were building to solve check out on the
web I'd like ruslan to talk a little bit
about what our overall design philosophy
is thank you Alex today we're going to
show you several demos of how we're
going to improve the mobile checkout
experience throw out our work we
concentrate on two core principles first
from the standpoint of the user we would
the checkout experience to be as
seamless and painless as possible if you
type the new credit card in the web
browser once you shouldn't have to type
it in again you shouldn't have to type
in your information into every website
on the Internet second from the
standpoint of the web developer you
should be able to get all the
information that you need to complete
this transaction as quickly and
frictionless Lee as possible that means
whatever solution we come up with should
be straightforward and should be able to
integrate into existing products in
solutions so you see speed is very
important to us and we will address this
during our demos so keeping in mind
these two design philosophies and also
keeping in mind that check out forms are
still today the predominant way of
collecting payment from a user we
started thinking how can we make this
experience more pleasant for our users
on the web the answer is with autofill
and auto fills a pretty basic function
that's been in chrome for quite some
time and the way it works is by when you
tap on a form you can automatically fill
any information that you've saved to the
browser into that form the best part
about autofill is that it just works the
web developer the site doesn't have to
change any part of their code they can
automatically fill the form with any
user information that the user has
securely stored within the Chrome
browser so going back to our checkout
form here we can see that the first real
issue is that it's manual and auto fill
solves this by being able to save
automatically your information and fill
it in without you having to enter a
keystroke next it takes this tedious
process of having to fill out a checkout
form on every new website and it makes
it simple so this is a real win for
users it really enhances the user
experience as I'm going on a mobile
website and filling out my information
but what does this actually mean for you
what does this actually mean for sites
what does this mean for developers we
recently conducted a study with the
chrome research team and we found that
autofill actually drove a twenty-five
percent increase in conversion rates and
this is extremely powerful because you
don't have to modify your site at all if
a user comes to your site and they have
autofill enabled they are twenty-five
percent more likely to complete the
checkout form so how does autofill
actually work under the hood the process
begins when the user saves the
information into the browser this can be
done either manually in settings or
automatically when the user fills in the
form next chrome will securely
synchronize this information across all
of the devices where the user is logged
in finally chrome will automatically
detect the forms on the web page and
fill them in for the user with minimal
user interaction the primary component
that makes this work is the autofill
server
because form detection works through a
combination of client-side heuristics
and server-side modeling this is one of
the areas where we have been making
great improvements in fact today we have
over ninety-five percent accuracy for
firm detection for the top 100 ecommerce
websites the best thing about autofill
is that it requires no integration from
the website developers the chrome does
all the work for you indri are cases
where autofill does not work we do
support autocomplete types to guarantee
autofill and get that sweet sweet
twenty-five percent increase in
conversion rates okay so let's sweep
over and see a demo of auto fill in
action
so before we see the actual demo i want
to say we've actually collaborated with
the polymer team to create a really
awesome site experience that we're going
to be showcasing here in addition to
autofill so I'm going to tap in here to
my shop and again this is the polymer
part of the polymer toolkit it's the
e-commerce shop experience and since
it's so much colder this morning I'm
going to shop for a little men's
outerwear this neon what do you think
russula about this nylon jacket it will
look good on you so I'm going to add it
to my cart so I want to point out that
up until this point it's been a really
amazing experience got to browse an
amazing catalog of Google products but I
now encounter the part of the e-commerce
experience that I dread I'm going to
have to fill out my entire credit card
information my shipping address and my
billing address there's got to be a
better way so you can see this is pretty
this is a pretty nice design forum but
it still it doesn't get around the fact
that I'm going to have to manually type
this in but as you see with autofill i'm
able to tap into the form and
automatically fill in my information it
immediately is filled into the form and
if I happen to have a separate billing
address I could also fill that in
and then finally just like the addresses
are securely stored my credit card
information is also securely stored with
the browser so I'm going to fill in my
MasterCard here now the one piece that
autofill doesn't save is the cvv of your
credit card so for security purposes
you're still going to need to enter this
into the site so you see I place my
order it was done it was simple
let's flip back to the slides
great autofill is amazing this is a
product that I use myself almost on a
daily basis and it really simplifies the
process of going through a web form
today I also want to point out that
we're continuously launching
improvements to autofill to make it
faster and more available to more users
on Chrome but autofill again is tied to
existing form infrastructure we use web
forms as essentially the tool by which
we're passing the users payment and
shipping information back to the website
so because of this there are some key
limitations first we can't solve the
latency problem we can't make the page
load faster with autofill and secondly
as you saw in the demo it still takes
multiple sections multiple tabs to get
through a checkout process and actually
submit my order so going back to our to
design principles we wanted to start
thinking beyond autofill and it led us
to the idea that maybe the the best way
to solve checkouts was not simply to
improve on the checkout form but to
actually completely eliminate the
checkout form so I want to go through a
quick exercise here and I want everyone
to close your eyes and imagine a world
without check out forms this isn't a
rhetorical exercise I actually want
everyone to close your eyes and just
imagine a world without check out forums
so what does this mean for users this
means that when I find something I want
to buy I can just tap and buy it I don't
have to go through a complicated process
of re-entering all the same information
what does this mean for sites for
developers for merchants it means that
you can focus on creating an amazing and
engaging experience for your users and
not have to worry about creating a
checkout process not have to worry about
optimizing that checkout process we're
really excited to bring you the payment
request API which is the way that we're
going to make this formless world a
reality
payment request is a JavaScript API that
allows the browser to handle the heavy
lifting of payment collection the result
is a simple one tap experience for the
user and an easy way for a site to
receive and request payment our goal
with payment request is to create an
open API so no matter what browser what
device what platform or what payment
method you choose you'll never have to
enter another checkout form the pin
request API is currently under
development in the w3c web payments
working group our goal is to create a
universal cross-browser standard for any
website to accept any form of pain it
there are three key points to keep in
mind when thinking about pain requests
first this is not chrome only Google
only custom proprietary be I know this
is a cross-browser standards-based
effort where we are collaborating with
other browser vendors and members of the
developer community in order to define
something that any browser should be
able to implement second we're targeting
mobile platform first because this is
where we can solve the biggest problem
but the pin with request API is designed
to be extensible and will be available
on other platforms as well third our
goal is to create an open ecosystem any
website should be able to accept any
form of payment that they desire without
the need for complicated custom
integration points so we're excited to
announce that chrome has an
implementation of interquest today for
you the developers to try we expect
other browsers to be implementing soon
shout out to Microsoft in particular
they have been a great partner in the
w3c what pain is working group so let's
go back for a second to our checkout
form so just like with autofill we take
this manual and tedious process and we
make it simple in fact in our
implementation that we have that we're
going to show you today in chrome we
actually are using the same data that
the users already saved to the browser
through autofill and we're exposing that
data to the payment request API but what
makes this even faster is that rather
than relying on the checkout form we
pass it directly via this open API we're
also able to reduce latency because
chrome is rendering the payment
collection you I natively so you don't
have to render a complicated checkout
form that takes several seconds to load
so payment request is extremely fast
what this all amounts to is taking a
multi-step multi-section long checkout
process and makes it truly one tap let's
take a look at how payment request works
the process begins when the website
passes to the browser information
necessary to negotiate this payment this
information includes for example how
much is being charged what is in the
shopping cart so the browser can
represent it most importantly this
information includes what are the
accepted payment methods on this website
the browser then determines the
intersection between the websites
accepted payment methods and what the
user has installed on their device the
browser presents this UI to the user
where the user can select their
preferred method of payment and
authorize this transaction explicitly a
payment method can be anything as simple
as a credit card stored in autofill or a
third party application that you and I
can write that would provide the payment
to the website once the user authorizes
the transaction chrome invokes this
payment app gets the response back and
that is a directly back to the website
from the standpoint of the website the
only thing that happened is a single
JavaScript call that retrieved all the
information
that the website needs to process the
transaction let's actually take a look
at the code of how you would internet
this the w3c members are working really
hard to make this API as simple as
possible while still passing in all the
information required to negotiate the
transaction the code that you see is how
it is implemented today in chrome
developer version the w3c is
continuously evolving this API based on
the feedback from merchants and website
developers so please participate in the
process and give us your feedback we'd
appreciate it there are several
parameters that you need to specify for
payment requests the first two are
required the first one in particular is
the list of payment methods that this
website accepts for the legacy case of
credit cards which is what we're showing
showcasing here you would pass in the
credit card types the second parameter
and are the shopping cart contacts and
possibilities shipping options finally
we're shown here the third parameter
which is optional which specifies that
this website is indeed selling physical
goods and would like to request the
shipping information from the user
remember our goal is to pass in to the
website all the information that the
website needs to process the transaction
and one of the most common if pieces of
information that the website needs is
shipping address for the user so the
website would use this request shipment
true parameter to specify that they do
in fact need the shipping information
and then they have the option of updates
in the total based on the shipment speed
or the shipping address that the user
has selected so yeah let's actually see
how it work so let's flip back to the
phone and I'll leave the code up so we
can walk through what's happening as we
go so I'm back on my polymer shop but
we've implemented this you know
relatively minimal 15 lines of code to
include a call to payment request when
the user clicks the checkout button
so I'm going to come back into men's
outerwear and this time I'm going to buy
this nice youtube hoodie here i'm going
to add it to my cart i'm going to view
the cart and then again we get to my
least favorite part of the e-commerce
experience i'm about to check out i'm
about to land on a long complicated form
but now that we've implemented payment
request chrome is actually going to
natively expose a UI or i can select all
of my billing and shipping information
so there it goes see how fast that was
zero latency no loading new pages chrome
natively services this UI where i can
select my shipping and my payment
information and again this is the same
shipping and payment information that we
previously used in the autofill demo but
now it's available within this nice
chrome you I so talk about a little bit
about what's going on with the top row
here ruslan sure in the top row the user
sees the identification information for
this website this information is the
title of the website some iconography
from the website to make sure the
website can be easily recognizable and
for security purposes the origin of the
website where the user can make sure
they're indeed passing their money to
into the right hands the total
information comes from the website this
is the shop and guard the ship in and
the payment is something that's most
frequently and recently used by alex on
his phone so this is smartly selected
but if Alex wanted to change his
shipping address for example he could
tap in and change the selection if you
wanted to so let's go ahead okay so the
only step when I click pay because our
goal is to return everything the
merchant needs to process the
transaction the merchant presumably
needs the three digit cvv so just like
with autofill i'm going to have to enter
it here in this minimal form
and I click continue and it
automatically returned it to the website
the the other thing to note about this
interaction is that the response that
you get back from the web browser when
you invoke payment request is exactly
the same as the response you'd get back
when your web form is submitted so we're
really trying to simplify this so that
you know we're really trying to take the
process of implementing a web form and
really encapsulated in this nice native
chrome you I so let's look back to the
slides
so you've seen how easy it is to request
credit cards and again all the credit
cards that are available in auto fill
are also available via the payment
request API but one of the most
important features of the payment
request API is the ability to support
other forms of payment and other more
secure forms of payment like Android pay
will now be available in the browser via
the payment request API what makes the
Android pay experience even more
seamless than traditional credit cards
is that rather than passing the actual
credit card number we pass a secure
tokenized representation of the user's
credit card number and we use device
authentication to further protect your
transaction this means better security
for the user and for the site your users
get a much more secure easy checkout
experience so when we launched the
Android pay last year we had a really
ambitious goal to make it everywhere but
obviously we can't call android pay and
everywhere platform if it's not
supported on the mobile web so as you've
heard earlier via the payment request
API we're now bringing Android pay
support to Chrome and so you're probably
thinking this is going to be a really
complicated integration but actually
it's just a few lines of code that you
add to the payment request to be able to
request and bring all the security and
simplicity of Android pay to your mobile
website reason why it's so simple to add
a drop a integration is because payment
request is designed specifically to be
extensible to work with any payment
application out there so the first thing
they need to modify in your existing
payment request call is to specify the
identifier for the payment application
in this case it is android com / pay
which identifies Android pay next
payment applications might require some
extra information so in this case the
demo that we're making is integrated
with stripe and in order to work with
stripe Android pay requires us to tell
android pay that it is in fact the
stripe gateway that we're using but you
might be using a different one on your
own website and for stripe there are two
pieces of required information the
public
key and the version of the stripe API
that you are using so while we're
kissing Android pay here it is important
to remember that the changes to your
payment request constructor to support
new payment applications is going to be
essentially the same you're going to add
another payment identifier and if the
app requires some extra information you
added in the last optional parameter
great so let's leave this code up and
we're actually going to go back to our
polymer demo site one last time and show
you with this easy integration how we
can now accept Android pay on the web so
I'm going to go a little slower so you
can actually see it because the cast is
I think a little slow so i'm going to
come in here to t-shirts no more author
work for you I don't need any more
outerwear and it wouldn't make sense for
the one of the first android pay
transactions on the web to buy anything
other than this android pay t-shirt so
this is what i'm going to get today so
i'm going to add it to my shopping cart
i'm going to click checkout and again
you see this chrome you I renders just
as quickly as before in the case where
we were requesting credit cards but now
it's actually with Android pay so this
is really cool that with just those few
lines of code you're able to now bring
the security of Android pay into the
browser so what's going to happen when i
press the pay button is chrome is
actually going to be making a request to
the android pay AP is on behalf of the
website so for security reasons android
pay is going to surface just a very
simplistic you I where the user is going
to be able to authenticate with their
device unlock so in this case I'm going
to show my fingerprint so now chrome is
communicating with Android pay and
Android pay is going to surface this
nice UI where it gives me the option to
pay with my MasterCard I'm going to
authenticate with Android pay the
response is going to be returned back
instantaneously to chrome and Chrome is
going to then pass it back to the
website now they have everything they
need to process the transaction
so one of the really additional cool
features about Android pay is that it
has this notion of rich receipts so as
you see here this is a live transaction
that's taking place you know with the
stripe account that Ruslan is set up so
you can actually see that that shop with
my MasterCard was actually charged 899
so this is a real live transaction
that's taking place today with Android
pay and if you were to click into the
Android pay experience you'd be able to
see all of the rich receipts for all the
transactions you've made in store via
your NFC terminal or in Android pay apps
it's all together anytime you use
Android pay in store in Android
applications or on the web all the
receipts show up in the nice Android pay
interface we are excited to announce
that payment request is available for
developers in chrome today it's going to
be available in Devon better versions
for now until we release in stable
version of Chrome in late 2016 and in
2017 we expect to be able to integrate
with third-party payment applications
and to come to other platforms aside
from Android so today if you were to go
and do a payment request in the dev or
beta channel of chrome you'll be able to
access all of the credit cards that are
currently stored with autofill and it's
really an amazing experience we're also
really excited to announce that with our
stable launch this fall we're also going
to be bringing the Android pay support
you just saw into the web browser so
we're really excited to continue
bringing these first two implementations
into payment request but there's so much
more and next year we're going to
continue to work to grow the ecosystem
of payment applications that are
available through payment request so our
goal in developing this API we really
want to get it into your hands as
quickly as possible that's the only way
we're going to be able to provide an
amazing experience for our users is
getting you the ability to test this API
now we're really excited to announce
that we're already working with these
amazing partners to make sure that
payment requests and our chrome
implementation of payment request works
across a variety of mobile web you
cases I actually want to showcase one of
these use cases today and show you what
the payment request experience would
look like on Shopify mobile website
we're really excited to be testing with
Shopify in fact they've already started
sharing their insights with us and they
have some deep insights about mobile
purchases because they work with
thousands of online retailers and so
they've shared their feedback with us
and they've shared their feedback with
the w3c to really help improve payment
requests and make it better so we really
see this as an evolving standard this is
not a fixed product that we're
implementing now we really would
encourage you to provide us feedback so
we can develop this together please
visit the Google spaces app to stay
connected we will post the video of the
stock there we will also post the link
to become a better tester in there as
well we're going to remind you that this
is an open standard would love your
feedback on the HTML spec everything is
available on the w3c github page please
go ahead read through the spec browse
through the issues were discussing today
open another issue if you have a
suggestion or if you have a concrete
suggestion go ahead and write a pull
request on github everything is public
and we take your opinion very seriously
and ruslan actually made the generous
offer of anyone who implements payment
request he says we'll come buy something
from your store that's right go build
something that will buy it so thanks
again I'm Alex sica I'm response to
