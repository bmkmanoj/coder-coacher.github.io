the front end at lassen by day but by
night I'm a hopeless romantic for web
components and it's it's almost shameful
so you may or may not have heard of a
library that I created called sketchy is
it's it's like polymer but it approaches
things from a different angle
I'm not here to talk about that but I do
make mention of it in the slide so it's
worth mentioning I'm here to talk to you
about some techniques that we're using
to surface ID render web components and
why we need to do so but before we go
ahead first into that I really want to
briefly cover what pushed me to actually
try and do this so I tend to straddle
the line between the webbing the plan of
community and other communities and it
puts me in a somewhat unique position to
empathize with other viewpoints from the
other communities as long as I'm able to
keep my bias and check of course and of
those criticisms there's really three
main ones that keep on popping up the
first one is you can't represent complex
data structures with attributes it's
always been an issue with HTML but it's
not so it's not really specific to web
components and polymer and skate kind of
help you get around this because they
set properties and they manage that
property to attribute reflection for you
so it's not really a must-have the
second one is that there's no
opinionated templating model and polymer
does get kind of do this for you too and
there's also libraries like lit HTML and
pre-act
do we even do your custom elements so
it's not really a must-have and lastly
the one that I hear the most really
though is that you can't server-side
render shadow DOM and it's proven to be
something that we do need in order to
solve a couple of problems but why can't
we do this out of the box so rendering
shadow Dom on the server is not possible
because there's no way to attach a
shadow root and represent its content
without executing imperative JavaScript
on the client
and while you can render your element
without a shadow root declaratively
there was some light bone you must then
imperative ly create the shadow root and
then attach sorry attach the shadow root
and then put some constant inside of it
there's no way to express this within
the bounds of HTML so the two main
reasons compelling us to do server-side
rendering first one is SEO and BOTS and
the other one is to help with user
experience and this can be kind of
contentious and I'll explain why shortly
server-side rendering isn't a solution
that's looking for a problem
there's prior art here many JavaScript
communities such as ember react few felt
they're all turning to server-side
rendering to help solve these problems
search engines and other BOTS need to be
able to read scrape and index content
and then do something with it these BOTS
may or may not execute JavaScript and on
the ones that do they're going to do so
to different extents if we wanted to do
something like render an app shell with
a single custom element not all search
engines and BOTS are going to be able to
be the content of that if they execute
JavaScript they might but if they don't
execute JavaScript they're definitely
not going to see it some have suggested
not putting content in the shadow of it
that you want crawled and it works but I
don't think it's really fair this
precludes using custom elements as
templating hooks for example the about
page here it might be useful to embed or
share this and then another part of the
app at the side Twitter is a great
example of an app that would probably
use an app shell and possibly use a
router to then render a custom element
for the page and it needs probability
Googlebot is probably the biggest and
most notorious search engine out there
and it was recently announced that it's
based on chrome 41 Bing comes in second
with a fairly sizable market share but I
couldn't find any documentation about
what it supports but it turns out they
both execute JavaScript but they don't
execute modern es2015 this means that
you have to use the polyfills and then
you have to use es5 to write your custom
elements or you have to use a transpiler
for it and during my testing with being
bought I didn't get consistent results
because depending on which webmaster
tool I was using they all behaved a
little bit differently and what about
other BOTS things like social shares
simple crawlers and language specific
libraries and my limited testing on
social media sharing the server-side
render pages behaved better so the moral
of this story that there's a fast world
of bots designed to massage content some
of them don't execute JavaScript but of
the ones that do your mileage is
definitely in a very testing SEO has
proven to be a tedious and
time-consuming and the results also send
up sound a little hand wavy and it
decreases my confidence that what I've
tested is actually going to work and
something I'm not really sure of is if
relying on JavaScript even a good thing
because on top of targeting browser
matrix you now have to target different
BOTS with different capabilities and as
a developer I really just want
everything to just work without having
to jump through hoops the second major
reason to use SSR is for user experience
many argue that server-side rendering
can hinder user experience and this can
be true because you have a larger HTML
payload it looks interactive but it
might not be this is called the uncanny
valley anchors and other built-ins will
probably be in an interactive of course
but what about complex UI components the
require JavaScript to boot up
and others argue that it can improve
user experience because it's a faster
time to first paint and users can start
consuming that content and plan their
initial action while the JavaScript
boots up they're both right the key here
is context does your target audience
mainly consume or interact with your
content do you use a lot of built-in
elements or do you have a lot of custom
components that require JavaScript how
long does it take for your JavaScript to
download parse and execute so the moral
of this story is actually very similar
to the last one and that your mileage is
going to vary server-side rendering is a
tool that can help you improve your user
experience
use it if you need it but you need to
measure and you need to care and this is
something that we should be doing
regardless in our jobs everyday using
server-side rendering to solve your
problems depends a lot on context if
you're only targeting Google butter bang
you might be okay that said you have to
know the limitations of what you're
talking the same goes for UX you have to
know your audience
measure your apps performance and if you
think it will help try it measure it if
not you don't have to use it okay so now
that we define the problem face let's
look at how we can solve this at this
point I'd like to reiterate that our
goal here is declarative shadow DOM and
I wish I had a dollar for every time I
use the word Eclair ative because I'd be
rich but it's very important it
underpins this talk because it's a core
tenant of HTML therefore it becomes a
fundamental principle for being able to
express shadow DOM I'd like to start off
by defining some terms real quickly the
first one is web components right this
is just custom elements in shadow Dom
that's all I'm talking about here not
HTML imports or templates or anything
the compose DOM is the state of the Dom
when the light on is distributed through
the slots in the shadow root and
serialization is when you transform a
Dom tree into the composed HTML reverse
rehydration is reverse engineering that
string
taking the composed tree and turning it
back in light and shadow Dom at a high
level we plan this into a three step
process first we wanted to be able to
run web components in node because we
really wanted the simplicity of
Universal JavaScript and being able to
co-locate client and server code next we
wanted to take a Dom tree consisting a
bowl shadow and light DOM and then
serialize that down and transform it
into a string and finally we needed to
then run JavaScript on the client to
rehydrate that there's a couple of
different approaches we could have taken
here the first approach is running into
something like headless chrome or
electron I haven't tested a headless
chrome but my first fur and all of this
was trying electron to do this the Dom
API support is top-notch
but there's a bit of friction because
you can't kalokhe eight your client
server code everything has to be proxied
through a separate tool and because of
that performance is questionable so the
other method of doing this is running
your code in something like Jaya stomp
or Domino or Undong depending on the
implementation this can actually be very
fast the API ends up being a lot simpler
because there's no context shift between
tools and it opens up a lot of doors
with a note and I'll talk about this a
bit more in a little bit unfortunately
none of them support web components yet
there is work happening to fix that j/s
Dom has an ongoing PR for custom
elements and shadow DOM and Domino has a
PR open
for just custom elements however we
decided to use undock it's written by
the author who wrote pre-act and Jason
Miller and it's a it's a subset of the
Dom API and we we did that so that we
could build on top of it and build our
own subset of custom elements at it all
we really wanted the ergonomics of
co-locating client and server code and
it's only 1 K so the upfront overhead is
pretty minimal it's also fast because
it's basically just arraignment
violation hidden behind a Dom like API
and it's easy to extend because you
don't really have to worry about
implementing the standards in full being
a minimal implement implementation
allowed us to move really quickly we
needed that because there was a lot more
work to do in order to concept this idea
right the first pass of all this work is
a new library under the skate Jas org
excitingly titled SSR the only thing you
have to do to start writing web
components a node is to make sure that
Dom API is exists in your execution
context to do this you simply require
the module that registers the API is
once this has been done it's as if the
server and the client have joined forces
so now you can write your code as if you
were running on the client and here
we've defined a simple hello world
component that we're going to be using
in the next example so now that we can
run our Dom code a node next step is
taking a Dom tree and turning it into a
string our requirements for the string
are pretty stringent first it must
represent the compose tree because it
must be legible to bots without
executing JavaScript and the content
must appear in order and retain semantic
meaning second it must contain all the
information required to transform it
back into the state before it was
sterilized so the state that was on the
server and third it should be
reminiscent of what a standards-based
approach might look like because we do
want to take this to the w3c as a future
proposal so assuming we've already
defined the hello component
and in the previous example we don't
need to do that much to serialize it the
library's default export is a render
function so we load it up to serialize a
hello element and then we create an
instance of the hello element that we're
going to serialize and we want to
project some content to the light Dom so
we set the text content property and
when we call render on our element it
returns a promise that resolves with the
serialized result using a promise helps
account for components might that might
render asynchronously
for example skate does this to to batch
property updates into a single render
and then it happens on the next micro
tasks you can also pass a custom
resolver for example if you have like a
fetch request somewhere in your code
that you need to account for so the
previous example would output something
like this and this is the compose tree
with a few extra bits so now that we've
serialize our component let's look at
the rehydration process this is the
previous result that we had without
built-in declarative primitives we have
to to execute JavaScript in order to
rehydrate this so we need do the
rehydration code into a single function
that way we can call that function
whenever we need to rehydrate a shadow
root and it's it's called B hydrate here
but the library is going to make sure
that's not gonna have any collisions in
the cold pool namespace this is just for
the example so upon rehydration that
script tag that invoked rehydrate gets
removed
the place over shadow root element is
also then removed and real shadow and
the real shadow root is then attached to
the host in its place and the content
from the particular shadow root or sorry
the placeholder shadow root is then
transferred to the real one now we have
to take all the top-level slots and then
take it to sign nodes or direct children
and then move that back to light domina
on the host we have to be careful though
so that we don't move any default
slotted content the best way we've come
up with so far is by flagging the slot
within an attribute called default but
for the sake of simplicity I'm not going
to do that here and this is what the
full rehydration ends up looking like
this is something similar to what you'd
see in dev tools it's also a really
really great example of why we need to
serialize out the compose tree looking
at the order in which the the text
appears here so you have world appearing
before hello
even if world came after hello it's
still appearing after that exclamation
point and if you had anything placed
around the slot for example to place
emphasis on the text inside the slot
you're going to lose that semantic
meaning using a shadow root custom
element though does have its drawbacks
it's not perfect it's really good
because we can deliver a custom element
in the future instead of using script
tags however we didn't do this initially
because delivering custom element opens
up questions around requiring polyfills
and shims and we wanted the usage of
this to be as simple as possible the
possible alternative to a custom element
would be using something like a composed
attribute or shadow root attribute on
the host doing this means that there's
less Dom elements that need to be
thrashed or you know mutations happening
and it seems to match the imperative API
a little bit closer
either way declarative shadow roots are
currently only designed to work for the
initial parsing of an HTML page
using an other declarative abstractions
like reactant JSX other ones hasn't
really been prototyped yet but we hope
to be doing that soon between the time
that I wrote this talk and now we
actually implemented experimental
encapsulation for CSS class names this
means that you potentially don't have to
execute any Java scripts at all to
server-side render service bots and
actually have scoped content on the page
I got about halfway getting all the
stuff prototypes and it kind of just hit
me do you realize what doors this opens
up and all of a sudden I got pretty
excited behind door number one there's
the ability to run your tests and jest
as a testing famer framework by facebook
just runs a node and normally uses J
estimates as its default environment so
we wrote a custom environment that uses
our on Dom one plus the extensions that
we put on top of it all you have to do
to configure just is to specify the
environment in the package JSON and then
you can start writing tests as if you're
in the browser skates entire test suite
is now run through Jess
using this similarly lady to Jess you
could use mocha to run your tests
directly and note it looks a bit
different though because mocha doesn't
have a concept of environments you're
just running it directly and note so
instead of configuring it to use an
environment you would do as you normally
would and just require the the API is at
the top and then you can just write your
tests as normal
if you find yourself rendering your
content on the server's statically to a
single file with these api's you can
actually quite easily generate an entire
site statically so we built a little CLI
tool that will take a glob of JavaScript
files that have custom elements
constructors there's a default exports
and it will render each one to a static
HTML file it also accepts a props
argument so you can do pseudo dynamic
renders with it and this could be useful
for anything that doesn't have much
dynamic content or isn't very
interactive like documentation sites
however if you want to pre render your
pages and deliver your Java Script
separately that updates some or even all
of those those rendered elements and you
can do that too so dynamic SSR is a lot
like static SSR you're just running it a
node server like happy jsr Express you
can make your components render
dynamically via props by assigning the
request parameters to the component
doing this allows your component to then
dynamically render according to those
props and then the output is serialized
and sent to the client writing libraries
can be fun and it we've really useful to
the community it can also be kind of
glamorous however the definition of
success here is if this library can be
made mostly if not completely redundant
we've built all this stuff out on on top
of on dom and undaunted aborts plug-in
so it would be pretty logical for us to
then just distract extract this stuff
out into a plugin into a separate
repository and once j/s don't have
support then developers can choose
depending on which one has meets their
it's their needs since serialization
rehydration are pretty tightly coupled
it would be really great to get a
standardized way to represent this
composed tree as a string maybe
something like element uh composed HTML
that way we can be confident that what
we sent to the client is going to be
properly rehydrated
and finally to the main point of this
talk we absolutely need a standardized
declarative way to represent shadow Dom
so we can service BOTS
present scope content to users quickly
without requiring JavaScript and so that
we can use the power of shadow Dom
declaratively in other libraries and
frameworks before I go I just want to
say thanks to be Dover and he's
somewhere in here
he spoke yesterday for all of this help
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
