little bit hard but before that i was
also elect an electrical engineer so
although i'm not from the VoIP side of
the world i can definitely appreciate
that this is much easier than it could
be for sure but there's a lot around the
design of WebRTC applications that i
think we're still learning because this
is very much an evolving bleeding-edge
space so that's what i want to talk
about is user experience around WebRTC
based applications alright so as
technologists and as engineers and
people who really love and are
fascinated by WebRTC we love to talk
about things like stun and turn and
signaling and peer-to-peer and
encryption and all of that good stuff
and that is super cool but our customers
are users of our applications don't care
about it at all right and so we try to
talk to them with with metaphors about
things like it's skype in your browser
which helps to convey perhaps the
business value of it and that's great as
far as it goes but we need to still make
sure that that we're not just stopping
there anything okay great the same
experience that we might have in a
particular tool in this setting is what
we should be plugging into a mobile app
or in a web browser right all that the
users really care about is the
experience that they have in the
application okay and that means a lot
more than just peer-to-peer and
encryption now there are some things
about WebRTC that it provides to us out
of the box that determine a lot about
the interaction patterns with our users
and so these are really important to not
only recognize that they exist and we
don't control them as the application
developers but also think about how they
impact people might you people using our
applications and the most obvious one on
the left here is the allow or block from
the browsers to use the video or camera
and that's great obviously really
important for for permissions and
security but we also need to think about
what is your application going to do
when so
one does block the use of their camera
unexpectedly right so even though we
can't control the display of that pop-up
nor should we be able to we need to
think about what do we do when someone
does something we don't want them to do
which users do all the time right and
then the other obvious part of WebRTC
that it comes with out of the box for
experience is that little red circle on
the tabs within the browser experience
telling you that you're live that you're
on camera and that's a great reminder to
users of which tab is using their camera
right but especially if they're coming
back to your site for the second time
over SSL and so maybe they previously
gave permissions for your application to
use their camera but they don't
necessarily remember that when they came
back and all of a sudden we're turning
their camera on for them so we need to
think about how does our application in
its experience warn them perhaps that
this is about to happen even if the
browser doesn't and make sure that they
know that experience is about to happen
for them and that they're ready for it
and with screen sharing two similar
things there you've got the permissions
bar that's going to be displayed on
their on their laptop reminding them
that they're sharing their screen but we
also need to think from an experience
perspective especially if you're
balancing that screen sharing with video
streams going on at the same time how do
we make sure the user has a great
experience with both the video and
screen sharing aspects of the
application so there's a couple of terms
around user experience that you should
be familiar with and these are the these
are the the themes of anything in how
people are going to interact with our
web or to see applications first there's
this term called micro interactions
which is the spit and polish of design
the little touches that users don't
necessarily notice but make a big
difference in how positive they feel
about their experience how easy it is to
interact with something how intuitive is
it then there's information hierarchy
which is all about the structure and the
placement of controls and the end the
implicit priority of those controls
based on their placement on the page
age and then finally feedback which as
engineers we might think about audio
echo that sort of feedback but here
we're talking about feedback to the
users of making it obvious to them
what's happening what's going on what we
need them to do that sort of thing and
how the connection is going ok so first
thing let's talk about is is a pre-call
experience and this larger screen shot
here I had a very early morning call
today on hangouts with people on other
continents much later in the day and
thankfully hangouts gives me that nice
video preview reminding me that I was
not ready to go on camera at five
o'clock this morning San Francisco time
so it caught it saved me although now
I've shared this with you so that was
foolish but this morning it did save me
and reminded me before I go into the
call you're going to be on camera this
is what you look like right now and if
you want to change that at least pause
your video before you go in or or mute
yourself ok that's really important once
I was in the call that I had this
morning the other participants are not
only displayed there but a couple of
interaction patterns here I really like
about hangouts is you've got the name of
people ok so that you're reminded who
they are and then for me at the time I
grabbed the screenshot I've got the
little green dots vertical bar reminding
me of the volume of my voice and it's a
visual indicator to me that they can
hear me and that I I didn't leave the
mute button on right so those are some
really important interaction patterns to
keep in mind in your applications
typically in one-on-one video chats you
have this pattern where you have the
main speaker in this case our UX leave
Mariana and then my camera is down in
the smaller square in the bottom right a
typical pattern that you've got the you
the person you're speaking with and then
you in a smaller window and I think that
that's a really important pattern for us
to keep following however keep in mind
that it can also be distracting right
after I don't want to get too enamored
with looking at myself but at the same
time I do want to make sure that i see
that i have the right camera on that i'm
sharing with the user if I have multiple
amber's attached to my laptop as well as
that the placement of it is there that
people can see me but a pattern that I'd
like to see more often in these
applications to is the ability to
perhaps move the view of myself around
so that it's not interfering with the
the video stream of the other person and
whatever they are displaying or maybe
even minimize at once that I know it's
there now on the on the web experience
when you're doing a web-based WebRTC
applications the interact the controls
that you have with did we just lose
ozzard are you here are you okay there
we go all right so in a web browser
experience we can take advantage of the
real estate that we have within the
browser we've got a much larger space to
deal with so the person we're talking
with can can use up more of that canvas
but also we we can have the audio and
video pause and controls can be more
subtle and kind of up in the top right
corner where people expect to look for
them but they don't have to be real huge
although if I mute myself I want to make
that more visible Mobile is different
right mobile some of us myself included
have very fat fingers and so those
controls have to be evenly spaced spread
apart on the device and we want to give
we have very limited real estate to work
with here so we want to give as much
priority as we can to the to the video
that we're looking at in the app but
still have overlays for those controls
on top of it so those overlays are
really powerful especially in a response
of a mobile layout but we do want to use
them wisely and temporarily so in this
sample from from one of our applications
I'm chatting with with a colleague and
as we're doing text messages there
they're appearing in bubbles overlaid on
top of his video but they're only going
to be there briefly and they're going to
move up the video as as we create them
so that way at least I can give maximum
coverage to to his video but still know
what's going on in any text chat in the
conversation obviously it does interfere
with that video
which is why we want those to move and
we want that to be temporary and the
other pattern that I've seen 24 may be
seeing a more permanent listing of the
chat to go a little further back in it
is to is to sort of like reversing your
camera have an icon that you click on
that sort of flips and hides the big
video shows you the chat messages and
now my colleague Armand is video goes to
a smaller icon a smaller space on the
screen so I can focus on text for a
minute but still see him talking to me
right in multiparty chat of course the
the dynamics are a little bit different
in this multi-party conversation in in
an open talk call we've got lots of
different parties the video is all given
equal priority in there which is great
but we also want to think about other
other settings here right what about
giving the dominant speaker a larger
video space to deal with and maybe even
lowering the quality of the other video
streams if they're not active
participants and then also think about
what happens when in multiparty you have
to deal with performance problems more
often so I want to be able to pause the
streams of others to improve the
performance that I'm seeing or have the
application itself automatically
downgrade their performance and when if
you've ever been in a multi-party call
where the performance was low and so
everybody pauses their video and now all
you see are a bunch of silhouette
generic icons it's really confusing if
you don't know everyone in that call and
maybe you don't know their voices really
well to know who they are so putting in
their profile pictures their names
instead of just a silhouette when their
video is muted and can add a lot to the
user experience we want to provide
feedback to people both before and
during the call about the performance
that they can expect from the
conversation so that they know they know
what's coming so in this screenshot on
the left it's a tool that that that
we're building where think of it like
live support right so you're looking at
people who are
who are on a website and you're maybe
going to start a conversation with them
but if I can tell in advance that they
have a really bad connection I don't
want to even reach out to them I don't
want to try and talk to them because
it's not going to be a good experience
for them or if I can see that they have
a mediocre we just have kind of like
good okay and poor ratings of their
connection I can see it's mediocre maybe
I still want to talk to them but the
video is going to be paused we're going
to leave that part of it out right so
you can you can anticipate that before
the call starts and then in the in the
screenshot on the right here in facetime
it does a nice job of when I was
chatting with my son and he's walking
around with his phone the connection
goes bad his videos automatically paused
and there's a message that tells me that
but now it's given priority to the audio
but that message is important too so
that I don't just think that his video
has frozen and the connection has died
it's telling me the video will resume
automatically when the connection
improves okay and but I can still have
the actual conversation with him and
although we want to get like you know we
talk sometimes about how quickly can we
do the signaling process and get people
into the conversation and reduce that
delay into the conversation sometimes we
might actually want to delay that that
conversation the connection just a
little bit to test the connection first
so with a call quality check in the
beginning only takes a few seconds but
tell the user what you're doing we're
checking your bandwidth right now and so
then in in this example that we build it
will tell you if if the if the quality
is too poor for your video it's going to
tell you you failed the video check but
you're going to put in be put into the
call with audio only the important thing
here is providing that feedback to the
user and making sure that they know how
it's going to improve their experience
in the tool maintaining focus that
information hierarchy part of user
experience is really important always
think about what is the most important
thing that somebody cares about right
now so in this in this screenshot
Mariana and I are talking and one of us
is sharing our
green that's obviously the most
important thing and also where the most
details are so that gets the biggest
video panel of course right and then our
VIP but we still want to see what's
going on in our video tags so they're
going to get some smaller profiles here
and in in this screenshot it's you know
kind of like a typical pop-up window but
we also want to make sure that we've got
controls in there so that the person
watching the screen can make it full
screen bigger than the browser so that
they get as much detail as possible and
you could still leave the video overlays
in there in that full screen mode too or
maybe be able to move them around like I
was saying earlier and then coming
coming to the end here don't emphasize
the the difference between web and
mobile which sounds obvious but just
making sure again that you think about
how everything about the interaction
matters even more with mobile than it
does with a web application because of
that constrained space that you're
dealing with so this this application
not one of ours but called GV I like how
here as I'm as I'm loading the
conversation with someone I'm seeing a
video preview of myself so I've got that
opportunity to see if I'm holding the
phone in the right place for them to see
me but also I'm seeing the profile
picture and the name of who i'm calling
the connection status as i'm calling all
of that is overlaid on top of my video
feed and then following standard mobile
conventions which are really important
on mobile devices that you're doing you
know when somebody expects to be able to
swipe something where that buttons or
the standard convention and in the
standard place like any other call on
that mobile device so so in summary of
the key points here are that WebRTC is
much more than just a video tag the VoIP
side of things is fascinating and and is
amazing what we can do now and bring
into web and mobile experiences but just
getting that stream from getusermedia
and putting it into a video tag is not
enough we've got to think about the full
user experience around that the
information hierarchy of how we
structure the
application the feedback that we give to
users the micro interactions that they
have with our device that will make all
of the difference in in in whether
people really love your application
because no matter how good the
technology is behind it if they don't
have a good user experience they're not
going to be impressed with the
engineering so that's that's my message
to you today keep that in mind as we
talk about a lot more really fascinating
speakers and technical topics today
which i'm looking forward to as well but
always remember on top of all that make
sure that the user experience is awesome
thank you very much that's great that
was great thanks Erin we have two
minutes for any questions you might have
any questions for Erin don't be shy we
have a that's nice and convenient hi do
you have any suggestions for solving UX
problem during screen sharing because
well when your screen share you lose the
context of the web page where you have
your web RTC session and you go to
another app how do you solve this it
well the challenge I think with web
screen sharing right is that as the
developers we don't want to one of the
interesting challenge there's we don't
have control over what they're going to
share with us if they're going to share
the whole screen or only a particular
window and so I'm not sure of a way to
force force that necessarily and then
once you're in that screen sharing you
know in the use cases where we've used
it it's important to still see those
other video streams and have that level
of connectivity with it but you know in
terms of maybe what you're referring to
is is like if I've got the screen
sharing maximized in full screen mode
right but we're still having a text chat
or other data is on the page maybe
streaming in that we want to see perhaps
we can overlay that on top of the screen
sharing video area that gets maximized
so that when someone brings the screen
sharing full-size they've still got the
focus of presumably that's that screen
is the most important thing to look at
but
other information on the periphery can
still come in in in temporary scrolling
sort of fashion somewhere slightly out
of the way so that we can focus on the
screen itself so any more requests any
other questions wait a second there are
more than 20 participants in our
application and you have an active
speaker and wind up two speakers changes
so how we get issues regarding rendering
of the video content so how do we handle
that you say like we have we get like a
snap issues and dejame issues we face it
every day so how do we handle those
things do we have any debugging tools in
chrome itself or are we planning into
that yeah it's it's a it's a really
interesting problem and probably a
better better question or you get a
better answer rather from someone more
from the VoIP side than myself but it's
that I think is comes down to what is
the the the the video implementation of
how you're handling all those streams
and feeding them out to the participants
and I think from purely on the interface
level on the inner interaction design
level you can kind of go one of two
different models maybe more what one is
let let some sort of a media controller
that you know it's not pure WebRTC but
something in there that is aggregating
streams for you handle that to reduce
the load another is try try to do
detection around the audio and and then
maximize the video based on that and
play with the video streams based on
that sort of you know the content that's
coming to you in real time or the other
is change if it fits within the use case
of that do all 20 participants regularly
participate or can it really be more of
like a few too many architecture where
you have and this is when we've done a
couple of times where you have a few
people who are going to be constantly
talking you know like speakers
an organizers at an event and then other
people like asking questions who are
going to come in temporarily and so
maybe they don't need an actual
peer-to-peer WebRTC connection that
entire time they can come in and off of
the stage as needed to ask a question to
debate a particular topic but then they
go back off the stage and everyone else
in the room doesn't that doesn't have to
be 20 or 300 connections there can be a
broadcast of the few important
connections to everyone else so I think
that's the probably the most if your use
case support that that's a great way to
handle it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
