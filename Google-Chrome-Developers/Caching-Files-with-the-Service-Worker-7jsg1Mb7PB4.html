workers it is actually exposed on the
window so can be accessed from anywhere
in your script the entry point is Cash's
you are responsible for implementing how
your script service worker handles
updates to the cache all updates to
items in a cache must be explicitly
requested items will not expire and must
be deleted you are also responsible for
periodically purging cache entries each
browser has a hard limit on the amount
of cache storage that a given origin can
use the browser does its best to manage
disk space but it may delete the cache
storage for an origin the browser will
generally delete all of the data for an
origin or none of the data for an origin
make sure to version caches by name and
use the caches only from the version of
the script that they can safely operate
on will outline a few common patterns
for caching resources we'll look at
caching files on the install on user
interaction and on network response we
can cache sites static resources in the
install event in the serviceworker and
we can cache the HTML CSS JavaScript any
static files that make up the
application shell in the install event
of the serviceworker
it's important to note that while the
install event is happening any previous
version of your serviceworker is still
running and serving pages so the things
you do here mustn't disrupt that event
dot wait until takes a promise to define
the length and success of the install if
the promise rejects the installation is
considered a failure and this
serviceworker will be abandoned if an
older version is running it'll be left
intact caches open and cache at all
return promises if any of the resources
fail to fetch the cache add all call
reject there are plenty of ways to do
this but in this example we iterate over
the list of keys
from the cache and then delete any
caches that don't match the current
cache name if you're making your app
offline first this is how you'll handle
the majority of requests other patterns
will be exceptions based on the incoming
request if the resource exists in the
cache this code will return it from
there otherwise it will send the request
on to the network we can intercept the
request in the serviceworker cache a
clone of the response and send the
response itself to the page this
approach works best for resources that
frequently update such as the user's
inbox or article contents this is also
useful for non-essential content such as
avatars but care is needed if a request
doesn't match anything in the cache get
it from the network send it to the page
and add it to the cache at the same time
if you do this for a range of URLs such
as avatars you will need to be careful
you don't bloat the storage of your
origin if the user needs to reclaim disk
space you don't want to be the prime
candidate make sure you get rid of items
in the cache you don't need anymore now
to allow for efficient memory usage you
can only read a response request body
once in the code above clone is used to
create additional copies that can be
read separately when the user clicks on
an element in our page we can add the
element to the cache if the whole site
can't be taken offline you may allow the
user to select the content they want
available offline for example a video on
something like YouTube an article on
Wikipedia or a particular gallery on
Flickr give the user a read later for a
save for offline button when it's
clicked fetch what you need from the
network and put it in the cache the
caches API is available from pages as
well as service weapons meaning you
don't need to involve the service worker
to add things to the cache we create a
cache with a name corresponding to the
specific article then we fetch the
article and add it to the cache
let's look at some different ways to
serve files from the cache there are
several approaches cache falling back to
network network falling back to cache
cache their network and generic fallback
the request is intercepted by the
service worker we look for a match in
the cache if that fails we send a
request to the network we return the
response if you're making your app
offline first this is how you'll handle
the majority of requests other patterns
will be exceptions based on the incoming
requests if the resource exists in the
cache this code will return it from
there otherwise it will send the request
on to the network the request is
intercepted by the service worker we
send the request to the network if that
fails we look for a match in the cache
we return the response in the above code
we first send the request to the network
using fetch and only if it fails do we
look for a response in the cache this is
a good approach for resources that
update frequently that are not part of
the you know the version of the site for
example articles avatars social media
timelines game leaderboards and so on
handling network requests this way means
the online users get the most up-to-date
content but offline users get an older
cached version however this method does
have flaws if the user has an
intermittent or slow connection they'll
have to wait for the network to fail
before they get content from the cache
this can take an extremely long time it
is a frustrating user experience the
approach we show here is called cash
then network and this is a better
solution requests are sent from the page
simultaneously to the code in the main
JavaScript not the serviceworker this is
a good approach for resources that
update frequently that are not part of
the version of the site for example
avatars social media timelines and gain
leaderboards like we say this approach
will get content on screen as fast as
possible but still display up-to-date
content one
that arrives this requires the page to
make two requests once the cache and one
to the network the idea is to show the
cached data first then update the page
when and if the network data arrives in
the above code we are sending a request
to the network and in the next part the
code is looking for the resource in the
cache the cache will most likely respond
first and if the network data has not
already been received we update the page
with the data in the response the code
for this is shown next when the network
responds we update the page again with
the latest information now sometimes you
can just replace the current data when
new data arrives for example the game
leaderboard again but you know that can
be disruptive with larger pieces of
content this code looks for /data JSON
in the cache this will most likely
respond before the request to the
network and update the page if the
network hasn't already responded if the
network responds after the cache it
updates the page again if getting
response from the cache fails it tries
the network again as a last attempt if
the request is not found in both the
cache and on the network respond with a
pre cached custom offline page if you
fail to serve something from the cache
and/or network you may want to provide a
generic fallback
this technique is ideal for secondary
imagery such as avatars failed post
requests you know unavailable while
offline pages and so on in practice you
have many different fall backs depending
on URL and headers for example a
fallback silhouette image for avatars
the item you fall back to is likely to
be an install dependency for example
cached on the install event of the
serviceworker
once a new service worker has been
installed and a previous version isn't
being used the new one activates and you
get an activator event now because the
old version is out of the
it's a good time to delete unused caches
during activation other events such as
fetch are put into a queue so a long
activation could actually potentially
block page loads keep your activation as
lean as possible only use it for things
you couldn't do while the old version
was active it's important to remember
that caches are shared across the whole
origin there are loads of resources
available where you can learn more you
can access these from the materials that
accompany this video so now it's your
turn go to the lab for this video and in
there you'll be able to practice caching
the application shell intercepting
network requests and lots more
