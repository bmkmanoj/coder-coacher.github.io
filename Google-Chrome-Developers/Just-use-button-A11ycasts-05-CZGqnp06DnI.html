the show
so in the last episode we were talking a
little bit about tabindex and how you
can add focus ability to some of the
custom controls that you're working on I
promised in this episode that we would
be you know talking more about tabindex
and I'd show you how to build some
custom components before I get into that
I realized I was getting a little ahead
of myself I should actually spend a bit
more time singing the praises of native
HTML in particular the humble button
element it's one of those things that I
see a lot of developers actually not
using in their projects using
alternative it's like like divs or maybe
even abusing the anchor tag and so today
what I wanted to do was to show off why
instead of building your own custom
button you should always just use a
button now follow me over here to my
code editor and I'm gonna walk you
through kind of the process of building
like a fake button and then demonstrate
why we should stick with the native
button so here I've got just a div tag
and I'm gonna turn this into a sign-up
button one of the things I think a lot
of developers feel is that maybe the
button element is not super style right
so they'll go they'll drop in their own
styles for for this div button we'll
give it a class button there something
like that actually I'm gonna call this
fancy because it's a really fancy
looking button so we'll get this class
fancy okay so now I've got this very
fancy looking signup button that I've
created here if you remember from the
previous episodes though one of the most
important things for our users to make
sure that our controls are interactive
controls at least are focusable and as
you know this div if we go and we try it
with our keyboard and press the tab key
we're not gonna see any sort of focus
indicator actually on this element and
again that's because to the browser a
div semantically is just sort of like a
grouping element there's nothing
implicitly interactive about it and so
there's no reason why it should be in
the tab order so if you're creating a
fancy div button you might realize that
and say oh okay well I I saw that last
episode that Rob did so I know that I
should maybe add a tab index to this
thing ah okay I'll give it a ten minutes
of zero now I can go and I can tab to
this button and sure enough it is in the
focus order but remember keyboard focus
is not the total story we've also got
our screen reader users out there so
see what happens when we try and
interact with this control using
something like voiceover so you saw
there that instead of saying sign up
button it said sign up group again
because semantically to the browser it
did which is sort of like a generic
containing grouping element type thing
now we haven't really talked about Aria
much but to fix this we need to add our
own role and now we're starting to kind
of get to a point where create our own
custom button has diminishing returns
let's instead look at what we get when
we just use a native button tag so I'll
drop another button in here just a
regular old button element
I'll also right sign up next to this one
I'll say sign up for real
okay and right away you can see that we
don't have that really cool beautiful
styling that we had on our custom button
but you know a native button Ellen just
is totally Styler below so I'm just
gonna give it that same class of fancy
and then boom now we have two buttons
that look pretty much identical we can
see that they are both in the tab order
which is cool I didn't have to add
anything to my button Ellen it's just
sort of like gets that for free and now
let's try this out with a screen reader
and see what we get so you can see there
with that second button it actually
announced the proper role to our user so
had they previously just been working
with that first thing they wouldn't
really know that it was an interactive
control they might think it's maybe just
some text on the page that tells them to
sign up whereas now we've kind of
explicitly told them hey this is an
action that you can take to sign up for
our application but there are some more
reasons why the humble button is pretty
awesome another one is that we can add
our own click handlers to this element
and I want to show you kind of an
important distinction that happens here
so I'm going to just drop in a little
bit of JavaScript into my page and what
this JavaScript just doing I'll hide the
CSS there what this javascript is doing
is it's selecting everything that has
the class of fancy right so we have this
array of buttons now that have that
fancy class for each of those we're
adding a click event listener and when
we click on the element it should alert
this little message that says I was
clicked okay so I'll go click on the
first button you can
it says I was clicked right let's go
click on the second one ok we can see it
also says I was clicked alright well
that makes sense now let's try this with
our keyboard though so typically on a
keyboard pressing the spacebar or maybe
the inner key in some situations will
interact with a control so let's see
what we get here we will focus the first
button and hit spacebar nothing's
happening
hit Enter let's happen in scale over to
that actual the native button element we
hit spacebar ah now we get our alert
message we hit Enter we get our alert
message as well so this little trick
that I'm showing off here in the HTML
spec I believe it's referred to as
synthetic click activation and basically
it's a little bit of black magic that
the browser does that says hey if you
have a button element you add a click
handler I'm just going to assume that
you would also like that to run when
someone presses the spacebar or the
inner key so again you're not gonna get
that with a div button to add that kind
of keyboard support now you're gonna
have to add key down handlers you're
gonna have to look at the key codes and
differentiate was that a spacebar or an
inner key if so run my click handler
right ok so now we're really really
getting diminishing returns with that
div button the last thing that I want to
show off is the disabled attribute so it
can be really really handy to just turn
a control off sometimes based on the
state of your application so I'll write
a little bit of CSS here just so we can
see what's going on so I'll say hey any
time anything that this fancy is
disabled then we're just gonna sense
background to gray okay and I'll add
that disabled attribute you both of
these controls right so let's say 1 2
all right now they both look disabled
but let's see here now when I go when I
click on the sign up button it's not
actually disabled right I'm still seeing
that click message running if I go and I
click on sign up for real ah nothing's
happening right and again as we saw here
we can see the focus ring is on this
control because we added tabindex to it
but we really don't want it to be
focused right now because it should be
disabled and so you can see I cannot tab
to that sign up for real button the
native button has been kind of removed
from the focus order because of that
attribute so again I just wanted to
highlight there's a lot of reasons why
you want to use the native controls
whenever possible you're getting a ton
a built-in behavior and you might not
realize it until you actually go to use
one of these attributes one of these
features and then notice oh shoot this
is not implemented in my button I'm
gonna have to add a bunch of JavaScript
to make that work so you see this button
you see this with other controls like
like select and input there's a lot of
reasons why whenever possible you want
to stick to the native elements so
that's it for today if you have any
questions please leave them for me down
below in the comments or you can always
hit me up on a social network of your
choosing
always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
