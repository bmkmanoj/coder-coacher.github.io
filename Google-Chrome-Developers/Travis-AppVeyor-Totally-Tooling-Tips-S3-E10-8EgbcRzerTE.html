probably be the title to this episode
there is a gray cloud coming towards us
yeah so for anyone who doesn't get that
that's a nice
Travis reference smooth so this episode
is gonna be on Travis CI which is a
super awesome continuous integration
tool that ties in very nicely with
github so you literally like enable I
think it's like a you I think you're
adding your webhook or something in
Travis it's a service you can sorry in
github that you add in to your repo in
settings basically whenever you do like
a commit to a repo or you do a pull
request or anything happens you can sell
Travis to perform basically set up a VM
and do whatever you tell it to do all
you need to do is like set up a Travis
yeah mall configuration file in the root
of your project and that can be as
simple or as crazy as you want to make
it yeah I think I was thinking of the
web starter kit Travis that um one is
literally just like we needed to run in
node 4 node 5 as all it does and then
Travis because it's setup for an
environment a node it'll go well they
should probably do NPM install and hope
that works and then it checks for NPM
run test so the NPM script just called
test yeah and it will do whatever it
does and then given that mocker it
returns an exit code of something other
than 0 and then Travis goes well the
build failed because it didn't do what
you'd expect and it's super handy just
having that thing just constantly just
checking what the hell you're doing yeah
especially for pull requests like when
you get someone just give you a load of
code and you're like does this just
break everything or does it yeah it's
just it's super useful for keeping
everyone honest about stuff that they've
trying to PR and that's just great yeah
I have some some Travis Pro tips how are
they your own or they came to me vividly
in a dream or a medium blog post but so
one of the things we do on a few of our
projects is we cache our package
management directories so like our node
modules directory
some people might cash their Bower
components as well it definitely works
is you can cash light any directory
can't you yeah pretty much if there's
something you want to generate then
afterwards just keep it around yeah just
speeds up installation having it cached
it's kind of a nice little thing you can
do yeah
another optimization is setting your git
checkout depth so that it's only running
against the latest commits for example
nice I think I think web fundamentals is
such a horrific history on get now by
this point that we should probably be
using that I remember using this tool to
check out the largest directories on my
my system were the other day web
fundamentals check out was was the
biggest one moving on Google engineers
know what they're doing
and my final fruits if I think was just
making sure that you know you can
whitelist or blacklist branches so that
Travis isn't running against everything
if you for example have 22 different
branches for web starter kit to Matthew
yeah I should do some cleanup there but
the other advantage of that that I was
going to add on was you can also lay
Travis adds a ton of environment
variables so if you've got shell scripts
you want to run and maybe you want to
like run certain things on master but
not when they were pull requests or any
of this other stuff Travis just dumps a
load of environment variables like one
of them is just like at my end Travis if
I am do this rather than do it if I run
it from the command line or something
yeah so that's the other thing is well
worth checking out because there's a
blog post adjust to all those things
Travis
runs really great when you're trying to
get testing done against like Linux or
OSX yep Windows I don't think it
supports Windows but there is another
service called at Bayer and it has its
own equivalent to the Travis yeah more
it's slightly different but largely it's
very very similar the only gotcha with
that via that I found a bit confusing is
it needs a build number for every time
it does like a run and there's a way you
can set it up to auto increment but it's
it's kind of a bit weird the first time
you do it but once you set up you're
good to go and it's super handy because
it is pretty different from a Linux
environment so up there I found it to be
a little bit finicky to get set up
pretty consistently but once that's done
it's just as easy to use
Travis yeah and some other things you
only really have to do it the start
we're frigid and then you forget what
you've done to the next one yeah but
it's all good so then the last thing
about that is obviously when you set
these things up is you get a lovely
badge just put on you read me yeah the
one last thing I'd mention because I
feel like the tool needs a good shout
out is David which is visually a badge
and it just tells you whether your
dependencies on NPM are up-to-date or
not all it does but I found it
surprisingly helpful just to the
projects I have just sitting there just
going well are they up today are they
out of date what's going on yeah love it
yeah so people should check that out at
David - DM org
there's also so on in the same vein so
whenever I'm working on node modules
there's a CLI called David very similar
thing that you can use and what that
basically does this again it will let
you know you're updated like dev
dependencies or outdated dependencies
list them down in the CLI nicely colored
you know what your version is the latest
version is and also give you like this
one liner you can run just like
instantly bump everything up which is
kind of nice nice that is pretty cool
which is pretty sweet there's also this
thing recently called greenkeeper that
you remember greenkeeper yes that's the
one where it will update everything
automatically run your test suite and if
it passes it will then ping your pull
request going here you guys just update
them yep so people should probably check
all of those out if you have good tests
yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
