name is Zack cook and I'm a product
manager on the chrome team leading our
web payments effort a special thank you
for coming out and joining me at 8:30
a.m. which is very early and of course a
special thank you and welcome to
everyone on the livestream as well as
anyone that's watching on YouTube later
I'm really happy to be up here today
talking to you all today about how we
think about the future of web payments
and how we're trying to really help
users both our users and your users your
customers have pain-free checkout
experiences on the web but I thought I'd
get started by giving a refresher on why
we care about this space at all I think
it stems from the fact that the web is
better than ever you've probably heard
it over and over again from Raul's
keynote to all of our web Trac sessions
that the web is really amazing these
days you can build fast rich app like
experiences like and in a really
compelling and that line between what is
web and what is app is more blurry than
it's ever been we think this is an
incredible opportunity and things like
WebGL and polymer and serviceworkers all
have these are all tools that can help
you create these incredible experiences
I think personally my favorite example
of how far the web has come is the fact
that you can literally circumnavigate
the entirety of the Earth's surface
directly inside of a browser tab these
days so this is Google Earth running
inside of Chrome and to me it just kind
of blows my mind that you can do this on
the web if you don't recognize this this
is actually where we are right now with
at Shoreline Amphitheatre which is the
beautiful white tint where all the
keynotes are and then of course we're in
the back parking lot but it's a very
nice parking lot so really incredible
stuff but when you look at all this
amazing progress there's one area that
seems obviously behind and that's the
way we buy things online because despite
all of this great progress this is still
what most check out flows look like
it's the same questions the same form
fields the same multi-step process like
for all this great innovation we're
still stuck here and I suspect this is
very similar to the way checkout forms
first worked when they launched in
preparation for this talk I did a little
bit of research and I discovered that
the first online transaction was made in
1984 in someone's home by a 72 year old
woman named mrs. snowflake which i think
is just an incredible piece of fairly
worthless trivia but I think that very
little has changed in those years even
though it's 2017 but I think the stats
reflect that we need some change here
long checkouts continue to be one of the
leading causes of cart abandonment out
there and it makes sense here's a
question for you has anyone in here on a
mobile device ever abandoned a
transaction because the process was too
long or cumbersome you can raise your
hand oh my god that's way higher than
the stat by the way so that's amazing
um and me too and sometimes I tell
myself I'm going to go back and I'll
complete it on desktop later maybe I do
maybe I don't
the point is that doesn't lost
opportunity to give users a really great
experience here and to convert at that
moment so we're quit literally losing
money despite these challenges though
mobile commerce is huge I mean mobile
commerce in the US alone this year is
expected to exceed 150 billion dollars
that's all the more impressive when you
consider the fact that mobile websites
still convert about a third lower than
their desktop or laptop counterparts so
we have a lot of work to do and a huge
opportunity here to really better the
lives of our users and so every good
platform out there whether it's apps or
the web needs a good payment solution to
succeed and so it became obvious to us
that the web needs a better answer for
payments and that's what I'm here to
talk today about today and in that sense
I actually have really good news it
already exists last year at Google i/o a
couple of my colleagues were up on stage
and they announced that we were working
on this new API called payment request
well I'm happy to report that not only
did we say we were going to launch it we
actually launched
request in September of last year so
what is payment request it's an open
built into the web designed to be fast
and secure ready to be used today API
for transacting on the web platform
we're going to be talking about all of
these different components throughout
our talk today and I'm really excited to
just dive right into it
but first I should clarify something
payment requests is not a processor
we're not trying to make the browser a
processor or a gateway or another new
entity in the system to move money from
point A to point B we think the industry
has already done a great job of actually
filling this service great players like
stripe and Braintree and Van t'v and we
love the work that they're doing
you know we're focused on users we're
focusing on taking that user experience
that seems stuck in legacy mode and
moving it out of that into a much more
faster streamlined experience so we
thought about designing the payment
request API we had two goals I think
primarily in mind the first is that
transactions on the web should be
seamless and we have to start with the
status quo so we have to take the
existing world oftentimes the world of
credit cards CBC's billing addresses all
those complicated things from a UX
perspective and we have to make them
better the second thing is we have to
think about security and how we can
improve that and I don't just mean
things like HTTP because of course we
should always have HTTPS Everywhere
we're big advocates of that but I mean
we should be forward-looking and say how
can we bring more secure forms of
payment like tokenization directly into
the web platform so how can we unlock
opportunities for players like Android
pay and Samsung pay in future
tokenization technologies to have a home
directly in the web platform so
high-quality secure payments become
first-class citizens of the web platform
now I could talk about this all day long
but I'm just go ahead and jump to a demo
and show you what this all looks like
all right so it's going to jump over to
the wolffish in here all right
so as I mentioned payment request is
alive and ready today so you don't have
to wait to start implementing and we
actually have a number of really great
merchants implementing one of which is
Cogan calm it's a little blurry but
hopefully you guys can get the idea
Kogan is Australia's largest retail
company and they've implemented payment
request and it just so happens that
chrome also has a office in Sydney now
I've never been there but I'm going to
operate under the assumption that one
day they will let me go to Sydney and
I'm going to give myself a gift on
arrival that will be waiting at the
Google office for me and so I'm going to
buy something that everyone I think
needs of course USBC adapters you know
super common so I'm going to add this to
my cart and it's now added to my card as
you can see and I'm hit the checkout
button and so you see here like this the
sort of standard thing happens I'm on
Cogan comm the shopping cart loads up
I've got my list of items I'm about to
purchase I have delivery estimates I hit
the checkout button and here's payment
requests in action so instead of going
to the traditional checkout flow at this
point a payment request sheet slides up
directly from the bottom we've got the
merchant name their HTTPS URL with a
lock icon we've got the chrome logo in
the bottom left so users are aware of
where this data is coming from as well
as a bunch of other information as you
can see so first you see we have a total
amount of money being requested so you
see right now it's Australian dollars
for five dollars and you see that I
already have a Visa credit card default
selected there and the only thing I have
to do is choose a shipping address this
makes sense because of course it's a
physical good so we have to ship it
somewhere so I'm going to tap on and
choose and you see here that payment
requests already knows my most
frequently used addresses so you see the
first one there my number one is my main
office in our San Francisco headquarters
and then the second one actually is our
Sydney office what this tells you is
this is not the first time I practice
this demo so Chrome has stored and saved
my address here so I didn't tap on this
address and what's happening when I tap
on that if we take that address and we
send it behind the scenes to the
merchants so they
use that address to dynamically populate
the set of available shipping options so
you'll see they default selected free
shipping for me but if I tap on that I
can also select express shipping now in
this case I have no idea when I'm going
to go to Sydney and pick up my little
converter here so I think standard
shipping will be fine for me and then I
hit the pay button and you'll see the
only thing that I have to do is input a
CVC now because this is a live
transaction and something should be kept
secret from the world I am NOT going to
show my CVC number to everyone but you
can trust what I just typed it in and
now the transaction is running behind
the scenes we've taken that data we've
bundled it all up and we've sent it
behind the scenes to Cogan and as you
can see the transaction is successful
yay I love when demos go well so that's
amazing
what like I think what's really cool
about this is that I didn't have to type
in anything except for my CVC we had all
my data stored it was all ready to go
all I had to do was confirm it off it
and get of it over so that's the kind of
seamlessness that we're talking about
bringing to the web now I know that
we're really focused this year on the
mobile web track but the reality is that
oh we need to ship back into demo mode
because we still have there we go
perfect
we again we've been on the mobile web
track and that's the big focus for us at
i/o but we all know that users still
love buying things on their desktops and
on their laptops and we thought that we
should bring the same great experience
in to to these to these platforms so
here you see I have a shop loaded up on
my Mac and Windows or sorry Chrome
running on my Mac and I'm going to tap
the Buy Now button and as you can see a
new payment sheet optimized for the
desktop experience comes down from the
top and what's great here is you'll see
that my same information is available so
I choose an address you'll see it's got
my same addresses that you saw online
mobile device because I'm signed in and
all that data is syncing across all of
my instances of Chrome
in this case I'm just going to ship to
our Speer Street office you see that
methods are still dynamically calculated
so we offer free shipping inside of
Alif or Nia but you can see just as a
demo if I do decide to ship somewhere
else
shipping dynamically changes to $10 and
in this case my 8605 visa is also their
present the card I just used to make
that last transaction but in this case
since I can't hide this screen I added a
test card that I'm going to go ahead and
use to facilitate payment so I do the
same thing tap on pay insert my three
digit CBC hit the confirm button and the
same thing happens so your order has
been successfully placed so really great
and I'm really excited to say that we
are bringing payment requests to all
chrome platforms very soon so really
nice so we can pop back over to slide
great pop back over the slides feel like
we'll get there excellent okay so now
you've seen payment requests in action I
want to help you understand a little bit
how it works now I won't go into too
much depth here because we already have
a lot of great resources but I want to
give you the core idea of how this whole
process works a payment request is a
JavaScript API
of course it's built and baked into the
web platform to create these experiences
this is what you saw there all was
natively chrome rendered UI and the
first thing you have to do when you want
to create a payment request if you have
to tell us how you can get paid we call
these supported methods and there's two
types of supported methods that exist
inside a payment request the first one
are things that are baked into the
standard in this case we have something
called basic card basic card is a great
fallback mechanism and it's your way of
telling the browser hey if it looks and
feels and functions like a cup piece of
plastic in someone's wallet
it probably maps the basic card so it's
your way of saying I accept any of these
forms of payment I don't show it here
but there are ways to get more nuance in
this as well
you can say I only accept debit cards or
I only accept credit cards from these
three networks all that's totally
possible the second thing you can pass
in our supported methods that we call
proprietary methods these are identified
by URLs and in this case for example if
you wanted to leverage the great new
self that the payments team announced
yesterday with
Google payments this is how you tell the
browser that hey I support any of those
Google payment methods and so there's a
proprietary system built in here so that
every entity in the payment space can
actually participate freely in the
payment request ecosystem it's the job
of the browser to look at the ways a
merchant can get paid and the way that a
user can pay you and maps those
automatically and that's what allows us
to offer that great rich experience
where things are default selected so all
I have to do is confirm and pay the
second thing I have to pass in our
details of the transaction itself
there's only two required things here
you have to pass in a label like
purchase amount for example and you have
to pass in an amount of money that
you're looking to get paid on in that
sense there's a currency code this could
be US dollars or as you saw on our demo
Australian dollars and a value and we
use that to render the appropriate
amount on the screen you can also pass
in an optional set of display items
these are things that show up that
basically inform the user about how that
total amount of money was reached these
are totally optional but we really
recommend them because it helps the user
explain how that total amount of money
was reached things like subtotal taxes
shipping cost etc and the final thing
you can pass into payment requests if
you're a completely optional set of
additional information you might need to
complete your transaction so when we saw
the Kogan demo you saw that what they
had done was they requested shipping
true this basically tells the browser
hey if you have addresses stored
leverage those so user can select them
and this is a fully dynamic system so
when I when I tap an address we take
that address we bundle it send it to the
merchants so they can dynamically
calculate shipping options and there's a
way in the API to then update us on the
set of available options so it makes a
really robust rich experience you see
you can also request things like email
phone and name email for example was
also in the Kogan demo because that's
utilized for a new customer like me who
had never purchased to be able to send
an email transaction receipt again all
these are entirely optional the only
thing you have to have in a payment
request is an amount of money and a way
that you can get paid at least one way
to get paid something that we owe and
now you have to put it all together
of course so quite simple you just
construct a payment request so you pass
in those three components we just talked
about and then whenever you're ready to
actually show that payment sheet you
call dot show in doubt show us the
function that says hey actually slide up
that payment sheet and facilitate
payment at that point that returns back
a JavaScript promise and you're going to
wait and at some point you're going to
get back a payment response and that
payment response is just a JSON object
that contains all of the data that you
requested and that you need to
facilitate the transaction so if it's a
credit card you're going to get things
like card number name a building address
and even a CBC to run it through if it's
a proprietary form of payment you'll get
all of the data for that particular form
of payment
so Android pay is also supported on this
so if you got an Android pay response
you would be able to parse that response
and pulled out that tokenize form of
payment and send it off directly to your
payment processor and the final step is
that once you're all doing it once
you're all done you just call complete
and that's your way of telling the
browser hey I'm finished with this
transaction go ahead and close that
payment sheet that then also returns
back a promise that will resolve when
that payment sheet is completely closed
down and that way would you have like
great UI bits that you want to flip or
whatever you can do that all like
seamlessly without the closing of our
animation and that's it that's as much
as it takes to actually get that great
experience we just show Don Kogen calm
now there's one other API I want to
mention or one method which is can make
payment can make payment is an API that
allows you to ask payment requests if
the user has a form of payment already
active and ready to go before calling
dot show so so if the user doesn't have
anything set up you'll get back false if
they have something set up you'll get
true we think that this API along with
that set of optional information at the
end there that third component allow
payment request to be really flexible
and they can work into all of your
different flows and so it's really nice
to be able to you can you can just use
it as simply as a payment mechanism just
for a credit card or it can facilitate
the entire transaction flow including
shipping address and names and emails
and phone numbers and we have merchant
shipping all different variations of
this as I mentioned one thing that we're
really happy to announce today is that
we are coming to ever
a single chrome platform we announced
Android last year and now we're happy to
announce it's coming everywhere that's
Android Linux Windows Chrome OS Mac as
well as even Chrome for iOS and so for
users that are synced all of that data
is stored and synced across all your
devices so the minute I sign in from one
to another all that data is there and
ready to go there's a theme here with
payment requests which is let the
browser help you we've got this data
stored our users trust us to store it
what we want to do is share it with you
all we need is user consent to do so
so in some sense think of payment
request as a way for a user to grant
consent to share this data with you
seamlessly and easily now something else
I'm excited to announce is that we also
have support for all google forms of
payment built right in so if you went to
the keynote yesterday with Sridhar and
Polly you saw that we're building this
great new payment experience where all
of your forms of payment in Google are
grouped under a single application all
this is going to be built and seamlessly
work inside of chrome and with payment
requests where most of the heavy lifting
is actually done by us so you're passing
that google.com slash pay identifier and
you get all the benefits of the Google
payment ecosystem built right in and
access to those hundreds of millions of
flops which we think is really
compelling and as you can see it's a
really nice experience built directly
into Chrome something else that I think
is also incredible is the fact that
payment requests now also work
seamlessly with amp so if you're not
familiar amp or accelerated mobile pages
they're they're basically incredibly
fast loading pages that load virtually
instantaneously so in this gift on the
right hand side you'll see a live
example of this working on one of our
partner sites Portero com you'll see
that you it all starts from a search you
search you tap on a result and that page
loads basically instantly so you get
very so user can very quickly go from
searching to seeing the entire product
information they then tap that Buy
button directly on the product page and
the payment request sheet slides up all
the information is there you're ready to
transact so the entire experience from
front to back it can be done in like
less than a minute it's really amazing
aunt I've seen incredible success and so
you if you haven't yet looked into amp
for your product pages I would encourage
you to check it out
and if you have amp to your product
pages I wouldn't really encourage you to
look into leveraging payment requests to
just facilitate that transaction right
there on the page now I know I'm talking
about a lot of Google here and you know
Google Chrome amp which is an open
standard Google payments but one thing
that is really great today to be able to
announce is that this API is a cross
browser API we talked about openness
right and openness means that it should
work everywhere and so this is really
great edge has launched Samsung Internet
has launched Chrome has launched and
Firefox is in development and launching
soon so we've seen a lot of movement in
the industry which we think is really
incredible yeah thanks I think tells you
that there's a commitment in the
industry to solve this problem and to
really make web payments compelling and
to give users on every platform
independent of their browser choice a
great checkout experience and so it's
been great working with all these
players inside of the w3c and of course
as I mentioned this is available now
this isn't just vaporware it's not
something that we're launching soon no
payment request exists and we already
have a number of great merchants
literally around the globe shipping
integrations so you've got we go you may
have heard already a ship at their base
in Southeast Asia
we've got kokkonen Australia JD Sports
Nivea players from Europe we're really
excited and thankful to all these early
partners and these are just some of them
the merchants that are shipping payment
request integrations right now we also
recognize that we want to bring well not
recognize we want to bring the benefits
of payment requests and seamless
transactions though to all merchants
independent of size and one way to get
that reach is to work with these great
channel partners people like womp Mobile
who you saw in the amp demo WooCommerce
big commerce mobile fly Weebly Shopify
by working on these guys and building
payment request integrations right in we
can bring these benefits directly to all
merchants even those in the longtail
because everyone should be able to give
their users stellar experiences and so
we've been really happy to work with all
these great guys now I realized that
this can be overwhelming and that
checkout flows are complicated you're
like Zack this all sounds great but you
have now
see my check out flow I've got guests
check out flows I've got registration
I've got sign-in I've got coupon codes
I've got all this stuff and I realized
that it's a big ask to go from not using
this new thing to leveraging this new
thing so I want to throw out a potential
place to consider getting started and it
starts with a challenge and the question
is to go back and ask yourself what
percentage of your transactions
especially on mobile have only one item
in the cart at checkout so go back run
your numbers and figure out what percent
of transactions only on I have only one
item in a cart at checkout and again
focus on mobile I think you'll be
surprised at how high it is we ask this
question to our partners all the time
because we're curious and it's always
higher than what we expect
but we've been amazed to see that it's
up to 80 percent sometimes of checkouts
that only contain a single product but
if that's the case why are we still
stuck to a legacy system it's like you
know years you know the way we walk into
a physical store is I I grab my shop or
my cart I like walk down the aisle I
like add items into my cart and then I
go up to the to the front and I check it
out and stuff like that and that's the
whole process and then we brought
ecommerce into the world and we thought
we'll stick with the same model we're
going to go ahead and have like virtual
aisles and usually have a virtual
shopping cart and they're going to walk
the aisles and add items in and then I'm
going to click on that shopping cart to
review and check out and then our form
factors got smaller and we're like ah
we'll keep the same model so users are
going to go on their tiny little devices
navigate our virtual aisles out of the
shopping cart and so the flow ends up
looking like for 80 percent up to 80
percent sometimes if your users are on a
product page they're having to tap on
the product add it to cart go find the
card and put it on the cart button
review the car at the checkout process
and you just think and maybe we can
optimize this and so here is my
recommendation or something you should
consider to get started which is
consider payment request as a Buy Now
button that you can add directly to your
product pages it's a way to pretty
simply get started you can leverage
tools like can make payment and request
shipping and request email address
facilitate that entire transaction right
there on the product page so just as an
experiment and see how it performs I
think it's worth giving users especially
those that only want to make a single
fast purchase the option to do so and
again with all the tools like can make
payment you can do so in a way where you
have full control over the system so
they don't have a seamless experience
built in that's fine skip it and go to
your legacy flow but we think there's a
really great opportunity here to have an
impact and drive up conversions and then
later if this proves successful you can
consider how to leverage payment
requests in your default checkout flow
as well now we've talked from the very
beginning about openness and when we
first announced payment requests we said
that it was never about just making
google forms of payment either there
although of course we care about that
but it's recognizing that for a true
openness means that everyone should be
able to participate in the ecosystem and
so one of the things that we're really
really happy to announce today that
we've been working on for a long time is
that we're officially opening up payment
requests so that third party payment
application providers can participate
directly in the ecosystem and show up in
that exact payment request sheet because
the reality is that payments the web is
global and payments are global and if we
want to have global scope we have to
open it up so that everyone can
participate freely and we think this is
really great but to talk a little bit
more about this I want to invite up a
couple of my colleagues from the w3c web
payments working group who we've been
working on this with from Ali pay and
Alibaba let me welcome to the stage
Max and jaja to talk a little bit more
about this
hello everyone I am Max and I lead the
international standards work for the
Alibaba Group
hello everybody I am Java I'm a senior
engineer for our EP we check MD and
finish our sauce group before getting
started let me see a quick show of hands
how many of you have ever heard of a
leap a whoa okay so how many of you have
ever used a leap a to make a transaction
oh not bad so mobile payments are very
popular in China for example honey pay
is used for online shopping teck teck
teck in taxis a supermarket and lots
more and we can use fingerprint
face detection and other biometric
authentication methods is very secure
and convenient holiday is not only
popular in China it's also a global
brand the word considering to bring
early pay into the global market we
found that mobile web is the popular
venue for people doing online shopping
we want you to bring the good user
experience of Nicky Valley paid directly
into the web ecosystem and we see that
the payment request API standard is the
best way to do this
we joined w3c and women working group to
work with Google to make sure that the
payment request API sender can also
support native hill map so updating your
native Android app to run instead of
payment requests a plan actually scratch
simple you just need to edit your
Android manifest XML file to respond to
the payment intent and as metadata which
specify your payment method name for
example
Ferrari pay is hollywood.com slash web
page your payment app buildin receive
the payment request through the T intent
and should reply with the correct
response for your particular application
but as you can imagine
invoking little pebble app from products
has security challenges to example if
there is a phishing attack and
effectively pay installed on user form
don't want the browser to oh man open up
that stick time so how the rapers
prevent this in the standard tall solace
in a cup of many festivals located on
the payment providers web set this
contain a variety of useful information
used to verify the authenticity of the
pmontap the first is what we call the
payment method manifest file this is
downloaded by the browser using the
payment method and densifier information
which was is a lapel comm slash web page
the browser does this by issuing an HTTP
header request which points to the
location of the premise of the manifest
file on a lapel comm instead of this
payment method manifest we can then
define the location of our second
manifest the web app manifest this is
severely define the information about
our application itself including the
package name and the fingerprint
information what is important is that
only a Lipe has control over this
manifest file and when the browser tries
to involve in lab it will firstly
download this manifest file and verify
the signatures match let's look at a
demo and see how this works
so other demo is Israel so in the first
demo the merchants about multiple
payment matters and even the user
colleague buy button
honey pay can show up as one available
payment method and if the user select
Alipay the NICU Valley P AB will be
opened up and the user can use their
fingerprint to do the authentication
it's very convenient than the Sakura so
in the next demo the merchant only
supposed RDP so the merchant can even so
a pay with a leap a button and with just
one click and within several seconds the
payment could be finished it's very
convenient and I think that will help
you to spend than your money no easier
cool so we are currently working hard
with chrome team to bring this feature
into production so if you are developer
you can use this feature in Chrome in a
VP in UC web and hopefully move others
in the near future
Alade is the world leading so the party
payment platform we have spotted more
than eighteen countries including this
team Hong Kong dollar euro Hong Japanese
yen and strong we are continually
improving user experience and security
so technology innovation and
implementing adapter standards
welcome to John Webb payment a
consistent thanks for being here thank
you
awesome
Thank You max and thank you ja ja I
think it's really exciting to see an
industry like this evolved and we're
really happy to be a part of it and
really pushing for openness on the web
as they mentioned I'll quickly recap
there are just three actually steps to
get started integrating your application
today one you'll define your identifier
for google.com slash pay that's what it
is for a leap a it's a leap a.com slash
web pay secondly you'll make a few
updates your manifest file in your
Android app as well as some functions to
handle those things and then finally
you'll set up some manifests on your web
server so so you can be confident that
Chrome is opening the right application
so really simple really great and I'm
happy to announce that we're already
working with some really great partners
so you'll expect to see Samsung pay
coming into chrome alley pay as you saw
just in the demo as well as Square cash
and a number of others so I think you're
going to see a lot of evolution in the
space over the next three to six months
now I recognize there's a there's a bit
of irony here which is that we are on
the web track talking about how great
the web is and how amazing it is and
then I'm up here saying our first
integration is with native Android apps
it's for a couple of reasons one it's
because we do think that there are great
experiences that can be built with
native applications you get access to
things like fingerprints so you can have
biometric authentication and it makes
great experiences the second thing it's
just a little bit easier to get started
but I have great news which is that we
are actively working on pure web app
support so you get all the benefits of
the web like no installation immediate
availability and global reach and so Web
Apps can be full first-class citizens
inside of the payment request system we
think this is actually really compelling
we recognize that users love to pay with
certain brands but don't necessarily
have those apps installed that's okay
and we're fully working and committed to
bringing that support and today I'm
excited to announce that we are working
with PayPal to actually build out this
experience and bring PayPal's web app
directly into the payment request
experience so look forward to sharing
more about that over the next few months
now again we talked about a lot today
there's a lot of code samples a lot of
overviews so we have a lot of great
integration guides that are out there
that you can reference we've got payment
request guides we've got how you can get
started integrating your Android payment
application we also have a great code
lab that you can run through what to
help you get familiar with the payment
request system so I encourage you to
check those out as well as after this we
do have a mobile web tint which is just
around the corner out this door to the
left so I would encourage you to stop by
say hello see some of these things in
action and ask ask the hard questions so
thank you so much everyone it's been a
pleasure to be up here today hope to
talk to you afterwards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
