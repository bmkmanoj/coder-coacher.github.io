masthead images I've got a plan for that
that should mean that I can do this kind
of effect and then have you know other
stuff behind it peeking through and all
the rest of it which is exactly the
effect that I want and I didn't know
exactly how i was going to achieve it oh
I was wrong I was very wrong because it
turns out edge doesn't support clip path
fair enough every browsers at different
stage of spoiling this and that says
nope not a big deal but it was going to
be my solution if you remember this is
what I had added these images and I
wanted the image itself to do kind of a
background size cover and then for the
clip at the bottom to just be applied
kind of after the fact just to do that
diagonal slice along the bottom and I
know I could use a canvas because you
know it'll be a few lines of code to
actually clip like that but I didn't
want to and the reason I didn't want to
is because it felt like it would make
JavaScript a requirement to get the
basic page content there and that's not
something I wanted to do and I felt like
it should be doable either directly with
SVG or well it was going to be fun with
clip path but as I say I can't use that
so here's where we kind of left the SVG
version had to go back to go back to the
drawing board a little bit so it was
either going to scale down like this
which would leave a gap at the top of
the page or it would squash and stretch
and causing the image to distort and I
was like one neither is good this one
was the the least bad version though I
felt that if I set this as a background
image and did told it to background size
cover from the bottom then I would end
up with something like this which
actually wasn't miles off until it kind
of gets to this book may be a bit small
area this point where if you got the
wrong kind of image I say wrong it's a
bit hard on Darren Darren's getting
clipped and so that wasn't good and so
my solution there was too
to do this we're as as it gets wider we
transform it down and you can do that
with some CSS inside the SVG what you
can see here and it's basically done on
break points so I have to cut a tweak it
as we go the idea is that you can
transform the image that is inside the
pattern and that will probably be in
here in the Deaf's inside the pattern
they are there's image we can transform
that down proportional to the viewport
width so as it gets wider it gets pushed
down more gets transformed down even
more problem being edge doesn't support
transforms our fight CSS transforms on
SVG elements yet right so that solution
didn't work and to be clear I spent six
hours on this particular problem trying
every different permutation trying to
get something that would work happily in
in chrome in Firefox in Safari and edge
and it it was a real Tuffy actually it
really you know it really took it out me
because I was just trying so different
combinations and thinking it's one of
these should work anyway the clue that I
should have heard in my inside voice
inside my head was I want something that
behaves like a div with background size
cover and yet be like it's in SVG with
the clipping if you've not come across
foreign object welcome to foreign object
101 with me where I explain how it is
that I'm actually using foreign object
this in fact gives me by the way the
same kind of look as I had in the
previous one but it actually works
everywhere and the way it does it let me
switch across to the code is we have
foreign object inside of the SVG and we
can apply that clip to the foreign
object so that's going to clip whatever
the foreign object is and the foreign
objects just one hundred percent width
and height what is foreign object right
it allows you to embed some HTML inside
of an SVG so
I have in here a div and I probably need
to add some Aria roles to that to make
sure that this is showing up correctly
for screen readers and the like but you
see all these breakpoints basically I
that div has a background and you see
that's kind of dynamically set but all
the same it has a background image set
to background size cover and so the
foreign object is basically drop that
image inside of the SVG as this kind of
totally other rendered thing which
happens to be the correct thing that I
want and I set it with background
position to move it down proportional to
the screens with why don't I use
transform well two reasons firstly
thankfully I'm animating this so I don't
need to worry about using it just
transforms an opacity if I did then this
would be problematic because if you try
and transform this down the foreign
object and the clip and the transform
don't work with Safari that particular
combination it stops clipping and just
starts to transform the content down so
the fact that I want it transformed all
or at least to be moved and clipped and
in HTML and all the rest of it means
foreign object it means using background
position which I can set and I can use
to move things and as I say because I'm
not animating background position it's
not going to be a performance issue and
there you go that's six hours of my life
fighting and usually there's quite a lot
break points but it does at least work
to which we can say Paul one browsers
