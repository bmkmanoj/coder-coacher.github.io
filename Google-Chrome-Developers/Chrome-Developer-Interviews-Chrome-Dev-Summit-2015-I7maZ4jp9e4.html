for me has been hearing about these
api's rights are being worked on before
they've actually hit the ground a lot of
people are talking about these on the
circuits yet I speak at a lot of
conferences and usually I'm hearing
about stuff that's really baked or
projects that were done six months ago
and that's all very well and good but I
feel like here i'm really getting in on
the ground floor with some of these
things and it's very exciting for me my
name is Brian LaRue I work at Adobe
Systems as a product manager don't hold
that against me I still read code think
the API I'm most interested in from
chrome right now would be the
serviceworker API we're seeing it just
start to land and this this gives the
web surface to not only interact with
the network in a new way but gives us
full offline capabilities which we
really haven't had up to this point and
it's been a huge win favor of native
apps so I'm hugely excited for that
basically it's just great to be with the
chrome engineers and be able to talk to
them on a very personal level so for me
personally it's about getting like this
really personal connection to people
working on Chrome and just you're having
lunch with them there's an incredible
time I think it's one of the biggest
opportunities all of us will see in our
lifetime in computing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
