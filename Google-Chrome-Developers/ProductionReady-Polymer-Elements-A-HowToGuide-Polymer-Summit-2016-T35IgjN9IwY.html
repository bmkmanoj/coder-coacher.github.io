I work on the polymer library and for
the next 15 minutes we're gonna go over
how to make your polymer elements ready
to ship into production through testing
methodology and infrastructure now you
may be wondering what are production
ready elements and in essence production
ready elements are reusable
they have great documentation they have
understandable code and comprehensive
testing but it's a fair question to ask
why should I care about reusable
elements I always make my apps from
scratch that works well for me but the
simple effect of the matter is
reasonable elements lower the cost of
making your app if you can standardize
on a set of robust highly reusable
elements when building your application
you will improve productivity by only
working on the parts specific to your
app and here's a real-life example
Google uses polymer and over 500
applications some republic or not but
all of them have to pass a high bar of
quality their users and in these 500
applications Google wants elements to
have the same behavior buttons
checkboxes dialogues sliders everything
should be consistent and this means that
Google wants to reuse elements across
applications so that the application
developers don't have to duplicate all
the same behaviors and in order to meet
the needs of Google and other customers
polymer has to maintain over 100
elements across three github
organizations with an additional copy
inside of Google's internal source
control system and to make sure that
these reusable elements actually keep
their promise to save the application
developer time they have to be highly
tested have great documentation and
contain understandable code that means
they need to be production ready well by
this point you're probably thinking that
sounds great but how
make my limits production-ready well rim
this slide it isn't by accident that
polymer has so many users inside of
Google we learned how to make our
elements production ready and we know
the tools to use they'll make your
elements production ready as well and
whether you're building one element then
you want to share with others or a part
of a large company maintaining a huge
set of elements used to cross tons of
apps there are lots of tools at your
disposal to make sure every commit is
production quality and since there's so
much to talk about today
I've condensed it for you into this easy
how-to guide and as a part of this guide
we'll be taking a look at paper check
box that link at the bottom will take
you to the repository so you can get a
good look at the tools we use on our
production elements and the main focus
of this guide is really about testing
and in particular these three areas of
testing linting unit testing and
continuous integration let's take these
one by one and discuss why they're
important how about we start with
linting linting tools help you spot easy
errors like misspelling a variable name
or forgetting a comma they can be
integrated into your editor to help you
spot mistakes before you even start your
tests and the first tool I want to talk
about is es lint so es lint is really an
industry standard it's extremely
configurable has a broad plugin system
and most importantly it's compatible
with our use of each two imports by the
way of the HTML plugin now you can
configure es lint to enforce all manner
of coding style choices like braces
quotes logging capitalization but this
is all you need to run es lint on
polymer elements so there's a lot here
why don't we break this down first we
extend the recommend styling guide made
by you cellent this styling guide has
just enough to catch syntax errors and
generally bad styling well it won't
force you into any particularly
opinionated style next we tell it us
lint that we expect this code to run in
the browser
so now browser Global's like
document window won't cause errors when
you Lent then we enable the HTML plugin
so that elements written in our default
polymer style with Dom module and inline
scripts will be checked correctly and
finally we tell is lint about the
polymer global itself for use when we
register our element and that's it
pretty simple right now you can turn on
es lint when writing polymer code and
catch a wide swath of errors before you
even start your tests but let's move on
to poly poly lint is a linting tool that
the polymer team is created that catches
polymer element specific mistakes that a
tool like es lint is not really designed
to do pilot checks that all of your
dependencies are imported that your
properties are defined correctly and
that the syntax is correct in your data
binding expressions with es lint and
poly linked together
you don't have to write a whole set of
unit tests but you can be still
production ready alright that's
everything about linting because now we
can move on to unit testing so unit
testing is really what most people think
about when they say testing where you
write scenarios for your code where you
know the inputs and contest' that the
outputs mess max yeah the expectations
of your algorithms and processes and
typically in web development unit
testing involves one or more of these
libraries Luca a test framework Chie an
assertion library and sit on just a
mocking and spying library this
combination works well for thousands of
projects in the web ecosystem and we on
the polymer team like them as well but
we were faced with a question how do we
make mocha chai and sit on GS worked the
best with web components and polymer we
tried a number of tools out there but in
the end we decided that we really needed
to make our own and we did just that and
made web component tester or WCT for
short now we had a few requirements for
WCT that no other tool would really seem
to give us
obviously the first requirement was at
mocha chai and sonship Jess should just
be loaded by default we also add a few
testing helpers that I'll get into a
little bit later another requirement is
that we wanted to write our tests the
same way we write our elements with HTML
and JavaScript together in addition we
wanted to test our elements using the
same dependency mechanism that we have
for writing our elements which is HTML
imports and finally we want it to be
able to run our tests both in the
browser and via a command-line tool so
why don't we take a little deep dive and
see how WCT works here is the test
runner page for our paper checkbox
element and here is where we specify the
sweets we want to run you can see that
we actually specify the same suite twice
albeit slightly differently the second
line means that we want to run that
suite with native shadow Dom enabled and
this is to make sure that paper check
box works correctly both in the polyfill
and native shadow Dom implementations
all right why we take a look at what
that basic suite contains but first we
have to load our dependencies we load
the web components polyfills WCT we load
mock interactions which is a testing
helper I'll get to in a little bit
and finally we load paper checkbox here
we go a little test from the paper
checkbox sweet we have mochas sweet and
test functions here we have a chai
assertion with a checkbox being checked
and finally we have these two parts that
probably don't look very familiar but
they're part of the testing helpers that
we load with WCT the first one test
fixture is an element wrapper that
integrates with mocha sweets to easily
produce and remove testing elements from
the document you can put your
complicated testing like this example
from paper-checkbox
inside of a test fixture element to
create the elements then you can test
them
automatically at the end of the test
they'll be removed from the page maka
directions is another helper that lets
you easily mock user input with an
understandable API you can mock Mouse
events touch events keyboard events
focus changes and you can use it
whenever you have a test that requires
user input to modify properties or fire
an event now the last WCG add-on I want
to talk about is the accessibility suite
by using Chrome's accessibility
developer tools you can automatically
test some baseline accessibility for
your element like making sure labels are
readable for those of color color vision
deficiency or that the re attributes are
set correctly for screen readers now you
can use the accessibility suite by
specifying a text test fixture and
calling the a love my suite function
with that test fixture and this will do
all the work for you and give you a
detailed report in your testing now I
remember that I said you can use WCT via
the command line the WCT command will
use selenium to automatically open all
the browser's on your machine run the
tests and report the results back in
addition if you use the sauce labs
plugin which I'll mention a little bit
later you can test all of your supported
browsers and operating systems from one
command all right that was a lot of
stuff but we can mark miuna testing
complete because now we can talk about
continuous integration continuous
integration takes all the linting and
unit testing tools that we just talked
about and runs them on every commit to
your code repository automatically there
are a lot of options out there when it
comes to continuous integration services
and I really don't have time to go into
all of them but I can talk about Travis
CI which the polymer team uses for a few
simple reasons first and foremost Travis
CI easily integrates we get up there's
no complicated strings to copy back and
forth through keys to remember just a
button on the Travis CI settings page
and testing is now enabled for your
repository
additionally Travis is free for open
source and this makes it an easy choice
if you publish your element code to get
out
like we do on the polymer team alright
now that I've told you about Travis CI
how about I show you how to configure it
for your helmet here is a sample
Travis configuration for a polymer
element that combines all of our testing
use this part here to make sure our VM
is up-to-date and Carano Jess next we
install it Firefox and Chrome then we
install Bower web component tester
yes lint and poly when we install our
Bower dependencies run our linters and
assuming the linting was successful we
tell Travis to spin up the display
server and run WCT if anything fits
testing Travis will mark the run is
failed and send an email to the author
of the commitment now with Travis CI
watching you can be sure no untested
code ever hits the repository but
there's one last trick with Travis CI
and WCT remember I mentioned sauce labs
earlier Travis CI can keep an encrypted
copy of your sauce labs credentials and
give those WCT to test all of your
supported browsers on every commit
alright we're done with continuous
integration now that was a lot of stuff
to cover but you all remember it right
well neither do i setting up a robust
testing tool chain is super complicated
there's a bunch of tools and
configurations spread out across a
hundred elements and we on polymer team
feel that pain because we have to
maintain over 100 elements and the tools
to make those elements production-ready
so we made sure that the testing process
is just as reusable as our elements
refer back to our example element
paper-checkbox 90% of the testing
configuration in that element is a copy
and paste into your own element and now
your element can reuse all the same
linking unit testing and continuous
integration tools that we use in our
elements and now your elements will be
just as production ready and reusable as
the polar teams elements and when your
elements are reusable
that saves you time and money on
building your applications alright
that's it for me if you want to learn
more about improving your elements come
find me at the after party thanks
everyone and have a great time at the
