the show
so in the last episode we were talking
about focus and what it means for
elements to be implicitly focusable and
inserted into the tab order now whenever
possible if you're building a custom
control you want to try and use the
native elements if you can because
you're going to get all that sort of
cool focused behavior essentially for
free but I realized there are times when
you're building something that is unique
and maybe doesn't have a native analog
in the browser so you got to go kind of
off-road and build your own custom
control and perhaps add your own
keyboard support now to do something
like that the first thing you're gonna
need to do is make sure that elements
focusable and to do that we're gonna use
the tabindex attribute so follow me over
here to my editor what I've done is I've
set up a little example here using a few
divs and a button element if you recall
from the last episode the button element
is an interactive control so it's
implicitly focusable automatically
insert it in the tab order whereas those
divs just being you know generic content
containers there's no reason for them to
be in the tab order and so if we look at
our output here and I go and I press the
tab key you'll see the only thing that
receives focus is the button at the
bottom of the page so let's change this
now let's imagine that we're trying to
make you know some some cool interactive
controls out of some of these dips I'll
leave this first one just as is so it
can serve as kind of like a control but
for the second div here I want to insert
it into the natural tab order so the
user could reach it using either their
tab or their shift tab keys to do that
I'll give it a tab index value of 0 now
if I go to my output and I press tab
you'll see that focus immediately
travels to that first div and now if I
start pressing other keys on my keyboard
those keyboard events will be directed
at that element the other thing to note
about tab and x0 is that it means that
the element is also programmatically
focusable so I could call its focus
method in in JavaScript or something
like that and I would direct focus to it
that can be useful if you need to you
know send a user to a particular control
perhaps after they complete some action
or some event happens on your page now
for this next div here I've added the
message that it's not going to be in the
tap water but it will still be focusable
so to do that I'm going to give it a tab
index value of negative 1 so now you can
see here as I press tab
focus moves to that first element though
that had the tab an x value of zero I
press tab again and we skip over that
element right so it's not in the natural
tab order I can't reach it by pressing
the tab key on my keyboard but I can go
down here with this little piece of
JavaScript uncomment it and now you'll
see that focus directed to that element
because I'm query selecting it and I'm
calling its focus method so tabindex
negative one can be useful for
situations where maybe you need to
manage focus perhaps you have something
that perhaps you don't even want it to
be interactive but you just want to move
focus somewhere else in the page that
the user has an easier more efficient
tabbing experience or you can use it
when you need to perhaps temporarily
disable a custom interactive control so
if you have something that maybe still
has to be in the Dom but maybe needs to
be off-screen and you can send it to
tabindex negative one and that's
actually what that inert polyfill that
we were showing in the previous episode
does under the hood it just sets all its
children did you have an X negative one
now the last example I want to show here
is the ability to set something to a tab
index of greater than zero so for this
last div I'll set it equal to a tab and
X value of like five or something like
that so I'm gonna go and in our output
mode in jsbin now there's nothing
interfering with my tab order I can
press tab and you'll see that it first
focuses that element that has tabindex
five I press tab again it focuses that
element has to have an X zero and press
tab again and then it goes down to that
button that was implicitly focusable so
what is going on there well a tab index
value of greater than zero means that
that element will be jumped ahead of
everything else in the natural tab order
the way it works is it starts at the
value that is lowest that is greater
than zero and kind of counts its way up
why would you want to use this well in
general you actually probably don't want
to use this at a man X value of greater
than zero is kind of considered an
anti-pattern and the reason is because
if you have a bunch of different
components on your page all with
different tab index values that are
greater than zero your focus order is
just going to kind of bounce around like
a pinball it might not make a lot of
sense to your users furthermore for your
users who use a screen reader a screen
reader navigates the Dom in a linear
fashion so you really don't have any
guarantee that those users are going to
necessarily land on those higher tab
index controls before something else in
the dock
so the general best practice if you want
something to be higher in the tab order
you should just move it earlier in the
Dom now that about covers it for today I
just wanted to go ahead and sort of set
a baseline for how tabindex works so
that can set us up in the next episode
so we can actually start exploring how
we can build some custom components that
use different tabindex design patterns
if you have any questions about what we
talked about today as always you can
leave them for me down in the comments
or you can ping me on a social network
of your choosing
as always I'm Rob and thanks for
