PAUL: How are we doing?
Are we all good?
Hello.
Hi, yeah.
Welcome to the fireside chat
about progressive webapps.
I'm Paul, and this is the
panel that we have here.
So what I'm going to do
first is introduce them,
and then I'll just explain
what it is we're going to do.
So I've got Dion
Almaer right here,
who's engineering
director from Web Dev Rel.
To his left, Jake Archibald,
developer advocate.
I could be so much ruder, but.
Oh, it's taking so much effort.
Immediately to his left,
Dimitri Glazkov, who's
a software engineer on Chrome.
And then it's Alex Komarovsky,
who is group product
manager on Chrome.
Who's next.
Owen Campbell-Moore to his left.
There we are.
Product manager.
Adrienne Porter Felt, who's a
software engineer on Chrome.
And then last but not least,
Alex Russell, also a software
engineer on Chrome.
Now, so we're talking
progressive web apps.
And if you've got any
questions during this,
there are microphones
to either side.
Please do use them.
Please come up and
ask your questions,
but do use the microphones
because it means that they
get it for the recording.
So that'd be great.
But we also put out
questions on to Twitter,
and Slack and so forth.
We're going to probably
start with some of those.
Also on the screen, you can see
URLs for pinging @chromiumdev,
and the Slack and so on.
So you can also ask questions
during this that way,
and they'll make their way to
me via the power of Google Docs.
OK so, the first question
that we got through,
which is going to go to
Jake, I think, how should I
build a progressive web
app when Safari doesn't
support Service Workers.

JAKE ARCHIBALD: You should
use progressive enhancement.
Is that the correct answer?
Yes.
PAUL: You're looking
at me like I'm somehow
responsible for the question.
I mean this came in.
You know, seriously, though.
Come on.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, so I
think progressive enhancement's
the right thing to do here.
When you first load a
page, even on a browser
that supports service
worker, that first load
is going to happen before
the service worker installs
and activates.
So you can make a site
depend on Service Worker,
but we designed it so you have
to jump through hoops in order
to do that.
And if you do jump
through those hoops,
you know, I might try and
find you and kill you,
because I'm a true believer
in the whole progressive
enhancement thing.
ALEX RUSSELL: Are you
threatening bodily violence
on a panel?
[LAUGH]
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But
once in a crowd.

So when you start enhancing
with Service Worker
and things start loading
faster in the browsers that
do support Service Worker,
which is at the moment
Firefox, and Chrome, and Opera,
then that becomes good evidence
for the browsers
that don't support
Service Worker to
start implementing it,
or to make their
implementation faster.
What I'm saying is, you
have the control here
over the future of
the Extensible Web.
PAUL: But there is a sense
in which a lot of the things
that people look to from
a progressive web app,
they do rely on a
Service Worker, right?
I mean, this is
what people are--
it kind of feels like, right?
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, we
survived for a long time
without Service Workers, and
the web was still usable.
So being able to add
these features in
to get more engagement, I
think that's a great thing.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: I think, too,
the progressive enhancements
is so important that we
made it part of the name.
So that just gives an
emphasis on how much
we think it's
central to the idea.
In fact, we just published
a case of it yesterday.
AliExpress, which is a company
that is an e-commerce company,
they built a progressive
web app, and in doing so
they also invested in
improving their mobile website.
And they actually
saw a lift of, I
think 82% in the conversions
they saw on mobile Safari
as well.
So the idea is that by
investing in your mobile website
is always a good idea.
It just so happens
that in browsers
that support Service
Workers, that experience
will be super charged.
So I think it's really
quite compatible, actually.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
we saw this already
with things like the
Facebook website.
Their website has
been there for years,
and then they've added Service
Worker in as an enhancement,
and now you get the push
notifications and hopefully
soon, some kind of
offline first experience.
And now they're seeing
more usage-- users
grow because of that.
I mean, I don't
know the figures,
but I know it's
definitely from one user.
I use the website rather
than the native app
now, because of that.
Because it does everything
I need it to do.
PAUL: All right,
let's move it on.
Oh this is a good one.
How did progressive
web apps work with AMP.
That'll be, I
guess Alex Russell.
ALEX RUSSELL: Without which?
PAUL: With AMP.
AMP.
With AMP.
ALEX RUSSELL: With AMP?
Oh yeah.
So for those who haven't
seen the sessions,
AMP is a web component
dialect for making
very, very fast loading pages.
Usually articles,
content articles.
But AMP has a validator,
which means that you
can't run your own scripts.
You can only run AMP
scripts, which is
how AMP continues to stay fast.
That's why AMP
files generally work
so well, is that the
validator keeps you
from running your own
or third party scripts.
So this seems incompatible
with Service Workers,
which require you to
register a Service Worker.
The good news is that the AMP
team has built an AMP install
Service Worker element.
And that element is
something that you
can use on your AMP pages.
So from there, once you have
the Service Worker installed
and running on your site,
you can intercept navigations
like you normally would
to serve up an app shell,
and that can be an AMP viewer.
So you can keep
the same content,
while upgrading from a
relatively bare bones,
but super lightweight AMP
experience on first load,
to getting that richer,
more immersive, more
engaging second, third, fourth
experience out of the gates,
very quickly, once the
Service Worker is there.
And again, it does the
progressive enhancement thing.
Because you start with a totally
valid, completely workable AMP
document, which is a
great way to read content.
So AMP is a starting point,
adding Service Worker
and then layering
in your app shell
later for a custom
behavior for richer stuff.
Once you know that you've got
that cached in the Service
Worker and you don't have
to wait on the network
to get that more
immersive behavior,
I think is this golden path.
I think that's a
great way to go.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: In fact, you've
got a talk about this tomorrow,
right?
ALEX RUSSELL: I've
got a talk that
outlines what The Washington
Post did tomorrow,
and we'll be talking
about this extra sort
of additional opportunity
at the end, yeah.
DION ALMAER: Did you guys
see the &quot;Washington Post&quot;
progressive web app with
AMP demo that was today?
Yes, I think that really
shows off the experience.
And you know, Alex, you talk
about how progressive web
apps are just web experiences
that take their vitamins.
I feel like AMP is like the
prescription medicine, where
it's like, hey, you guys,
you've screwed up for too long.
Here's a quick pill
that will help you,
but you may want to
change your lifestyle
and take some vitamins.
ALEX RUSSELL: A little
bit of exercise,
a little bit of
healthy eating, yeah.
DIMITRI GLAZKOV: The
interesting thing
that &quot;Washington Post&quot;
is just the beginning
of experimenting of how this
stuff fits together, right?
I mean, there is more, and
probably more interesting
integrations that
you can think of.
PAUL: Just to follow on, because
there is following question.
Again, I guess it'd
go to Alex, but,
is there a development
strategy which
allows you to have
that one code base that
will serve as both a
progressive web and AMP content,
and can you reuse
code and so forth?
ALEX RUSSELL: Yeah.
I think what I just outlined
basically is that strategy.
Where you catch your navigations
in the Service Worker
and serve up an app
shell, which has
that more advanced,
more customized,
slicker behavior, only for
the users who can support it.
Once you know that it's going
to be cheap or free, right?
Only when it's cached locally
inside the Service Worker's
caches, and you don't have
to go to the network for
It.
But all those URLs
should load nakedly
as regular AMP documents, and
you can move an entire site
to AMP today.
Have it on your Origin, have
it proxied out of the CDNs,
have it validate, and
that all works thanks
the AMP Service Worker element.
PAUL: All right, let's move on.
Question sounds
deceptively simple,
when does my website start
becoming a progressive web?
And the context here is, let's
say I just add push messaging.
Have I got a
progressive web app now?
Who would like to take that one?

JAKE ARCHIBALD: For me, and you
can feel free to correct me,
it's when Chrome will
start offering users
to add it to their home screen.
So it's the set of requirements
there, which is HTTPS.
It's having a Service Worker.
I think at the moment it's
just having a Service Worker,
but we're going to
tighten that to offering
some kind of offline
capable experience,
and having a manifest, so
all the icons are in there
and it's displayed stand alone.
So that the user can add
it to the home screen,
and it will look
like a native app.
And this is why we require an
offline capable experience,
because we want users to, when
they have a home screen icon
and they tap it and it
loads within Chrome,
we want to feel native for them.
And if the browser has to show
a default connection error
message, then that breaks
the native contract.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: The way I
think of progressive web apps
is actually as a
more general concept
that you want to reach towards.
Just like Ajax, it was
back in desktop web.
It wasn't like one of my Ajax,
like what does that mean?
You can always be
doing more and bring
a better experience that's more
in line with that golden ideal.
PAUL: And I think when Jake
mentioned Chrome there,
that doesn't mean only
when Chrome does it.
Of course lots of
browsers are supporting
all of these features.
ALEX RUSSELL: So on
a technical level,
Chrome implements those
specific heuristics.
Other browsers may implement
different heuristics,
and you might imagine getting
progressive apps different
ways.
The fact that we have
this one prompt that
triggers at this one moment,
which from a user perspective
can feel a little bit
arbitrary, is basically
an implementation detail.
All the technology is very open.
It doesn't demand that browsers
create any specific UI.
So I expect to see
a lot of evolution,
actually, in how browsers
present the ability
and willingness to keep these
things to the local system,
and how you run them.
I expect that to change a lot.
You can imagine listing
these things in stores,
or having persistent
UIs that tell you
that, hey, this thing is a
progressive web app as opposed
to that occasional prompt.
Those are all possible
futures that other browsers
can explore.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: In
fact, we are also
exploring different
treatments for it,
and seeing other ways to improve
the treatment we've got today.
But I also want to
correct one thing, though.
I think a lot of people
think of progressive web app
as it doesn't count until
it's on your home screen.
And to me, that isn't
the be all, end all
that it is with, for
example, a native app where
it's the same thing.
And I think that users
can get value out of it
from push notifications,
or just from it
loading more quickly
when you come back to it.
And so, the fact
of the matter is,
not everyone's going to want
to add your thing to the home
screen.
And that's fine,
because you can still
create a really
meaningful experience
and add value for them.
And as you do so, maybe
over time they'll say,
you know what, you
are pretty cool.
Maybe I will add you
to my home screen.
ALEX RUSSELL:
Decoupling these was
sort of this thing
where we had to give it
a name at some point, because
they added up to an experience,
but the goal was an
experience for the user,
and not a particular
bundle of things
you had to have all at once.
Like the native
app model of having
to go through a particular
huge transition,
a big phase change, a big
step, to get to the moment
where you can do all this
stuff, because you said yes
to it all at once.
That's pretty tough from a
user experience perspective,
and so we want to make
them more a la carte.
And the fact that they
add up to that ability,
that moment where
you can get added
to the homes screen,
or that moment
where you can ask for
push notifications.
That's just the strength of
the web being more a la carte.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: What you're
talking about before,
being able to have some kind of
store or place to find these,
I think that's
really interesting.
I think that's something I would
like to see Google take on,
is to create some kind of
engine for searching content
on the web, and somehow
users can find these.
ALEX RUSSELL: That
sounds really hard.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It feels like
a space we should get into.
PAUL: So Jake, since you
started talking again.
There is a follow on.
Because you mentioned
that offline's
a thing, and actually,
Alex, you kind of
mentioned that it's
about the experience,
not necessarily
checking all the boxes.
Why is it then that
app cache isn't
valid as part of
the requirements
list for a progressive web app?
ALEX RUSSELL: So, I've
had a lot of questions
from internal teams in the
last couple of months about why
isn't app cache good enough.
And so I wrote a document,
which I haven't shared publicly,
for obvious reasons, called
&quot;App Cache In Your Architecture,
Not Even Once.&quot;
And the TL;DR of this
document was basically,
you start with the
best of intentions,
and app cache's design decisions
cause you, at every moment,
to contort yourself ever further
away from the experience you
wanted to deliver.
And before you know it, you've
centralized on a single URL,
and you've decided that you're
going to do hash navigations
and not push state.
And that you're going to
do offline only, and not
reliable performance.
That you're going to give up
on a bunch of the experience
differences that
you're really trying
to affect, to get to
something that app cache
will allow you to do.
And so I think it's worth
sort of understanding where
the endpoint of that journey
is, and then deciding
that that's not something
we should buy into.
It isn't that app cache
is bad technology,
it's just that it's not designed
to build reliable performance.
It's designed to give
you special case offline.
And special case
offline kind of isn't
worth having, because offline
is very much a special case.
You're only in an offline
mode very occasionally.
When you sell your phone
into an offline state
or when the navigation
finally fails.
But you're on a flaky connection
basically all the time.
And so handling the
flaky connection
and getting reliable
performance is the goal.
That's the user experience
win, and confusing the two
doesn't really work.
Doesn't help anybody.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Plus we keep
finding horrible security
things in app cache spec.
ALEX RUSSELL: Oh yeah,
and we're taking it off
of HTTP, by the way.
Yeah.
So you just BS, though.
Kind of terrified.
PAUL: OK let's move on--
DION ALMAER: One thing.
PAUL: OK.
DION ALMAER: A lot
of people spend
a lot of time trying
to make app cache work,
and went through
all of this pain.
ALEX RUSSELL:
Jake, for instance.
DION ALMAER: Yes, this guy,
but lots of other people.
And so, we did release just
the beginning of a library
today or yesterday that
tries to kind of say,
if you've done all of
this work to generate
these manifests and all that.
Like, that's a lot
of work, so here's
a path to make that work
with Service Workers.
And then again,
hopefully, you then
kind of move off over time.
So if you do have app
cache working now,
we're trying to make that
pain go away a little bit.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And it
doesn't have the security bugs
that app cache does,
so, safe to use.
PAUL: OK, the next question
is a security related one,
I suppose.
Will we ever get
signed or trusted
progressive web apps with
the same security properties
and the privileged
APIs of Chrome apps.
I guess, Adrienne, do you
want to take that one?
ADRIENNE PORTER FELT:
Yeah, that's actually
a very interesting question.
I've heard a lot of
developers asking when will we
get specific APIs that I really
like from the Chrome apps
platform.
And the answer is that we
want to keep the web open so
that you click on any
link, and you as a user
don't have to be
afraid of what's
going to happen when
you click on that link.
And so for that reason,
we're taking a very reasoned
and measured approach when we
look at the different APIs that
can be adopted by the web.
I don't think that signing
and packaging are necessarily
the distinction here, rather,
it's the discovery mechanism.
Is that you're
getting to a website
just by clicking on a
link, you don't necessarily
know where you're going.
And we want it to just
begin working immediately.
So our approach has been
runtime permissions for the web,
where we try to
first of all, design
APIs to be safe by default,
and then have permissions,
where users can opt
in to experiences
that might potentially have
some amount of security risk.
Though again, our
first aim is to do
through designing the APIs that
there are no major security
risks, with any APIs.
And this takes time, and we
have to think very carefully
about which APIs we release.
So in the long run, I'd
like for most APIs-- many
of the cool things that you
could do in Chrome apps,
to be available to
the web, but it's not
going to happen overnight,
because we have to make sure
that the security experience
for each one is done correctly.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: I think it's
a really important broader
point, too.
The web strength
is low friction,
the ability to
just tap that link
and get to another experience.
That's one of the
things that enables
so many really cool
business models and so
many interesting diverse
things on the web.
And it's not like we all
woke up one day and said,
you know what, it would be
great if by tapping on a link
we could load it immediately
without an interstitial.
That's part of the design
from the very beginning.
It's been very
meticulously managed
and evolved and strengthened
over the past 20 years.
It's something that's
fundamental to why
the web is so successful.
PAUL: OK.
Don't forget you can come
up to the microphones
and ask your questions
if you got them,
but there's an interesting one
that's come in on the Twitters.
Android Instant apps,
brackets, no need to install,
versus progressive web apps.
How slash where do you
see each being used.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: Cage match.
PAUL: Round one, fight.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: In all
seriousness, though,
of course, Google, I think
we're a large company we always
want to make sure
that developers
are successful in whatever
platforms they choose.
The way that I think about it
is, the web has historically
had this really low
friction, which I
conveniently just talked about.
That's very important to this
awesome, diverse ecosystem.
But it's also had
low capabilities.
And if you look at
native apps, those
have historically had very
high capabilities, but also
very high friction, in part
due to those capabilities.
So progressive web apps has
been a multi-year effort working
with standards, working
with other browser vendors,
to design these APIs very
carefully to maintain and allow
us to responsibly bring these
capabilities to the web.
And I think that Instant
Apps is the same kind
of multi-year journey to
bring the lower friction
to native apps as well.
So I think that really cool demo
that we all saw in the keynote
is something that's like, an
aspirational goal to get to.
I think will be a
really cool place.
Now, one of the reasons I
love progressive web apps
is because it's
just web technology.
We've been using this
stuff for many, many years,
it's been evolving
all the time, and you
can deploy these things today.
In fact, we published seven
additional case studies
from businesses around the
world, Indonesia, India,
Africa, many other
places, just yesterday,
showing business is
having really, really,
really strong business metrics
by adopting these technologies.
And that, to me, is one thing
that's so cool about it.
It's cross-browser, it's
cross-platform, even,
because we've seen lift
in conversion rates
on iOS, for people
who invest in web.
This is something that works
on standards with other browser
vendors as well.
And you can use it today.
That's why I think progressive
web apps is pretty cool.
PAUL: In terms of choosing
one of the other, if I
had to push you on
one, on the basis
that people have to make the
decision, often internally,
to their own businesses.
They have to kind of go,
which way are we going to go.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think
the way you would choose
is do you stop at
java, or do you
add the script on to the end?
[LAUGH]
PAUL: OK.
DION ALMAER: I think
one piece of that
is what is instant apps really
going to be like, right?
A lot of people coming
up to me and saying,
oh, so I saw this
demo, I tap on a link.
I'm into this full experience.
I can buy things
right away, there's
access to all of my payment
information, that's amazing.
And really scary from
a security plan point,
has all access to all of his
background-- wait a minute,
how does that work?
Obviously, there wasn't
enough time in the keynote
to go into all the details of,
you know, here's the sandbox,
here's how things will work.
So I don't think it's as black
and white as, oh, instant apps
is, you just do
this native app that
has full capabilities versus the
web that has this poor sandbox.
It's like Alex was saying
where that sandbox has been
a huge advantage
for us, and I think
it's fair game for Android to
come in and go after the things
that we're awesome
at, and I think
it's fair game for us to go
after all of the things that
are good on native platforms.
PAUL: Super.

Why is add to home screen
not on desktop Chrome?
It seems like a big
potential market.
That would be Alex
Komarovsky, I think.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY:
OK, so one thing
I'm actually interested in is,
who here would be as interested
in that, if we were to ship it?
PAUL: But there's hands.
There's definite hands.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: There are.
There are definitely
hands, I can confirm.
Very interesting.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Three hands.

ALEX KOMAROVSKY: So,
we've focused primarily
on the add to home screen
behavior on mobile,
primarily because it was
so simple to reason about
from the user perspective.
People are very used to,
on mobile, you tap a thing,
it goes full screen,
they get how that works.
It's on their home
screen, that's
where you find all this stuff.
And frankly, by the
way, we actually
aren't happy with
the behavior today.
We see that as a first step
that we're going to constantly
be trying to evolve, so
that users, once, they
add it to their
home screen, they
can kind of forget about the
fact that it's a website.
Because right now, there's
actually a number of tells.
I think that some other
questions about that as well.
And so if you look
at desktop, it's
actually much harder to imagine,
what precisely does that mean?
When you tap it, does it load
a window with no URL bars?
Does it load a
different thing that
appears to be a different app?
Is it just another
tab within Chrome?
Is it a desktop icon?
Does it show up in the dock?
Is it in the start menu?
There's a lot more
questions to reason through.
And we're always looking
for the developers
to give us more, to tell
us about these use cases.
The things that you
want to accomplish,
to help us design this in a way
that makes sense for our users,
without complicating
the product.
Because obviously, with Chrome,
it's all about simplicity.
One of our key tenets.
We want to make sure that
we don't overcomplicate
the product, just for this kind
of uncanny valley thing that
doesn't really make any sense.
This is something we
definitely want to do,
we just want to make
sure we do it right.
OWEN CAMPBELL-MOORE: Yeah,
so just to add to that.
I definitely think
that that's right,
so if you have thoughts about
this, come and chat to us.
Tweet at us.
We'd love to talk more about it.
We've been actively going
out and talking to developers
to find out what they would
need to make this successful.
I also want to give a
shout out, while we're
talking about it,
to the Electron
project that the guys over at
GitHub have been working on.
So this is what powers
the Atom text editor,
and a bunch of-- people are
building desktop applications
using web technology.
I think it's really cool
that you can actually
take a progressive web
app using Service Workers,
and you can wrap it in Electron,
which is essentially Chromium,
and you can
essentially just point
that at your progressive web app
and give someone a little file
to install.
And then you can give
them that experience,
and you have full control over
the UI around the browser,
and you can add extra bits
with additional APIs they have.
So we're kind of watching
what's going on there.
We're looking to see how
Electron evolves and how
what developers need
evolve, and trying
to work out how we can
handle the complexity of how
to fit it into the existing
product at the same time.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's been
really satisfying to see
with that kind of base layer
there, the Chromium, Electron
thing, to be able to
become a native app.
To see apps being able to
compete on different things
and that-- you say Atom, but
it's also Visual Studio Code,
and to see them competing
on a different feature set.
But most of it's been
sort of dealt with,
so they're able to build
that stuff really quickly.
That's really satisfying to see.
OWEN CAMPBELL-MOORE:
One last funny anecdote.
I was thinking recently about
why web browsers are great,
why different operating system
window management is great.
It's funny.
So we did a little
user study, where
we got-- interestingly, we
should have mentioned this.
There's a prototype of this
implemented in Chrome today,
if you go in about flags.
There's a flag.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: It's actually
on by default in Chrome OS,
I believe.
OWEN CAMPBELL-MOORE: It's
on by default, that's right.
So we do have add to shelf
prompting on Chrome OS,
and we have it supported on
Windows and OS X behind a flag.
So you can go in
and try that out.
I think it's called
add to shelf in there.
And so it's funny, that we
did some user studies recently
where we brought in
some users and we
asked them to try
this experience
and got their feedback on it.
And one of the
things that came up
was, wouldn't be great if
operating systems had tabs
so I could have all of
my different windows.
And so, anyway, I think you have
to think about the benefits.
Window management
is complicated,
and we have to think
about it very carefully.
DION ALMAER: I also
always love to-- when
I talk to someone who is
kind of anti-web or whatever,
and they're like, yeah, I mean,
you could never use a web app.
It's not good
enough, the quality.
I notice you're running Slack
there, how do you like Slack.
Oh, it's great, it's fantastic.
You're using Atom, using
visual code, all of that.
Oh, OK, next.
OWEN CAMPBELL-MOORE: The
subtext there, in case anyone
doesn't know-- so Slack
uses the Electron project,
and it's essentially their
web version using the Electron
shell.
And you can build these things
that work offline and do
the native like experiences,
using the same one
codebase that you do on the
web for the native experience
on desktop as well.
PAUL: OK, before anybody
else on this panel
goes, just one more thing,
I've just got something to add.
OWEN CAMPBELL-MOORE: Sorry.
PAUL: I'm going to roll
it to the next question.
If San Francisco doesn't pay
attention to progressive web
apps and focuses
solely on iOS apps,
will Google abandon
[INAUDIBLE] in four years.
I like there's a very
specific timeline.
DION ALMAER: And San Francisco.
PAUL: And it's
only San Francisco.
I mean, I'd like to broaden
it to a least Silicon Valley
and the rest, but all the same,
there is this obviously implied
question, I suppose.
What is the metric for
success here, I suppose.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY:
So, first of all,
by any reasonable
metric of success,
we are blown away with
all the amazing stuff
we've been seeing happening.
Last week, there was a case
study for a company called
Selio, I believe.
I had not heard of
the company before.
They had a presentation,
talking about how
to do progressive web app.
Now they had amazing stats.
That's amazing to see that kind
of self-sustaining and organic
momentum going on.
I check the stats every morning.
We see a very, very,
very healthy growth
across all these
different areas.
So we're very, very happy
with how this is going.
But I think also,
at this point, we've
shipped these technologies.
Other browser vendors
are also working
to ship Service
Workers and others.
So like--
ALEX RUSSELL: Samsung has
shipped progressive app support
in their S browser entirely,
including push notifications.
Firefox has shipped
push notifications.
Microsoft is implementing
Service Worker.
I mean.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY:
So obviously, we
plan to continue
investing a ton here.
I mean, this the first step.
But even if it
weren't, I mean, that's
the cool thing about the web.
We have all these
other browser vendors,
also pushing, also innovating,
trying different UIs for this.
Which I think is one of
the strengths of the web.
DION ALMAER: I think another
thing is, sometimes people come
in, oh you got the best job.
You get to work on the
web, you love the web.
You can be this hippie
guy that floats around San
Francisco and Silicon Valley.
PAUL: Why do you point
at me when you do that?
DION ALMAER: Hippie
bald guy, I mean.
But then, I also kind of-- I
think it's actually important
that people understand this.
And it's kind of obvious
and people know it,
but we make money on the web.
It's like, we're
not just altruistic.
We may be altruistic a little
bit, and we love the web,
but Google makes
money on the web.
So it would be kind of
weird to destroy the web.
DIMITRI GLAZKOV:
Might be bad, yeah.
The other thing is the
San Francisco thing really
rubs me the wrong way.
Because actually, most
of the success we see
is like in India and Indonesia
and like the countries that
actually feel the
pain of installing--
or the barrier of the
installing native apps.
Because it takes a
long time to download,
and it's much easier to just
click and get something fast.
ALEX RUSSELL: Well I think the
question might be motivated
between the disconnect
between the success
that we're seeing
specifically in emerging
markets with
progressive web apps,
and the sort of prevalent
tech culture here, which
sort of-- it's literally
privileged in every way
I can think of.
And that privilege sort
of blinds us to the fact
that, for most people, the
dominant technology that we've
shipped on mobile
operating systems basically
doesn't work for the
next billion users.
It just basically doesn't work.
And as a result, we have
to do something different.
And progressive web apps
are succeeding because it
is that something different.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: Yeah.
I've been blown away.
We talk to a ton of developers
in India, and Indonesia,
and many other places, and just
blown away by the amazing stuff
they're doing.
I think to some extent,
it's like, come on,
like Silicon Valley,
get together.
What are you all doing, right?
It's we're seeing
some of the people
pushing the forefront the
stuff around the world.
ALEX RUSSELL: I mean, the
AliExpress team-- you've
got to go try this on a phone.
Go try AliExpress or Selio.
I mean, these are--
or Flipkart, right.
These are incredible
experiences that
are making people real
money, and they're
making the people
real money in places
where it's hard to do that.
I think what you didn't mention
about the Selio slide deck that
was going around
Twitter last week
was that the number
specifically that they showed,
the one that got me was
they had similar engagement
between their native app and
their progressive web app
version of the same experience.
But their user acquisition
costs were 1/10
with the progressive web app.
That literally changed the
trajectory of your business.
What are you doing?
You're not doing that right?
Do How do your numbers add up if
you haven't made a progress web
app that can do that for you?
PAUL: All right, let's-- we
have a question from the floor.
Don't go on too
long, because I've
got candies I can throw at
you, if you-- go for it.
AUDIENCE: Progressive web apps
sound like quite a unicorn.
I'm wondering if there
are use cases where
it's maybe not the correct
approach to take, or do you all
foresee Service Workers becoming
as ubiquitous as JavaScript
CSS, and HTML.
PAUL: Terrific.
Thank you.
Who wants to take-- Jake
wants to take that one.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, so-- if
you saw my talk earlier, sorry,
I'm going to repeat some things.
If you look at the IO web
app, and a lot of sites that
use Service Workers
to work offline,
they tend to show a
little banner saying,
everything is cached, this
will work offline now.
And I think it's cool.
I think it's great
that these sites are
bragging about that, because
there's not a lot of user trust
there.
But I hope one day,
that that starts
looking like those little badges
we used to put on our sites
like, this is made with CSS
2.1, and how ridiculous that
looks now.
And I hope one day
when a site's like, I
work offline, you're like,
yeah, well done, it's the web.
It's supposed to be like that.
PAUL: I'm going to just remove
a banner from my website, so.
[LAUGH]
Awkward.
OWEN CAMPBELL-MOORE:
So I have a secret hope
here, which is-- so
Service Worker is
a very powerful primitive,
is how I think about it.
And I actually expect that
most web developers won't
be using it even directly.
So there's this great library
called Service Worker Toolbox,
which a lot of big companies
are using as their abstraction.
Because that's
really what you want
when interacting
with Service Worker.
And so I would expect to
see this to go further,
where we get to a point where
if you're using a big framework,
you're using your
Polymer, your React,
or whatever you're using.
Or if you're building a website,
the tools that you're using
have caching, and they have
Service Worker built in.
So when you start building a web
app with any of these systems,
you start with this offline,
and high performance.
So building into the tools, and
open source projects, I think,
is going to be key.

ALEX RUSSELL: In fact, I
think the Polymer team just
showed this purple pattern.
If you didn't see
the talk earlier,
I recommend you go find
Taylor Savage's talk.
But their pattern
also comes with a CLI
that does exactly this.
It generates Service Worker
assets for you, based
on the routes that you provide.
And it gives you that
precaching, pretty immediately.
So that stuff is
coming very quickly,
and it's exciting to see.

PAUL: Okey doke.
OK, let's have a look.
Ooh, Dimitri.
My site loads in less than
a second, but then ads.
What can I do about
poorly performing ads.
DIMITRI GLAZKOV: Why don't
you just get rid of adds?

DION ALMAER: Also
make our money, then.
DIMITRI GLAZKOV: Well,
it's a tough question.
Ads are a part of the
ecosystem of the web.
This is where a lot of
publishers make their money
and make their living,
and figuring out
how to fit this into
a healthy website
sometimes is very challenging.
And most of the time, this comes
together at the last moment.
When you built your
website, polished it,
it looks really good.
And then you've added those
scripts, tags, or things,
and suddenly everything goes to
terrible, terrible performance
hole.
And I think we as
a web platform,
as Chrome the browser, do
have certain responsibility
to protect the user and
act on the user's behalf,
in some cases.
And we're actually actively
exploring this field
and trying to make sure that
the most egregious cases where
the ads truly either don't know
what they're doing or doing
something that they
shouldn't be doing
are prevented and
are not happening.
And so that the user still
gets good experience.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY:
So when one pattern
we see a lot when we look
at real world websites that
have jank, or what have
you, is you look at it,
and it's like, why is
this simple page janking
when it's scrolling.
And there's like 12
analytic scripts in there,
there's like four
different ad tags,
and they're all trying
to calculate viewability
at different elements, all
at the worst possible time,
and scroll events.
Actually Raul
showed in his-- what
do they call it, keynote, what's
the-- state of the union, state
of the union, yeah, today.
Passive event listeners,
which actually
makes a really big difference,
because it allows you to say,
hey browser, I'm never
going to cancel this scroll.
Just using it as a convenient
time to run this calculation,
and that makes a
huge difference.
DIMITRI GLAZKOV:
In a lot of cases,
we are quick to blame
ads and ad networks.
But our outreach and
just talking to them
shows that they're actually
actively interested in solving
this problem as well.
It does not make them
happy that people
hate ads, because it does not
work real well in the long run.
And so we've been
working with them
on some of the primitives,
like intersection
observer and passive
event listeners,
to effectively enable them to do
some things cheaply, instead of
clogging up the whole system.
PAUL: OK all good?
All right.

Let me see, other progressive
web apps in Google products.
If progressive web
apps are the answer,
why isn't Google Inbox
a progressive web app,
or any other Google
asset for that matter,
with the notable
exception of Air Horner.

[AIR HORN NOISE]
Actually, no, people get
silly about Air Horner,
but actually Air Horner is
really interesting to me.
Because it's like,
it does one thing,
and it does it really
well, and it's really fun.
And it actually does a
lot of the right things,
for sort of-- you just
search for Air Horner app,
and you find loads.
DIMITRI GLAZKOV: Really
simple user interface.
PAUL: My kids love it.
DION ALMAER: In a Google Doodle,
Air Horner on the Google logo.
That's what we'll need.
What's interesting
about this one,
though, it's a dangerous
question to ask.
Because we get to dog
food the next versions
of all of the Google products.
So I may make a
mistake, and be like,
I think Google Docs has
shipped all of this,
because I've seen these
push notifications.
Oh, no, no, no,
that's not right.
That's not public
yet, so we have
to be a little bit careful.

DIMITRI GLAZKOV: No comment.
[LAUGH]
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: Space is
thing, that's now-- I mean,
that's-- Space is a
progressive web app, right.
So they use a push notifications
and a bunch of other stuff.
And [INAUDIBLE] ship
caching, and Service Workers.
OWEN CAMPBELL-MOORE: Yeah,
there's-- the TL;DR is that
Service Workers are
great performance,
and that you build
really great things.
So naturally, you'll
be unsurprised
to know that Google teams
love performance and making
things faster.
And yet there's lots of active
investigations in this space,
and you will hear more
about some of them.
There are a few in live for
small fractions of users,
so if you're a
lucky user and you
start getting push
notifications,
or you start seeing the
site going really fast,
look for a Service Worker.
Tweet it if you find one.
There are a few of
these things out there.
Yeah, so go looking and
you'll start finding things.
DIMITRI GLAZKOV: You can
actually see it in Dev Tools.
PAUL: Sort of related to
that, since people are going
to be looking around
and being like, hey,
look, it looks like a
progressive web app.
Wouldn't it be
great, apparently,
if we has a-- I'm
saying apparently,
because I'm actually reading
somebody else's question,
it's not like I made it
up-- wouldn't be great
if we can have a progressive web
app store similar to the Play
store.
Pwa.rocks is there, but I'm
not sure how many people
know about it.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: I see
pwa.rocks as more of a,
at this point, just a
cool place to go to find
a bunch of great examples.
So if you don't
know, this is a site
maintained by Opera Dev Rel.
And a bunch of awesome
progressive web apps
are all listed there in
different categories.
It's a great go to
place, and so when
someone says, what's
a progressive web app,
well, here's a whole bunch.
But it's obviously
not the end goal.
One thing, I think,
is really interesting
about this question,
is the link is
like the super power of the
web, in the fact that you have
all these different
discovery mechanisms
and that someone can text you a
link, or they can email you it,
or you can find it
on the search engine.
That's the power of the web.
And in some ways,
actually, app stores
had to create stores, because
there was no other way
to find them.
And so although I
think there it's
definitely interesting space.
I'm interested to see
what happens here,
and I think there might
be some other stuff
that we could do here.
It's also one of
those things of like,
it's not like we're dying
without it at this point.
ALEX RUSSELL: I think there's an
interesting missing link here,
which is that if you go to
something like pwa.rocks,
you can't choose to keep
any of these directly.
There's no sort of-- you go to
the experience, and then boom,
there's a button you can
press to say install, or keep,
or whatever the action
is in the browser.
Like in Opera,
it's the star menu.
Or the plus menu.
In Chrome, it'll be
the thing that comes up
from the bottom, right, in
Firefox it'd be the thing that
comes up from the bottom.
So those are different
experiences that you can get,
but there's no
button you can press
that you know, hey, this thing
is a progressive web app.
I think that's an
area where browsers
need to innovate a little bit.
We need to make
it clear to users
when you're in one
of these experiences,
and that you can do
something about it.
But, I mean, the
technology is all there.
That's just a mere bit of UI.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: UI, that's
not very hard, right?
It should be very
straightforward.
ALEX RUSSELL: I'm not
a product manager, so.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: But
yes, we are very-- again,
at this point, even the
UI treatment in Chrome
we view as a V0.
Just as a first step to
enable some of these things.
And it's really
interesting watching
as people deploy these
things, and as they figure out
what the best
practices are for how
to reason about how
these fit with your app,
or with your desktop site.
It's going to be really
interesting to see how this all
evolves, I think.
I'm excited.
PAUL: Kind of behind the scenes,
I get a little bit of help
with things that are
kind of coming through,
as you might have guessed.
And I'm just a
little bit concerned,
because I've just got a question
that says, isn't airhorner.com
the best.
So I think my helper Paul
[? Killan ?] is finally
losing it, so give him a
bit of a hand after this.
Now, the next question
is around HTTP and HTTPS.
We've recently seen
the deprecation
of a bunch of features--
or, not deprecation,
but movement to HTTPS
for geolocation,
to get user media,
that kind of thing.
Should we be expecting any more
wise Service Worker on HTTPS
and all that kind of stuff?
ADRIENNE PORTER
FELT: Let me start
by explaining why are we
doing these deprecations.

The things that come
with progressive web
apps and other APIs
like geolocation,
they're all very
powerful privileges
that we're giving to websites.
And we want to be able to trust
websites with those privileges.
And the bare minimum
of trust is HTTPS.
Because that means
when the privilege is
given to your website, it's
given to your website, and not
your website and also all the
friendly people on the network.
This is also especially
important for a Service Worker,
where friendly
people on the network
could stay around
for a long time
after the user
leaves that network.
And they really are friendly
people on the network,
looking to enhance your
browsing experience.
So HTTPS really is important.
And we are trying
to make it easier,
and there are also lots
of other people trying
to make it easier.
Certificates are less expensive.
There's been huge gains made
in the areas of performance.
Many of the ad networks now
support primarily HTTPS,
or support a lot of HTTPS.
So I think there's been
huge gains in this area.
If you haven't seen
Emily Stark's talk, which
she gave yesterday,
she covers a lot
of this in detail, dealing
with HSTS, and redirects,
and performance, and
things like that.
I strongly encourage
you, go see it.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY:
And I think HBS is
the gateway to all
this new stuff,
and is without
question the future.
So if you're dragging
your feet, get on it.
ADRIENNE PORTER
FELT: And I forgot
one part, which is we do have
a few more deprecations coming.
Alex alluded to
app cache earlier,
and also long term we see
EME moving to HTTPS only.
We don't have specific
timelines that
are public yet, these are
medium to long term plans,
but if you rely on
either app cache or EME,
I do encourage you to start
the transition HTTPS now,
rather than after we make an
announcement with the timeline,
because it will be much easier
if you can start investing now,
when it's not an
emergency or a rush.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: Although
we will make sure that we
do this responsibly, so.
ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: Yes.

PAUL: Ooh, we have
another question, hello.
AUDIENCE: OK, so my
question is this.
There is a recent report saying
that a third, mostly a third
of the Android
users are browsing
the web through Facebook,
or web view, right?
Mostly Facebook.
So that's a challenge
for a progressive web
app, and Service Workers, and
having the app install banner.
So what are your
thoughts about that?
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: Well, one
thing we announced, is I
think, was that
Chrome Dev Summit,
or last year, I can't remember.
Chrome custom tabs,
designed specifically for--
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, But
Facebook is not using them.
Now, at least.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: -- but we are
seeing huge adoption numbers
for Chrome custom tabs.
It's just through the roof, from
many, many different providers.
Facebook really doesn't
use it at this point.
ALEX RUSSELL: Twitter does.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: Twitter does.
ALEX RUSSELL: Many
other search--
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: Basically,
everybody else, as far as
[INAUDIBLE]
ALEX RUSSELL: From
a user perspective,
you should understand that if
you don't see Chrome custom
tabs in an in-app browser, that
means that that application is
fundamentally insecure,
and that you should
go find the setting
in that application
to disable the in-app browser.
It's not OK to be loading
arbitrary content into a web
view.
It wasn't designed for that.
It isn't prepared
to handle that.
It isn't prepared
to handle the TLS
questions, the communication
with the user about what's
going on.
Not to mention any of
the feature questions,
about the features
that are missing.
So, that's bad.
And Facebook should
feel bad, actually.
They should feel bad.
So.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That is
one of the things that
terrifies me, in native apps, is
when what looks like a web view
but it might not
be, I don't know,
says do you want to log in?
I'm like, yeah,
I want to log in,
and then it shows me that
the Google login box,
and I'm like, I don't
know where this is.
I don't know where
this is going.
I don't know if it's secure.
I don't know if it's on
theevil.com or whatever.
I mean, that's why we
created the custom tabs.
PAUL: I like the term
insecure, because it
makes me wonder if
the web view really
is worried that people-- that
it doesn't display content
properly, and whether anybody
actually really likes it.
We have another floor question.
We have not too much longer
left, so let's go for it.
AUDIENCE: Mine's
just a short comment
to add to the HTTPS
comment, is Firebase
announce custom domains
and HPS support for free.
So you don't even have to
buy certificates or anything.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: Yay.

That's a [INAUDIBLE] as well.
PAUL: OK.
I'm thinking of using
Angular and or React.
Please don't make that an and.
[LAUGH]
And Ember.
And Polymer.
All of them in one.
I might have embellished.
Will that work for a
progressive web app?
Dimitri, would
you take this one?
DIMITRI GLAZKOV: Yes.
PAUL: Cool.

What, all of them will work
at once, or just individually?
DIMITRI GLAZKOV: Define work.
They will do a lot of work.
JAKE ARCHIBALD: If the
app is to turn your phone
into a personal heating
device, then it's
probably the right thing to do.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY:
In all seriousness,
I think a number
of progressive web
apps that have been
shipped today, I think,
have been using React.
Flipkart, for example,
is built with React.
There's a great talk
from Chrome Dev Summit
where some of the
Flipkart engineers--
I think we got one
tomorrow as well, that you
will be presenting at.
So you can definitely use React.
I think I've seen some
Angular stuff as well,
that talks about
progressive web apps, too.
So, the point is this is
not about which technology
you use to help
you build your app.
It's just about the fact
that it's a web app,
and there are lots of
different ways of doing it.
ALEX RUSSELL: Although
please make it fast.
ALEX KOMAROVSKY: Yes.

The truth is in the trace.
If you didn't see it on a
