unnatural environment for working on
code yeah and this one's gonna be on dev
tools so it's dev tools rain and boats
nothing synthetic about this in the
slices right so today we're talking
about responsive toolbar now for a while
dev tools we've had device mode which
has been useful for like building
responsive sites this is sort of an
evolution of that tooling so some of the
new things we've added our support for
this little toolbar that lets you toggle
between like different mobile sizes like
medium large tablet desktop but we've
also improved at device simulation so if
we switch over the nexus 5x for example
you now get a little bit of device
artwork from android showing on the top
and the bottom yeah and then they've
added an extra little drop-down where
you can then say you want port rope with
a navigation bar which is like Chrome's
URL bar but you can also do portrait and
landscape with keyboard as well which is
kind of nice especially weird a
life-form input just to see how it
renders nice little step up as well
that's kind of cool you also have a
drop-down for being able to say you know
how much of the viewport you want to
occupy for your actual device preview
and we've got this little menu with a
few extra options in here so one of the
things that you might have tried out
before is the show media queries option
super useful it basically like parses
out the media queries in your page and
you can just see what your page looks
like at different different media query
breakpoints I already have some be for
this because if you try and use it as is
after you selected a device it doesn't
nothing but if you go to the responsive
mode and drop down and then click on it
then it starts working what are you
talking about Matt it's all perfect it's
all perfect now it needs an issue okay
you file a bug on that um all the things
that we include in here include show
device pixel ratio so you can switch up
your device pixel ratio settings another
thing that I usually have on is network
throttling so if you're building to be
resilient against like really flaky
network conditions or life.i or anything
like that never controlling can be
useful to toggle on
usually you can have on like a good like
3G or 2g setting and that
means that when you're loading up your
page we're gonna throw little that
connection and it'll show up it'll load
up a little bit more slowly and it's
kind of nice just having that there
because otherwise you bury it in the
network thing is way too easy to leave
it on some random setting start looking
at the elements fixing other problems
it's nice just having it constantly
there in the responsive mode you can
also look let's say you're building an
app like a progressive web application
and you've got Service Worker support
you can also switch on offline to try
out your service we can just make sure
it's working well offline it would be
great if it was just like one button
might disable Internet yeah this is just
an airplane icon that's what you need
done folks
we're asking about Rula support so we've
got to show rulers option there wasn't
there before it's now back you can check
that out for you like rulers some of the
newer stuff that we've been playing with
are the ability to trigger Add to Home
screen so let's say you want to emulate
your web application manifest experience
you can click trigger adds a home screen
it'll bring up this message at the very
top that says you know add this site to
your shelf to use it anytime you can
click Add and they'll bring up a little
prompt - sighs okay well what do you
want to customize the name of this thing
- and the idea behind this is that it's
supposed to like just emulate the ads of
home screen experience you get on
Android yeah and it was kind of annoying
because before you'd have to do on your
phone you need something snail load the
manifest file and normally the reason
you'd want to do that is because if
there's a problem in your manifest file
and chrome wasn't happy it wouldn't pass
it and it's just tricky to debug so
having this like hard way of just saying
going download it and pass it is
insanely helpful when you just do it as
a reminder we also have another little
panel called sensors which lets you go
and emulate different sensors so like
you can emulate geolocation coordinates
the Vice orientation and you can decide
whether or not you want to emulate touch
based on your device or whether you want
to do force touch force enables the
that's about it for the responsive
toolbar and the new device moment yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
