chrome dev summit day 2 we're just
getting things underway for the
afternoon i'm here with Malcolm a
product manager from lift team I think
you actually kicked off the day this
morning talked a little bit about how
you guys built she's an amazing
progressive web app really lightning
fast can you kind of highlight what you
guys did and why I decided to build up a
pwa yeah sure we built our pwa actually
came out of a hackathon project you know
similar to how lifts came out of a
hackathon project for our original
company and product zimride our ride
lift project came out of hackathon
project and the reasons why we built it
you know number one we wanted to prove
that eight was even possible to build a
web app and possible because as lift is
a native mobile first company there's a
lot of skepticism as if you know can it
really match the performance and
usability and user experience of our iOS
and Android apps but more so the main
use cases were number one greater reach
so we want to be able to support
unsupported h out devices as we for
example you know eventually deprecated
older os's number to essentially reduce
friction so pushing users through an app
store is very very inefficient right so
being able to optimize on that and then
finally you know a little bit more on
faster deploys and experimentation so
certainly deploying code fixes
experiments a be testing on web takes
hours not weeks so I asked little bit
about that because you know I built a
few pw's myself certainly probably not
as large as as lift or you know an
application like that but like are you
guys iterating quickly like how do you
get the performance like there's some
really cool things you guys are doing in
the app yeah definitely I mean I think
our team worked on the Alpha roughly two
months it took us you know just a couple
engineers and we slowly built that team
up and we rebuilt the entire stack on
react to a beta version and that would
only took about one month really so
productivity was very very quick you
know we were able to do it a lot faster
and in fact four times faster than our
native usually moves and so from a
performance standpoint from a
Productivity standpoint timeline
perspective it was definitely you know
smoothly that's so awesome so one last
thing where can people actually try this
out yeah just go to ride lift calm and
check it out
would love your feedback it's very much
a very early preview of the beta but you
know there will be bugs so just reach
out to us if you find those bugs but
yeah check it out that's awesome I'm
super excited about that so check that
out we're here at CES all day today so
check out our stuff on YouTube hashtag
chrome dev summit will see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
