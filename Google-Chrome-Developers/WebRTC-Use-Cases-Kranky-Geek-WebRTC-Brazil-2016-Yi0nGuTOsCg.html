my first time in Brazil my first time in
San Paulo it's the first time we do a
cranky geek event here this our first
one in Brazil and the sixth one that we
did over all cranky geek is an event
around WebRTC development or robot you
see developers we create the content we
bring the best speakers that we have in
the industry in order for the people in
the room and for the people that watch
the YouTube videos later on to be able
to learn more about WebRTC what can you
do with it and how can you achieve the
things that you want to do so you can go
to cranky geek calm for future events if
you go to youtube and search for cranky
geek you will actually see a lot of the
sessions that we've already done in the
past this is our second event this week
or in the last 7 days
we came here directly from San Francisco
we had an event where the focus was
WebRTC for mobile developers or how to
run web at issue in Mobile I'm sorry
Levent levy I run a blog called blow
geek me with me doing these events are
chad hart chad hearts come from both
walks boned and he is the editor of the
chief editor of the website called web
RTC hacks
if you do development with vertices
that's a place to go out in the back we
have a guy called Chris cranky most of
you have already seen in more than once
today I'm sure if you haven't caught you
for a photo for a topper for asking your
name we should go say hi what we're
going to do in this event this time is
to deal with the basics around WebRTC
we've ran these events a few times and
then we've understood that there are
things in in the basics of WebRTC that
we haven't covered never covered in
these events but also there are things
in WebRTC that we couldn't find great
content online that is available so
we've decided to bring this content to
you
so you'll be able to enjoy it though you
know this is what we're going to do a
sponsors that made this event happened
first and foremost Google Google is
running this event with us from the
beginning each time getting as the
facility is the location and the
assistance all of the assistants are on
this event so I'd like to thank Google
other sponsors that we have include
Twilio and talkbox
they came a long way with us for these
events and they were also in San
Francisco last week and specifically on
this event we have additional two
sponsors whoever it is he ventures
details with consulting and art sourcing
of development related to over TC and
course at i/o that has tools for
analyzing live calls in WebRTC we will
have sessions from both of these vendors
and also from top box later on today so
what we have to turn the agenda first
I'm going to talk about WebRTC use cases
to explain what we started and where we
were going when it comes to a party see
in show a few examples that we have on
the market of our web RTC is being used
then we're going to discuss about the
WebRTC basics are there people here that
know what - RTC is no well okay those
that this is the first time they hear
about WebRTC and I hear for lunch okay
so this is where you're going to cover
what web RTC is how you use it the API
is how they look like then we're going
to move on and Chad Hart will give an
explanation
around servers in WebRTC whoever this is
a peer-to-peer type of a protocol and
this is what you usually do with it but
at the end of the day you need servers
nobody will tell you that but it
actually requires a lot of servers in
the backend and different types of them
and that will be the main topic of Chad
speak then we're going to have a break
so we can actually have lunch and
afterwards we'll convene back here where
we'll have a very interesting talk by
Google about
scaling the signaling part of WebRTC
it's easy to get a weber TC server
running and do your signaling but it's a
different thing of scaling that up and
doing a large production based service
and it will go over some of the aspects
that relate to that from there we'll
move on to a session by talk bucks
around what are the main issues and
American main complaints that you will
see on the market by users that use your
service and what to do about these
complaints how to debug them how to
assist your customer and how to make
sure that it doesn't come with that
complaint ever again then we have calls
at i/o and Varun Durr will introduce us
to the get stats API is how to use that
and what you can do with it this is a
very important part of a service once
you go into production something that
you usually miss in the first run of
your service and then we let on later so
you probably need to do know about that
in advance last but not least we will
have people flipper comes from appearing
and usually comes with us to all of
these events and this time is going to
talk about the web RTC internals what
you can find there and how to use that
to debug services and to troubleshoot
issues last but not least after the
break we will have Niklas Blum the
product manager of WebRTC at Google
discussing where what WebRTC is what
Google sees in WebRTC and what the
roadmap in the near future is going to
look like for WebRTC so thank you for
being here and I hope you'll enjoy this
day I'd like to start with Robert ECU's
cases and before I dive into what weber
TV's case cases really are and where the
interesting innovation and and services
come from I want to start from
communication and where we began this
journey began I don't know a hundred
years ago a bit more with the telephone
I remember something like thirty years
ago when my parents got their first
you took two weeks to get you had to
wait for it until it arrived today it's
faster to get a phone or a phone line
but what you do is you do in front of a
phone company now things progressed we
had these nice analog phones in the past
and then we moved on to digital phones
they turn on different types of networks
it's no longer sacred switch networks
we've moved to ip-based networks and we
can run these communication or these
calls through the internet but at the
end of the day nothing really changed
here when we moved from analog to
digital we use the same services you
will still dial the numbers which we
want to reach and this is the main way
that we've communicated for many years
now what hasn't changed and what the
main I guess issue is that communication
is still considered a service if I want
to do a call or to reach out to someone
in order to be able to talk with him or
we're going to do a video call I need to
go to a service that offers me that
specific capability and into that world
came something called WebRTC and it
changed everything in that regard so
Robert II see just you know to give a
game software that is because I'm going
to talk a lot about use cases there are
two ways in which I look at WebRTC and
the first one is that where RTC simply
offers real-time communications natively
inside the browser you can open the URL
in a browser probably if it's Chrome or
Firefox or Microsoft edge you just open
URL and magically you get connected to
someone and you are able of doing a
voice call or a video call or web
session or whatever it is that you're
trying to achieve in an ongoing need to
download anything or install anything to
get that done now this magic happens
because we already see at the end of the
day is a media engine it's a media
engine that allows us to take audio and
video inputs
that come from our device either a phone
a laptop a desktop from the microphone
and the speaker encode that compress it
and send it over a network to someone
else that's a media engine for me at
least and web RTC is such a media engine
that has JavaScript API is on top of it
that are part of the browser that's the
implementation that you get so we have a
party see it's inside the browser it
allows us to do these calls over URLs
what does that really mean how does that
change anything so the first one is it
reduces the barrier of entry for anyone
that wants to offer communication
services I'm I guess I'm around 15 or 20
years now dealing with voice over IP
type of technologies probably 10 20
years so my upbringing comes from voice
over IP I know it hu 2 3 is sip as a
seven and all of these curse words that
are using the cat in the telecom
industry now if you wanted to join my
specific small club now I can actually
see can someone close the lights some of
you are already sleeping interfere so if
you come into my small club of voice
over IP then there are things that you
need to know learn and I just understand
okay these things are how you make calls
how do you dial what signaling in that
case how do you mute calls transfer
forward and do a lot of these ugly and
boring services that might not be
necessary in each and every use case
that you are trying to achieve and now
it's built using javascript if I want to
build a service I can just use Java
JavaScript and there are more JavaScript
developers then there are VoIP
developers so we've reduced a barrier of
entry into this field and enabled a lot
more people to get into that field
people that were never taught what voice
over IP is and that's a good thing
because they don't all now think the
same and the only thing that you need to
do to dinner to build a service is to
start from I have a dream I want to do
this in a how to I reach that the second
thing and not less important it reduces
the friction for the users
everybody here ever use Skype okay did
you have to install something to get it
up and running you had to sign up to
sign in to put user name to you know add
friends into that so there is friction
with the user the user needs to be a
part of that service in order to use
that so as a business it's hard to use
such things because our closed networks
and there is a friction between me and
what I need to ask like my customer to
do in order to reach me and this is
something that I don't want I want to
reduce the friction for the users okay
and the fact that WebRTC is just in the
browser you just hit a URL and it's
there reduces that friction this all
boils down to something very simple if
we started with communication being a
service if I want to communicate I need
to go to the phone company okay we've
now done something quite simple with to
co-op RTC and turn it into a feature and
now it's a feature of another service
okay I no longer need to treat
communication as a full service I can
look at it from a very different prism
now what does that mean exactly
but now communication became a feature
and it's not no longer a service so
let's go back to the phone then
telephony okay back in the old days if
you wanted to make a phone call
you needed to go to a phone company in
every country has its own set of phone
companies and these companies are either
monopole monopolies or duopoly Zoro
lakopolous or whatever but they are the
gateway dedicates between the users and
their ability to communicate with each
other
you might say well we've got Skype okay
I can use Skype instant of the phone
company but to me that's like saying the
same thing I've just replaced one phone
company with another phone company if
you go to Skype we do the same calls but
instead of dialing I use the buddy list
but it's almost the same it's
practically the same thing now this
happened in the consumer space what
happened the net enterprises what they
understood that there is this internet
and they can just take the phone system
and built it into their own internal
networks put an IP PBX inside and run
the whole communication that goes
between their employees inside the
network in-house snow I feel I do a call
between two people in the same
enterprise I run over the Internet
okay over the IP network that they have
in the company were in on the open
Internet
but these calls don't go through any
carriers they don't go through any phone
company if they happen within the
enterprise that's usually called unified
communication and then I can do emails
messaging some phone calls video calls
conferencing which is nice but it's
closed to the network into the
enterprise an enterprise's needed one
now and more thing they need to be able
to reach out and communicate with our
customers so how do you do that you
build a call center you put agents you
let them speak to customers and for that
you usually put a different
infrastructure and a different set of
phones and PBX is an infrastructure to
do that in which a point or what we have
is well see to see
communication across consumers happening
through phone companies we have
businesses to businesses using unified
communications and businesses to
community consumers b2c going to call
centuries it ends up being three
different communication services where
what you do is communicate
and what it means is that at the end of
the day we did change the underlying
technology we're now use voice over IP
we don't use circuit switching but we
haven't changed the user experience or
the need to look at communication as a
full-fledged service and then I have a
question for you
uber as a company where exactly the
employees who are the customers where do
you place the drivers are the customers
employees are they partners suppliers
vendors the riders if I take an uber to
somewhere am i a customer of uber
America's tumor of the driver that is
now serving me is that a b2b interaction
between the driver and Ober is that a
b2c integrate interaction where I try to
reach out to the driver because I can't
find him or he can't find me okay we're
at a point in time where this whole
notion of interaction within a business
or between businesses to customers is
changing it's hard to draw the line
where thing starts and where things end
and it's not just uber if you go can
find a book about uber of everything
there are a lot of companies today that
are trying to be Oberer and not just by
competing with uber on taxes but rather
by doing it in other industries you can
see that in Airbnb that is doing
practically the same things to hotels or
Netflix by doing the same things for
movies and TV series and they there are
everywhere as well and these companies
are different because you can no longer
distinguish but by who is the customer
who is a provider who is the employee of
that company but in all of these
instances communication is the key I
need to be able to communicate within
the service that I'm providing
and the service for that I'm providing
is not communication the service that
I'm providing at the end of the day is
something totally different if I'm Ober
I'm trying to get you from point A to
point B and I'm using that through
someone else that is a driver for that
specific interaction so I've taken the
communication part that I needed in
order to achieve that capability and
I've made it into a feature of my
service I can do it without web RTC but
if I do it with IOT C it might be easier
to achieve or it might allow me to do
something that I couldn't have done
before at all okay so we got from the
point that we had communication as a
service into a point that we say we want
to make it into a feature because our
service is something that is totally
different we don't want to be a phone
company we don't want to offer
communication I want to offer a solution
that will allow me to teach people to
provide healthcare I don't know whatever
it is that I'm trying to achieve so
let's see a few examples and let's start
from popular ones the ones that are easy
to explain and understand
facebook facebook Messenger today uses
WebRTC if you do a voice call or a video
called through facebook Messenger you
are effectively using WebRTC both when
it's done in your phone and in the
browser you can open messenger com sign
in there to your Facebook account and
just call someone it works now Facebook
is huge in terms of the amount of users
that they have and the amount of calls
that they have in their net work done
over WebRTC that's in the consumer space
and that's a social network that decided
to add communication ready to decide
communication in terms of voice and
video you could have sent messages all
over Facebook before that is already in
the enterprise we have slack
lack is not really an enterprise company
they don't sell to enterprises
they don't go to the IT try to sell them
a bundle and tell them you know that's a
hundred thousand dollars for the whole
year and you need to pay yearly and then
we'll start deploy what you see that
slack goes into companies by people
inside the company starting to use slack
and then starts paying for that and then
causing the IT guys a lot of headaches
by doing that
now the notion about slack isn't the
fact that you need to do voice or video
calls it's about the fact that I'm going
to be able to communicate one-on-one or
within groups around specific topics but
these interactions are going to be
stored and I can search them and I can
search all the documents and stuff that
I provide links inside slack and this is
why people use slack they don't use
slack because it allows them to send
group messages we have what's up for
that right use it because you can search
fingers on that and because the
experience is more suitable when you go
to the enterprise and then one day slack
came out and they acquired the company
few months later they went out with a
service it offers voice calling inside
slack and I don't need to go and know
that well Chad what's your Skype ID I
want to call you okay I can just see the
chat is online on slack press a button
and have a voice called with him I can
decide that if were you know dealing
with cranky geek and we've got our own
slack account there if we have paid for
that and we could have opened the group
chat a group call for all the people in
a specific topic and just discuss things
between us I couldn't care less what
Chad's phone number or Skype ID is long
he's on slack and I see Mike and I
illumined that's it but slack dancin to
offer me that as a service it offers
something else on top of that and again
it added communication using WebRTC
because it could it was easier to do
than anything else
snapchat another company another type of
a social network into
action whatever I try not to let my kids
use that my daughter is nine years old
and she wants either that or musically
snapchat acquired the company in 2014 I
think something like that called heed
live a life was was one of the vendors
that enabled doing WebRTC calling video
calling in groups and one-on-one over
the internet so if you wanted to build
something you reviewed their API
snapchat went took them out of the
market and use them to build their video
calling capabilities it exists today on
slap on on snapchat so again they want
wanted to add that on top of just being
able to record videos and send to your
friends and have helped them you know
temporarily Verret ability to do a
session in real time they used WebRTC
for that now I'll go to something that
is not that obvious
Kickstarter X tarter added a new feature
in the last I think month or so and that
is the ability that if you run a
campaign in Kickstarter and you've got a
large audience and you want to tell them
you know here is the thing that I'm
doing you can hold the live event on
Kickstarter about your campaign she
opened a live broadcast on Kickstarter
people can go online what you live
comment or do whatever it is so the
session is rather interactive you might
say you know that's easy these are cases
that are still either large or
communication is still a large part of
that now social networks at the end of
the day needs to be able to enable
people to communicate so you can argue
that social networks are actually a kind
of communication services adding voice
or video calling into that is still a
communication service so what are other
services that you can build with WebRTC
as well and that's like at least that I
had about a year ago I just placed it on
the website on my website in one of the
posts because it was interesting so
things you can see there things like
document sharing
Hospital clowns I had a company in the
Netherlands and say well we're you know
Hospital clowns we go we cheer up kids
that are in the hospital but we want to
do that also for kids that are at home
and can't go to school and are stuck at
home we'll Skype today we don't like it
we want something else you can bill it
with WebRTC and there are many such
different use cases out there everything
you can imagine can probably be done
with WebRTC when it comes to the
communication part of it or vote of
voice and video so I hold a large list
of a large database that I've started a
few years ago about what vendors are out
there that use WebRTC and what projects
and what they are doing with it now what
you see in this chart is the different
segments of what companies are doing and
if you look at almost half of it from
video conferencing through customer
management telephony collaboration
unified communication that's all
communication as a service the service
that we have an offer for you is
communication come to us get that type
of service
the interesting part though is the other
which I'm not going to touch now they're
just too many things going on there with
WebRTC I'm going to look at the
verticals so around 17% of the companies
that I look at are inside a specific
vertical if they use communication to
solve a specific problem that is
unrelated to communication directly and
there you can see this mix up so a lot
of healthcare companies use WebRTC they
do things with it but the service isn't
communication it's offering a health
service the same in education a lot of
companies doing education one of the
main use cases there we're going to
teach you English our going to do that
we're going to take students in China
India Brazil wherever and we're going to
bring them to teachers or just to people
that will speak English with them from
the US or from wherever or now at let's
do the opposite I'm going to teach math
and I'm going to teach it in the US
and I'm going to use teachers in India
because they cost less and I'm going to
do it through my service which is
education experts market I'm going to
teach you something I don't know what it
is but we're going to do a one-on-one
session or you know a large session if
you want to take it our lessons you can
go online find that and learn guitar
from someone that will teach you that
specific thing same for taking a yoga
lesson why not and if you look at the
education so you know I hand-picked a
few examples for you so it wouldn't be
too high level or too abstract of what
you can do with it there's a company
called Proctor exam they offer Proctor's
it's a word that I learned about a month
or two ago because you know I saw these
type of companies what they do is bring
a person into the room when someone does
an examination to make sure that he
doesn't cheat now how do you do that
online you go to the student you have a
camera in his machine that camera is
working and now someone is watching that
boring video of that person taking the
exam online and we can decide not to
watch it we can just record it for
example and use it later if we assume
that someone cheated and we can do other
things with it so communication is it
the serve isn't the service here but
rather than knowing that someone has
been cheated vidonne to the done to in
the education space located in India
startup vendor what they do is offer the
ability to do one online one-on-one
sessions in the education space inside
India for me that was weird like you
know who's going to pay for an one
sessions in India there are billions of
people there they should do only group
sessions so no they do one-on-one that
they're a target market they are
aggregating different teachers the
teachers aren't their employees if you
want to be a teacher the transfer over
down to you can just sign up for the
service as a teacher
and then you get ratings there you get
rated by the students that come to you
and that's how you build your name
inside Vedanta as a teacher in the
education space similar to how up work
works for developers designers and these
kinds of things health care in the
health care space this one is something
from Israel my country there is a
company called semi premium they built
the back-end services for a lot of the
health care providers in Israel Clete
the company that has this mobile
application is the largest HMO in Israel
they provide healthcare services through
the government to people in Israel they
have over a million subscribers to their
service my kids are there I'm not I'm on
a different HMO they're also one of I
think the four largest s HMOs in the in
the whole world
in terms of the number of people that
they have and clearly decided to offer
well video conferencing services instead
of taking the kid at the middle of the
night to see a doctor you can just do a
video call with a doctor instead so you
know if you need to go or you can stay
at home I did that once it worked nice
it was at the old days when they used an
application that you had to download and
do stuff with about half a year ago that
I decided no more they're going to use
WebRTC instead because they don't want
to ask their customers their patients to
install an application so what happens
today is you go online you book a
session with them you get back a URL in
an SMS message on your phone and if it's
an Android phone you get connected
directly to a doctor and the doctor runs
from a PC and sees all of your
information and everything around that
so again it's no longer a communication
service it's me getting health care for
my kids today quality is doing that for
kids for general practice whatever it's
called in English I don't know how to
translate it from April so for generic
of healthcare stuff and they're now
starting to do it for skin cancer as
well so they can check skin issues also
online remotely instead of you going to
a doctor another one in the health
Scripps health care space this is
another company in Israel and this is
interesting because it's a totally
different type of service mini-speech
what they do is offer a kind of a
treatment for people that stutter
if I stutter
okay need to and this is the way I speak
it in my understanding by talking to
them was that if you are stutter then
improving that means speaking to people
a lot and people that know how to work
with you on your issues and also doing
some of these things offline so they
have a nice app that does that and
allows you to do your own self exercises
but also talk to people that this is
their job to assist you with stutter and
again the service is no longer
communication it's something different
moving to a different area I want to
look at financial services
I'll show two different examples here as
well so the first one is going to be
Symphony Symphony is similar to slack
what they offer is a kind of a messaging
service but based for the financial
market so you can see stop takes
information and all of the things that
you would see with a large Bloomberg
display that has all of that stuff
they've recently added video
conferencing to that using an
open-source framework called GT video
bridge so now I can have group calling
in that I have no clue what they're
going to use that exactly for but they
decided to add it why because you know
we can do that now why should I put a
call on WebEx to do something when I can
do that within my own financial specific
service that I offer to my customers no
communication for me here is again a
feature of what I give to the
stomer i want to close the use cases
with this one this one is a Turkish Bank
the bank is called TEB it's a large
Turkish bank and they've opened a new
type of a startup a bank called scepter
tab or however you say it in Turkish and
this is an online bank only a digital
Bank there are no places you can go to
everything happens online and they try
to provide a different type of a service
to their customers and one of the things
that they do he's allowing you to book a
video call from our desktop with someone
at the bank with an agent at the bank so
you can do that in a regular Bank but if
the whole bank is digital and it's
targeted to a very specific niche of the
customers that are out there then this
makes a lot of sense so it is you know
banking service but communication is
embedded into it again just because we
can and it makes sense and my question
to you is what are you going to build
with over TC today what is the use case
that you are thinking about that might
be totally unrelated to telephony that
WebRTC can enrich that interaction or
that experience that you give to your
customers through your service by
improving what you offer and the
communication that you get between users
customers suppliers or whatever it is
that you define your target market and
the audience that your service is going
to interact with thank you very much
