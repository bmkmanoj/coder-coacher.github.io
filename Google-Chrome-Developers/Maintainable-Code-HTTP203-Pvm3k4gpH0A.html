indifference to banks okay how about one
they turned into a pub oh that's
progress
yes do you know how to untie a file no I
always check I never remember I think I
do
it's TI ta are tar space - and your
arguments are X said F okay by the way I
have a remembering this and someone else
taught me this I think it's brilliant is
because it's you know your untiring yep
XZ f x taxi files it's perfect right
you'll never forget check out that now
so I I had to go and do some work on an
older project of mine from some time ago
I'm so sorry
right exactly I don't know if you've had
this before where you you you come to
some of all the code of your own I know
you're kind of looking through this
project since you have the Gandalf
moment I have no memory of this place
exactly that it just was like someone
else had written it and they'd written
it not very well like a Weissach might
yeah and it kind of made me feel that
even on a project where I am going to be
the only contributor or you know if I
expect only me to be the only
contributor even then maintainable code
is so important when I was at the BBC we
had a pattern which I really liked where
before we even started on the
implementation of like part of the
library we were working on we would
first write the Docs and we'd write them
in line which is kind of not entirely
popular at the moment but I still liked
having the documentation really close to
the code because when you updating one
it reminded you to update the other but
the way we did it is if we were adding
new functionality we would write the
docs first before any line of code you
know that
of the function signature the arguments
what it returns and that is the first
thing with a code review we would code
review the documentation before any of
the code and one of the things that you
would do is part this is right examples
a function usage and it happened loads
well as we were writing the examples
like this isn't fit for purpose now I'm
actually you know pretending to be a
user of this function this this is
actually really hard to use for the
common stuff you use it for because it's
not it's not a particularly attractive
part of coding right you know I rather
do the features a rather the new
exciting thing than kind of make sure
that you know me six months from now
could read this code well if you ever
coded something in a way that year you
kind of step back from it and you think
ah this is only four lines now yeah I'm
very very smart yeah I see this a lot
and it really do it really books me
actually cuz it's like I've got you know
four functions that do broadly related
things so what I did in stairs I made
this one mega function mega not in terms
of its quality but just in terms of you
know how it sort of it bakes all those
four ideas down into one thing and then
you call it four different ways I've got
one function that actually produces the
of a function it's almost become self
aware the code is now writing itself
yeah I'm so smart in many cases just
doing it the simple way which might be a
few lines extra it might even be slower
but it's only worth like removing the
maintainability if if the benefit is is
worth it like if that's a hot function
if that's going to be called a lot in
the forms benefits worth it yeah
absolutely I think Mike there's a micro
optimizations in some form there and
it's not worth doing otherwise I
sometimes find that when I'm reading
code for Python projects mmm I find
their code really really easy to read
even though I know I know JavaScript a
whole lot better than I'm not - petpaint
hesitate do you think as a community is
a Java community we need to just swallow
our pride with all these different like
techniques of like writing JavaScript
and just even if it's not even it's one
we all a little bit hate we just we have
our own Pepe I think what you're tapping
into is actually the cultural
requirement it can't just be you can't
codify maintainable standards it
actually has to be something that's
baked into the
pull that are working on the code that
they want to keep the technical debt low
they want to make it easy for themselves
and for other people and the people who
join the team to actually be able to
sort of contribute and I think that's
it's a crucially important thing in
technical code it's just a better way of
doing it to the heroes or unsung heroes
or maintainable code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
