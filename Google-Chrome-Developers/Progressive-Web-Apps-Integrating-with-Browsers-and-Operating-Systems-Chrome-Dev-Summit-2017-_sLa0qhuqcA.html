Owen Campbell Moore and I work to try
and make the web a more powerful
platform for applications so on the
chrome team we believe the progressive
web apps should provides an immersive
and integrated experience on all
platforms and operating systems and I'm
going to be telling you all about that
today
but to get started I want to tell you a
story so cast your mind back to 2012 so
this is me
you can tell what I was missing in a
haircut I was making up for in having a
big idea so my idea was to create a
messaging app for the web so I wanted to
create something that would work a cross
platform it would work on all devices I
wanted to build something with
JavaScript because JavaScript was the
cool thing and I really like the
openness at the web provided so I was
really excited to build this actually
you can see I think my friend is a
little less convinced that my idea that
I was but okay so here I was starting
off on my journey and as I started
working on this project I quickly ran
into a problem where I found that my new
great messaging site didn't work offline
and as you might be able to tell from my
accent I'm from the UK and at the time I
was taking the London Underground a lot
and so not being able to read my
messages offline was a deal breaker for
me and so this was the first struggle
that I ran into and so I looked around
at all the different possible solutions
and I found something called mobile
Chrome apps so mobile Chrome apps let me
take the content I'd already built this
web content and kind of package it up
into a chrome app that users could
install on their desktop or install on
their mobile device so it would still
run everywhere but it wasn't actually
available on the web and something that
I didn't really appreciate at the time
was that because users now had to
install it to use it about 90% of my
potential users were just going to hit
the back button when they land on the
store page they never even get to
experience my great app so there was a
downside there which you know it
didn't even realize at the time but I
migrated it over and everything kind of
seemed to work until I got to
implementing notifications and I
discovered the mobile Chrome apps
actually didn't support notifications at
the time and obviously is a messaging
app that's kind of a big deal and so
again I'm back to the drawing board and
looking around at the other possible
options and I find Cordova so for those
of you that don't know Cordova is this
tool that lets you again take some
content that you've built for the web
kind of wrap it up and package it for
mobile so now in this move I actually
lost desktop support it now only worked
on mobile devices but you know could
over supported notifications and I could
still write JavaScript so that was
pretty cool but in the process of doing
this migration something else happened
the sound in my app just stopped working
I can I pulled it this and I was
wondering is it because the way I'm
loading the audio file because now I'm
kind of bundling everything instead of
serving it from the web is there a
problem there and she turned out to be
more fundamental than that the problem
was that Cordova is based on web view
and web view actually is kind of
fundamentally different to the browser
in some ways and it turned out that
webview just didn't support the html5
audio tag so that was fairly
disappointing and I had to look into a
different kind of hacks to get around
that it turned out that there was a
could of a plugin for audio so I was
able to pull that into the project and
get the audio back up and running but
now it's kind of getting a little hacky
didn't feel too great but I got past
that and I'm back to implementing my
notifications and then this happened
Java so it turns out that although
Cordova does support notifications and
that's what I just abla SH I didn't
realize that you actually have to
implement them writing native Java code
you weren't able to write them with
JavaScript so I'm now at a point where I
set off on this journey to build
something cross-platform with JavaScript
that's open and works on the web and I
built something that's not
cross-platform it just works on mobile
it wasn't all built with JavaScript and
it wasn't open it wasn't served on the
web and so this is you know roughly
where I ended up at the end of this
journey but I had a bunch of
realizations during this process and I
learned a bunch of the problems that
existed and I was really determined to
try and help solve those problems
and so the problem actually that I
really ran into was that all of these
issues were fundamental in web standards
and anyone here that has experience in
standards would know that when you run
into an issue with standards you'd
mostly back away slowly and try and go
and find something else I was young and
foolish and so I didn't do that and so
if we fast forward a year this is where
I ended up again the haircut is still
lacking and in fact if you are wondering
this is still my current employee badge
photo that I carry around with me all
day and yes if you're wondering I do
avoid walking around the campus on bring
your children to work day just in case
people think I'm lost there's a good
story about that ask me about it later
so I joined the chrome team and when I
joined we were really laser focused on
three areas offline so on mobile devices
users don't have this reliable wire
straight into the internet and so it's
just table stakes that sites must work
for ly ibly when you're moving in and
out of elevators and through buildings
and in the subway next was notifications
so notifications obviously on mobile
unlock a whole new range of applications
so this was really important to bring to
the web and third was install ability
opening the browser and type in a URL is
really fiddly and on mobile the power to
open your home screen and tap an icon is
really important and so we knew that we
needed that on the web too and so today
I'm going to start by giving you an
update on install ability so I'm excited
to share with you that today are what we
call improved add to home screen is now
launched to 100% of Chrome for Android
users so improved Add to Home screen
integrates progressive web apps deeply
into Android so here you can see trivago
and you can see an add to homescreen
banner and when I tap add not only do I
get an icon on my home screen but it
shows up in my all apps drawer just like
any other app it shows up in their
Android system just like any other app
and it integrates with Android so when I
get an email from a friend about a trip
with a link to some hotels and I tap it
it just opens in the trivago progressive
web app which is exactly what you would
expect
we're also working on what we call the
add to homescreen modal flow this allows
sites to take more control of their
install experience provide their own
upsell UI and when the user taps on it
to request that the browser show a
confirmation dialog to the user and this
is something that's coming soon so those
are just some of the ways that were
integrating the web more deeply into the
Android operating system but what about
integrating the web into Android apps so
today apps can use custom tabs which
essentially allow them to provide a
simplified browsing experience for users
looking at third-party untrusted web
content for example you might tap a link
on an article in a social app and you'll
be presented with this simplified
browser showing the news article but
what about content that is an arbitrary
content there isn't third-party in
content that you trust content that's
from you do we still need the simplified
browsing experience and so this is the
question that led us to today
introducing what we call trusted web
activities so been highlighted trusted
web activities in the keynote today but
I'm excited to give you a deep dive on
it now and tell you what it is how it
works and what it means so on a high
level by launching a trusted web
activity any new or existing Android app
or Android instant app can include
content of their own served directly
from the web so long as it's from the
same developer of course so long as it's
trusted now that web content is powered
by the same modern and up-to-date web
runtime that the PWA in the browser is
so advanced features like serviceworker
and the push API just work by default
and you don't need to use a tool like
crosswalk to bundle a whole web browser
with your app just to render this web
content now naturally the app is able to
take advantage of everything Android has
to offer while the embedded web content
continues to be always up to date small
on disk and shared across all platforms
so for today's event we've created a
hello world example where we embed the
polymer news PWA content that we've
already built so let's take a look so
first to get this project to work we had
to set up digital asset links so this is
how we attest that the polymer
PWA web content is owned and served by
the same developer as the app that we're
building so we set that up and then we
set up a Android manifest and you can
see here that we've taken advantage of
new features in Android Orio like
shortcuts so now once the user opens our
amp we want to go ahead and launch a
trusted web activity to our site so here
because trusted web activities is based
on custom tabs first in my activity Java
we set up custom tabs just like we would
normally and then once that once the
custom tab service is connected we go
ahead and launch a trusted web activity
so most of this is just boilerplate the
the really important line is the one at
the bottom where you can see we're
launching as trusted bioactivity and
we're passing in the URI of our site and
so that's really all it takes to get
running and here you can see what it
looks like so this is content that's
loaded on the fly powered by the same
browser that the PWA runs in and thanks
a serviceworker
the user can browse the news here even
when they're offline and because it's an
Android app we can take advantage of
great Android features like in-app
billing to set up subscriptions as you
can see here so we'll be releasing a
preview of trusted web activity support
in Chrome's dev channel very soon and a
full documentation will be available
this Wednesday so trusted web activities
are will be available through the
Android support library so other
browsers will be able to support this as
well so we'd love you to try this out
and let us know what you think so if
you're like me you're now looking at
this and wondering what does this mean
for add to homescreen
so in essence improved add to homescreen
is still how users get your progressive
web app on their device this now just
opens up new patterns for how you can
integrate the web into your Android app
since you can now take advantage of all
of that app like web content that you've
already created and if you do build an
Android app that contains some of your
web content and instead of having users
at the site to the home screen you want
them to install this app that you've
built that uses the content you can set
up the appropriate metadata in your web
app manifest and chrome will show this
native app install banner instead of the
Add to Home screen banner so your users
can easily install the app straight from
the site so we're really excited about
what trusted web activities means for
your ability to make the most out of
your web content and for the new install
ability patterns that it creates web app
install ability is evolving across the
whole ecosystem and to tell you more
about how they're improving it in
Mozilla Firefox I'd like you to join me
in welcoming andreas Bowens from Mozilla
thank you hi everyone my name is andreas
Bothans and I work as lead product
management at Mozilla I woke asan gecko
and on Firefox for Android and it's
absolutely fantastic to be back here
again at the chrome dev summit so let's
dive straight in for a long time
Mozilla has been very dedicated to
implement support for the various
technologies that power progressive web
apps we've added support for service
workers and push back in Firefox 44 and
we've been heavily involved in the
editing and the specification and the
standardization work that has gone in
the web app manifest specification
however thus far we didn't have an
implementation yet that was using the
metadata that are provided by such a web
app manifest so it's my pleasure today
to announce that very soon Firefox for
Android will ship with add to homescreen
support we're not doing this exactly the
same as you might have seen in other
browsers but instead we're following a
badge approach if a site is served over
HTTPS and it has a valid manifest a
subtle badge is shown in the address bar
and when this badge is tapped the user
gets an option to add the side to the
home screen and then of course when the
site is launched from the home screen
it's shown in this nice standalone or
full screen more immersive mode
integrates nicely with the task switcher
and so forth like we get to know got
I've gotten to know from progressive web
apps
but we didn't stop there we went a
little bit further and we tried to think
a lot about how to deal with external
links external links included inside of
progressive web apps so for instance you
might have used the Twitter light
progressive web app and of course you
see then a stream of tweets and from
time to time such a tweet to a link to
external content so the question is what
to do with this external content you
want to signal to the user that hey this
is not anymore and within the scope the
original scope of the progressive web
app we're actually going here to an
external site so an option would be to
launch the full browser and load the
link there but we found that there was
not very smooth experience it was a bit
disruptive and so we decided to look at
custom tabs which seems like the perfect
fit for this kind of use case scenario
so what happens now is when you tap an
external link and a progressive web app
install to Firefox you will open this
external content in a custom tab and
it's really smooth to move back and
forward between the progressive app and
the external concept
content and chrome has also followed a
similar approach and I believe that oh
and later on this talk will cover this
as well so what is next for Firefox for
Android you can expect further
improvements to Add to Home screen we're
not done yet we're still trying to tweak
a number of things and we're also
working on support for new API s we're
working on well we will be shipping soon
background sync we're working on payment
requests and we're also looking into web
share and a number of other api's so if
you want to try this out today it's
available in Firefox nightly from Google
Play at this point you still have to go
into the settings in the Advanced
section and turn on support for
progressive web apps but of course once
it hits the final version expected to be
in January 2018 this will be turned on
by default and so try it out and let us
know what you think thank you very much
thanks andreas so now I want to tell you
about what's happening in the rest of
the ecosystem so if we turn to samsung
internet in samsung internet
they've also shipped a feature that will
indicate to the user when the site
they're on is a progressive web app so
here you can see the normal browsing
experience with the normal bar at the
top of the screen but when the site is a
progressive web app the bookmark icon
changes to a small plus and when the
user attempts it they're given the
option to either bookmark it or add it
to their home screen
and so this is just one more great way
for users to discover and install
progressive web app content and now
turning to Microsoft and Windows so
Microsoft have announced that they will
be listening progressive web apps in the
Windows Store and so here you can see a
screenshot of jyg dot space yeah random
uploads for them
so here you can see jig dot space a
progressive web app listed in the
Windows Store this is a great
progressive web app that's a platform
for 3d content and works great
everywhere and especially on windows
thanks to this new discoverability so
now turning away a little from install
ability and install ability in the
ecosystem I want to tell you about
what's going on in the new API that are
available to allow sites to more deeply
integrate with the browsers and
operating systems I want to start by
talking about api's for social web
applications like the one that I was
originally trying to build so with any
social application one of the most key
features is the ability to upload photos
now unfortunately until now the
experience of uploading photos on the
web has been a little lacking so when
you tap on a site to upload a photo you
typically get an experience something
like this here I'm being shown a dialog
to choose an action and my options are
camera camera or files I mean really
like what's going on here so if I if I
do it well actually this is frankly best
case scenario this is a screenshot that
I took a few weeks ago on another
Android device where it's giving the
option of Android system photos gallery
and xej and so you know this is this is
not the most highly polished user
experience and if you do actually go
ahead and tap through to pick a file
often you're presented something like
this it's a it's a dialog really
designed for picking files from your
file system not optimized for uploading
that selfie that you just took and then
if you do want to upload a second photo
for any reason you know what naturally
we're always uploading our selfies in
batches you know my friends seem to love
these you're back to where you started
you go through this cycle again and
again of going through these dialogues
and so it's very frustrating so I'm
really excited to announce that this
week we're rolling out oh yeah
this slide really yeah so this week I'm
really excited that we are rolling out a
new image uploading experience and so
here it works just like you would expect
when I'm on Twitter and I tap to upload
a photo it takes me straight into a
gallery of my images I can pick one two
three five doesn't matter how many hit
done and we're done that's it way better
than before
and so this is rolling out just this
week so keep your eye out for it and you
know the best thing about this is
actually for most sites you'll just get
this for free no changes required the
only thing that it requires is that your
input type equals file element on the
page specifies an accept attribute that
only accepts images obviously if you're
looking for zip files or something else
we're not going to present this flashy
new image picker but if you just specify
images you'll just get this dialog for
free and so this is a great time to just
go and check on your site that you're
setting the accept attribute on your
input type equals file elements so
that's uploading images but what about
taking images you know lots of new
social applications have these rich
image capturing experiences built in so
this year we've launched the new image
capture API which allow you to really
use the photo taking pipeline on the
device so previously you were able to
get a video stream out from the camera
and then take snapshots from it but most
hardware can provide much higher quality
higher resolution images via a more
dedicated image photo taking pipeline
and also we now have the ability to
customize things like the zoom the ISO
the flash all of the different aspects
of the camera that we'd like to control
and so this API has two main modes for
using it one is to customize the stream
coming in off the device so if an
example of that you might be customizing
the zoom and showing the preview on the
screen and allowing the user to pinch
and zoom but there's also a mode where
you're just setting a property when
taking a individual photo so something
like flash
is in the or redeye reduction is
something that just happens when you
take a photo not just on the stream
until let's see an example of using that
so the first thing that we do is we ask
the device what the capabilities are of
the hardware we do that by calling image
capture get photo capabilities and that
will return an object that tells you
what fill light mode options are
available what redeye reduction options
are available and then based on that you
can call image capture take photo and
specify whatever customizations you want
so here I'm telling it that we want the
flash and if you go ahead and try this
you'll find that it works just as you'd
expect so next is the background sync
API so the background sync API allows
you to guarantee the uploads complete
successfully so if you are building a
messaging app or you're building some
kind of a social app like Instagram when
a user wants to post a photo or send a
message you want to make sure that it
makes it up to the server even if the
users on a flaky network or offline and
you don't want them to have to sit there
staring at the site as it continually
retries and so you here you can see that
instagrams mobile site have implemented
this so when you go offline you'll see a
banner at the bottom of the screen
telling you the offline but you can
still post photos if you go through the
flow and you choose a photo to upload
you can then close out from Instagram
and later you'll get a notification when
you reconnect to the internet telling
you that your photo has now been posted
and so this is a really great pattern
that you can use to ensure really
reliable networking within your
application it's really easy to use so
I'll show you quickly how it works
within your main page javascript context
when you realize that the users offline
and you're trying to send something you
have to store whatever you were trying
to upload somewhere persistent in this
case it's the image and the metadata
associated with it and you'll store it
somewhere like the indexeddb or in the
cache API which actually is my favorite
place to store rich data it's a nice key
value store that you can use so first
you're going to write those data to the
disk and then you're going to tell the
browser that you wanted to fire an event
in the serviceworker when the user
reconnects the internet so to do that we
get a reference to the serviceworker
registration by calling a weight
navigator dot service polka dot ready
and then we tell it we call
serviceworker registration sync to
register and we give it a tag so then
later when the event is fired we know
what we're supposed to be doing what
what what we'd scheduled this thing for
and then in the serviceworker it's
really simple you listen for a sync
event you look to see what the tag was
so you know what you're supposed to be
doing and if it's upload image you're
just gonna pull all of the pending
images and data that you wrote to the
disk and upload them to the server with
a fetch request now there's one problem
with this which is that the browser
actually doesn't have a way of knowing
when you're done uploading and so it
doesn't know when to kill your
serviceworker and stop it running on the
user's device and so to solve that what
we want to do is tell the browser to
wait until we're done and keep the
serviceworker alive until our upload is
complete and so to do that we call event
wait until and we're going to just
return a promise that will resolve when
the fetches are complete and that's
really everything so next with
applications we are sending
notifications these days and it's really
great to be able to build really
immersive notification experiences on
people's devices here you can see again
I'm showing my British bias a screenshot
from The Guardian when they were showing
live election updates for the UK
election and they made this great
updating graphics that would show in the
notifications and they would give me
buttons to say stop or give me more
information so this is a really great
experience it's super simple to use in
your serviceworker when you call
registration show notification and you
provide the title for the notification
you provide a whole bunch of different
options for showing the notification
including an image which is just a URL
and an array of actions in this case I'm
just showing what it would be to add a
like button on the notification and
that's really all there is to it so now
I want to turn from social and talk
about publishing a little bit so one of
my favorite new API that you can use in
publishing is the web share API so
obviously having users sharing articles
and content is really important and with
the new web share API you can integrate
directly with the native Android sharing
system so here you can see a screen a
gif of boots progressive web app running
in the browser and when the user taps
the
button it shows the native Android share
dialog just like you'd expect this is
simple to use all you do when the user
attempts the share button you check
where the Navigator share is available
in the browser and if it is you just
call it and you're passing the data that
you want the user to share so then in
publishing another important aspect is
linking out to third-party content and
again like Andrea showed earlier chrome
supports this using custom tabs from
progressive web apps so any navigation
that crosses the scope of the
progressive web app will be shown in a
custom tab so now what about shopping
and travel so with shopping and travel
payments are obviously a really
fundamental problem the manual tedious
slow and they involve lots of tapping
and can create a really frustrating
experience so in the last couple years
we've brought the payment request API to
the web which allows the browser to
facilitate the collection of checkout
information from the user especially for
users that aren't signed in to your web
app the browser already knows who the
user is and likely knows their email
address and has their shipping
information stored and so it can help
provide all of those things by default
but until recently our payment request
was only available in Chrome for Android
but this year we're announcing that
payment requests is available on all
platforms across a desktop and Chrome
for iOS and in fact if you use feature
detection to tell if this is available
and to use it these will just you'll get
this for free without any changes
required now using the payment requests
API is really easy you instantiate a new
payment request object you tell it what
methods of payment you support here
we're just saying basic card which is
used for credit cards debit cards etc
and you tell it how much money you want
in what currency and then eventually
you're going to call show on that object
you've created and you get the users
information back in response and so this
doesn't actually carry out the payment
it just gives you all of those details
it gives you the shipping address it
gives you the credit card information
that you can then go and use to process
the payment now just this week we've now
announced the ability to use pay with
Google using the payment request API
so pay with Google means that any
payment method that the user has
supported in their Google account will
now be be able to be used just in one
tap via the payment request API so this
includes things like Android pay and any
credit cards that have added to their
Google account so this is incredibly
easy to use all you do is you swap or
you add another supported method of
google.com slash pay and here you can
see it working when were on a site we
just wait for it to loop back around so
when you're on a site and you're going
to check out on something you get
presented with the normal payment
request dialog and then you see the new
option pay with Google and so once you
choose your shipping address and hit pay
the user can now pick from whatever
payment options that they have listed in
their Google account and just take that
payment and so you can follow this link
at the bottom to find out more and find
out how to use pay with Google with the
payment request API on your site so
turning away from payments identity is
another really important aspect to
shopping and e-commerce sites and when
talking about identity we need to talk
about the credential management API so
this API means that once the user signs
up somewhere on any one of their devices
you can keep them logged in across all
of their devices now this is great but
the problem is that some browsers don't
yet support the credential management
API that's why today we're announcing
one tap sign-in in every browser so this
is a new library from Google a new
library from Google based on the
credential management API so let's take
a look at how this works here you can
see it with Zillow and this could be any
browser even those that don't support
the credential management API and I've
never signed into Zillow previously on
this device but I can when I'm on the
login screen I'm showing this dialog at
the bottom I can tap a single button and
now I'm signed back in with my existing
account this is really easy to use you
just call a wait smart lock to retrieve
and you pass in what supported
authentication methods
you have and it just returns a
credential for the user when user taps
the button which you can then send up to
the server to start the session now this
works really great for keeping users
signed in but if they're just on your
site viewing a product or browsing
flight options there's a good chance
they've never actually signed up for
your service in the first place and so
if they swap to another device to
continue that session but they've never
signed up you can't actually continue
that session over that's why today we're
also announcing one tap sign up for the
web so if the name suggests this means
that you can get users signed up in just
a single tap so here you can see that
I'm using Hipmunk
and I'm being prompted to sign up with
an account in line I simply tap continue
there's no jump to an account creation
page I accept hip marks terms and
conditions and I'm signed up and now
I'll be I kept logged in across all of
my devices with or without the
credential management API so we believe
that this will have great impact for
many developers and the early numbers
that we've seen indicate that it can
increase the signups for sites by 2 to 3
X this is really really easy to use
all you do is you call a wait smart lock
dot hint and again you pass in some
options it gives you back a credential
as soon as the user has tapped and you
can send that to the server you can
present them with the terms and
conditions whatever you want to do from
there so that's one tap sign up and sign
in a new library from Google and you can
find it at developers.google.com/live
and t-today so now i want to talk about
media on the web so with the media
sessions api you can now integrate your
media on the web with the user's
operating system and devices and so here
you can see that because i was playing
some media content in the browser i get
this rich notification to control the
playback on my android device and it
comes across to my android wear device
super simple to use you just called
navigated media session metadata and you
set the metadata that the user should be
seeing and by this API it's even
possible to
the media be controllable for example
from the Google assistant on different
devices to where it's playing which is
really great now the media story and the
web continues to get better and better
thanks to new features like media
sessions and offline video playback now
there's so much to cover in this base
that we have a whole dedicated talk to
this later today so go and check that
out for more so now to bring it back to
where I started on this journey I'm
excited to say that I did the analysis a
couple nights ago and I found that I can
actually build the whole original web
app that I wanted to build entirely with
the web in JavaScript with web standards
cross-platform which is just really
amazing ok
and so since they did give me the stage
to talk to you today I would be remiss
to not tell you about one more thing so
we've been talking a lot about mobile in
the last year or two on Chrome but today
I want to give you a sneak peek of how
we're starting to look at desktop so
here you can see at the bottom of the
screen a YouTube icon in my shelf
showing up just like an app and when I
launch that you can see it running in an
experimental version of Chrome that can
run any PWA just like a native desktop
app now this isn't yet ready for
primetime but we're really excited to
explore more with what we can do with it
in 2018 and to close I think that given
that even Apple recently announced that
Service Worker support is soon coming to
Safari we're truly living in a time
where progressive web apps can provide
an immersive and integrated experience
on all platforms and operating systems
thank you
