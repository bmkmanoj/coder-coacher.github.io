has become quite sterile like UX has
sort of taken away the kind of the
creativeness of it before a designer's
go to art college and everything about
that was the creative persons coming
internally but now everything needs to
be validated and everything's to be like
very sterile and the way we create
things is all about replicating the same
user experience patterns and UI elements
and and it feels like the validation
part has taken away what it means to be
creative that's from developer
perspectives I must say data is very
helpful so I personally like it I like
to you know have hard proof that what
I'm working on or the decisions I'm
making are having the the right impact
on the user experience on the app I'm
building or on the look and feel but I
can totally see where you're coming from
when it comes to the creative process
for example it's quite important and
easy to measure stuff that is already
out there to figure out if this decision
was right or wrong but it's very hard to
start with data and not to start the
process of creating something new from
hard facts you need this ingenuity that
you put into the app in the first place
for example when I create some reference
up I want to showcase some technology or
some new way of solving technological
problem but it's a front-end app so I
need to make it look and feel nice at
the same time and I send this by canvas
and then I pray to have some creative
designer next to me you know coming in
with its infinity rather than just you
know getting my data and following the
data so I mean this feel a bit like a
chicken and egg situation what comes
first the creative step of just
discovery I actually like to think about
it as a sandwich you know other than
chicken and egg it's like you know you
have some bread and then some feeling
and then some bread again so I think it
all starts with kind of creative process
by designer or by some you know creative
person
working on a given product to have a
distorting idea and any bit data and
user testing and all this you know heavy
weaponry for polishing the original idea
so that it's the best you can get but
then at the top you still need this
touch of ingenuity you know like when I
think about different visual frameworks
on the web they kind of stop at this
second layer they took the initial idea
they applied a lot of data to make it as
nice and you know to use and as usable
and the browser friendly environment
friendly whatever you need and they
stopped there but then the design needs
to take such a visual framework and
touch this something unique you know
that to make a given app or product
outstanding and sometimes I think we
stopped at this data level and we don't
go through this extra step of heading
somewhere else on top of it to make it
excels in us amazing I mean I've never
ready for that I was always feels like
one comes before the other and I know a
lot of working environments do feel like
a factory in that respect that I draw
the picture then a developer I implement
the picture and then I take it back and
say could you change the color back and
and but I think I suppose it's about
finding a process where both can really
feel like they're making a sandwich
together in a kitchen rather than it
being a conveyor belt it's a little bit
similar to when the agile methodologies
enter the software world you know where
you go through different iterations of
the creative process and I agree when
there was the situation where first you
get a design out and then you give it to
developers to implement it and that's it
it's very stressful for both sides
because developers we stress that the
design is not really implementable to be
honest like it's not compatible with the
technology and then designers are angry
because you know developers change their
design and now we're not as pretty as it
was before so I think it's all about
making it more iterative and more
collaborative and then it takes the
stress out of both parties
and I know there are some there's some
tension on the line every now and then
but to be honest I really like working
with designers there's this up I worked
on in December last year it's Santa
tracker it's it's a Google app that kind
of tracks the steps of the Santa Clause
throughout December up to the
combination day where he goes around the
world you know and gives the present and
there's a lot of apps you can play and
in that experience throughout whole
December and I was developing this app
where a little elf is going through a
maze is navigating a maze finding
presence and you can look Doug do you
see the elf from the top so it's pretty
much just a red dot with a little pointy
hat and kind of and my task was to make
it jump through obstacles and that was
totally stuck you know because you look
from above and it's just this red dot
that is ahead how you make a jump like
you don't don't see legs you don't see
arms hours hours stuck I implemented all
the technological parts to it in two
days and then for next week's I would
like Bank how to make it look right and
the last for designer help and within
very short time he came up with the idea
that you know if you make this those
bigger and they're smaller it looks like
you know it's like floating in the air
and then falling down this is so
brilliant and I never thought about it
like you really need to and Trust in
your competencies you know and that
could help when you need it and what I'd
love for us to do is to end up in a
world where we have language and ideas
that are native to the web itself that
embrace the fact of the web is hypertext
not just a another way to build make of
that
