I take the sites that you've submitted
and I go through them and I look for
performance issues bah Louis voice of an
angel face of a pig last time we looked
at the Guardians page load performance
this time we're going to do pretty
similar it's going to be the guardian
because we're going to bring it for all
it's worth why wouldn't you a little bit
of something to clarify from last time I
showed my bookmarklet which is really
cool to toggle the styles on and off and
switch off the remote styles and just
leave the inline styles that were
shipped with the page um there was a bug
in the bookmarklet which is why I was
causing some of that page content to go
a bit crazy who writes code with bugs
not me we've updated the source code so
if you want it you can grab it yourself
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna look
this time at the scrolling performance
and I'm going to do that on mobile
because if you've got performance issues
on a mobile device you really going to
feel it you're really going to notice
and so it's a really good opportunity to
just step in and go well if I can fix it
on mobile it's going to be amazing and
blazing fast on desktop so it's a really
good opportunity so I have my trusty
Nexus device here and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to unlock it first of
all for it is locked I wear a lot of
hats in this show in my job I wear a lot
of hats this one is jazz hat I'm going
to go across to chrome inspect and you
can see here that it's showing me that
chrome dev is available which is good
and there's a new tab ready to rumble
right what really gonna put my teeth
back in ready to rumble yeah grab that
let's go open tab with Ural and click on
that open it and that means we can also
inspect it which brings up chrome
devtools urban ball I'm street I can be
down with the kids you see i'm i'm cool
like you and i am on the timeline which
is my personal favorite place apart from
well maybe the elements or the console I
just like I like them all so much is
like choosing a favorite child
I can't do it I'm going to do scrolling
performance because scrolling is and
animation and if there's a problem with
scrolling it's going to really kind of
be the most obvious thing to to users of
the site and you know this is a Content
site so scrolling should be 60 frames a
second and that kind of thing so combo
hat urban jazz and I will record and I'm
going to scroll like that and every time
the framerate drops during that scroll
there's a bright yellow block which is
the JavaScript and so you know it's it's
good to know that it's JavaScript but I
think we want a little bit more details
so what I'll do is I'll switch on the
JavaScript profiler okay so we have the
JavaScript profiler switched on gonna
hit record I'm just going to go bed of a
scroll most of the time I rely on
editing to to sort the the wheat from
the chaff yeah wheat being the one thing
in every hundred that I say that's worth
listening to most of the time it's like
I don't like mung beans so timeline time
line the line of time when you look at
timelines it's often really good to try
and break down the work and one of the
things that the JavaScript profiler will
do is it's going to color code the
results based on the file so if you see
the same color you know it's come from
the same file and that's actually
extremely useful when you starting to
kind of divide and say well where's the
work coming from where is it you know
what's responsible for the work so you
see I think most of these are lazy load
load slot oh there's a message Jess I'm
not sure what that is but my hunch is
that they're trying to show a message
but it is it's going through is going
through Raven Jess which is a sanara
capture so I guess that's just acting is
a bit of a gateway aha pub ads in pull
so there's something to do with ads here
move along to the next one another
animation frame more ads a value each
script there's an ads there and let's
have a look
readystate change so there's something
going on where there's some presumably
some ajax in and we get some pars HTML
here so that implies that there's
something that's being lazy loaded in
but that's causing a massive recalc
style which is pretty pretty intense
actually like 117 millisecond again this
is all locking up the the main thread I
actually went through the timeline and I
think this is a really good exercise for
everyone to do is go through a timeline
recording and start marking out exactly
what's going on so in this case I've got
there's a shower brain some visitor
tracking there's some some add stuff the
the Guardian itself is doing a bit of
setup over multiple request animation
frames there's a whole block here that's
just garbage collection collecting the
garbage taking the trash out I say trash
in England it's rubbish one of the
interesting ones is this recalc style
you can see that it's recalculating the
style then triggering a layer forcing a
recalc style triggering a layout and
this is a really bad state for us to be
in however it is third-party code and so
there's only so much that you can do I
think the thing to remember is that when
you're running third party code it's
running alongside your code and
everybody's got contention for the main
thread that one thread that everybody's
on and so it's a bit like that time I
had 10 people in a five person tent that
was just awkward so there we go i think
the the majority issues that they're
facing our to do with scrolling
performance and the fact that this code
is not running at a time that's
convenient for the browser for the user
really you know web performance has
never just been about page load it's
also about things like animations and
about responding to user taps and things
like that so I take a look at that if
there's a way to just differ that a
little bit more to when the user isn't
interacting don't forget you can
subscribe you should do that do it doing
it well done well don't you clicked it
well done yay and you can submit your
site's also a good thing to do and I'll
take a look at them and I will catch you
next time yes come on throw a dart they
said it'll be easy they said you ready
miles off next time next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
