welcome back to the polycast show so
today as part of you know popular demand
I'm going to be covering the topic of
using redux with polymer so a lot of
people have asked for this you know how
do you manage state in a big polymer app
and you share state between all of your
components so I thought it'd be cool to
try and tackle this subject now Redux
itself is a very big topic so I'm not
going to be able to you know cover every
single facet of it today in the show but
I will link to some some content down in
the show notes some some educational
materials you can learn more about Redux
on your own time I'm going to try and
give sort of a short synopsis of how
Redux works and then we'll look at how
we can build a very very simple polymer
app using the Palmer Redux behaviors so
follow me over here from my laptop I've
got a little presentation that I've put
together for you to try and explain
conceptually what Redux is in kind of
how it works so when you're building a
Redux app your app is going to be
composed of views if we're using polymer
you can think of these as your polymer
components okay now a view in redux
planned it's typically going to be the
kind of component that maybe have a few
components sort of like aggregated
inside of it so every button and you
know drop-down and things like that
those might not all be hooked up to
redux
but maybe the component that like holds
all of those children together you know
sometimes in polymer we refer to these
as mediator components if you use react
before they're often referred to as
container components these sort of
components that aggregate a few very
simple children will be connected up to
our Redux system so we've got our view
and what happens inside the view is it's
going to listen for changes so today on
the show we'll be building a little
friend list thing so someone can like
add a friend and hit a button we'll save
it to a list right so the change there
would be the user clicking on that
button and adding a friend so what
happens is our view is going to when it
hears that user action you know it hears
somebody clicked on that button it's
going to dispatch what in redux plan is
referred to as an action an action is
quite simply just a little object that
has a type so some sort of like string
constant in this case add friend and
then usually like I
like a payload value of some kind so in
this case our firm that we're going to
add will be named Eric right so we
dispatched that action in response to
the user clicking a button or something
like that that action then gets handed
off to you this thing called dispatcher
dispatcher is actually what sort of like
takes that action object and it hands it
to what are called reducers or in this
case we're going to build one big
reducer a reducer is a function that you
know looks at the current action that's
coming in and then based on that action
type and based on the payload in that
action it generates some new state for
our application now the interesting
thing about Redux is that it takes all
the state for your app and it keeps it
in one big top-level object right so so
any change in you know any any action
just batch by any component is going to
update that one big state object so
inside of our reducer what we're going
to do is we're going to look at the
incoming action so in this case the
action type is addfriend we might run
some code you know we might uh you know
push something into an array or
something like that as part of our state
and then finally we'll return that state
to the outside world
now both dispatcher and the reducer live
inside of a structure called the store
and normally when you're building a
Redux app you'll have these components
that subscribe to updates from the store
using the polymer redux library that
were going to be working with today
that whole subscription flow is actually
going to be automated for us but
basically what happens is the reducer
says hey I've got some new state based
on the action that just happened and
then the store says cool I've got that
new state I will now hand it off to all
the views that are listening to me now
the cool thing about this is we don't
have to limit this to just one view
because we have this one big store we
can have multiple views listening to
that same store right so component over
here can do some updating you know it
can change something in dispatch in
action and then these other components
around it can also get that new state so
that way we don't have components that
are trying to talk to one another which
is nice we keep them decoupled instead
all the state just sort of flows into
them unidirectionally right so
everything we're going to do today is
actually gonna be one-way bindings
because we're just going to go in a sort
of little loop here alright now I know
that that's a lot of like weird abstract
theory how about we get into our code
editor we actually
writing some code and hopefully that
will help some of us make a bit more
sense so follow me over here to Visual
Studio code and I've got a vegetable
project set up the first thing that I'm
going to need to do is actually go into
my terminal I'm going to run Bower
install save Turner puller redux
I've actually got that already installed
in my application right so skip that
step and the next thing we're going to
do is we're actually going to use NPM to
install readex itself
saluté NPM install - Jeff Save Redux
write metal then pull down the Redux
library to our application cool so those
are really the only two dependencies
that we're going to work with today and
now in Visual Studio code we've got our
power components directory and we've got
our new modules directory with all of
our dependencies set up for us alright
I'm going to set up a little index.html
file then and I've already kind of
stubbed this file out this should look
pretty familiar to you if you work with
polymer before so the first thing that
I'm doing is I'm pulling in our web
components polyfills and then I'm making
sure that Redux is included in the page
and then I've got a couple elements that
I'm going to build today friend counter
friend input and friend list
I'm just including the imports here so I
don't forget and then I've got the
actual elements themselves commented out
down here so as I'm implementing each
one I will comment these back-end you
can see the results okay so let's start
by defining our Redux store the thing
that's going to be consuming actions and
generating the state for our app now the
way that I typically do that is I'm
going to create a Redux store HTML
import and inside of this you know just
like we're working with any other
polymer element we're going to import
polymer redux okay and then we're going
to create a script tag inside of the
script tag the first thing that we want
to do is we want to generate sort of the
initial state for our application so
this is you know just just sort of like
the user hits the page for the first
time what does the app look like so I'll
define a Const and I will say initial
state equals an object and this is a
really simple app so we're going to say
the only state that we initially have is
this empty friends array okay next I'm
going to define our reducer so I'll say
that my reducer is going to be a
function that
takes state and action okay and then
typically what you see with reducers is
they go through and they usually make a
switch statement and so they say they
suppose do a switch case based on the
action that is coming in at the current
moment so we're going to say all right
so based on the actions coming in what
kind of state do we want to return let's
see so if there's maybe no initial state
or anything like that
let's actually go ahead and return our
initial state so if no state was passed
in will return the initial state okay
then we can switch on the actual action
that was passed absolutely switch for
action type okay and in the app that
we're going to build today we're only
going to have one action type it's going
to be add four in so let's say all right
cool so if action type is add friend now
we want to do something to modify our
initial States we're going to take our
initial state I'm going to sort of like
move it to the next phase right we're
going to add whatever frame was just
passed in now in redux but what is often
done is you'll have make sure to sort of
like copy your state
so rather than mutating the the one big
global state object you try and make it
immutable so you actually copy it and in
that copying phase you might insert
whatever changes you have right so every
time you're modifying the stage of
creating a new copy of the state and
you're adding whatever changes you want
to do so I'm going to say friends equals
state friends got slice zero so I'm
making a copy of the current friends
array and then we're going to say
friends dot push and in this case we're
going to be pushing in the the new frame
name from our action so say action dot
friend she met him to our friends array
so that would be you know we just be
pushing in a name like Steve or Eric or
Monica or whatever and then the last
thing we're going to do is we're going
to return the new state object now the
pattern that I've often seen done in
Redux goes a little something like this
you do an object if I take an empty
object and take the current state so
we're taking the current state for
copying it into a brand new object and
then we take whichever a little mutation
that we're doing based on our
that'll be the last thing that we copy
them there so we'll say the last thing
we want to copy em is this new friends
array that we've created okay this is a
pretty straightforward simple reducer it
only has one action that it supports but
we can add multiple actions to this we
could add you know remove friends we
could sort friends the cool thing about
this is it kind of just like scales
infinitely which is really nice now the
next thing we want to do now that we
have our initial state and our reducer
is we want to create a store and we want
to create a behavior that we can hand
off to all of our polymer elements so
let's say our store is going to be equal
to Redux dot create store I pass it our
reducer and then we're going to say
Redux behavior equals polymer Redux and
we'll pass it our store so if I haven't
made any typos I believe this should
create a behavior for us based on that
store that we generated and now we can
mix that into our different elements and
they'll just get notified whenever we
update our data so let's try that out
we'll create a new element here called
friend counter and first we want to do
in this element is going to make sure
that I'm pulling in polymer so pull and
polymer and I want to make sure that I
pull in that Redux store that we created
so we'll import our Redux store and now
we're ready to start stamping out this
new element so we'll call our element
friend counter and the only thing we're
going to do with the filaments we're
just going to display the current count
of friends that the user has so
basically just taking the count from
that friends array from our store we
want to make sure that we mix in our
Redux behavior
say behaviors Redux behavior like so
okay and then the only property that
we're going to have or will have two
properties actually so we'll have one
which will be a property for our friends
that gets passed them it'll be friends
sent array and the the one piece of
unique syntax that the reject behavior
is going to give us is this thing called
state path
I'm going to set that equal to you
friends so what state pass is doing is
it's saying okay what is the the path
how do I link this property up to you
know the the one sub property in that
big global state object so for instance
because we have that big state object
and friends it's just an array right off
the root of that object our path is just
friends but it could be you know nested
you can do something like if you were
looking for user dot address right you
could do something like that that right
here right so you can kind of work down
sub properties if you need to to link up
the property miss element to your big
state object in this case because
friends is right on the root of our
state object we can just say our state
path is right there okay so that is
going to connect our element to the
friends array now the next thing I want
to do is I want to compute a property
based on the the total number of friends
that we have so I make another property
called friend count this is going to be
a number and so like should be computed
and we'll give it a computing function
called cute friend count friends that
and compute friend count function takes
that friends array and you're going to
return friends dot like pretty simple so
now in our template we're going to just
say we'll have an h3 in here and we'll
say you have friend count little Alexis
okay so let's go back to our index file
friend counter is already ready to go
this will uncomment it in the body go
back to the google chrome's refresh the
page you can see right here it says you
have zero friends oh but we can we can
you know play around with some of that
initial state if we want to we can go to
the reject store we could say okay well
I have a friend Monica is my friend
right so we can change the initial state
in our app we can go back and verify ah
we have one friends now cool you know so
that way we know that the initial state
is working and it's being piped to that
element let us then modify that state so
let's now create a component that'll let
us
some more friends to the sarey and
hopefully what that should do is update
the count in our friends counter as well
so I make a new element called friend
input and I'm just going to steal LAN
ports from friend counter and grabbed
Palmer I'll grab the Redux store move
that over there root so friend input got
to make sure to not forget our Redux
behavior I forget this all the time as
I've been working with this thing I've
realized that's probably the me mistake
I make it forget the behaviors I'm like
how come nothing's working
why it's not updated so I'm going to
make sure the rejects behavior is there
and this element we're going to have
basically two very simple things we'll
have an input field so someone can type
in a friend named and I'm gonna give it
an ID of field here we go and we will
also have a button this is add friend
okay and we'll say when someone will
give it a button handler on tap someone
clicks the button we will run the add
friend function
now the next interesting thing that the
Palmer rejects library gives us is it
gives us a way to sort of like like take
a the what in redux are called action
creators and actually just sort of like
make them part of our components and
sort of predefined the actions that this
component can spit out to the rest of
the world so we do that by adding an
actions object the same way that we add
like a like a properties object and add
actions object so the actions object
here I'm going to have an action called
add and that is going to be a function
and it's going to return an object and
the selection is also going to take like
our new friends name so we're going to
return an object the type will be add
friend add friend and the friend will be
that name value that we pass in okay so
far so good now the last thing we're
going to do is we will implement this
add friend function this thing that
happens when you click on the button and
what that's going to do when we
implement it is it's going to basically
get the value from our text field and
it's going to dispatch this action right
here so so down here we'll say add
friend is function
first it's going to say alright our
field is equal to this dot dollar sign
that feels so we can reference it more
easily right I will say if the field has
value you know someone just like clicks
a button and there's nothing in there we
don't want to do anything but if they've
typed a name then we're going to say
this dot dispatch ad and we're going to
pass in field value right so that will
trigger this action creator right here
you'll pass in the name and it'll
dispatch this object to our reducer so
dispatch add friend with our friends
name that'll go to our Redux store which
will run the switch statement it will
say what action was it through that
friend and then let me find the action
dot friend property and push that into
the new state that's what we're doing
there right so we're going to say
dispatch frame value and then we'll do
just like a little bit of cleanup will
also say field dot value equals null to
clear out the text field and then we
will also call field dots focus to
return focus to the field after
someone's clicked on the button all
right
see if this one works on the first try
so we got to do go to our index page put
the friend input back in there
alright refresh the page okay cool like
I'm able to input here so my initial
state says I have zero friends and add
Monica add friends and Oh totally busted
what did we forget forgot something oh
hi Barry this dispatch is not a function
okay friend input all right where'd we
go wrong add friend function on video to
262 Redux behavior we got the Redux
behavior hmm
all right in here somewhere hold on
folks we're going to fix this ah wait
wait there it is behavior is Redux
behavior all right try that again
Monica bad friend
we have one friends right now we can't
see the friends right now we're not
displaying our friends list but we can
sort of tell the things are working
because as I'm adding friends to that
array is updating our friend account so
the last thing one view is just
a friend list element that will display
all the friends as we add them so we
will grab our two imports from our
previous elements grand new one called
friend list this one will be pretty
simple so the friend list just like we
did with the front counter and the
properties object we will say hey I
would like to have friends object the
type is right the state path is friends
we make sure to include our behavior
look here behavior Redux behavior that
is going to hook us up to the Redux
store and then the last point of view is
creating ul and then a little template
with a Dom repeat but is equals Dom
repeat will say that the items that
we're going to pass in again that we're
using a one way binding here the items
is going to be friends and we will say
we will rename each item to just friend
like so and then I'm going to create a
little list item that and I will type in
the friend okay save that go back to our
index file uncomment the friend list go
back here refresh the page so we don't
see anything just yet we had a friend
Monica boom there we go
one friend two friends three fan cooled
so now we've got three elements they are
all receiving data from our global data
store but the nice thing is those three
elements do not have to you know talk
directly to each other or anything like
that they all work in essentially the
same way they all take part in the sort
of unidirectional data flow so all any
of them have to do if they want to
change something is they just dispatch
an action and we influence that action
as part of our reducer that updates of
the state for the app and then everyone
displays the new value so that about
covers it for today I mean this was a
pretty quick and dirty introduction to
using Redux in polymer and there's
probably a bunch of questions that you
have and a bunch of things you would
like to see so please please please
leave some comments down below and I
will try to maybe tackle some of those
you know feature requests and whatnot
in the next episode I definitely wanna
keep it
bring some of this looking at how we can
like share actions do asynchronous
actions other cool things like that as
always you can also contact me on a
social network of your choosing thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you next time hey folks what's up it is
