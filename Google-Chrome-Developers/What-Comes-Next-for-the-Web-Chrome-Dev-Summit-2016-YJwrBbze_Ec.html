actually worked out their bonuses yet so
it's fine
hi everyone my name is Paul Kinlan it's
great to see you all here I've had a
really great two days actually as
everyone had a good two days yeah
everyone's been super awesome I really
like the conversations I go in
honourable lunch over the breaks as well
there was a question about before about
kind of web cereal and stuff I saw
that's a big one that a lot of people
are asking for and it's kind of cool
that you can go up to the chrome
engineers and actually pitch him for it
so I think it's pretty cool but anyway
I'm here to talk about the what comes
next
o be all right I think we'll get out
pretty soon it should be pretty cool
like the thing I was gonna say was that
this part of the talk needs ton before
this in fact this part of the talk was
supposed to be just after Jake's talk
and Jake were supposed to talk about all
the practical things right the things
that we want to see from the future the
web in terms of like the infrastructural
elements you know the improvements the
serviceworker the improvements the
network stack with fetch and background
sync all these types of things and then
I get to talk about all the kind of the
showbizzy things right like we're VR and
all type of stuff so like this was me
experimenting with it in my I think 2009
2010 or something and it didn't work in
the slightest so I just whatever I was
coming it was kind of fun to play around
I thought I got I risk oh I've got
canvas I'll be kind of cool nothing
worked I'm terrible but anyway one of
the things I'd like to talk about and I
was trying to think about how we frame
this talk is that if you think about
it's like back to two years ago alec
crystal was talking about wander or a
year ago Alex Russell was talking about
like distribution is the hardest problem
in software right and the web for us is
actually a great way of actually
distribute not software because you just
click on the link and go to the places
and if you've got any experience helping
your grandparents or if you have ever
worked in like an inflight in a big
enterprise like you'll get these types
of experiences where you have to go
through and you have to go install the
applications and go and download them
and it's just such a nightmare I know
like who who worked in is anyone worked
in enterprise deployment at all a couple
of people like it's an absolute
nightmare you build big pieces of
software to deliver to enterprises then
you have to get on site and have massive
teams to go out and build all this
infrastructure and one of the things I
liked and when I used to work for
Spearin years and years and years ago we
moved from this type of model into kind
of the web type of model and for us that
was great right we could just go to the
user and saw their the customer and say
go to this URL and login with your
account details and you'll get this
experience it was a really great model
for everyone but the interesting thing
was like we knew at the time it was like
way less capable the browser no although
you had ActiveX and a bunch of other
stuff the browser didn't do a lot of the
things that you'd expect in native
applications through our native
experience at that point but we trade
that traded that off like we just said
the model for delivering this software
out to users and all they liked the
enterprises and any user that's out
there is like it's way better than the
model that existed in the past and I try
to think about this model of like
distribution right so in the 1970s you'd
buy an apple machine and you'd build it
and have to construct it yourself and
take it home and then you have to
program the software that was on it and
then later in the 80s you could go to
the store and buy the software there and
by the 90s the web came in right and
like that's the start of the change I we
like you could build webpages that were
based on CGI at this point with a little
bit JavaScript occasionally and then
actually start to build interactive
experiences where you know immediately
you got a lot of value from like the web
I think that's quite powerful but at the
same time like native platforms are
starting to catch up right native
platforms especially the time around
like like specifically the iPhone came
out is that you know we obviously we
waited a little bit longer but for
native applications to come through this
but like at that point in time we got to
the bit where the web is great everyone
likes the distribution model of the web
we need to solve this for the platforms
that we're ship and at the moment and
obviously things have changed like app
stores come along and in the future like
chat applications and other kind of
different social media or not social
media but like different types of
experiences will enable people to
distribute software more effectively and
I think and I want the web to play a
massive role and kind of make like be
everywhere in all these platforms and be
the key reason why you'd actually deploy
on the like deploy software because the
web is a great model but the way I was
trying to think about this again was the
reason why a lot of people and at least
when you speak to a lot developers why
they moved to the native platforms and
went with like native kind of as a
native hardware native api's was it's
kind of weird right like
the iPhone first launched the web was
the way that you delivered the software
right everyone said like this is the way
you're gonna build applications they
introduced a whole bunch of new API eyes
that were media queries local storage
web sequel app cache you know there's a
whole bunch of different API is that got
launched to support the ability to
deploy kind of comprehensive software on
the web through mobile devices but then
everyone was like yeah that's cool but
we want like these native API eyes we
want this kind of ability to have a
distribution platform light and then
that took off and at the time the web
was just like well catch up at some
point and it kind of like continued on
for a long time without that much change
right we thought we had all the
primitives on the platform to be able to
deliver a comprehensive and compelling
experience but like it wasn't until kind
of I guessed all these numbers by the
way about 2012 i'ts we didn't actually
have I think 2013 was when chrome came
to Android at this point but we didn't
have like a compellingly competitive
mobile browser ecosystem at the time and
we weren't pushing out all the kind of
defeat is that we needed we knew we
needed to solve payments we knew we need
to solve all these other pieces but we
didn't really have the kind of the
emphasis behind it to do it at the time
so I was thinking about like what is the
game plan for the web and my right so
the whole thing about this is you have
you seen a presentation by Paul Lewis
weight draws like these are most amazing
pictures he has custom slides for every
single thing was like I'm gonna do
better than that I'm better than Paul
Lewis so I bought an iPad and a pen and
that is all I could do so anyway the
whole idea behind this was that ie was
thinking about like what is the mobile
web game plan and at the time and like
the last three or four years maybe three
years at least anyway like it's kind of
everyone's like incentive to say we just
need to catch up with native right we
need to have a whole bunch of these
features where we know that natives
doing it it's obviously is very hard to
kind of get this all going with the
specification groups and you know other
browsers kind of collaborate in but you
can start to see a trend right you can
start to see more kind of involvement
across the ecosystem say yeah we watched
this one we need to geolocation
JavaScript came through straight away
but you know we didn't have access to
the camera so we've got getusermedia we
got all these are the different API is
coming through we're not kind of
completely compatible across the entire
browser ecosystem on them at the moment
but we have the
to try and solve those problems and I
think it's interesting that we are
reaching more of kind of the native
parity at the moment which is kind of
cool so actually lost the slide I was on
sorry so this is the kind of the graph
I've got is like like we've got all
these new api's coming in I think it's
quite compelling that you know we've
started to see a massive change in the
industry but there is still a lot more
to think about so we've got things like
UFC like geo locations one big one we've
recently moved out to the kind of HTTPS
only it annoyed a lot of people that we
made that change but we think it's the
right thing to do for your users
security cameras which is kind of cool
like the interesting thing about cameras
on I'll talk about cameras in a minute
is like we do have access to the ability
to do inline camera access we also have
the ability to fall back as well so if
you have like native camera application
like on iOS you can choose to you choose
that again limited only to HTTPS and
this is a common theme across all the
new API is coming through to the
platform is that they have to be on
HTTPS we think they're powerful we want
you to use them but they have to be
secure and you know users have to be
able to trust like you know trust the
trust them
at that point and again an extension for
the camera microphone again same
restrictions you have to go in HTTP has
to be user per user granted permission
from there we had the battery status
again this is a little bit contentious
it's been removed from some browsers at
the moment but the idea is you can
understand whether you know people can
access the hard like people are actually
trying to power the device so you can
maybe give a different experience if the
user is low on power you can say hey
we're not gonna do all the kind of fancy
animations I don't think people are
actually using that API this way at the
moment I don't think many people are
using that API but like that's why
therefore at the time we have
permissions on the platform so you can
actually build compelling experiences in
terms of like we know that you've got
access to geolocation I'm not gonna try
and prompt for geolocation straightaway
so you can understand the state of the
permission model that the users accept
it like there's a lot more things to add
into this but you can start to provide
more compelling experiences and this is
especially important when you're kind of
building full screen applications as
well
we have networked information a lot of
developers especially when we've been
out to India or ask you like we want to
understand the type of the network that
the user is on so we can adapt the
experience I don't think we're actually
using this to our full advantage at the
moment we've got things like a thing
called downlink max which basically says
hey we know that the user is on a at
least a 2g connection or at least what
you know they can have
the speed of the 2g connection you know
you might want to do something with it
and again I don't think that many people
are using it right now but you can start
to think about how you can adapt your
user interface and your experience to
the needs of the user based on the types
of network that they're on I think
that's quite compelling you know got
autofill it's kind of boring really hard
to get people excited about autofill but
we know that it improves the overall
experience of the web like for users
we're trying to fill in data
everyone hates keyboards fill in forms
we really encourage people to use
autofill but no one really does but like
that will change over time I think
because we know it has a measured and
improved benefit for users at that point
then obviously we saw the credential
management API yesterday I think that
was actually really cool right though
you can get one tap sign in and have it
synchronized across all your devices
that type of experience is a really
great experience especially when you're
thinking about kind of cross device
cross form factor conversion at that
point and then obviously the payment
request API would be great to see
whether this comes through and you know
how it's kind of supported across
multiple platforms but my whole bit
about this is that I rethink and I think
Zack said this yesterday is that you can
start to think about amazingly
compelling guests check out flows once
you know that the browser supports the
credit card information or the payment
kind of has the payment information that
you can provide across platforms or at
least across the unit across the device
then once you know that you potentially
got that you can start to think about
well I don't actually need to sign the
user in to be able to get them to make a
payment I can just take the payment and
then ship them the deeper ship them the
product after the back of that which I
think is powerful and obviously push
notifications everyone's been talking
about push notifications for a little
while now we know that this actually has
a material impact on people's kind of
engagement and revenue and you know re
interaction and everything and it's
great for on the special mobile it works
when the browser is closed you know I'm
not gonna talk about this too much today
but like this is one of those powerful
API is where we don't need to build a
full-on progressive web application to
actually start to take benefit what make
a like receive the benefit of actually
seeing this API or using this API at
least then obvious you've got offline
support right we've been talking about
kind of building these offline based
experiences for a long time now we've
got the kind of the tools in the
platform across most of the pot most of
the platforms and even if you want to if
you want to fall back to FK sure we
don't encourage it you can actually
start to think about how you build these
experiences and it's not just about
offline full offline support it's about
kind of thinking about the resilience of
your application in terms of like kind
of an adverse network at that point I
think is pretty powerful and finally we
get like this whole idea of installed
ability you get to the point where
if you meet all the criteria if we think
your application should be installed or
could be installed then you know you let
the user say hey we can install this and
it will be on the user's device working
like a kind of a native application well
at that point and we think that's pretty
powerful we think it's pretty good but
the thing is I just it's just a big list
of API right like we're just talking
about these different kind of API is one
after one after one we know that the
next API that we need to build is the
most critical API that we need to solve
and I think that's the thing I'm trying
to say here is like we did a whole bunch
of API is that we kind of thought we
kind of called start off with getting
camera access great but it wasn't until
the last maybe two years we've had to
say well actually we want to build these
resilient applications that like great
in this in the face of adverse not works
and actually get to the point where we
need service workers we need to make
them installable we need to know that
users want to get re-engaged and through
push notifications it's been a lot more
tactical about how we actually start to
implement those api which i think is a
good thing but it's like kind of it's
hard to actually see that strategy kind
of playing out like the thing that i
want to get to this point though is like
it could still get to the point of like
everything is just a random api that we
start to build like it could be that
like i'm not putting out the web serial
api we know that there's use cases for
things like the web serial api but we
have to think tactically about how those
how we bring those like API to the web
because there are some really important
things we need to get done and the thing
is like we don't want every single api
to be like hey native has got this i'm
actually talk about some of these and so
I'm kind of a contradicting myself a
little bit we know that like the native
platforms about this we're not gonna
implement this directly we should think
about how we want to kind of have them
in the context of the web and the
context of the web is the thing that I'm
kind of interested about and we were
thinking about it on the chrome team a
while and they don't really like people
using this acronym at least cuz it's an
acronym and like if you've ever been to
a chrome dev summit you get rail you get
amp you get Peter beware the world is
full of acronyms at the moment but the
reason why I like this one is slice is
that it at least codify some of the
reasons why I think the web is important
the benefits the web that other
platforms don't necessarily have so
slice is kind of simple you secure the
idea is that we've got an overly
restrictive permissions model and a
security model wherever this sandbox you
know in the past we've had some issues
but the idea behind this is you don't
automatically get access to everything
on the user's device you know you have
to
do it kind of you want access to the
camera you have to ask the user for
access to the camera like those types of
things so it's secure it's sandbox you
can't just go and pull out data from
another website that the user might have
been to like the whole can the web
ecosystem is kind of conscious about
security and I think that's a very kind
of cool thing for our side of things
the web is linkable it's really hard to
find a set of links of the last two days
which haven't been interested in this
force but the idea behind it is like we
have these links once we have the links
we can do really interesting things of
them like we can build these types of
sites we can build indexes we can build
news like use the white combines calm
because because it's a link we can go to
it and we can do things with it and then
once you think about the things like you
do with it like index ability right
that's the heart of Google for our point
point of view is like it's indexable we
can go and archive and organize and
aggregate the world's information
provide I don't know does anyone else
know what that you know what the our
mission statement is sorry I'm pressure
point to my boss here no cool that's the
one but like that's the whole point
right is like we can go out discover the
data it's an easy possible manner sorry
about that by the way it's an easy
possible manner we can start to
understand it and we can do interesting
things because it was indexable because
it was linkable and then the idea behind
it is like the next way is like and we
know this from kind of the whole starte
the Ajax era was its composable we can
take you know we take like JavaScript or
somewhere we can take an iframe
I don't pulled in like that i frame
thing before but we can start to mash
together and build interesting
applications just off the fact that
other interesting applications of
components exist on the web I think
that's incredibly powerful and then I
think like the whole idea behind the
ephemerality this is the Guardians
mobile I think we were out in one of the
breakouts before the goat guardians
mobile labs experiment of like ill
delivery you news via notifications you
go in you install it you forget about
the webpage you never have to go back to
the webpage to start experience in these
applications like it like normally the
web lives and dies when the Browse tab
closes serviceworker changes that a
little bit but like these types of
experiences we can build where we say
like I'm gonna use it once and in this
case I was using it this wasn't for
breaks it but like it was on for brexit
and we got to it I fell asleep I got all
my notifications I saw
greg's it play out via notifications
once I kind of cried a little bit and
then current like close everything it
was closed it was gone and never
received another notification again and
I think that's a very powerful model for
the web is we don't have to think about
these experiences where you have to go
off install it and start to use it just
to get some experience out of it like
you can live and die with kind of how
you want to but the thing is like slice
is just a model right it's it doesn't
cover all the other benefits that we
know of the web right it's accessible
she'll be available for everyone to work
on and use irrespective of kind of like
whether they can actually see it where
they can hear the kind of the
experiences from it or even actually
interact with it
it's installable like it's available
it's deployable like it's composable
like there's a lot of even more though
I've said composable once before but
like there's lots of different kind of
properties that we know the web to be
that actually just don't make this
acronym make a lot of sense like if you
think about it we've got this idea of
like huge amounts of different
properties like but this is things
actually I speak to one of the PMZ of
the day like I've got this massive
ecosystem right and the thing I liked
about the way he was phrasing this like
it's a massive ecosystem you could pull
in from all these other tools from the
random around the web you know lots of
other web developers are building on it
if one of those kind of industries goes
away it's fine right because more people
can come back in and likewise there's no
one owner for it as well so you get to
the point where excuse me you get to the
point where there's no one owner for the
web it means you not find a gatekeeper
you've not kind of controlled ultimately
by their whims at that point we can go
out deploy it and as long as you give
the person the link they can access that
link they can start to experience your
experiences and I think that's
incredibly powerful so for me one of the
things I was trying to think about is
like if it's not just about a feature
race what is it about well we've done
have been doing a lot of work and I
think over the last two days we've seen
submit by trick buyers and they've won
as well is we want to smooth out the
platform we do definitely want to reduce
the feature gap but we want to do it in
a way that enables brand-new styles of
content and using like new levels of
interaction that we're never gonna see
from any other platform unless it's the
web so one of the things I was thinking
about the smooth line now at the
platform this is the second image I drew
with the iPad I was actually quite proud
of it everyone else hates it but the
idea is like you have this like kind of
level of lumpiness right like the web is
not even not every single browser
implements every single feature in his
webbed about
as we quite frequently find that really
really frustrating but the interesting
thing for us is like there are really
big things and some of these big things
I'm gonna talk about today like things
like Bluetooth or es6 like you know that
it's not there but you can kind of see
it right so you can kind of ignore it
and go around it and say when that
becomes ubiquitous I'm gonna start to
use it but then there's like the really
frustrating things like things like
flexbox where there was two different
implementations of flexbox and it's
really hard to work out which individual
browser support which individual version
of flexbox and which syntax like those
types of frustrations really kind of
they frustrate developers means that you
can't build great experiences for your
users that are responsive and accessible
for everyone so one of the things that
we've been trying to do is like smooth
out some of those rough edges and the
first one and it's one of the most
recent is like position sticky is like
one of the ones that developers have
always wanted right they've wanted the
ability to say anchor an element to the
top of the viewport and we had it in
chrome and everyone's like that is great
right
Apple have got it Chrome's got it I
think Firefox had at the time and we
were like yeah it doesn't start that
performance so we're gonna remove it by
removing it at that point I mean it
might have been the right thing to do
ultimately you know we got to the point
where it wasn't a compatible right so
people couldn't use it you couldn't rely
on it so you couldn't build the types of
experiences that you know like this is
not a great experience of where you
might want to use it but you couldn't do
it without JavaScript at that point you
either have to include it or not include
it and for developers that is actually
really frustrating part of the
experience for them and then we get this
idea of things like intersection
observer right we know that the web is
slow when you scroll and you're trying
to kind of keep something in the view or
know when something has gone into the
view now this isn't necessary about
bringing like ubiquity to the platform
because I think Chrome is the only one
that implements intersection of
intersection observer at the moment but
the idea behind intersection observer is
like we want to kind of provide a level
playing field for performance as well so
you can start to understand when
elements come into the viewport and when
they leave the viewport so then you can
do your kind of your room or you know
whatever you want do with your whether
it's ads or whether it's one of the
types of logic as well which i think is
really cool because then when you start
to thinking about the next part of the
future and like this is one of those
ones where like this is really hard to
actually see in terms of the code and
there's not a lot of detail in this I
stole this from Paul Lewis's polymer
talk which is actually was a really good
polymer summit talk which was a really
good talk but the idea behind it
is like custom elements for a long time
have been kind of talked about they've
been deployed in some browsers we didn't
deploy completely because we had a v-0
and now a v1 I think now it now is the
point on the web where a developer's
been really frustrated that they
couldn't do these types of experiences
it was completely uneven is the easiest
way of saying it at the moment and it's
great to see that you know this has come
to a lot more browsers at the moment
it's definite
the latest versions of Safari definitely
had template syntax and now they've got
custom elements as well in the shadow
Dom so like that whole part of the
ecosystem is all-stars player and it's
great to see that a lot of the browser
vendors are all starting to work
together on we know that these are the
important api's that need to get done
developers have been saying that we need
to get these api's completed and finally
we're starting to kind of get around a
picture and on that subject is there
another one is like we as on the chrome
team we made this decision to not
support pointer events I think about two
or three years ago we had said we don't
want to introduce multiple pointer
models and multiple interaction models
to the web we don't think developers
want it
Microsoft's like you know developers do
want it you know we've got this
experience they want to have one unified
model of interaction interacting with
things like touch or interacting with
things like the mouse pointer they don't
want to have to deal with all the
different ways of doing it and so
developers shouted a lot and Rick buyers
who was on yesterday was one of the
engineers who started they kind of
implement that and flesh that out and
now pointer events is in chrome so we're
trying to start to bring more
compatibility to the website like level
out that part the playing field so it
for you as a developer it makes it 10
times easy to work out whether you what
you should support and how you should
support him I think that's pretty
interesting and then also like Darren
mentioned this in the keynote yesterday
is that like we've been pushing
progressive web apps for a long long
time right and we've been saying oh I
say but the last year and a half maybe a
year now the whole idea behind it is we
want your applications if you want them
to and the user wants them to to act and
feel like a native like experience like
if it's if it's installed on the device
it should appear everywhere and if
you've actually ever installed one of
these like yes you can get it on the
home screen you can launch it and it's
in the tab switcher but that's when the
kind of the illusion breaks down after
that right like we've got a nice model
but as a massive uncanny valley at the
point of like these aren't actually
native applications on the systems they
don't live like you to live in the app
view and there's a whole bunch of other
kind of edge cases that
developers implemented a progressive web
app either with push notifications or
not has been complaining about
so what Darren was saying is like we
actually want these experiences to look
and feel like they're native and so this
is the flow that we've got I think um
this is the add to homes being flow
normally or the on screen flow normally
this is the the new kind of install flow
so we've taken the holiday of Add to
Home screen which essentially was a
bookmark on the home screen with a
special parameter that Chrome knew how
to launch the screen into a fully kind
of native model so the application is
downloaded installed it's still a
progressive web application of time
pulled everything's pulled from the web
it's not anything kind of packaged up
and everything but it's a native
application on the user's system at that
point I think that is incredibly
powerful
now you can experiment with this today
and I'll show you how to do it in a
minute but the idea behind it is like we
want to experiment with this it's a flow
that we think is going to work but we do
need a lot more feedback but once you
actually get these applications
installed is really good so one of the
kind of things that we've seen is that
we've got the like developers wanted the
or deniz at least as well wanted their
applications to appear in the app drawer
and other elements the system you are as
well so it now appears in app drawer you
can actually go and inspect like the
like the storage model of it as well so
you can see the storage storage will be
allocated to the application not just to
Chrome or the web's like the like chrome
is at the hole and then you can do a
bunch of other stuff as well so you can
force in store for stop it or install it
you know you get access to that like the
battery profile and a bunch of other
stuff so your application is ultimately
accountable versus just being
accountable to the browser at that point
I we also get deep integration with
links so if you own like in this case
airhorn accom and the user clicks on the
link to airhorn accom rather than go
into the website you'll go directly into
your native application up or your
progressive installed web application at
that point and I think that's pretty
cool because all you have to do is
update the manifest track you say how it
should actually be intercepted on the
user system and likewise for
notifications like you click on a
notification like the bugs that we had
in the system we're like you click on
the notification and you go to the
actual web app versus the thing that was
installed in the home screen which
essentially are the same thing we just
didn't know when we couldn't launch the
application at all because we didn't
know it was installed on the home screen
at that point so we kind of leveled out
that part the playing field so it's a
lot more compelling a lot more natively
integrated at that point
hey thank you the other thing as well as
we do continue to respect the launch
information as well and the interesting
thing about the launch information is
that obviously when you click on the
home screen or you click on the link or
you click on the notification you do
want it to launch in portray or like if
it's a game you might want to launch in
landscape though it's like that's
everything we've been we've had a lot of
trouble actually making sure that was
synchronized across the entire device
the cool thing for me at least anyway is
that the biggest thing is that we can
keep the application name and launch
profile on the manifest opening all that
information up to date as well so the
good thing is like if you update your
manifest right now because it's just a
bookmark we don't know whether your
application is updated we don't know
that you've changed your name or the
icons changed a little bit though such
things we now have the ability to
actually say we know it's changed we
know that the users got it installed and
we can update it across the device as
well which i think is actually pretty
powerful and the great thing is like if
you're already building a native for a
progressive native web application
that's not the words say is it if you
think you're building it progressive web
application like you don't really have
to do anything you have an optional
scope attribute and that's pretty much
it the scope attribute just says this is
the URL string but if the user clicks on
it will be opened will cause my native
application ativ application my
progressive web app to open up I think
that's really cool so it's experimental
today if you just go to Chrome flags and
search for enable improved Add to Home
screen you'll be able to get it and you
know it's it's actually really
interesting but the thing I would say is
we do want a lot of feedback around this
because we want to make sure that the
model works for users works for
developers and we can go more from there
but I did say that was kind of smoothing
out the platform I think a lot of the
things that we've been talking about is
just making developers lives a little
bit easier I do want to briefly about
kind of decrease in the feature gap
because this is where for me some of the
showbizzy things come in but the
interesting thing about the like this is
that we we're in this way attention
where there's a lot of new API has come
into the platform some of them are not
completely specified at that point like
in the past you go through chrome flags
and you enable it to test the API but
that's actually really hard for doing
kind of in this case Alex Russell saying
doing science on the web at scale like
if you want to know that an API works
with all your user base and how it works
and how users interact with it you
somehow have to get that out onto a
stable channel somewhere but if you
to the stable Channel and then
developers start finding it like the old
kind of say WebKit prefixes but the old
prefix model like that causes a lot of
problems in the long term for developers
and we don't want that to kind of happen
you want to be responsible about how new
features a new API is are designed but
tested at scale so I definitely
encourage everyone to look at Alex
whistles post on this because it gives a
lot of insight about how we're thinking
about this model but the the name and
Alex alluded to this in the panel
session is origin trials now the idea
behind origin trials is that we sit
there and go well we think that this API
is going to be important like in case of
web Bluetooth or web USB or persistent
storage that tree worked on we know that
this is like an important piece like of
the overall kind of API ecosystem it's
not fully specular I specified just yet
but we want to get it tested out you
have to sign up for the API there's
basically a link that you can go to on
any of these pages you sign up for the
API you drop it inside your web page in
this case it's a meta tag and then the
whole thing is designed to kind of I
don't say fail but it's kind of it's
designed to only run for a certain
amount of time so this is like as a
developer you know that you're opting
into this experience you know that at
some point the API will change it might
change significantly it might actually
get pulled out once we know that we
don't actually want to all
developers and users don't want this to
see this shipped on the web but the
point is that these origin trials allow
you to have that flexibility to
experiment with the API give us a lot of
feedback and then we can actually help
kind of help the specification process
move along a little bit more effectively
and why API that I want to talk about
that is behind an origin trial it's
quite close to my heart is the web
sharing API like I used to work on the
web intents API and the whole idea
behind that model was to say the user
should be in control of the applications
that they use to perform common tasks so
if you want to edit an image you would
use the image edits an application that
was on your site or inside your native
application or inside your device at
that moment the problem with it was it
was too broad we learned a lot about
building ecosystems and build an API is
where you know there it's an undefined
scope and undefined kind of range about
how big this should be we got a lot of
feedback from developers got like well I
don't want to edit and I don't want save
I'll do an edit and save intent at the
same time like it got to a point where
we couldn't feasibly deploy this API at
scale so what the thing was we said we
should go back to the drawing board and
design smaller chunks right we should
try and solve the sharing intent we
should try and solve the different kind
of aspects of what we were trying to
like in the original vision was going to
do but do it in an isolated sense so
this is the share into app or this is
sorry this is the web share API at the
moment it's a Nick origin trial inside
chrome you have to subscribe up to it
we're testing out we want a lot of
feedback around this but it's a simple
API cool it's all right in it it works
pretty well but the idea behind it is
you just share some data and then that
will be passed it to the underlying kind
of sharing information like in the case
of Android it will just do a fire
basically a send intent and then the
application picker will pick up and then
you'll be able to share the data to it
like it's got some problem still we need
to flesh out images and a bunch of other
things but the capability is there we've
got the ability to test this on sites
with every single user who say visits my
rather low traction blog at the moment
but I think it's a powerful API but
that's going from web to native right
and what we're saying is we want the web
to be across all that like the users
ecosystem so in this case we want and
this isn't actually ready yet which is
still trying to sell but like the web
hog API the idea is that your web
application should appear in the native
picker
now we're trying to do this by the web
app manifest and then also the
serviceworker as well but like this is
one of those things where the intent is
clear right we want to make sure web
applications if the user installs them
act as first-class citizens on the web I
think it's pretty powerful there's also
a whole bunch of media improvements as
well and this is where things get kind
of a little bit more interesting at
least the whole media team even working
on this idea of you know developers
don't have to do everything like we can
provide a lot of integrated experiences
with them like the user's device so the
first thing that we did in this was
about a year ago was anything that you
did if you had like it it connected
who's got an Android wear device that's
more than I thought actually that's cool
cool so if you're playing if you're
playing normally normally no one puts
the hands up but if you're playing if
you're playing some media you'll be able
to kind of that notification will get
generate doesn't use a device passed
across to your watch and then you
controlled from there the developer
doesn't have to do anything and that's
actually pretty cool you get this kind
of thing for free again kind of just
making the platform a little bit richer
for web developers we've also got the
ability to do things like background
place so you can take you can take a
like a movie file or an audio file close
the like close it down or close your
turn your phone off to go to the home
screens go talk and then you can just
like still control the web experience
but I think that's actually quite
powerful like you can start to think
Podcast applications and music
applications which you can just run like
in the background continuously still but
have the ability to control them from
the web and from the user's device and
then if you move a little bit further on
some of the rest of the way that the
media team is doing and this is one of
my faves I did a little demo on which I
think I quite like to put anyway the
idea is like capture stream right you
want to record something from a canvas
and actually record it into a movie file
right like a lot of people been doing
this to try and generate like animated
gifs and a bunch of the stuff in movies
there is a dedicated API now cameras
start capture stream it's an X it's in
Han chrome flags at the moment it's in
Canary normal anyway you basically get
the canvas you say I want to capture at
25 frames a second and in this case I'm
just gonna attach it to a video element
it's probably not the best use case to
do anything with that video element but
it's a stream you can put it onto
something that can read streams and once
you can put onto something through the
green streams is you can do things like
well I'm gonna put it on a web RTC
connection and I'm gonna send it out to
someone you know in Australia and we're
gonna kind of they're gonna be able to
see what I'm doing on the screen like
inside my kind of WebGL 3d game which i
think is pretty powerful right like it's
very hard to do these types of
experiences like on any other platform
on the web now at three or four lines of
code and you can start to stream your
experiences with your kind of friends
and family and one of the things I do
like is that you can then think about
well I've got the stream I actually want
to record it and actually kind of save
it this I can persist at the disc so
this is using the media recorder API
which takes the stream from the camera
at this point and then when the data it
kind of comes through you append it to a
blob and then you just start recording
and then once it's completed you get the
blob and in this case this is the demo
that I wrote it's a little bookmarklet
erode finds the canvas on the page
download records it stops out to ten
seconds and then downloads as a WebM
file to your hard drive at that point
they give twenty lines of code and you
can get this experience where I've not
actually seen this type of thing on the
web before record a WebGL game kind of
throw up to YouTube but it's pretty cool
and pretty powerful I think at that
point but once you kind of have the cam
like the the camera and this is the
thing that most people don't know is
like you you have the streams coming in
you've got WebRTC you can send a video
stream now you can send a canvas
directly to the user one thing that
everyone said is like we can do a lot
with the kind of the user's camera right
now we've got getusermedia which gets
that stream from the camera that's like
a camera app but we only find this out
with maybe about six months ago if you
actually capture a frame from the
getusermedia API it's only like a 10
anything it's not like a raw food dump
of the entire kind of camera frame at
that point now the thing is we've got
the image capture API it's again it's in
Canary at the moment but the idea is you
can pull in and get user media stream
say I want to take a photo and it will
give you the photo like the blob of the
photo at that point so if you've got a
21 megapixel camera in theory you'll get
a 21 megapixel image which i think is
pretty powerful the more important thing
is that you actually get to understand
the settings and capabilities of the
camera we haven't had this before right
we can take the media stream and say
what can i what can this camera do well
I can zoom in you can control the ISO
you can auto focus you can do all these
other things with it we now get that
piece of information you know we can get
that back and once you can get that
information the next thing to do is can
I do something with it well the answer
is yes roughly and it's like the idea
behind this is you if you know that the
range for zoom is that you can say well
I want to do a double zoom and the idea
here is that you know you will obviously
do the zoom and this is the video at
least anyway was trying to record the
slides and it didn't quite work but the
idea is you have the camera you change
the properties and it updates in real
time and then when you take your photo
it'll use those properties as well again
I think it's pretty powerful we can
build kind of full on camera
applications not that we need to but we
can have build following camera
applications on the web but I think
that's pretty powerful and then what the
other ones and this is this came in last
night so they said one of those ones
where I was speaking to one of the
engineers on this miguel and he was like
poor I've got this API for you can you
talk about it tomorrow so what's the API
cuz I'm gonna run over time in a run way
over time they're already he said I can
detect faces I've got an object
detection API in the future they'll do
QR codes you'll do barcodes right now it
does faces I was like nah that's not
true
you show me oh this is the code right
you basically do face detector you
detect the faces with the image that
you've just captured from the image
capture API and then you can start you
can pass it to the underlying kind of
system behind the scenes and then it
will find the faces and you get the
information that comes off the back and
I think that's actually pretty powerful
right is like I built a QR codes kind of
a couple of years ago and to get it
running at 60 frames a second it's an
absolute nightmare to do and if I have
one API that lets me do that
that is actually a really great thing
for me at that point so that kind of
brings me on for the next bits like we
have this idea of sensors behind the
scenes in terms of like face detector
sense is not really sensor but it's a
thing that is there that pulls out data
from the underlying device now there
generic sense for API is an interesting
one because the idea behind the generic
sensor API it basically provides a
common I need to get it right but like a
common abstraction for how to access
Hardware consistently inside the browser
so that the browser vendors have a way
of saying we've got all these different
API but like a gyroscope we've got
accelerometer all these different ones
like how do I kind of access them
consistently in a relatively sane and
like equal way across all the different
sensors this has been kind of in you
know in edit mode for about a year now
I think about a year and a half it's
only recently that we've started to
actually put this inside the browser and
it's on this is know I'm really proud of
that demo because I was like that's
gonna know so many people but the idea
behind it is you can have a sensor that
is like what the ambient light sensor in
this case it landed in chrome in canary
the other day and the idea behind it is
it just reads the light values from the
image sensor or in whatever kind of
sense that you've got which can actually
detect light levels at that point you
initiate the ambient light or you you
get hold of the ambient light sensor you
put a handler on it for unchanged and
then you start it and then it will
deliver changes maybe a specified
frequency if you want you know regularly
to your unchanged handler you just put
your application logic in there and you
can kind of do whatever you want the
interesting thing about this API is that
you can also poll as well so if you
don't want to have a good on change
handler always firing but you only want
to do it kind of synchronized to a frame
you can actually say well what is the
data from this sensor or what is the
value of this sensor and it will turn
the last last value and I think that's
quite interesting ambient light I don't
know how much use there is you might put
a dark mode inside your application or
you might do something super annoying
but it gets a little bit more
interesting when you think about like a
compass right a compass needs actually I
didn't realize this I just thought it
was like the Alpha component of the
orientation it actually needs multiple
sensors to be able to build a compelling
compass for the web and I Kenneth from
Intel gave me this demo which I'm
grateful I think he's up there there is
hello but the idea behind is there's
multiple sensors you need the
accelerometer and the gyroscope to
actually start to think about like how
you can actually kind of get the proper
compass
and at this point like it's quite simple
you start both the sentences up and then
you kind of forget the changes then you
kind of you saw the store the changes in
some global state and then you update
when you when you need to render at that
point it's just quite simply the logic
behind this is quite like it was harder
than I thought it was using cuarto nians
a whole bunch of other stuff but like
that whole point is like you've got two
or three sensors on the device you can
start to do really interesting and
compelling things with them once you
start to get that data through and not
necessarily you have to rely on a
browser vendor making the compass API at
that point just to actually solve those
problems I think that's actually pretty
cool I should I just talked about the
wrong slide I didn't play the video I'm
sorry but uh so that's kind of like the
newer API is coming through I think some
of them are pretty cool like some of
them a very hardware driven at that
point and the one thing I do want to try
and get across at least is that I I want
these web api is to kind of I say mimic
native that's the wrong way of saying I
want all the capabilities of the native
platforms to be available to web
developers but I don't want to kind of
like lose our soul at the point of
saying that we must have an exact parity
with those api's there are very webby
things that we can do but no other
platform can do and like that's one of
the things I think is pretty cool
especially on the whole ephemeral aspect
right is like for very short lightweight
experiences you know whether it might be
a marketing campaign that a lot of
people get asked to build or just even
things like the election users like you
don't want to have to build a native
application deploy through the stores
you just want someone to go to a URL and
start interacting with the experience
and then when something happens be able
to respond to it I think it's a very
powerful thing to do and I think if you
look at things like the physical web has
anyone interacted with any of the
physical web beacons today that's cool
quite a few people like we had Pali Mon
kind of on their physical web broadcast
the URL your phone picks it up or any
device I could actually pick up the kind
of the beacon signature at that point it
understands what the URL is being
broadcast present' you with some
metadata and user interface and then you
can start click on it and start to
interact with that experience but super
lightweight like no one's ever going to
build or install an application which is
just interact with the TV just say say
for a conference and those types of
things
the lightweight kind of en't like
ephemeral nature of these experience
especially through physical web are
really powerful but the really
interesting thing for me is like yes we
can discover
a beacon which is kind of cool a pointer
web experience but actually sometimes we
want to take the the web experience like
the like the URL that's been presented
and it actually to a physical device try
like weather it I know they would talk
about Internet of Things before but like
this is where you can start to see that
kind of the tie-in with web Bluetooth
and web bluetooth again we talked about
this last year but it's at this point
now again where it's an origin truck I
think it's not in trouble it's still an
origin troll yeah it's not an origin
problem and I thought we'd create an
origin trial so you have to enable it
and kind of excuse me you have to enable
it in kind of like you're gonna use it
which is cool it's fine the API still
might change at this point but you can
start to build really compelling
experiences you can have a hardware
piece of hardware this is the plague
plate candle vincent has been walking
around around the venue a couple times
with with the actual play bulbs and
we've had a code lab as well where you
can go and start to play with it
but the idea behind it is you know you
don't need a native application to start
to interact with that experience it
literally links to a website which then
connects through to the beacon and then
you can start or not the beacon that the
the Bluetooth device and you can start
to interact through it with it and then
you can walk away you know you don't
have to install this is a added to
homescreen progressive web app like once
you've been tracked with it you don't
have to install it again and use it I
think that's incredibly powerful super
lightweight experiences that we can do a
lot with and it's kind of interesting
right like I'm not gonna go too much
into the whole Bluetooth space but like
because I if you're not gonna build
things with Bluetooth probably I have to
understand it too much but like you have
this idea of like the the ble beacon or
the ble device broadcasting a whole
bunch of attributes there's actually as
well yeah broadcasts a whole bunch of
attributes does get through the GATT
server you have this idea of services
like your device can have multiple kind
of like super capabilities like it could
be a battery service it could be in this
case like the candle service at that
point you connect to the service and
then you can get different attributes
off the back of it so a service might
have multiple attributes like in this
case the battery service you probably
only want to ever read the battery level
but you can kind of get that and start
to read from the data and then you can
also get prompted for changes to those
data and it's actually a really simple
or relatively simple API once you
understand like how to actually start
interacting with the device and you know
like what data you need to send it and
how you should connect to it it's
relatively simple and it gets even
simpler when you start to think about
the async/await syntax as well you not
having to change promises together and
the next the next the next it's actually
pretty simple but in this case the
skooby phases you just basically called
Navigant do bluetooth request device
tell the type of service that you want
to connect to and then you'll get
prompted to say well we know that
there's the device here you want to
access it once you have to get access
you can physically connect you get the
access to the service you call what you
try and get access to the service in
this case this is for a heart rate
monitor you say I want the heart rate
the heart rate service and then you can
say well I've got the service I need to
get regular data from it at that point
so I'm gonna get the heart rate
measurement and in this case I want to
be notified whenever the heart rate
measurement changes and I think that's a
very kind of relatively easy flow just
to start getting some light weight
interactions with the device at that
point it get a little bit more complex
when you think about things like web USB
and Web USB is it's an interesting API
and again this is a demo from Kenneth
but the idea is that any like a webpage
could connect to a USB device right so
this is kind of interesting so you send
some data through slow typer press end
and then it appears on the device so
you've connected to the Vice and you've
sent some data to it but the interesting
thing is like the first thing that
people say is like I don't want a
webpage access in my USB devices and
there's a very great like medium
document by Riley grant who's the
engineer on this project who is
basically describing the security model
of web USB and whole gain to the whole
point is like not every single site or
not every single site will be able to
get access to any USB device
specifically only whitelisted sites by
the device so the device has to say this
site can access my I can actually
connect to the device and then only when
the users actually opted in and granted
it will the caption connection be made
so the idea is that you can get the USB
based experiences you can plug it in and
like the owner of the the owner of the
piece of hardware will be able to say
yes like I'm gonna build the web-based
user interface for this experience a lot
of other random sites wouldn't be able
to do that I think that's a quite a
powerful security model for the web at
this point and again the API is very
similar to the Bluetooth API rather than
Bluetooth connect request device so you
do the same thing with USB you as the
hardware vendor know your vendor ID and
all type stuff so you can connect to it
you
grants access you get the call back
through and then he actually gets really
complex right I remember a couple years
ago we tried to make an Xbox Kinect
thing for Chrome apps and he gets really
really complex we you have to deal with
the types of control methods and the
data transfer like if you're into USB or
Hardware you'll probably understand this
I don't particularly know Stan this
because I'm not kind of build a whole
range of interactions but you do get to
choose like the control method and the
data transport map making mechanisms as
well so you get a lot of control over
the device at that point and then we
also kind of start to think about the
new types of experiences like those two
experiences in theory have been quite
lightweight right you can have the
device or a thing around you you can
connect to it start experiencing with it
leave and then you that's fine right
you've not installed a new device the
web VR experience I think is an
interesting space to begin because it is
quite I don't say immature is the wrong
word but it's quite Mason at the moment
things are changing in everyone's trying
to explore what to do in the space of
web VR like who's but is any what
playstation vr one person Hailey's
people I for one they're pretty cool but
like we don't know how to use these
experiences probably don't know how to
build them properly as well so it's a
very kind of emergent market but the
chrome team is particular I've been
working on kind of making sure that you
know you can start to like build
web-based experiences that kind of a
powered by like the VR subsystem at
least anyway and it's in chrome 56 at
the moment again it's behind an origin
trial and I think the thing about Web VR
for me is not that it's gonna like like
taking over the world and everyone must
kind of use it but it's it is uniquely
positioned to be able to provide kind of
compelling experiences that are very web
like web like you don't have to install
a whole bunch of native applications
just to experience some web base VR
content and the interesting thing and if
you've yet if you've used the chrome dev
summit site is that we believe at this
point like progressive enhancement is
key to this right that you can build
experiences that live on the web are
there kind of you know for people to
interact with irrespective of whether
they have like the piece of hardware
that they need to experience a VR system
so that's pretty cool on that side of
things the way that we implemented it
and we're trying to think about how you
inspired some of these Lu VR experiences
like we're not saying right now that you
go out and build a whole bunch of games
and these the triple-eight class games
to actually you know take advantage of
web PR but it's a very much more
incremental approach so in the chrome
dev summit site we had the plate final
they mention you've got the kind of the
picture of this venue
then you had like this 2d immersive view
so if you had like a device that had
WebGL you could click on it and then you
could kind of like drag your mouse
around and scroll around the page then
you have this kind of a our view if you
had an iPad or an iPhone or any device
with a gyroscope on you'll be able to
kind of like basically move your device
around it's not complete AR it's like
faux AR at this point but any of you
have a headset and if you think the
headset got launched today you have the
headset you can pop your phone in and
then experience the web PR experience
first class so this is the experience
that we've got on the chrome dev summit
site now this is like we know that this
device doesn't have Web VR but we can
provide this emissive experience because
we have WebGL and I think that's pretty
cool because the this is the model right
the plain image view the immersive 2d
view so this is where I'm kind of I've
got my phone and I can move it around
like not every experience is gonna be
like this but it's quite powerful that
you can do that and then we've got this
idea of the full immersion right and
this is rendered using WebGL using the
web via our viewer that Boris moss on
the chrome team wrote or is in the
Google team at least I think now is that
you can basically plop your phone in you
will know that you've connected your
phone to the to the hardware at least
and then you move around and it
automatically moves into this model I
think that's actually it's actually
pretty cool right did you get to this
point of every single user can
experience your site you'd not build an
application for this experience you're
not having to get people to go install
it if they have the VR kind of
capabilities they can start to take
advantage of it pretty quickly you can
do this for videos you can do this for
images like it's a really nice way of
doing it now the thing I would say is
like you can get to this point where you
know we want to ultimately build these
triple class or triple a class types of
games I personally don't know whether
we're there on the web just yet but I
think we're getting into a good place
and the final thing I would say is that
I I want to get to this point where we
have a common understanding and it could
be slice it could be any other kind of
model going we have a common
understanding for how we want to deploy
these experience on the web the web has
properties that no other platform has
specifically around ephemeral ephemeral
free morality and the ability to link
ability and index but you can give a
link to anyone you can start to use that
experience and go anywhere the last
thing I would say is if you are
interested in obviously of the
progressive web app space and the future
development from crow
and these are new api's we do have our
developer portal on
developers.google.com slash web if you
go to slash website updates you will get
all the new AP Isis they come through
chrome but our guidance and our focus is
the new and shiny stuff is great right
it gets people excited and it gets you
inspired to actually build the next
generation things developers.google.com
slash web is our place to build like
gives you practical guidance for all the
technologies are available today so much
more focused on responsive design
performance and serviceworker and
progressive web applications and
obviously developer feedback as well so
with that I've know I've run completely
over time but I would like to thank
everyone this rehearsal right by the way
still to go so it did they say keep
going are you trying to run straight
into chrome dev summit 2017 yes
