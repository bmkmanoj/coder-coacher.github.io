WordPress I thought about having to
configure Apache and my sequel and all
these things it actually kind of scared
me and then I thought this would be a
really good opportunity to finally look
into docker and learn how docker works
in both local development and for
deployment and all these things and in
the end I have to say I have no regrets
it turned out to be a really great setup
and I want to show you how it works you
can even run this entire setup on your
machine locally before we dive in just
keep in mind that I didn't just pull
this out of a hat at the very start this
is a result of many iterations on my end
and lots of failure and lots of
frustration but in the end I had a setup
that I really liked and before we start
I think I should make sure that we all
know what darker actually is docker is a
way to run virtual machines and not just
virtual emulated machines but actually
containers like isolated from the host
system and we're gonna have two of these
containers running one for Apache PHP
and the WordPress code and one for the
database which is my sequel we can put
these containers in their own little
virtual networks so they only can talk
to each other in two nothing else and
also no other docker container that
might be running can talk to them and
we're only going to expose port 8080
from the Apache machine because that's
where the web server is running and
that's the thing that we want to talk to
so you configure these virtual machines
by writing so called docker files so in
this case we need to write two darker
felts one for Apache on PHP in WordPress
and one for my sequel so let's start
with the my sequel container we can use
the official my sequel image and if we
read through the readme we will actually
find the command that we can just copy
paste and just adjust to our needs so
the only thing that we need to change is
set the password for the root account
and we need to add it to a network so
that we have it in isolation where we
can later add on the Apache so we can
just change the command accordingly one
of the things we need to keep in mind is
that these containers
volatile so there should be throw away
and recreate able at any point in time
without creating a disturbance in the
system so any kind of data that we want
to persist between these tear downs
recreation phases we need to persist to
the host system and that's where volumes
come into play which basically is
mounting a directory from the whole
system into the container and in this
case we're going to store all of my
sequel data in one of these mounted
folders the other container for Apache
PHP on WordPress we can actually use the
official WordPress image which already
takes care of configuring Apache and PHP
to work together as WordPress expects
and just surfs up WordPress for you
again the only thing we need to worry
about is to add the network flag so that
the Mike's secret container and the
WordPress container can talk to each
other and if we run this command you can
already see that WordPress is being
served up and is completely working
which I thought was pretty amazing with
just two containers but for my
development flow I wanted to have
something more I wanted to have it hb2
because it makes websites so much faster
so to achieve that I wanted to add a
third container that runs caddy caddy is
an HTTP to server that runs as a reverse
proxy and has a very tight integration
with let's encrypt so in this case I
would run it as a reverse proxy in front
of Apache and expose a new port to it in
this case it would be 8 4 4 3 and that
means that on the port a 4 4 3 I would
get the entire app served over hb2 with
a locally signed TLS certificate while
on 8080 the old hb1 version would be
served up ok once again we start with
reading the readme of the image that we
are going to use we can copy paste the
command just into little adjustments
once again we have the port in this case
we have the configuration file for caddy
and we have as always the network flag
so the caddy ends up in the same network
as all our other two containers for the
configuration file for caddy we need to
define where the requests are supposed
to go so we need to use Caddy's proxy
command to tell that all incoming
requests are supposed to be forwarded to
a machine called pwp which is the
machine that runs
Pachi PHP and WordPress additionally
though we need to add some headers to
the forward request because the back end
needs to know that even though it's
receiving HTTP requests that they were
originally actually HTTP and that
enables a slightly different machinery
inside WordPress this is the only bit
where we need to monkey patch a little
bit inside WordPress but that's because
that's how their official wiki is
documenting this process and they don't
have this HTTP handling built in then we
need to tell Kelly that we want to use a
self-signed certificate so we don't
actually want to go let's encrypt but
just create a certificate yourself for
local development that's fine if we were
to go to production we could just remove
that line and Kathy would actually
request a real sign certificate from
let's encrypt and the entire machinery
would just work even on a real server
which kind of blew my mind that we can
just use the exact same setup for local
development and for production so if we
run this additional third machine you
can see that we now have the exact same
effect as before that everything is
working but this time it's now over HTTP
too which is amazing however we now have
three individual machines that we need
to configure and that can get quite
cumbersome and this is where so-called
orchestration comes into play for
orchestration docker has the command
docker compose we write a compose file
to describe how all your individual
machines are supposed to work together
so this is what really makes this thing
really frictionless to write or compose
file we just create a new Yano file
docker compose clusters are always in
their own little network so we don't
need to worry about the network flag
anymore and now it's basically just a
list of the machines that we need so the
first service in our docker compose file
is the my sequel service and we're going
to define the my cycle password the
image to use and the volume you want to
mount that holds all the my sequel data
the second service is the WordPress
image with Apache and PHP which also
needs the my sequel password and the
port to listen on and the third service
now is caddy which needs the image the
configuration file for caddy and the
second port that we want to expose to
the host machine so this configuration
file we can now save and run with a
command docker compose up
and as you can see if you run this
command we immediately have our entire
system set up and we can just start
using WordPress out-of-the-box so we use
docker to define our developer
environment and you just spin it up and
tear down with just one command but also
we can use it in production which i
think is pretty great next time we're
going to write our very first lines of
PHP and I'm really excited about that so
