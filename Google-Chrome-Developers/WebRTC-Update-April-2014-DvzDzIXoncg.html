updates coming to you today from
beautiful Stockholm we're going to try
and do these at least once a quarter to
make sure developers wherever you are
can get a chance to hear the latest from
the WebRTC team I'm here with Justin
Liberty who is tech lead for the WebRTC
project and Serge Alicia pelt who is
product manager for WebRTC
my name is Sam Dutton I'm a developer
advocate for Google Chrome and before we
start I just wanted to shameless
promotion relief for our new home for
sample code which is now on github the
URL just on the video now we've we've
moved WebRTC HTML CSS JavaScript samples
to github to make them easier for you to
write patches make issues any feature
requests and contribute new content and
it also makes it easier to to view the
demos the URL for that now
so we'll be adding some some new demos
considering stuff relation to testing
stun and turn servers also some work on
a party see our video chat demo we've
added some new features to this such as
stuff like audio muting and a kind of
range of UI improvements to make sure
that it works really well across
different display size of screen sizes
and we'll be moving the code for a party
C to github as well just wanted to give
a shout out to Silvia Pfeiffer's great
blog post which lists the various
options that we can use with a party C
and we'll actually be adding that to the
demo as well with them options in
addition to that stuff like controlling
bit rates and so on so um first up
getting back to the main topic what you
know what in general is in the pipeline
I just want to start with you sir
so chrome 34 is getting is going to the
stable channel this week and that one
includes a lot of improvements as usual
I'll start I'll focus first on echo
cancellation so the fixes that we rolled
out in previous chrome releases to Mac
and Chrome OS are now reaching Windows
and Linux with 34 and what we've done
here is that we were doing a basically
an extended filter for the echo
cancellation so we should be able to
catch even more edge cases that the echo
canceller did not catch previously also
on mobile we we can now use the hardware
echo cancellation of the mobile device
if present and we've turned this on for
most of the Samsung devices and the
Nexus devices that have hardware AC so
for mobile if use Chrome for mobile 34
you should be seeing a pretty pretty
impactful improvement in echo
cancellation it made a big difference
did the other big news we have for 34 is
that the developers can now add
screencasting to their web RTC
experience so if you extend your current
WebRTC app with an extension this
extension will be able to do to allow
for screencasting in in WebRTC we're
doing this because of certain security
issues with having to do with casting of
a desktop or particular windows on the
general web and we're still discussing
this as a general I guess in the general
WebRTC community on how to do this in
the most secure way so this is our first
our first release of this and companies
like uber conference and jitsi have
already added this to their to their web
RTC app so I suggest that you go take a
look at those apps if you want to an
idea of how it can work
it's the chrome choose desktop media API
thank you other quick things
opt-in ipv6 support is now available in
34 opt-in dscp support not available in
34 and Chrome OS devices that have vp8
hardware acceleration for ok it will now
be using this hardware when doing WebRTC
calls so Chrome OS devices that have vp8
hardware are usually the ARM based ones
and for those machines you'll see a
significant improvement in decode speed
so that's 434 Justin you want to run you
want to give us a preview of 35 yeah so
running right behind 34 is going to be
35 and we've got a whole slate of fix
was going into 35 we've been doing a lot
of work around bandwidth estimation and
bandwidth estimation is the kind of
magic process where we tried to figure
out how much capacity you have on your
network and send just the right amount
of video to fill you know that capacity
that you have it only goes too much well
as packets don't to send too little or
else you won't get enough video quality
this is a really tricky thing and we've
been spending on a time trying to
optimize this looking in cases where we
don't do a great job and trying to
figure out what why didn't we do a great
job and in m35 we're doing a lot better
job about making sure that the timing
analysis we do is really accurate and
this is this additional work we're doing
to make the timing right has translated
into much better bandwidth estimations
over various types of networks there's a
whole bunch of other stuff that we're
doing a whole bunch of grungy details I
want to get into right now but the
bottom line is that in them 35 you can
see even better video quality better
more varied class of networks than ever
before and so we're very excited about
that um another thing we're really
excited about is we've got a new version
of opus opus is the audio codec that is
you know our server of preferred codec
for WebRTC and it supports sort of full
band you know quality it supports all
sorts of different complexity moves it
supports stereo well in the past what we
had was
good quality but there is a high CPU
cost or higher than they really pointed
and especially on mobile especially an
arm this actually ended up being a bit
of a hindrance and so what we've done is
we've integrated the latest stuff from
the Opus team
this is Opus 1.1 and with opens 1.1 we
can have this great quality at much
lower complexity and so you're gonna see
on especially in alarm devices the
complexity of using Opus go down by half
so this is a major optimization so
overall you know open this these
improvements will happen across the
board
Nestea better quality or you'll see you
know when used an OPC lower complexity
on both desktop and mobile but you'll
see really you know that the biggest
effect would be you can now use opus
without concerns on mobile devices we've
also got in 35 a new version of what we
call net EQ and net EQ is some kind of
the magic stuff we have inside WebRTC
for adaptive jitter buffer handling and
I won't get into all the details but the
bottom line is before we did stereo the
net EQ caused a lot more complexity and
it was because the old version of that
EQ really wasn't tuned for stereo many
cues now rewritten made for the future
made for stereo it can handle stereo
much more efficiently so if you're doing
over stereo you're gonna see way better
results so we're very excited about that
for atom 35 just go through a bunch of
other minor changes turn TLS the ability
to tunnel turn over basically a TLS
socket we had this previously in WebRTC
in previous chrome releases but it
didn't work properly with you know with
TLS domains that were identified by
hostname which is pretty much the way
you always want to use it so wasn't
really usable until m35 but we fixed
that we've tested it basically turned
UDP TCP TLS should work fantastic in
chrome 35 and we've been doing a lot of
other polish on reports we've gotten
from people saying you know my mic
didn't work my webcam didn't work
they've gone through investigated these
issues made a number of fixes and I'm
thirty-five they just will raise the
overall quality of the platform
you know for Europe and they'll better
fit your application so yeah that's
chrome 35 that's fantastic it feels like
there's a lot of stuff moving towards a
more kind of adaptive responsive way of
doing business
yeah I mean we just you know we get this
report so things don't work we go
investigate it we figure out hey here's
something we didn't know about we can
try to figure out exactly what when you
do the software to deal with a
particular case we make the adjustments
we roll it out we see people they're
happy with it and we move on to the next
one and like this is the way we raise
the quality of the platform you know
just chipping away at you know
issue-by-issue
piece by piece you know fixing these
things these things there's no silver
bullet but you know we've been really
making a number of fixes over the past
year to have really made a big
difference so please continue filing
bugs continue using the discuss web RTC
list because that's really where we get
the the best feedback and and help help
us track our progress there absolutely
so well I mean one of the things I think
we've been asked about a lot from
developers speaking recently is
considering iOS and video on is is there
any kind of progress update you can give
on that yeah so this is a really happy
to talk about where we are at iOS you
know we're still in a situation where
due to the way that you know the
requirements are on the iOS landscape
that we can't ship a version of chrome
that has you know full web marquees wrap
RTC support built in and so this makes
us kind of sad but we do ship now a
version of iOS basically have
objective-c library you know with
objective-c bindings that basically
provides the same web RTC API that you
can compile and make your own iOS app
and in the past we just had support for
audio we now have full support for video
as well so we're really very close to
parody on our iOS SDK then we are with
Android with our own Android SDK and I
get it the web so like you know we're
not at a hundred percent parity we're
still have some work to do to add
support for data channels and SCTP but
this is something that we are going to
be working on this quarter you know to
basically fill in that last room
on iOS on the topic of DTLS an sctp it's
good to mention that these things are
now available on Chrome for Android as
well and also they Android a standalone
SDK so you can have ditching application
working across web and Android and very
soon iOS awesome and I know we get a lot
of questions also about you know what's
happening with the specs what's
happening now and what's what maybe
further in the future a couple of things
in particular thinking about output you
know device device selection right so
now developers will in the near future
be able to add selection of microphone
speaker and webcam directly into their
JavaScript instead of having that
managed through Chrome and so we think
that's gonna make it a lot easier for
for users to be able to change input and
output devices and also it'll allow web
developers to to customize their app to
customize that experience to their app
so that's something I think a small
thing but I think it'll have a lot of
impact on usability we got that feedback
that developers really won't be able to
manage the stuff and they're an
application present the GOI themselves
don't get that control and the API that
exists right now there's a media stream
tracked get get sources yep and this is
actually gonna change in the new version
of the spec it's a method on the
navigator object called get media
devices and whereas get sources only
allowed you to enumerate input devices
and get media devices wide and put our
numerator input and the audio output
device as well so you can figure out you
know decide which for a given audio or
buddytag what device you want that to
render to so that you know if you want
to have a headset or something you know
toggle quick link between a headset and
speakerphone you can do that with just
some JavaScript
yeah that's great news makes a lot of
sense on
object - I think the other question of
course that people are always asking
about is media stream recording yeah
yeah any any news on that yes so uh it
actually ends up being a bit more work
than we expected
we're doing a lot of plumbing right now
you know getting the ability to assert
Marshall on the estream track move it
around in the system and do that sort of
stuff we're getting that other stuff in
place so that you know when we actually
can turn our attention to media stream
recorder the API we've got all the guts
in place so right now we're working on
that and we hope to have more to
announce the next in the next updated oh
that's great that's great and I guess
maybe a good place to finish off is just
a little consideration of about TC to
point naught what is this what's
happening
yeah there's a lot of talk about like
you know where are we with the the spec
you know webrtc 1.0 or c 2.0 or there's
the thing o RTC you know basically you
know we're trying to finish that Weber
c1 point now basically get to a very
stable baseline of functionality that
all developers can say you know here's
what you can expect across browsers this
is the stuff that's fully documented you
know in the spec it fully works you know
this is the baseline you can go off
build these great applications and we
think we're very close to that at the
same time we kind of want to look to the
future and say well you know what what
are the neck where do we want to go in
the future where where's the sort of
ultimate destination for for WebRTC
and you know trying to do so maybe some
some more advanced things you know
things like simulcast layered codecs
like SBC you know how will we express
that sort of stuff well we don't really
have the right API a 1.0 yeah and so in
2.0 we wouldn't have a little more
flexibility to go to do you know maybe
maybe some different ups of scenarios
that you know now people are trying to
like way more advanced things and so on
it's still very early days but there's
this a community group called ortc and
ortc has come up with like a preliminary
sword raft specification that gives an
idea of you know how to do some of these
things like simulcast that you might
want to do in the future and you know
it's currently you know we don't you
don't know if this will sort of make it
into an eventual sort of working room
product you know we're interested in it
because it kind of matches a lot of
things that we want to do and others
there's number of other people that are
interested now we've heard that
Microsoft you know has been sort of
looking at at this at this spec as well
so overall I think there's a lot of
community interest but it's too early to
say exactly where this is going to end
up so I think that if it's something
where you're kind of looking at the
future of where wherever you might go
it's something just to take a look at
and there'll be a lot more we can report
I think in our in our next update right
right great
ok so thank you very much justin and
search and add yeah join us for next
time and yeah final plug for the the new
home of WebRTC samples on github and
please we really appreciate all your
issues and additional content and
feature requests for those and yeah look
forward to seeing you for our next
webinar to see update sometime in the
next couple of months thank you thank
you
next time goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
