manager on the chrome team and I'm here
with Maria and Robert to talk about some
of the things we've learned from
building products that can work for
billions of people so just before we
jump in as a quick overview there's
three main things that we're going to be
covering here the first is just talking
about where we found that our users
actually are and where we expect them to
be in the coming years second we'll be
talking about some of the things we've
learned from trying to make sure that
all of our products work for everyone
and third we'll be sharing some specific
tips that we have for how you can build
products that work for everyone as well
so to jump right in when we're talking
about billions of people we really need
to think about where people are
accessing the Internet and the reality
is is that internet growth is happening
everywhere so we really need to take a
global look when we're thinking about
this so this is a chart from 2014 of the
overall number of Internet users per
country
we're darker means more Internet users
and what you'll see that is that in 2014
China has a tremendous number of
Internet users with about 675 million
and then you'll see that the United
States also has quite a large number of
Internet users at slightly under half
that number but if we fast-forward a
little bit we start to see a different
story here so by 2015 you see a few
other areas light up most notably India
here was about three hundred and fifty
four million Internet users and by 2016
we still see a similar picture but we're
seeing a few other areas light up as
well with areas like Brazil having 139
million Internet users and Nigeria at
about 87 million Internet users but
what's really interesting isn't just
looking at the absolute number of
Internet users but looking at the growth
that we've been seeing year-over-year in
each of these countries so looking at
the same data a little bit differently
this is a chart of the number of new
Internet users that came online every
year and in 2014 you already see a bit
of a different picture here you'll see
that well we saw a lot of total Internet
users in the United States the new
Internet users was quite minimal and
because the United States was honestly
pretty saturated the number of Internet
users
in comparison both China had a lot of
new Internet users and India but if we
fast-forward a little bit more we see
this start to shift as well in 2015
there's clearly a dominant India here
with new Internet users and this gets
even more pronounced in 2016 last year
and if we dig into this and looking at
India specifically last year we saw over
100 million new Internet users come
online in India alone but what's really
remarkable here is that this is the
second year in a row that we've seen
over 100 million Internet users coming
online just in India and this isn't just
the case over the past couple years we
still see that 65 percent of India's
population is not yet online so
projecting forward various estimates
suggest that by 2020 there will be about
1 billion unique mobile subscribers in
India alone and this is just India
remember we saw other areas on this map
also having quite a few new Internet
users and we've seen this shift in a lot
of our Google products as well to give
one example on Chrome on Android we've
seen that we now have hundreds of
millions of Internet users from all of
these next billion user contributions
are all in our top 10 based on search
query volume for Google searches so the
reality is is that it's not just about
where our users are going to be but it's
where our users are today as a result
we've been working really hard to
improve our own products and to share
some of the things we've learned I'm
going to invite Maria on stage
one billion by 2020 right it just blows
my mind all of these people are coming
online Rahul
yesterday day before and his mobile
keynote mentioned that seven people are
coming online every minute in Brazil so
these people are going to be your future
users and a lot of them are already our
users and we've been doing a bunch of
research and also iterating on products
to make sure that we best suit their
needs
and I want to share with you a little of
the stuff that we've learned so that you
can apply it when you are building new
stuff on the web or elsewhere for your
own products now Brazil India and
Indonesia might seem like they are very
different you know different continents
different types of population languages
culture GDP but actually what we found
is that they share a few very common
things and I want to share three of
those things where you first to put you
in the right frame of mind when you're
thinking about building a product on the
web what kind of things you should be
considering the first thing that is
shared across all of these countries is
that there is a really wide range of
devices now all of us have a phone in
our pocket and probably you bought your
phone what maybe a year ago two years
ago but in India and Indonesia and
Brazil people use a lot of second hand
phones there is a queue polite range
screens storage and memory so what might
work on your phone if you're building it
and testing it on this kind of device
might not work for these users in fact
what we know is that about 33% of users
in India run out of storage on their
phone every day can you imagine this you
look at your phone and evening you're
like oh I can't take any more pictures I
have to delete something out and that's
what they do actually 83%
if people delete stuff every week to
make space for new pictures or videos or
other things so what does this mean for
you if you're building an app are you
building something else and it's large
for a small phone with limited storage
you're going to have a hard time
competing with everything else and
you're always going to be in a
precarious position if someone is
wondering okay I want to have some more
space for videos what should I delete
should should it be this two megabyte
app or should it be this 45 megabyte out
right the other thing that we found
which is shared is the very poor quality
of connection so a lot of us here on
Wi-Fi we probably don't even notice
we're completely online all the time 4G
networks really fast connections but
half of the users in India currently are
still on 2g connections and two-thirds
of the users in Nigeria are on 2g
connections so a lot of them actually
are not even connected most of the time
and if you're building a product which
relies on the updates over-the-air
or you're relying that people have to be
connected in order for your product to
function that is not going to work out
for you now we learn this the hard way
so you need to make sure that your
products are either fully functioning on
offline so it offline is a state of it
so it's not an exception or you need to
make sure that at least they degrade
gracefully so people can still use them
in some kind of decent way finally data
is really really expensive so a lot of
people in those countries actually use
prepaid data so they will buy it in
small packets of ten megabytes or 100
megabytes and they're extremely
conscious with how they're using this
data so they keep track which app is
using up how much and they will turn
different things on and off and
sometimes even go into airplane mode in
order to preserve the data so for us
what we perceive as a free app and it's
only 40 megabytes to download it's
actually a big decision
for them because they have to spend a
bunch of their very very precious data
in order to download it so if you're
requiring people to install stuff and
it's large in size think again so we
took these three trends and then with
research we've actually extracted five
principles that have made our product
successful and I want to share with you
an example of what we've made in terms
of changes for each of those five
principles and I'm hoping that this will
help you when you're building your
product on the web so the first really
big principle that we learned is that
before people even start interacting
with your product you need to remove the
barriers for them to do so so remember
the things that I mentioned before in
terms of high cost of data poor
connectivity and low call quality low
range devices those are things that
stand between you and these users even
before they start using your product so
you need think do you think about okay
do I can I make a solution that will not
require an install can I have something
which is very small which works offline
and here's an example of how Twitter did
this I don't know how many of you went
to the session that they did in one day
but they very recently released a
progressive web app which is a light app
and it folds for all of these challenges
to remove these barriers so it doesn't
require any installs it's less than one
megabyte in size and it allows to read
stuff offline even if the user is
disconnected if that stuff has already
been pre-loaded and it also comes with a
data saver feature so that people can
pick exactly which images and videos
they need to download so they need to
they don't need to see all of their
stream they can just download the things
that they like and they've just launched
it for a few months now but it's really
enjoying a lot of success so here are
some of just some of the metrics that
they share with us it gets over 1
million launches per day and since we've
launched it they're seeing
see percent decrease in bounce rates so
by removing these barriers they have
delighted their users and they're doing
pretty great and they actually built it
specifically for these emerging market
users where the connectivity is flaky
and the data cost is high and the
devices are kind of for the second thing
that we've learned is that in order to
succeed in these markets you need to
optimize for speed your load performance
needs to be amazing and a lot of people
are like well I don't need to do all
this special work and believe me you are
not special casing for a specific market
when you're making your stuff fast I
have yet to hear anybody anywhere on the
planet that is complaining that
something is loading too fast
so if you make your stuff work for users
in Indonesia on a 2g connection your
your users in the US will be also super
delighted now we've been working to
optimize our car products as well for
speed and one thing that we noticed is
that for users in India on 2g
connections it actually could take
sometimes up to eight and a half seconds
for the search results page to load for
them so imagine that you're searching
and you're counting one two three four
five and still no results right so we
did some work to optimize our page and
we also didn't stop there we actually
looked at what can we do after the click
because we noticed that in some cases
again on 2g connections it could take up
to 25 seconds for a page to load in
India so what we launched is something
called transcoding pages and it leads to
great results so this is an example of a
one of the biggest newspapers in
Indonesia combust and as a result of
this transcoding and page optimisation
we are now consuming 90% less data and
these pages load five times faster and
what do you think users react how do you
think users reacted when they saw it
well actually there's
then 50% increase in traffic to these
transcoded pages because users just
receive that everything is loading much
much faster and then they just browse
more so it's a win-win for both sides
the next big thing that we learned is
that all flight is a state in itself we
need to make sure that our stuff
functions even when people are going in
and out of connectivity so not everybody
has Wi-Fi in fact a lot of people
especially go to stores or train
stations in order to get access to Wi-Fi
they download a lot of stuff there and
then they spend most of their time
offline the rest of the day so one thing
that we are experimenting with in order
to make sure that people have a little
bit smoother experiences when they're
going online and offline throughout the
day is in chrome if you're searching so
this is the example on your left if
you're searching and you're trying to
fetch a page in chrome and we notice
that you're offline first we'll show you
adorable dinosaur and second we show you
this download button so when we detect
that you're if you click on this button
we detect that you're going back online
later we'll download this page for you
then and then you can see it so we are
aiming to experiment in order to smooth
the experience for people
similarly in search if someone does a
query and we notice that they are fine
we'll offer them to do this search later
and then send them a notification that
they got their results the next trend
and a really important one is that in a
lot of these countries people use more
than one language to accomplish their
daily tasks they might do their homework
in English they might talk to their
grandma in one dialect and they might
use a completely different language in
school and so depending on that and what
products you're building you need to be
ready to handle these challenges as for
example in search what we've noticed is
that sometimes people will search in
English but the words that they're
typing are in Hindi so we launched
something where if you're searching
and Hindi and English will show you the
results side by side and you can
actually click on the top and then just
switch and people really like this we
saw that there is a 50% increase in
Hindi searches on mobile after we
launched this now the last trend and a
very important one is that a lot of
these users are coming online in a
completely different context and so you
shouldn't expect that the product that
you have right now with the UI and the
flow and the graphics will fit their
needs
even though it has a very specific
functions so a lot of them are coming
online for the first time on the phone
they don't have any experience with
desktop a lot of them have never used
email and they have different cultural
expectations or color preferences so we
did a lot of research for our products
in order to make sure that what we're
launching for them is actually suitable
for their needs and you need to keep
this in mind as well so here is an
example this is the Chrome default page
and if you look at the one on the left
it's the standard one right Google is
pretty much known for a super minimal
interface we have the search box and
that's it but what we found when we did
research with users in India is that
this empty page reminded them of like a
big vast empty lobby where you have to
walk all the way and then ask the
receptionist something so it felt very
cold and not welcoming and what they
wanted to see where they wanted to be
surrounded by their favorite things and
so on the right side you will see a
version of the chrome home page that
we're experimenting with where the user
can see their favorite site that they're
visiting the most often and then also
they can see articles that are related
to the searches that they've been doing
so this feels a lot more welcoming and
we continue to experiment with that so
to sum up five important things they
need to remember if you're building
stuff for these markets which we learned
the hard way and you today by waking up
early
and coming to the session have managed
to learn the easy way first before you
even start thinking about how people are
interacting with your products make sure
to remove the barriers for them to adopt
this product second make sure the
optimized performance as much as
possible because these connections are
super slow and data is very scarce third
third yes make sure that your product
works offline almost as well as it works
when it's online sports don't assume
people speak only one language all the
time and make sure that whatever user
flows you have in your products are
addressing their multilingual needs and
finally what's not last
make sure to guide the users and that
you experience in your product matches
what they're expecting in terms of
culture and habits so you've seen the
examples of how we've done this in our
own products on the web and hopefully by
now you're inspired and you want to know
how you can do this well you're very
lucky because we have Robert here who's
going to give you specific examples for
each of these five things on how to
build to succeed in next billion users
markets Thank You Maria so first and
foremost thank you for showing up like
morning of day 3 I love you I'm so happy
you're here
so I'm Robert and I'm looking at how the
world is evolving and looking at what we
learn I'm going to be here and talk
about our best advice for caving through
these challenges like our best practices
and how you also carry all of this into
the things you're building so the first
and really most important thing though
and Maria was talking about this as well
this is not only about advice for a
certain market or a certain country or
certain person
like all device will be giving you here
will be applicable everywhere it's going
to help all your users wherever they are
in the world so let's start with
removing barriers for instance this tile
was saying in 2020 we expect about 1
billion unique mobile drivers in India
alone that's a lot of people so how do
we cater to that and how to do we make
sure to remove barriers for them as you
saw with Twitter light when you're
building something you really make sure
that you have no friction or as low
friction as possible so no install being
not being necessary saving as much data
as possible and working offline these
are all crucial features we also need to
have the best possible reach with what
you're building and also that the
content is actually being kept
up-to-date through your users as well
and meeting these seeds of no install or
using as little data as possible a
really big and hard challenges for
native apps so what's the solution
it's I'll be showing you from our
experience progressive web apps really
is to respond to all of these challenges
and also these opportunities and I'm
going to walk you through this with a
few examples and also a number of
different use cases as well historically
with native apps once they've actually
been installed they had really great uf
experiences home screen icons offline
support push notifications background
syncing access to sensors and much more
and the idea was forget the web apps is
bringing the best of native together
with the best of web like what are our
learnings and how can we get it all in
one good package and I'm sure you
already heard a lot about progress for
web so far before Google i/o and also
here at Google i/o as well so I'm not
going to delve too much into the
technical details here I just want to
quickly mention a few of the core basic
features like at the home screen push
notifications offline support and all of
these features it's not just something
that's completely new right this is
being built on top of what the web
already has the existing reach to the
web has and then already saying up
today's capabilities that the web has as
well one quick thing to mention though
if you haven't already implemented that
it's a web app manifest so you can add
this to your HTML codes and this is
really foundation for the features like
at the home screen and push
notifications in the way through it is
really really simple just reference the
manifest file for win the HTML code and
then within the manifest file it
describes the F name the icons to start
URL and much more and an important thing
to note here if you look at the start
URL it's also to make sure to have a
parameter in there is you know if your
users are coming from the home screen
icon or if they're coming from visiting
your progressive web app through a
browser tab you can also control other
things like having a splash screen
theming and background color display
type orientation and much much more and
we've had a number of talks here at i/o
about progressive web apps so I really
recommend looking at those videos but
also in our developer website as well we
have very detailed information how you
go about implementing all of these
things but also when we're talking about
progressive web apps we can talk about a
lot of Technology right but at the end
of the day it's about user experiences
and this is really the key thing like
user experience need to be reliable fast
and engaging for whatever you build this
is the key thing and then for us these
are the keywords for progress web apps
so these whatever you do this should
really be your new mantra look at what
you're building does it actually match
this and we also see this kind of mental
approach as the key to removing barriers
for your users and we talked about being
reliable it means that it will always
load the instantly for users you will
never show the users that are actually
offline a use serviceworkers to cater to
that and there are client-side proxy tip
with you as a developer in control of
things like cache and networking
requests but it's also about being fast
you need to load fast we also need to
stay fast as well you don't want to have
any janky scrolling or slow experience
like it always needs to be very very
smooth for the user and also need to be
engaging and we see features like at the
home screen immersive full-screen
experiences push notifications much more
that's really really good things to get
there
but another part of removing barriers
that is sometimes overlooked is actually
storage constraints like app size
matters more today than ever before and
we see a lot of users never installing
and in new apps or never installing any
apps at all or they remove the apps
they're using up the most of the space
on their devices and as Maria mentioned
33 percent of smartphone users in India
run out of memory space every day that's
a lot of people and for instance we only
have one gigabyte of app storage you can
only install between five and ten native
apps so with this in mind we were really
excited with seeing Twitter's
progressive web app which really cater
to this specific issue so Twitter light
is under one megabyte and compared to
your native apps that only makes up one
to three percent of their sizes as well
and this is great like it's a really
small file size but they launched very
recently and already so far they see a
50% increase in pastries and 60%
increase in pages per session in an
India a company called Ola cabs they had
fairly big native apps 60 megabytes on
Android 100 megabytes on iOS and these
aren't like super big sizes for native
apps either like but fairly big right so
they decided to build a progressive web
app to address this and the result was
really stunning so their progressive web
app now is only half a megabyte so you
compare that to the size of their native
apps and you can still give the users
the same exact experience and they also
work with polymer to achieve this both
to get the small file size and the good
experience but also working with polymer
to make sure that it would have support
for the UC browser which is a one of the
very popular browsers in their main
market and polymer is natively supported
then Safari Chrome and opera and with
polyfills it works on Firefox as you see
browser now and I 11 as well and which
I'm referring where if you use I mean
you should use what works best for you
this is just one example but make sure
it also has a small file size like in to
kill you from polymer to those just
release it's only 10 kilobytes on Chrome
30 kilobytes on Safari
a slightly larger on firefox and ads and
a couple of the other ones and in brazil
we saw a company called terra and the
reason they build a progressive web app
as well and for them it's already a
success they're seeing used to visiting
twice as many pages as before but also
spending twice the amount of time in the
progressive web as well compared to the
previous mobile experience and the
second challenge but also opportunity
here is really optimizing speed you want
to make sure to reach your users we also
make sure that they don't go elsewhere
as well so coming back to Ola cabs their
progressive web has an envelope first
load of only 50 kilobytes and repeat
load sizes can be as small as 10
kilobytes and that actually means 500
times lighter than the iOS app and 300
times lighter than than the Android app
so I mean it's completely different
worlds here right but also this low data
consumption make sure that the first
load is about three seconds and then
repeat load times could be down to about
1.8 seconds which is good on its own
like it's a fairly good loading time but
in this case these loading times are on
2g or ultra load 3G networks which of
course is the defining factor to
actually reaching your users and for
them killing to many many millions of
people in India this is the key things
actually being able to reach them to
begin with another really interesting
number that we see is that 53% of the
users abandoned sites that take longer
than three seconds loads and 53% of
users that's over half in three seconds
that's not a long time so you can work a
lot with progressive web apps and
achieve a lot of really good performance
but generally with progressive web as
we've seen that for the second and
subsequent loads using both web apps and
service workers it's a really good
experience but what about the first load
what about it no matter how hard you
work on it what if it's not fast enough
for your users
one option we'll be looking at here is
called amp and accelerated mobile pages
and one thing that I want to stress here
is the
an open source initiative really trying
to make the web better through fast and
high-performing pages across different
devices and distribution platforms and
the idea with em is that you're guided
to only do things that are fast it's
almost impossible to make slow on pages
so I'm going to talk briefly here about
what what amp is but also how it ties
into progressive web apps and and
consists of a few different things the
first thing is amp HTML and it's
basically regulation well with some
restrictions for liberals or formers I
like this cute little bolts like a
morning shot something but basically
it's HTML but it's extended with some
custom properties that you will need and
some HTML tags are bringing the place
why am specific tags or so called an
HTML components the second part is the
amp javascript library and the idea is
really to ensure the fast rendering of
the amp external pages to manage
resource loading and also give you
support for a few of the different
custom tags I mentioned but also makes
everything that comes from external
resources load asynchronous so nothing
in the page can block anything age at
anything added else from rendering and
finally you have a google amp cache and
the idea with that amp cache is that you
can serve cached amp pages so it's a
proxy based content delivery network
through livering all valid amp documents
and it caches them improves them and
improves the page performance
automatically so these three together
make up the foundation for amp and if
you want to get started and create your
first amp page it's really quite easy it
looks like any basic Ishmael's place
you've ever seen before
just a few regular tags as you can see
at the top you have the lightning icon
indicating that this is an amp page you
have some boilerplate CSS needed to make
sure you have the consistent rendering
and look across browsers and platforms
and then finally you include the amp
JavaScript library and then you're good
to go
that's your first amp page it works
and then if we do things like including
an image you have the amp image
component and if you look at it it kind
of looks like the image element in HTML
there you see it has the source
attribute the alternate text dimensions
and all of that but the interesting part
here is that the amp runtime can choose
to delay or prioritize resource loading
based on different things like viewport
position system resources connection
bandwidth and other factors so basically
the runtime will take care it for view
to manage the image resources make sure
their loads the best and most suitable
things at that specific time and one
company called somato sort of work with
amp pages and they had a 4 second page
load before and they're down to one
second now and again on really slow
networks as well and I mentioned I was
going to talk about amp and progressive
web apps and how they're connected to
each other
and we see two different approaches here
one is using M as in come on
one is using amp as an entry points into
your progressive web app and the other
one is using amp at sedate the source
for your progressive web app so taking a
look at the first one and using amp as
an entry point amp selling point is
really almost instant delivery of pages
whereas first web apps enable much more
interactivity and engagement enabling
features so a good approach here could
be have an instant first load with a m--
and then upgrade the user to a
progressive web app basically start fast
stay fast and the way to do it within
the NAM page is the using component
called amp installed serviceworker
it basically allows you in the amp page
to warm up a progressive web app in the
background so then for the next click
from the user you can instantly load a
fully featured progressive web app and
looking at this component you have the
source attribute here which is
specifying the URL of the serviceworker
you want to register and then you have
an optional attribute called data iframe
source which could be the URL of an HTML
document to register a serviceworker and
then finally you need the layout
attribute which must have the value no
display
and looking at this combination between
progressive web apps and amp we go
started working with that and for the
rampages they had a previous page slow
time of about 12 seconds and it's down
to 2 point 75 seconds now and for the
progressive web app shell they had a
loading time that was almost nine
seconds before and they're down to one
point 63 seconds now and again these
tests are being done on the nexus 5 on a
slow 3G connection just looking at the
improvement and again coming back to the
user experience it makes such a massive
difference for them but it's not only
fast right this director leads to actual
results so with the new implementation
they now see 74 percent of all visits
actually turning into conversions and
all in all the conversions have gone up
now on the side ninety-five percent and
looking at the other option of having
amp as a data source for your
progressive web apps maybe you started
with building something with amp for
instance we haven't built the PWA yet in
the idea here is that you can still
reuse your amp content within the
progressive web app and a common
scenario could be that you're building a
progressive web app as a single page
application that connects to JSON API
through Ajax and and I know it kind of
looks like I'm trying to set a world
record in acronyms here I'm sorry about
that it's a lot of fancy words but the
thing here is like with the JSON API
here then it will return a number of
data sets to drive the navigation and
then the actual content of your site so
the way you can do it is that you start
by including shadow amp in your
progressive web app you load the amp
library in the top-level page but it
won't actually control the top-level
content they will only amplify the
portions of the page that you need it to
and then secondly as you would normally
do you handle navigation in your
progressive web app but then the final
twist here that you then use the shadow
amp API to render amp pages in line so
it could look something like this you
have a progressive web app shell around
everything
but then when you start capping you get
the amp content the amp pages instantly
within the progressive web app so it's
been a really good combination in that
way another thing I want to mention it's
a network information API and we had
this for a while but people have been
really asking for detailed information
about bandwidth to convey the HTTP
clients network connection speed and
network speed here is provided as an
estimate of the current transport RTT
and the network bandwidth and also takes
constant variation and user variation
into account as you might know 4G
doesn't actually always mean before G
speed you would expect but still though
if you're building things you're doing a
really good job but it's not really fast
enough for users at the end of the day
how do you know when to deliver even
lighter experiences and one really good
option here is to check for the save
data request setter and this is
available in Chrome and opera and in
Yandex browsers and the idea here is
need to deliver fast and light
applications to users who have opted
into the data savings mode in their
browser for instance in chrome if you
turn the data saver on it will send this
header with on master value so it
basically looks like something like this
it's easy to check the header and then
know what to use is one and need here
but also if you're building something or
using something like a serviceworker you
can inspect the request headers and you
can apply the relevant logic to optimize
experience so you can for instance
return an alternate response like
different marker smaller image files
more video size and much much more
and within the chrome dev tools if you
start inspecting character you would
just find save it really quickly and you
can adapt the code the third part here
is about addressing intermittent
connectivity and Maria showed us before
and the what we learned section that
around 50% of the users in India are and
2g so slow or intermittent network
connections a really big challenges for
reaching users but also giving them a
good experience
and here we really see serviceworker
that's a key technology to address that
so what are they and how do they work
basically it's a programmable proxy
sitting between the network and the
browser but it's more than that so when
a page register your serviceworker it
adds a set of Advent analysts respond to
things like Network request push
messages updates reserves worker and
much for and because being event based
it doesn't need to be resident in memory
Alice is handling one of those specific
events and also it kind of a side note
here there are two interesting options
for poor network conditions but also
devices with slow disk access and the
first one is using timeout for slow
networks so for instance if you have a
slow or intimate the network connection
you can create a timer in the surf
worker where you give the network a
chance to deliver a resource within say
one second but if it doesn't then you
can fall back to the local resource a
small note here like don't set a timer
that's too long though because the
serviceworker might get killed or
replaced by a new serviceworker
the other really fun thing is race
conditions because with some devices it
might actually be faster to go to the
network and get the content than going
to disk which is not what you would
expect but this is really good the
interesting way of testing that and of
course both with the timer and with
going to disk or not it's always
important you have to get data for a
network to have it locally just in case
memory also mention Nigeria and then
seeing two thirds of the users being on
2g here and one company they're called
conga added serviceworker
to streamline decides to help consumers
really reach to you the parts of the
site they wanted you to browse so you go
to categories you can review previous
searches and can actually even check out
by them calling in to order all by being
offline and as you can see it results is
much much faster than native like 92%
less data for the first load in 82% less
data to reach the first interaction but
it wasn't just faster than native it was
much faster than the previous mobile
website as well so sick
simplest data for the first load and 84%
less data for to reach the first
transaction in the fourth plots and
Maria was talking about over 20% of
users in countries where we see the next
billion users are coming online or
searching in two or more languages so we
have something called the search console
which is tools from Google to show how
your site is doing in Google search but
you also have something in there called
search analytics which looks like this
which shows your queries positions and
results click click-through rates and
much more and you can filter information
in many ways in here like applying the
country and the device filter for
instance to see from which countries
we're getting the most mobile users and
also in this example the majority of the
users of the site are coming from China
Indonesia and Malaysia so it's really
worse than guest investigating whether
the contents available language they
understand and also if they can complete
the key user journeys you can also track
perform as specific pages specific
queries and much more and finally about
guiding new users it's really about
making sure to help users when they come
to your website the first time and we've
seen really good numbers from at the
home screen here in this case with our
Lex like the users browsing around
they're looking to see what it's like
and then you get to a certain point
where you get to add the home screen
prompt pop-up and they then choose to
add it to the home screen and then to
get the icon of the home screen is
really easy for them to get back as well
and one really really interesting number
to share with you here now
that I actually don't think it's been
anywhere else here at i/o so far is that
we see users five to six times more
likely to use at the home screen than
installing the equivalent native app
that's a pretty big difference and in
India we saw Flipkart with 63% of the
users on 2g and again being fast was
essential right and use a serviceworker
and all that to achieve this but one
really interesting part here is that
they really work on when to show that
the home screen prompt and now they see
really great results
so 60
users are now coming from the home
screen icon which is fantastic but it's
not only a lot of visitors it's also
high quality visitors so people come
from the high screen home screen icon it
converts 70% higher than the other ones
so summing it all up as you see in
applying the five principles that we
learned about removing barriers through
using progressive web apps and the web
optimized speed by using m2 progressive
web apps together but also the networked
information API and the save data header
and for addressing intimate the
connectivity serviceworkers is really
your best friend here and make sure to
have multilingual support and understand
your users in which languages they're
actually using and then adding features
like add the home screen which has been
really successful to make sure they
actually guide users throughout the
yarning journey and with all of this we
hope this is good advice and good
numbers and good learnings for you to go
out and build for your next billion
users and if this sounds great
which it does right you would go to this
website and you would get a lot of
advice and guiding to to actually how to
get started and also tell Marie and I
it's just going to be out around in the
corner and the big round fluffy thing in
the web mobile web sandbox so please
come over ask us questions and you know
tell us what you're building on behalf
of all of us thank you and go out and
build great things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
