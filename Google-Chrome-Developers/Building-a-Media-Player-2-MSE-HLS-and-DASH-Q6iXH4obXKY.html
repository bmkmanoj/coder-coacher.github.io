let's talk about video so we're not even
going to look at any code so that's
boring to you area I guess you can stop
watching now but I wouldn't because this
is actually really kind of a fascinating
underpinning which I imagine will come
out in various ways throughout the build
but nonetheless it's worth talking about
now which is how do you actually do
video playback in modern terms simple
version you take a video element with a
source equals something dot mp4 or
marble or whatever it whatever container
codec combo works right and you can have
multiple sources inside it's fair enough
you can do that more modern versions use
something called MSE apparently which is
stands for media source extensions think
yes that sounds that right the idea is
rather than giving the video element a
file and link to a source like you would
with an image or even an audio element
for some another what you do is you have
a buffer underneath so you attach a
buffer to the video element and then you
start filling in that buffer yourself
cool so you kind of maybe xhr in each
individual chunk so that you can start
playing the video quickly you get you
know you're videoing in chunks
fetch xhr whatever works and you build
up that buffer and the player video
player plays that video and everybody's
happy so it's like the next step up then
there's another step up above that which
is a thing called - which is dynamic
adaptive streaming over HTTP I don't
know whether they named it bash before
or after they went let's call it - what
it stands for
I don't know dynamic adaptive
sugar-filled
helium no that's not going to work
however they did it - is the idea that
instead of one video file that is say
like a 1080
P video you have different quality
versions of say your video and your
audio and you want to swap depending on
what the users bandwidth is looking like
so if they're on a low bandwidth
situation then you want to adapt to a
lower quality video to just keep them
going and this dovetails into MSE
because you've got this buffer that
you're filling well why not fill that
buffer with a lower quality version when
it makes sense to do so or a higher
quality version when that makes sense to
do that so you're using - to kind of
swap between qualities and you're
filling that buffer in that way
so that's that's MSE and - in a very
very very short space of time and
there's probably about as well as I
understand them
now in order to get your video into that
format there are a bunch of ways you can
do it but there's normally something
like ffmpeg is used to going to be used
to take the big video and turn it into
all the different quality variations
that you need all those different
physical representations or adaptations
as anyway representations I think is
what it is and then you have there's a
bunch of you know tools that you can use
one I've been using is called the shakka
packager which ties into the shaka
player which i'll talk about some other
points with a shaka packager you give it
all the different versions of your video
and it creates this manifest that has
like how much bandwidth each one needs
and what size it is is it like 1280 by
720 or 1920 by 1080 and what codecs it's
using all that kind of stuff so it makes
this big manifest that is a - manifest
that you can hand over to a - compatible
player so that's all good that works on
believe it's Chrome I think Firefox
desktop Safari I make that distinction
because it matters Chrome Firefox just
rip Safari I don't remember how edge is
I'll have to look that one up or you can
look it up yourself because I mean
that's how the internet works
and then on the mobile safari side
things are a little different there's a
thing called HLS which I can't remember
what that stands for there with me I'm
just going to google it HTTP Live
Streaming effortless you see and it's an
alternative way of splitting down the
big mp4 or whatever you've got into
different chunks that you can then swap
between and so in some ways it's sort of
analogous to - because you have these
different versions of the file so you've
started with you big HD video and you
split it down to different qualities and
then the you make an HLS manifest and
there are tools that you can get that
will segment the file the media file and
make a playlist of all these different
variations and all that kind of stuff
and then you end up at the end of this
instead of a - manifest unit with an
m3u8 manifest it's a playlist file which
you can on mobile safari you just say
video source equals and then you give it
that playlist file
it's m3u8 playlist file and it will do
the rest so that's the kind of video on
demand way of doing it I think it's
slightly different again if you do live
streaming a havening looked at live
streaming yet so bear with me and I only
looked at things like encrypted media
all things for future stuff right now
I've been concentrating on I have a
video what on earth do I need to do to
this video to make it play so there you
go so there's the MSE really - and HLS -
eh I seem to be the two things that I'm
going to be looking at hopefully making
them automatically swap between this
which everyone but depending on support
and I guess that's that so stick with me
in the next episode I think I'm going to
show you
around some of the prototypes I've been
building because those have been quite
interesting to build as well to try out
some of these things I should show you
I'll show you the manifests yes I will
show you like the - in the HL s
manifests loads of stuff it's there's so
much that we can talk about if you
speaking of which speak English if
there's things that you want me to cover
don't forget to drop those in the
comments everybody who's been commenting
so far thank you
it's lovely to have your your input in
your feedback and I will see you in the
next episode hey folks thanks for
watching don't forget that there is more
content that you can find kind of over
here ish and if you want to subscribe
there's probably a button oh maybe there
maybe somewhere around there click that
if you've not done that brilliant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
