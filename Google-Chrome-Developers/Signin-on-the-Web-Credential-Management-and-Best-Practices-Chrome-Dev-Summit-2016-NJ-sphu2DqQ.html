product manager on the chrome team
working on authentication as we heard
earlier today in Darrin's keynote the
purpose of progressive web apps is to
improve user flows to reduce friction
and to create really engaging
experiences and we've already given you
tools to solve issues around reliability
or to create a plaque experiences by
adding PWS to the homescreen and now we
want to focus on two missing flows
sign-in and payments AJ and I are going
to start off and spend the next half
hour by talking to you about how chrome
is helping to remove friction from your
silent flows by making signing and
easier in a simple and secure way but
the first of step of course is getting
users signed up and we all know entering
all your information in long
registration forms can be super
frustrating like this is how it looks
like each time when I enter my
credentials on my phone and the stats
also confirm this about half of users
would rather abandon a service then go
through another registration form so we
have a huge opportunity here to reduce
friction in your signup flow and then
really drive growth and conversions and
that chrome help you do this Chrome
offers out of your functionality that
makes it easier for users to fill out
these forms faster and easier but
sometimes things are ambiguous like here
it's unclear which of these fields
represents their user name the
identifier is it the user name or is it
the email address it's unclear to the
user it's unclear to the browser for
sure but the best thing to do with
ambiguity is to be explicit in an easy
way to be explicit here is just to
markup your forms with autocomplete
attributes and then you can make sure
that your forums were perfectly wave
password autofill and I promise you it
will only take you a few minutes so now
that we got your users signed up the
question is how to keep them signed in
maybe like this probably not because
they are already Spartans on that
you have to remember which of them you
used last time or if you used two
username and password and then you have
to remember which password you use so as
you see a lot of things to remember and
let me now ask you a quick question here
how many people in this room have run
into the experience that they create an
account for our site and bam get this
message that the account already exists
yeah quite a few so as you can see it's
full of friction and there are so many
drop-off points along the way and also
the stats again show this year according
to a study 92% of users would rather
leave aside then reset their login
information if they forgot their
passwords it's 92% of people leaving
just think about that and how much is
this I intend use of Earth to your
business so again really huge
opportunity to get all those users that
are abandoning your sign-in screens
today to be signed in and become really
against users if we just made things a
bit easier for instance like this so
when a user returns to your site it
would be dramatically better if they
could just skip the sign-in form and go
straight to an engaging personalized
experience and that means knowing who
they are but the question is why is that
so hard it's because
sign and flows today are limited in ways
that the browser is not so leveraging
the position of the browser here is
really the key because if a user is
seemingly new to you they are not new to
the browser and that's what we are
focused on making signing in easier in a
secure way through the browser and we do
that with an API that we were talking
about today to credential management API
oh but before we dive right into that
let's assume for a moment that you have
a really dedicated user and they found a
way their way through all these
possibilities and successfully signed in
to your site so are we done now
nope not quite yet because users
typically don't stay sign and file in
that forever unlike on native apps so
there is a unique challenge
that we are facing here on the web which
are the different attack surfaces and
threat models just think about
cross-site scripting zrz see our CSRF or
clip checking so section management on
the web is really hard and as a result
of that they are very different
requirements for session management on
the web and are native and one one
interesting thing we can do with service
workers is using two copper two tokens
short lifts and a long lift token where
we use the service worker to refresh the
short-lived token and if you're
interested in learning more about this
idea then just check out that blog post
that's linked from here so as you can
see there are some avenues like this to
explore for the long term
but an easy way to handle this is using
the credential manager API it basically
moves users from a state in which they
are frequently automatically signed out
into a state which they can be
automatically signed back in so sounds
good it's a it's a web platform API
standards-based and it allows the
browser to facilitate the silent process
with information it has stored from the
user and it does that in a frictionless
fashion and also works across devices we
shipped this API earlier this year in
chrome 51 and we announced it at Google
i/o and since launch we have seen a
bunch of developers shipping it like you
can see here and we want to start off
now by looking at two common problems
that we are trying to solve with this
API so on some sites like e-commerce
travel or news sites seinem is often not
required it's really nice it's really
helpful but it's not necessary so on
those sites the credential management
API can automatically sign the user in
right on the home page and that's
basically what you see here indicated
with that small small blue button on the
bottom of the screen the toast and and
the users being auto signed in here
right on the home page
and as mentioned earlier we know that on
on the web sessions often expire very
frequently sometimes within a day
sometimes even within an hour 10 minutes
so that means on those sides basically
every time user returns to the side they
are in a signed out state and then it
requires quite some dedication from the
user to find a user menu click through a
sign-in button and then be signed back
in we know that most services can
provide usually better better
experiences to users if they are signed
in but that's not always immediately
clear to the user so they might not see
the value proposition of signing in
right away
therefore it's dramatically better if
you can just automatically sign them in
right on your home page like I mentioned
but basically on any live page that the
user might land on through a search and
Aliexpress for example an e-commerce
site they have seen an 11% increase in
conversion rates that means users who
actually made a transaction and that's
for users who signed in through the API
in comparison with users who didn't sign
in through the API and have also seen
some really really good 2x improvements
like an 85 percent drop in sign and
failure rate on the web or a 60 percent
decrease in time spent signing in now
the guardian has seen a 44% increase in
users signed in on two or more devices
across chrome and the Android native app
and another common problem that we are
trying to solve with this API is that
password managers today are not really
equipped well to remember your federated
silence that means when you sign in for
with Facebook or with Google and that
means those users often create duplicate
accounts as you know because they just
forgot that they already had an account
and the credential management API can
also help here because it can remember
for the user that they're signed in with
such a federated account Pinterest is a
website that offers federated sign-in
options too and they have seen a 10%
increase in desktop web logins for
eligible users
after that ship the credential
management API and have also seen a
three percent increase in user
engagement now even if users switch
between devices which is pretty common
today and let's say they download the
native app for your service they can
seamlessly continue that signed-in
experience just they need to just be
signed in with the same Google account
and we call this password sync feature
in Chrome smart lock for passwords and
if you want to enable this
cross-platform experience for your users
you can do the mapping between your
website and your native app and then you
can also use the smart up for passwords
API as for your Android native app and
with that let me hand over to AG who is
now going to show you the credential
management API in practice thanks Robin
my name is AG what I'm going to show you
now is a credential management API in a
demo with a website called polymer shop
which we introduced at Google i/o this
year let me get it
so this is the partnership website
imagine that I have just finished
shopping experience through our guest
checkout experience and I'm about to
create an account so first thing I
should do is to enter my email address
so tap on it and now I see my email
address pop up the nice thing about
using this browser is a autocomplete
feature suggest me to use one of my
email address that I have put into this
brother in the past so I can just stop
to enter my email address and enter a
random password and sign up and now you
see a pop up at the bottom of the page
asking me if I want to store the
credential information it's nice so I
can just save so now my browser
remembers my ID and password for me so
what I'm going to show you now is a odd
signing in action but in order to make
this demo exciting what I'm going to do
is to swap this device with a new one
let's see what happens so as soon as I
tap on this icon
I'll be out sending to the same website
okay
one two three boom
I'm sandy so what happened here is that
the credential information I have stored
to the browser to the other device was
synchronized across my Google account
and propagated to this device and as
soon as I learned it on the same website
the credential management API picked up
the credential information and let me
authenticate and let me sign in but
sometimes you might wanna keep sideout
in that case you can simply sign out
that way you won't be signed out for the
future so this is truly a frictionless
signing experience but if I talk about
sign-in x-ray a frictionless signing
experience you might imagine about
federated logins today the logins are as
Sabine mentioned like Google sign-in or
logging Facebook logging or some other
options we have like Microsoft Yahoo
Twitter github etc luckily we have a
Google sign-in option right here so let
me try something so I sang in with a
single tap what is new here is that if
you look at the bottom of page I see a
similar pop up show up so I can store my
identity information to the browser like
something mentioned so I can store
federated login information to the
browser so so far I have two accounts
store to this process then what happens
if I try to sign-in let me sign off
again and try to sign in by pressing the
button and now what do you see is a
dialog asking me
to signing with at 1:02 accounts so I
can simply type of one with top one of
them to get sign-in so this you might
notice that I didn't type a single
letter using a software keyboard this is
really frictionless signing experience
so let's get back to the slide so the
benefit of credential management API let
me recap the first thing is it enables
what signing feature across devices and
it also virtually enables a prominent
session and it remembers federated
accounts for me and I could use a
computer to skip forms without typing a
single letter using software keyboard so
I should say credential management API
eliminated whole bunch of frictions from
the sign-in experience right so how can
you as a developer bring the similar
experience to your own website so I'm
going to dive into that the first thing
you should do is to save credential
information to the browser the forms
such as sign up sign in or change
password is a great chance for users to
store their credential information to
the browser
so there are a few steps first interrupt
the form submission then send the
request to to the father using Ajax then
store the credential information and
finally update the UI using a profile
before moving forward just make sure
that your form is annotated well using
the autocomplete attribute that Savi
mentioned earlier with that when the
user submits a form prevents default
interrupted and prevent default and
prevent it to proceed to the next page
why is that
if the page transition happens this will
move to the next page which means that
credential information user has put into
the previous page will be lost in the
next page by making the verge
authentication call using Ajax you can
retain the credential information in the
same page
while verifying the authentication
credential make sure to create a API on
the server side which responds with HTTP
code with 200 or a 401 so that it can
respond with a correct correctly to tell
the browser that authentication was
successful or not responding with a
profile information would be ideal so
after the authentication you're you can
store the credential now before doing so
make sure that API is available always
keep in mind about the progressive
enhancement to store the credential
information instantiate password
credentials object with the form element
that you have created as an argument
then call navigated credential top store
if the API is not available you can just
skip this step and forward the profile
mission to the next step once everything
goes well you can update the UI or
proceed to the personalized page and you
are done then in cases where you have
your website has a federated logins here
here's what you should do so federated
logins are asabi mentioned a concept of
signing into a website using a
third-party identity such as Google
Facebook Microsoft etc so finally the
logins are based on a standard protocol
such as open ID Connect or both there
are two benefits of using it one is that
users doesn't have to remember extra
password to sign in to your web your
website and second is that in general
users can sign into your website
by one table there are few steps first
authenticate the user with the identity
provider then store the credential
information and update the UI so
obviously by tapping on the button
kick-start the authentication flow so in
order to authenticate the user using an
identity provider we should you should
use kind of libraries provided by many
different identity providers for Google
we provide Google signing Facebook
provide Facebook loving now let me skip
this step because it's quite complex and
just assume that you get authenticated
and got a profile information so once
the user is authenticated create
instantiate object called federated
credential but in this case you're not
storing ID and password instead you're
storing identity of the users and into
the identity provider and also a string
that represents the identity provider
itself name and icon URL our option then
call nubira dot credentials dot store
the rest of the steps are similar to
what I have mentioned in previous
section so let me skip that and the most
exciting part of using credential
management API is old sign-in what's
hanging can happen anywhere on your
website as long as the you think it is
appropriate for example top page is of
course a good place to use odd signing
but some leaf pages such as news
articles or item pages in e-commerce
website is also a good place to enable
odd sign names to do so you get first
you get a credential information then
authenticate the user and finally update
the UI before getting a Prudential make
sure that the user is not already signed
in otherwise it doesn't make much sense
right so in order to get a credential
call now we are about credentials not
yet
by giving it a password and federated as
option as parameters you can get rich by
the type of the credential information
you want to get and by giving it
immediately true this will tell the
browser that this is an odd signing a
call so it won't show any UI for asking
user to choose from and it will return
undefined if the user has no credential
information or there are multiple
credentials stored or the user is find
out after the function is resolved you
will get receive a credential object but
if that is undefined which means that
what's I mean didn't happen so you can
just dismiss the whole process and
pretend like as if nothing happened and
if you did get a credential object just
examine the type and run the
authentication code can all sentation
flow depending on the type of the a
credential so the authentication flow is
a similar with what I have described in
previous sections and finally you can
update the UI using a profile one tip I
should note here is that if you did get
a credential but failed to authenticate
that is going to be a little bit trouble
because the user sees the blue bar
popping up saying that the user is
signing in but it failed if there are no
sign of the failure user wavy confused
so you should show an error message in
this case and when the user is signed
out you should disable out sign name to
do so sang out user first then call
nebula credentials not require user
mediation this will turn off auto
signing feature and finally when the
user is trying to sign in you can show
account chooser so that user can
select one of the accounts to assign
name with this will also turn on auto
sign name feature back wrong there are a
few steps again so first show the
account chooser and once the user select
one of the accounts you will receive a
credential information then you can
authenticate the user and update the UI
finally so most of the cases this is
quite similar to what I have described
for out signing so by users explicit
action such as type tapping on a sign-in
button will show an let let the account
user to show up by calling Navi Araz
credentials not yet but at this time
with immediate false this will show an
account chooser when the user has
multiple accounts stored or user is
signed out the rest of the steps are
quite similar to out signing like I said
but except one thing if the user didn't
choose any of accounts or dismissed
account chooser that means that there is
no account that the user intended to
signing with which means that user wants
to sign with other account right so you
should show signing form so that user
can enter their other credential
information and let the user sign in and
store another credential ok so I
described a lot of complex stuff but we
have document of this so you can just
follow Jesus he owes slash credential
management API to learn more about this
API and we are working on a more in
detail document so hopefully it can be
published today or tomorrow I will tweet
about it using the hashtag so please
watch out with that let me hand it back
to Sabine
thanks Ashley
so we talked about session management
and how to remove friction in your
silent flows by using the credential
management API that we shipped earlier
this year but there is one thing we
haven't talked about yet today and we'd
love to hear your feedback on that and
that's the account verification step
during signup you know when you sign up
for an account you typically have to
verify that account by digging up an
email clicking on a verification link or
by copy pasting an OTP a one-time
password from an SMS back into the site
and what we've often heard from
developers is that about 20 to 30
percent of their users drop off at this
stage step just because it's not a thing
that adds friction and Android offers
api's to help with this for native apps
and those apps that are using these
api's have seen oh forgot to go continue
with the slides those have seen a higher
conversion rates so we are now exploring
whether we can bring something similar
to Chrome and and end the web and again
we'd love to hear your feedback on this
problem in general either via the
feedback forum you can see here or just
come and see us in person agian I will
be around looking forward to meeting you
Thanks
