back to the show so today we're gonna
complete our three-part series on
building accessible components by
talking about labeling labeling is super
important for accessibility because it
allows us to tell the user what a
control is for and let me show you an
example to explain what I mean by that
so over here I've got jsbin setup and
I'm just gonna start creating like a bit
of a form element so I'll drop in an
input tag and you can see all right cool
I've got a text input what am I gonna
ask the user for though
well I'll add a label and I'm just gonna
wrap that label around the input and I
will say hey I would like to know the
users shipping address right so anyone
filling out a form who is a sighted user
will be able to go through and see okay
there's a text input field there's a
label here I'm assuming these two are
associated and because I have used nice
semantic HTML and I've built this
relationship between the label element
in the input check out what happens to
my screen reader when I interact with
this thing nice so we've created that
alternative interface for our users who
rely on screen readers because we've
built this nice semantic relationship
now the tricky bit here is that the
label element only works with a handful
of tags so for building a custom element
we're gonna have to come up with our own
way of labeling it and providing that
sort of accessible name to our users so
let's go check out the Aria authoring
best practices guide to maybe get some
hints on how we can do this so switching
over to that document I'm gonna go to
the check box section and I scroll down
to the bottom the second bullet point
here says that the check box should have
an accessible label preferably provided
by a visible label associated using Aria
labeled by now we haven't really talked
about already labeled by yet but now
seems like a really great time to cover
that topic so in the world of Aria
there's really kind of like three ways
that we can label something there's Aria
label sort of the the singular which is
for basically applying a text
alternative directly to an element
there's Aria labeled by where we can
actually have another element and sort
of reference that element and use that
as our label and then in some instances
we can actually kind of generate a label
or a name for an
just based on its content and we're
gonna cover all three of those today so
let me start by talking about aria-label
because that one's pretty easy and
straightforward to explain I'm gonna
switch over to my code editor and here's
our - checkbox from the previous episode
and I'm just going to give it an
aria-label attribute and we'll say the
value is gonna be sign up
okay so we're assuming the user checks
this checkbox and they're signing up for
something so we switch over to Chrome we
refresh the page now if we look at this
checkbox now in the dev tools we can see
that Aria label has been applied here
and let's check out what happens when I
interact with this using my screen
reader so you heard the screen reader
say sign up uncheck checkbox right it
has generated a name based on that Aria
label attribute but we don't have a
visible label on screen so we could add
a visible label on screen using
something like a span but now we're kind
of duplicating our work there may be a
better approach would be to use
something like are you labeled by so
make sure how that works
we'll go back to our code editor won't
get rid of this Aria label attribute I'm
gonna add a span here I'll say sign up
in that span and the way Aria label
works is it takes an ID reference to
another element to use that as its label
so I'll give span here an ID of like
sign up label something like that and
we'll take our - check box and we'll say
Aria labeled by equals sign up label so
now we've linked these two together by
that ID reference we go back we refresh
the page you can see the CSS the height
is a little off right this thing is not
quite centered that's easy enough to fix
but we do have a visible label on-screen
now which is good and let's look at what
happens when we activate our screen
reader so you heard there that now it's
seeing sign up uncheck checkbox okay
this is great this is basically what we
want but it is a little burdensome to
have to ask everyone who's using our
checkbox to also include a span and
create this sort of label linkage
between the two one final approach that
we could take is to actually have the
checkboxes named generated by its
content
now this works for smaller elements a
checkbox a radio button something like
that it wouldn't work so well for really
large elements like like an article or
some big landmarks like that but for
something really small a little control
this technique could work so going back
to my code editor I'm gonna get rid of
that span I'm gonna get rid of the Aria
labeled by here so we'll nuke these and
we'll go to our - checkbox definition
and right now we're using the host
selector to draw a rectangle around our
element and then when it is Aria checked
true we're putting a little checkmark
inside of it and so we're gonna need to
add a little bit of additional markup
we're gonna need to actually have that
rectangle and that checkbox kind of over
in a container and then we're going to
need to have another element which will
act as our label so I'm gonna add a
little bit of HTML here let's see so
I'll drop in a div I'll call this first
div let's see we'll call it checkbox
container all right that's gonna hold
our actual check mark I'm gonna know
they're div here and we'll call this one
let's see well do checkbox label and
then I'm just gonna replace the CSS that
I have here with some some updated CSS
some updated styles now let's walk
through these really quick so what I've
done is I've kept the host style of just
making sure this whole element is in
line block the checkbox container now
has the Styles for drawing our rectangle
when the host has Aria checked applied
the checkbox container will actually get
the check mark inside of it and then the
checkbox label
we're just differentiating it by bumping
the font size up a little bit and making
sure that both of these are set to
vertical-align:middle so that way the
text and the check box look nice and
centered alright the last thing i want
to do is inside of this check box label
I'm gonna add a Content element and what
this is gonna let me do is in my index
file inside of - check box now I can
just write my label right inside the
element like that it's going to project
that into that element shadow DOM and
then the browser should be able to
compute the elements name or its label
based on that content so let's check
that out we'll go back to Chrome will
refresh the page you can see that the
text is
that bigger it's centered now we turn on
our screen reader and let's see what
happens so there we go we've got a
slightly nicer easier way to give our
user a label another really cool thing
about this is that since the label is
now inside of the element itself when I
click on the label it also focuses and
activates the element and this is
something that you see with sort of
native elements native input native
checkbox when you associate them with a
native label element so now we've
created a very similar Association with
our custom element here which is really
nice so that about covers it for today
there's always more to talk about when
we touch on accessibility but hopefully
now you have a better sort of
foundational understanding of how these
things work in the platform if you have
any more questions though I'm always
happy to answer them so please leave
them for me down below in the comments
or you can reach me on a social network
of your choosing at hashtag ask polymer
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
