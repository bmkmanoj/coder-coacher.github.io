back at the progressive web apps
somewhat we're hanging out kind of in
the speaker green room area people are
swapping in and out in between talks
we're joined right now by Dion all Mardi
on is a engineering director in chrome
developer relations Dion thank you so
much for hanging out with me today we're
here in Amsterdam we're talking about
progressive web apps one of the things I
think maybe a lot of developers think is
like do I really need like another buzz
word for what I do during my day job and
and so I was curious if you've heard
that and also what are kind of your
feelings about buzz word fatigue and
stuff like that related to this topic
that's a really good question i think
it's natural for engineers and
developers to you know where i
understand what the pieces are under the
hood like why do you have to come up
with this over arch and abstract idea
what's interesting though is that when
you step away from kind of the developer
engineering side like for example i was
talking to a friend who's a developer
who came to the event and he was working
on a start-up and he hears the
progressive web app thing and he
naturally is just like really do you
know do you have to build this do you
have to say this you have to sell it
sounds market any developers are
allergic to that a lot of the time but
what was interesting was his startup got
acquired by a really large company and
now he is kind of head of web technology
at this company and he wants to start
using you know all of the technology
that we're talking about and he found it
was just a really useful tool for him to
sell into the business where he could go
in there and just be like okay have you
seen if you heard that the Washington
Post did this progressive web map thing
yeah it's awesome what I want give me
some of that give me some of that
progressive web app and that gave him a
different way to converse with the
business side and so for me really it's
about those kind of things more than
about the the particulars and I think
we've seen that time and time again with
Ajax and other things it starts as oh it
means this this and this and very
quickly becomes a more abstract general
concept and then we come up with the
next one and so you mentioned kind of
the business angle there and I'm I'm
wondering uh let's let's say I'm a
business why would I be interested in
you
investing in this particular approach to
building applications yeah this has been
really fascinating kind of meeting with
you know different partners that we have
different developers and talking to the
business side in general I think a lot
of the time we think of kind of the
collective thing as you know progressive
web apps is building this ideal
experience but a lot of the times it's
kind of working out what the particular
pain points in a business sometimes it's
in a particular vertical so you're in
the e-commerce world and there are
particular pain points that you have and
there you know payments API credentials
API you know that are come in a huge for
you you have a massive impact push
notifications to reengage customers when
they're you know they've left things in
the car these things we see from our
pond and have a massive impact and so
it's about kind of finding those things
and helping to educate these companies
and and you know the case studies that
are coming around out around this are
just really helpful and you know I still
find that like you know we're very much
in the kind of middle of the storm so we
know about although these things but you
get out a little bit I was just talking
to a company that we're saying you know
we love the web our thing kind of is
built on you know you're in some social
weary you click a link and you get into
our experience but we need to build an
app now because we need push
notifications they had no idea that you
could do push on the web another company
we're talking to once they found out the
way i could do push notifications to the
desktop side like I thought this
progressive web app thing was a mobile
thing right and it's like no it's a web
thing and so a lot of it's just kind of
not getting totally wrapped up in it
means implementing every you know
possible API and finding out what makes
sense for a particular business so if I
am one of those businesses I have a team
of developers we want to learn more
about these different topics push
notifications as an example where would
be a good place for me to go to just
kind of like start to learn those skills
so we just updated
developers.google.com/live but I owe to
kind of have more content on the
progressive web apps I'd the amp side
and the like but also kind of the key
underpinning technologies that we think
are important performance
charity accessibility etc that's the
place to go and we've only just started
with that you know rewrite so to speak
there's a ton of content that we need to
get on there and so I think that'll be a
good holding place for people to check
out and see what's going on right on ok
so Dion thank you so much for being with
us today everything di mentioned
developers.google.com / web all that
great material we're going to link to it
down in the show notes we've also got
links to the progressive web apps
playlist so you can see all the talks
live from from Amsterdam there also be
sure to go check out the chrome
developers youtube channel click that
