most bikes on most web pages we can do
better
responsive images are a huge topic so
I'm just going to give a whistle-stop
tour first day some general principles
for using images on the web the goal
here is to increase performance and
reduce data cost now the first step in
that is to avoid images wherever
possible text CSS and so on use vector
formats where possible SVG you can use
icon fonts but there are good reasons
not to use them I won't go into that
here anyway always use the lowest
possible resolution and quality image
use the right format for the image type
web P PNG JPEG and so on speaking of
image formats there are also a few use
cases for inline images with data URIs
when you're using responsive design with
PWS be especially careful about aspect
ratio with images width and height if
you specify height as well as widths now
which may be good for performance make
sure to get it right you can incorporate
lossless compression tools in your
workflow and remember to use online
tools and to add testing to your
workflow PageSpeed insights web page
test and many other free tools are
available it's a great time to be doing
responsive image design on the web you
have really powerful elements and
attributes for sizing resolution and to
reduce data cost this chart is the
picture and source set as you can see
there's great support across modern
browsers there is also a picture
polyfill available for older browsers so
what makes responsive images responsive
firstly the resolution of the screen you
need to serve images with more pixels
two devices with higher resolution
screens and vice versa secondly image
display size this is the size at which
the image is actually displayed and that
can vary significantly even on the same
device
100% width in a maximized browser window
on a big monitor is going to need an
image with much larger dimensions then
if the images displayed at say 30% width
in a smaller window think about format
support different browsers support
different formats for example you might
want to serve web p images to browsers a
support web P and provide a fallback to
browsers that don't our direction you
might even want to serve a different
version of an image depending on display
size just like we mentioned earlier
let's take a look at the source set
attribute this example shows what are
called pixel density descriptors the
source set attribute tells the browser
which image to choose depending on the
pixel density of the display this might
be one extra desktop monitor 2x for a
laptop screen or even more on a phone
for example note that fallback to source
so this will work on browsers that don't
support source set also note the use of
the alt attribute improve accessibility
now unfortunately we're not going to
cover a lot of accessibility in this
course but the alt attribute is
fundamental for those using screen
readers or for users with images turned
off for a browser there's a catch-22
when it comes to choosing which image to
download the browser needs to know the
dimensions of each image but it can't
know that without downloading each image
to check enter the W unit the W unit
tells the browser the width of each
image in pixels thereby enabling the
browser to choose the right image to
retrieve depending on the screen pixel
density and the viewport size that's a
bit clearer the source set attribute is
giving the browser information about the
image width it does not specify the size
to display the image you still need CSS
for that now note that we can't specify
both pixel density and width descriptor
in the same source set it must be all
pixel densities or all with descriptors
you can go further than just telling the
browser the image width sizes attribute
describes the display
a size of the image element the sizes
attribute here is telling the browser
this wallaby will always be displayed at
50% of viewport width given the image
files available please choose
appropriately this enables the browser
to select the smallest possible image
size to download the picture and source
elements enable us to provide
alternative sources for the same
resource the browser will stop and load
the first source element that it
understands and load that image if the
browser can't read the file specified in
the source elements or if the browser
doesn't support the picture and source
elements the default image will be
loaded from the source the source
elements can include different file
formats in this example we use WebP II
first and then jpg as a fallback and
provide the same JPEG file as the
default image in the image element you
can also use picture for art direction
that means choosing different images for
different display sizes the source
element can take an optional media
attribute where you can specify a media
query when that media query is triggered
then the image in The Associated source
set attribute will be loaded only one
image will be loaded at a time
kitten large when the window width is
650 pixels or larger kitten medium when
the window width is at least 465 but no
more than 650 pixels and kitten small
when the window is less than 465 pixels
wide if the browser doesn't support
picture and source then only the image
tag will be used and you will see the
small kitten image the live demo link
will take you to an example of this code
for you to test and practice okay hold
on here hat
is everything put together we've
combined media queries and source set to
specify images for smaller and larger
viewports with different images for
different pixel densities don't forget
there are tools for making this part of
your workflow so you don't need to
manually code all this there are lots of
resources to help you get started in the
materials that go with this video the
lab exercises will help you get started
with responsive elements and
attributes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
