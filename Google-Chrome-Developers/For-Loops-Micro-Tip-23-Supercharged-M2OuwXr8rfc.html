them and we all have used them to
iterate over an array of things do you
see what I did there
modern JavaScript has improved for loops
to make the process of iterating over
things much more convenient first line
is the for off loop it iterates over the
members often iterable like an array
instead of having to maintain an index
variable and checking against the length
of an array we can instead use the off
keyword the loop body will be executed
for each member of the array for a while
now javascript and web api's have been
making extensive use of promises to
handle any sort of asynchronous
iteration more elegantly javascript has
also gotten support for the for wait
loop it works the same as our previous
for off loop but if the value is a
promise the loop will await the promise
this means it will block until the
promise resolves and we'll be using the
value the promise results - for the
loops body but there's even more you can
make any of your own types iterable or
use generators which are functions that
make creating interval types extremely
easy if you want to know more take a
look at Jake's article in the
description enjoy looping and iterating
yeah
what really okay I'm being told you want
to watch more supercharge well there's
two buttons for your convenience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
