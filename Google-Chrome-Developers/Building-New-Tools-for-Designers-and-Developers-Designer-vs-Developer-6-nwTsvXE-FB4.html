whatever I usually try to make things
pixel perfect and really well-crafted
but then when that's that process of
handing it over to a developer if
there's a lot of things are lost and it
makes me wonder if the tools that were
using be it like any of the graphics
applications don't feel like they're fit
for designing for the web and like
designing in browser doesn't make sense
to me so I mean I suppose the leading
question I'm going to ask is do you
think our tools are fit for purpose well
apart from the fact that I don't really
know all the tools that the diners have
because I'm really not good at designing
so I don't even try anymore maybe I
should I think that is one of the big
issues that are definitely there so I've
been working with some designers in the
past and as far as I know most of them
work in Photoshop InDesign which are
couldn't be further away from the web
really yeah so it's like okay so
classical page layout these tools are
grateful because we have a static visual
like you're trying to create well on the
web you don't even know what size your
canvas is going to be and you have to
adapt accordingly and that just doesn't
work and I know that tools like sketch
have gotten more popular because they
have a little bit more of a modular
approach to the time we have like things
you can move around as a compound and
not have individual lines and layers
necessarily but even then it's still you
end up with a visual fixed visual
nothing that conveys animation like how
a site mass comes into the frame when
you click it or how the site is supposed
to adapt when the screen size changes so
you guys have I think adapted to a point
where they usually design the same page
like three times phone layouts or tablet
layout and desktop layout but that still
assumes that there's three fixed sizes
and we have loads of different pixel
densities and aspect ratios and sizes
and distances to the screen where the
user sitting all these things are not
very well covered and I know that for
example sketch has a new plugin resizing
and we flowing exactly where you can
venue it to find anchor points and have
a little bit like
can basically resize your design and can
define how things are supposed to move
around on the screen size changes so
that's a good step in the first
direction but still most designers said
everything I worked with are more
familiar with classic print design and
that doesn't carry over well to the web
I mean do you find that quite limiting
then along with the outcome because you
are potentially receiving these static
mock-ups which have been no relationship
to the thing that you're going to create
by even just typography sometimes you
have to like for performance reasons you
may have to work like you know go with
default font typeface is like all the
system fonts and so much it seems like
that process is like there to stroke the
ego of the designer rather than the
thing that you actually create it's it
is not necessarily limiting because in
the end I have to make the precursor I
always think that I have I can strongarm
my decisions I can be like what you want
is not possible I'll just do it the
other way around but of course I usually
think the design that I get are really
good I want to make them I want to make
them it's as close as possible so I
think in that case um it's not really
limiting it's more exhausting because
you have to have much more feedback
loops with the designer in to can't do
this what else do you think would work I
can place the underlying exactly that
position because I don't have control
but add all these little bits and pieces
of designs have a lot of care deeply
about making something pixel perfect and
if you don't implement that way I get
angry at you and then you have to like
you know try to try to make it right
again so that's why I never change
designers that often back when I was a
freelancer okay so designers because I
knew they had a rough understanding of
the web what is possible what is not so
the designs would mostly kind be fairly
reasonable to do and I was just acting
like okay I have to make a compromise
here on the site because sometimes the
page could be too small or these things
that sort of extra work right and in
that is something that especially had to
start as a freelance web designer it's
money that you don't learn yes so I
think the other way to approach is if if
designers would get a little bit more
familiar with the capabilities
of the current web what is coming what
can CSS do what can't do and so what you
think about - elements and what is -
elements for designers who have no idea
what actually is well in terms of design
is actually producing question cuz
they're barely is any designer different
- elements with a project I've started
with Rob Dodson and Monika link oh
that's good in December basically we're
trying to take common UI pattern
elements like an accordion a side nav a
radio button group and we implement them
in custom elements but make sure they
are high performance very flexible and
accessible which is something that often
fall short in UI libraries where they
don't work well with screen readers or
just don't have keyboard input at all
and or if you're taking you can style
them as freely so in this case they're
really raw implementations with almost
no design attached to them and the I
guess the the new thing about it is that
you're not supposed to necessarily use
those but to read the code so we have
taken the majority of the time to make
sure the code is super clear super clean
very well commented we actually produce
the code into a return the code into
website where you have code and comments
side by side to know basically for every
line why it's there and what it's doing
and I'm thinking it's going to be really
interesting for the ecosystem that they
will have a chance to see how we can do
something it's highly flexible visually
very cycle designers can basically say I
want my radio box to look like this and
still have all the benefits of
accessibility whatever yeah all the
marks of performance excessively all
these things I mean that's really
amazing because I mean from a design
point of view we will never really talk
about accessibility and I think when it
comes to like the tools that we we use
to create these things are very boxed in
and it's like doesn't take into
consideration behavior yeah so I mean
it's actually part of the invention to
educate it's mostly to educate it so
it's a mixture of educating about how do
you do accessibility on the web
how do you do custom elements how do you
do high performance and how can you
achieve all three things at the same
time without trading off developer
convenience or
you know spending eight hours a day just
on getting the accessibility right like
it is it's possible it's doable and it's
not too much to ask for developer to
make this accessible let's probably be
one of the basic messages we want to
send with this yeah I mean do you think
so I mean the tools we use do feel like
inferior I mean what what you think
would be the next steps for designers
and developers to improve that kind of
tooling in order to make production or
like the final things much more easier
much more streamlined I suppose I feel
like especially right now the web is
it's such a fast point developing so
quickly so many new things for the every
major for the work kinda with red
Solomon ami I don't know it sounds
cheesy but it's like it's catching up so
so many new capabilities on the web and
service are being one thing yet I mean
we've talked so about soccer for two
years now almost and we're still
exploring the patterns and best
practices around them so considering all
the other news things they are like web
Bluetooth and web muse B and I mean
finally having web components on all the
browsers and all these things it's going
to take time to have the best parents of
practice with it at the end the
streamlined process for do using those
things is in place so I guess it's too
early to call to a week so yeah but I
feel like a lot of people do it spend
enough time on figuring out how to do
things right how to do like I guess I'm
one of them now I'm trying to do
accessibility in performance at the same
time yet so it's we're getting there
so it's really the gold rush and trying
to figure out we're still not there yet
but we will get there eventually I mean
we're not there yet what we can do right
now is pretty amazing and I feel like we
have now some apps that are purely on
the web they are really really good and
can you know keep up with native and we
have a choose it we are kinda there what
we can also be so much better
I find it really fascinating every time
I do create a project no matter how or
what the output or the final product
ends up being I just want so much in the
process and I discover so many new
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
