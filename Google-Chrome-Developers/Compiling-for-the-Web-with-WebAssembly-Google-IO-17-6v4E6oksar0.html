at five o'clock at night my name is Alex
Danilo I do a lot of work on the web
I've been doing web stuff for a couple
of decades I suppose I actually added
the HTML spec at w3c
and I'm very excited about web assembly
so I'm even though I love JavaScript as
much as I'm sure most of you do have to
confess I'm a real performance freak so
I love native code just as much the
beauty about web assembly is that it
lets developers compile from C and C++
or other statically typed languages into
a format that we can load into a web
browser it lets you build
high-performance web apps and that's
what we're going to kind of go through
today what it's about how it works okay
so why why do we even have web assembly
I can tell you're probably wondering
that's why you're at this session the
thing about JavaScript is because it's a
dynamically typed language there's a
limit to how far you can push
optimization so over the past few years
v8 and SpiderMonkey and all the other
JavaScript engines have done amazing
things to push the envelope of
performance but at some point you hit a
hit a kind of brick wall where you get
smaller and smaller improvements and we
look for another way to get high
performance on the web when we also
think about progressive web apps as
there's a session going on about
progressive web apps in parallel with me
that's the other Alex one of us is the
evil one but when you think about
progressive web apps as a kind of switch
towards a native app like experience
it's about better UI it's about higher
performance one of the things one of the
bottlenecks is the JavaScript right so
are there any abnormal native app
developers in the crowd can I have a
little show of hands maybe one or two
not too many but one of the things is
that there are lots of that developers
out in the world many many many millions
of them and they write in C and C++ they
use libraries there are plenty of great
libraries
processing video compression machine
learning all this kind of thing now
imagine how it would be if you could
take your existing application code for
your Android app or whatever and
cross-compiler to deploy in a browser
and that's what web assembly is it lets
you take existing C++ code deployed in
the browser and have it run performant
lis what's really exciting about this is
that all the browser engines are doing
it and I'll go into a bit more detail
there it means you don't have to ever
rewrite your code just because you want
to run in a web browser
okay so I just want to start with a kind
of little introduction to how JavaScript
works and how the JavaScript engines
work now take this tiny little function
here it's just adding two things
together and returning it this is some
simple Java scripts now can anyone here
guess what happens when JavaScript
engine sees that plus it horrifies me
whenever I look at it because it looks
something like this this is the ACMA
script standard for plus this is like
these are the semantics that the
JavaScript engine has to deal with
whenever it sees a plus B because Java
scripts are human written language it's
kind of designed to be easy to write and
convenient you have to do all these type
coercion 's you have to do all these
lookups I might be adding a double to a
string I might be adding an object to an
integer all these things have to be
dealt with by the JavaScript engine and
so what happens in modern engines is
they try really really hard to shorten
this path to as small as possible but
it's really hard to do but so what we're
really looking for is a way to get
closer to the metal to build a good
compiler target web assembly is not
about writing code in web assembly it's
nobody writes in assembly on a normal
computer people wrote assembly in the
60s and then they invented high-level
languages so to compile a target I won't
go into all this messy because it scares
the hell outta me
all right so basic principle of vine if
you want your code to run faster do less
it's very obvious very simple but when
it comes down to it what I would like
ultimately is to write a plus B in my
code and have the plus convert to a
single CPU instruction that's the
ultimate aim that gives you the limit of
optimization and that's what webassembly
can do you can actually add things
together ends up with a single machine
instruction so it's basically at the
limit of what's possible this kind of
portable code idea of running on
different architectures and being
portable has a long history that
predates the web so I'll just run
through a few earlier tense to set the
stage for how web assembly does what it
does so way back in the 1970s we had a
thing called P code and P code ran
underneath Pascal and it was an idea of
an abstraction of a machine that could
then generate P code and this
intermediate code will compile down to
the particular architecture on which you
are running fast forward a few years
later we ended up with bytecode like the
Java Virtual Machine or the.net runtime
which was a great example of a multi
language intermediate format if you look
around in the Google Play Store for
example we've actually done a lot of
analysis of native apps of native apps
that are actually in the store if you
look at like the top thousand apps the
vast majority of them are using the
native development kit or the NDK so the
compiling from C++ the majority of the
app logic is in C++ they're not using
very much Java at all so this is a bit
of a telltale where we should try and
support C++ on the web to get higher
performance and the reason these people
on Android are doing this is for
performance but these kind of devices
with installed apps or a closed system
and what we have is the open web and so
that brings a whole new set of
challenges like security and privacy
they will print plenty of previous
attempts to run native code in the
browser and I'll kind of run through
them for you because it gives you a good
idea about where we're coming from and
also show you how the
works to integrate webassembly inside it
and what you can do with it as well okay
so current web assembly as it stands
today runs at 1.2 times speed of native
code which is an astonishing number when
you think about it this is a format that
is compiled into a sandbox safe
environment runs within a whole lot of
constraints to make sure it has no
security vulnerabilities or is very
hardened against them and yet it's only
a small slow down compared to true
native code if it's probably like two
weeks of Moore's law in the evolution of
computers now the teams are working
really really hard to speed that up a
little bit more but the most important
point I want to get home to you right
now is that this is not one browser all
the full browser engines have done this
and they are seeing very similar
execution times and so this is really
exciting but anyway before we go into
the details like what did we learn from
the past that got us to where we are
well many years ago the only way to get
high-performance on the web was with
plugins okay we had lots of plugins for
different things we had flash with his
JIT we also had Java with its virtual
machine and it's Jude as well and
hotspot optimizer there are lots of
things like that plugins were great in
their day however plugins aren't very
good for today and the reason is that
even when we put a plug-in into a
sandbox environment we still cop
security holes it's just really hard to
control the other thing is that plugins
just do not play or nicely with the web
api we have lots of web api is we have
you know
motion detection we have you know stuff
you can do with a camera where there's a
lot of web api s that are native to the
browser but you can't get that them from
the plugins right so this kind of this
joint model that doesn't work very well
but i think the single most important
reason plugins aren't a great idea for
the modern web is these things right
they just don't run on mobile and so
it's very hard to give your users a
performant experience
from a plugin that doesn't exist and on
top of that people have to install
plugins and so you're not actually using
the browser out of the box you have to
do a whole lot of extra work just uses
so that was a very early thing and then
we moved on later to this thing that
we're good all built called Native
Client
so what Native Client was it was a
target for compiled code to run in the
web browser but initially it only
targeted the single architecture so it
was a sandbox compiler target so it was
safer than proper native code ran pretty
fast but again it had the limitations
that it didn't talk to other web Web API
so really didn't work with your Dom
object and also at only ran in Chrome
which is one browser we tried for a few
years to evolve this we've developed
portable Native Client if you remember
portable Native Client that actually let
you target an intermediate code that
could be compiled on the client side to
number of different architectures but
then opens up its own set of problems
because once you have the compiler in
the browser then that compiler could be
vulnerable to security holes and so you
have to put the compiler itself into a
sandbox so it was an incredibly complex
architecture and none of the other
browsers wanted to do it because it was
just too difficult so along came a few
smart guys over at Mozilla with a
research project initially that's called
Adam J's there's a very interesting
thing the early evolution of aztlÃ¡n
jeaious it was running incredibly slow
as a proof of concept but over the years
they refined this to be a really great
way to create a compiler target that was
compatible with plain JavaScript so what
as Andreas does is it takes C++ compile
it down into a tiny tiny subset of
JavaScript that contains a bunch of
bunch of annotations and then the
JavaScript engines attempt to compile
that into fast native code however one
of the limitations of Azam's ojs is that
the different JavaScript engines all ran
with different performance and so you
couldn't rely on a cross browser
performance story
so let's just see how as Andreas and
webassembly differ in the real world
let's have a look this is here is a an
example of an atom jeaious piece of
output so if you compiled your C++ code
you might get this and so this first
line of the function x equals x or 0
that's that's a hint telling the
JavaScript engine that that is an
integer so that can help the
just-in-time compiler to generate
machine code for an integer because it's
explicitly annotated but do I understand
why web assembly is a better model than
this or a faster model we have to look
at how a JavaScript engine works and
what it does when it sees this so within
VA any JavaScript program you write this
is kind of the first thing that happens
okay on the Left we have some JavaScript
source containing a bunch of JavaScript
functions first thing we need to do is
parse it so it converts you know all the
strings and things or whatever in the
source code into tokens and generates
this thing that's called an abstract
syntax tree now the abstract syntax tree
is an in-memory representation of the
logic of your program so here we have an
if-then-else
thing they're drawn up as a tree so once
you've generated the internal
representation you then at least in v8
goes straight to machine code you
basically walk the tree spit out machine
code and there you have your compile
function but that's a very fast
operation and there is no real attempts
made to speed that up now if we take all
of that and squish it up and go to the
next stage this is what the v8 pipeline
does we have this thing called turbofan
and so what happens is that the steps
from the beginning there to the left
where the first kind of red blob is with
the unoptimized code while your
JavaScript application is running
there's a lot of code inside v8 and all
the other engines do similar things
looking at what's running slow looking
at the hot functions going oh this one's
bad and when we identify slow functions
we then reoptimize them so we push them
through this back in here which is an
optimized JIT that creates much
faster code for those functions that are
cheering all your CPU but the one thing
I really want to emphasize here is it
this action of analyzing the code and
then deciding what to optimize that'll
cost CPU cycles and that means uses
batteries on a mobile device
so in yasm JSK if it comes in through
the pass stage so all the work of
parsing generating abstract syntax tree
generating the code realizing it's hot
rhe optimizing it is all CPU cycles but
you don't really need to burn because if
you use web assembly it hooks in like
this so what happens is that the web
assembly has already gone through
optimization during the compile phase
there is no parse as such right so we've
seen with loading large as linnaeus
programs there can be 10 or 12 seconds
of load time for a reasonably sized
application so you eliminate that past
time and what you actually have is
optimized binary they can hook directly
into the Jeep back-end which will
generate the machine code and all the
optimizations have already pretty much
been done by the compiler at the front
end so this particular picture with in
v8 shows that what happens is we when
you load the JavaScript load the
JavaScript engine and load the web
assembly module we can compile the whole
thing in one hit and we're ready to go
and everything runs at full speed some
other JavaScript engines like chakra in
edge they take a different approach and
what they do is they lazy compile so
they actually leave the module in memory
and the first time a function is called
they compile it at that point so they're
kind of trading ahead of tight time
compiled delays with kind of small
hiccups on the way anyhow moving on I'll
just kind of try and explain web
assembly is the concept now so what
actually is it and the one thing I've
been asked multiple times in the last
few days is does this mean we don't have
to write JavaScript anymore and the
answer is no right it's a complement to
JavaScript it's a way for people to take
C++ or C or rust code or any other
statically typed language and compile it
down to a mod
all that you can call from JavaScript so
they work together right one of the
things is also when we were developing
this was that people realize the
shortcomings of Native Client and the
shortcoming comings of Azzam jeaious and
it was actually developed by the same
people so the people that built Native
Client and the people that built as
andreas and people from Microsoft and
Apple all work together to build what we
have today so what we actually do with
it is it's tightly integrated into the
web platform it's a new capability you
have to think of it as that it's not
meant to replace JavaScript it also that
also means you can talk to all the Web
API so you can call all the standard Dom
functions or all the api's from your web
assembly code via JavaScript it does
have a few differences like 32-bit
floats and 64-bit integers and in the
future there's a plan to add threading
and multiple instruction at the same
time seeing the primitives so that's
kind of it in a small nutshell but I'm
about to go through a few technical
slides that are very dry and boring so
feel free to go to sleep for about the
next four slides if you're not a total
geek but I'm this is just pretty much
what's the goals of the design of web
assembly whether the first thing was to
be smaller than as nsj and right now a
web assembly module is smaller than the
gzipped
as MJS equivalent so it's smaller over
the wire the it wanted to be easy to
verify when I talk about verify what
that means is verifying that the program
is safe this is actually designed to be
run in a kind of sandbox environment and
so one of those things with running in a
sandbox is that you can't let stray
accesses out of them the memory of the
executing program happen so effectively
you can run through the web assembly
binary code in the file in one go and
validate that there are no accesses
outside of the bounds of the memory
block it's contained in you don't have
to do it that way but it is possible in
the
on same thing for the compilation should
be able to compile it with one pass
through the file and as I said before
other JavaScript engines have chosen to
imp to compile piece by piece for their
own design reasons the other thing is
also it needs to be extensible so right
now there are a very small number of
primitives which I'll show you in a
minute but the whole design was built
around adding new things later so let's
take a look at the basics of the memory
model this is a little bit of a scary
slide that's why I warned you in advance
but basically the memory for a C++
program compiled into web assembly looks
like a typed array to JavaScript so it's
a contiguous block of memory with no
holes in them but one of the features of
web assembly that helps with security is
this concept of an execution stack which
is separate from the linear memory so if
you think about a normal sleep like
splice program you have a heap and you
allocate memory from the bottom of the
heap and you grow the stack from the top
of the heap and it's possible to take a
pointer and then look up into the stack
memory and start playing with variables
and not supposed to be playing with and
do all sorts of nefarious things and
this is a wonderful now where attack
vector but web assembly has a completely
different model the execution stack is
isolated from the web assembly program
itself so there is no way you can
actually poke into it and change things
that's a really cool security feature
also the functions themselves are use
integer offsets so they don't actually
have pointers the functions are numbered
functions which point into an
indirection table and then those
indirect calculated numbers jump into
the function for themselves inside the
module and the reason it's built that
way is so that you can load multiple
modules side by side so you just offset
all the indexes and everything works
beautifully but one of the things that
very important to point out here as well
is that the web assembly module has no
access to any platform api's so right
back in the bad old days of plugins you
could call any platform API you
you wanted webassembly has no such
access and so everything is mediated
through JavaScript which means you're in
control and basically JavaScript is the
bus and web assembly just does the job
it's told to I think some are miss my
clicks all right so here's I'm compiled
what's the kind of what we look at the
memory when we compile since there is no
direct addressing all the pointer
addresses can be bounce checks so what
that means is that you don't actually
have a big address a number you have an
offset and since we knows is the block
of memory the web assembly modules
running in is misspeak we can very
quickly check that that number falls in
that range to guarantee that we're not
outside our memory block that also means
that that check is cheap right when
jumping into a function to do that
that little bounds check is really
really trivial and also one of the other
features of this is at the moment web
assembly is a 32-bit address space so if
you're running on a 64-bit device what
you can actually do is load the web
assembly module into ran into memory put
two Hardware guards on each set of the
32-bit address space and if anything was
possibly going to escape the 32-bit
address space would trigger a hardware
exception which means you get that
safety at zero runtime costs which is a
fantastic fantastic ability okay so this
is pretty much web assembly in a
nutshell this is all we have one one
page one slide also quickly run through
what's there sorry avoids 32 and 64-bit
integers 32 and 64-bit floating points
as I point out before the 64-bit
integers are a great thing for C++ lots
of C++ programs use this it's not
available in JavaScript the functions
are owner BigTable everything's down
statically I've talked about the
indirection for the calling and we have
like a bunch of standard operations
there on the right all the standard
operations you'd expect on integers
adding subtraction multiplication
shifting on in also contains square root
and float and ceilings for
floating-point and it's pretty much you
know it's conversions to do casting of
course from C in C plus it's a kind of a
load store model the actual web assembly
virtual machine model is a stack machine
so if people have heard of virtual
machines there two types their stack
machines and there are registered based
virtual machines so it's actually stack
machine based model and there's a bunch
of structures and twelve control flow at
the bottom for you flips in your four
loops and you
yada-yada-yada alright and the status
this is what you're all here for right
can you use this stuff and the answer is
a resounding yes right now four engines
have implementations in various stages
and this is monumental to get for large
crowds browser engines to work together
to bring something to market it's really
amazing like and at the moment these
engines like um chrome implements the
binary format so all of the browser's
Ranger's implement just the binary
format but at the moment there's a lot
of work going on about integrating with
post message for web assembly modules
and being able to store them in index dB
it's also in the works with a streaming
API and of course threads are high on
the priority list as well and as far as
tools now you people who are developers
love developer tools I'm hoping anyway
and in any case LLVM is the compiler of
choice today you connect they're
actually a lot of tools as thing called
em scripting which people may be
familiar with but it generates web
assembly code and it can generate as
andreas as well there's another tool
called binary in and binary and works
with M scripting to generate the web
assembly itself so it's but it's a
standalone tool so it could be used with
other compilers such as GCC there are
other tools as well that take the binary
format and disassemble it into something
that's human readable and vice-versa so
there are lots of things you can play
with if you want to experiment if you're
really hardcore developer you might want
to have a look at the reference
implementation which is written in
stand-up markup language
and also right now there's a working
group at the w3c that's working on
formalizing the specs now that if this
standard was originally developed in the
w3c community group which isn't very
kind of an easy forum to get started
with new features in the browser's with
so now that we've progress to
implementations it's moving to a working
group for proper formalization okay so
I'm going to just do a couple of brief
demos just missed out with 101 this is
the game Conway's Game of Life is like
one of these classic classic games and
what's cool about it is it's one of the
first things you learn in computer
science the reason I wanted to show it
to you is because I had a good friend of
mine engineer called Sam who who decided
he'd try and make it as small as
possible as a web assembly module to
prove something so he compiled this
without the standard c library without
memory allocation and the way of
assembly module is two kilobytes so I'll
just switch over to my laptop of you and
I'll show you it running so this is
basically a simple game of life it's
running here in Chrome and as you can
see the performance it's not so fast
that's running the little glider is
flying down the bottom there you get a
rough idea how fast that runs so that
that's pretty good now of course if this
was a one browser story it would be not
a very interesting story so we'll load
up Firefox here inside Firefox is
loading up the web assembly module
running exactly the same code it's done
its own G ting and performance is
basically identical to browser engines
all right where are we come on duck
here we go all right okay so here we
have WebKit in the Safari technology
preview and lo and behold it's running
as well the same module running
beautifully not a problem whatsoever so
you'll notice here the execution speed
is basically identical between all of
them and just to round out the floor
I'll run it in a virtual machine in edge
now this runs a little bit slower only
because it's within a virtual machine
but it is edge and it works so this I
just want to bring home the point okay I
just wanted to show that this is a real
thing and it actually does run in all
browsers okay so can we just switch back
to the slide for one second
spectrum all right so this is my another
demo this this is another classic
computer science 101 which is a
Mandelbrot set so I literally was
modifying this code on the plane on the
way over here and a friend of mine wrote
the original in fact but the reason I
bring this one up is because this is
your perfect example of something that
uses an incredibly large amount of
floating-point and it's the perfect
candidate for a web assembly module this
is actually in C++ it's a bigger can we
switch the laptop again please and so
this is you know your classic Mandelbrot
but what I'll do is I'll just click
through and start zooming in on it to
give you an idea how fast the
computation is I mean that is
calculating four million pixels every
time I click the mouse this is how fast
I can run it using web assembly it'd be
nice to compare to JavaScript but in any
case if anyone's played with this kind
of stuff before they would understand
that looks like an interesting spot
whatever look just for fun there you go
all right we'll switch back to the
slides again all right and I've one more
little demo for you and this is
fantastic this is a wonderful
open-source community project by someone
whose github name is Shah MIDI and it's
called web DSP and what this actually is
is a video editor in the browser so
rather than showing your little toy
things you can still kind of showcase
what you can really do with web assembly
so can we hit the laptop again please so
what this is this is like live video
we'll just played in the browser now on
the right hand side he has these nice
little graphs that show JavaScript
implementation versus the web assembly
right now we're just playing the video
but if we put on a grayscale effect say
you know once the graphs catch up you
see we're pulling 63 frames a second
with web assembly and only for using
javascript
so this is amazing it has a whole lot of
little effect so he is doing like age
detection so these are like convolutions
and things this is all running in a web
assembly module just quite amazing and
to prove its not a can demo we can
actually switch to the webcam hello
Google i/o how is everyone so I can do
horrible things to myself you know I can
invert the color make myself look really
strange like bacteria some sets not very
interesting you can do like kind of edge
detection and here so if we're looking
at this you know the frame rates you can
see that's a lot more taxing on the CPU
but we're still pulling 58 frames a
second with web assembly this is five
with JavaScript
I could even turn myself into an alien
people of Earth we come from the planet
wisdom to help you with performance ah
fantastic exactly
okay so just wanted to show you this
brief video as well so the webassembly
video editor great piece of work jump on
that github address and have a look if
you like also we have a open source
project at Google which is all about
compressing 3d point meshes so it's a
great thing to use with WebGL and stuff
like that and the team that was building
it have done a whole lot of benchmarking
and so what you're seeing at the top is
the web at their web assembly code
compiled and the bottom is a MJS so it's
not JavaScript it's a zombie is the
whole point of showing you this is that
this is actually quite a really intense
computing
thing like really amazing compression
and webassembly decodes the model in 12
seconds but as India's takes 18 seconds
so the whole point of this is that web
assembly runs in two thirds of the time
of the equivalent as MJS and so web
assembly is kind of an improvement on
top of those nsj and this is just the
runtime the actual past time Fidesz nsj
is not counted here and that's much much
higher all right so I guess enough of my
talking and demoing I guess you'll
probably want to work out how you can
build a web assembly module for your
application and if you want to get set
up on your develop machines one thing is
that the Mandelbrot demo and the game of
life demo are both available over in the
code live area so if you want to get
started straightaway while you're here
at Google i/o you can go straight over
there and have a go otherwise when you
get home you can get it set up on your
own machine
so right now the LLVM compiler from the
inscription repository is your best
friend as I say if you visit this link
basically download the compilers build
the tool chain if you once you've
installed it and build it all you
probably want to do something with the
secret with C++ code and build your own
web assembly module and so once you've
done this it's pretty easy
here are two command lines one to build
a C file and one to be Gil the C++ file
it's as easy as that it's all you have
to do
the minus s wave them equals one in the
command line there that is the thing
that tells them scripting to generate
webassembly modules now the output of
this will be two files will be hello GAF
and it will hello dot wave them so hello
dot j s contains all the glue code to
call your module so it makes it all very
simple and I'll show you how you call
the module so here is like what you put
in inside your C++ code something like
this if you want to pass data in and out
you can use a thing called en bind in
this case we're exporting a function
called my function and from that
function we're returning a type of
memory view and so to JavaScript that
will look like a typed array now the
beauty of gift is that when you pass the
memory from C++ back into JavaScript
land
there's no copying the typed arrays maps
directly to the web assembly module heat
memory so there's no copying it's just a
direct access it's a reference so inside
your actual HTML file you put maybe the
script like this so hello dot J s
contains the magical glue logic and it
also creates the thing called module and
so when you're calling your function you
go module dot my function in this case I
pass in the width and height and that
data variable is returned that typed
away array reference that I can work
with of course you might want to do the
opposite because of course this is part
of the web platform and one of the
beauties of web assembly is that you can
interact with all of the web api so that
already exists so here's a fairly simple
example using am Azzam which is
literally a chunk of javascript that
gets called from the c++ code you can
also directly map your C++ classes to
JavaScript object and you can even
import JavaScript function names into
the C++ code it just requires a little
bit more boilerplate code but that's
perfectly possible so
they're a bunch of really cool resources
here if you want to follow up a little
bit more the main site is webassembly
door which contains the tools
documentation example lots of stuff some
great demos if you want to like be
involved in the design know a little bit
more about the nitty-gritty technical
details you can go to the design
repository which is you know quite scary
believe me but you might find that
interesting and if you want to get
involved with it you can get involved
with the community because the community
is where it was originally developed and
it's a friendly environment you can go
in and ask questions and get answers or
make suggestions for future changes in
any case when you first build yourself a
nice web assembly module and you import
it into your app whether it's a
progressive web app or not if it's a
progressive web app and starts running
really fast you know what your users are
going to say to you I can't believe that
not a native app anyway with that I'll
open the floor for questions then thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
