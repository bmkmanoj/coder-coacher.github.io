asked because I did think a little bit
further than you this is you started
driving and you've no idea where you're
going I thought since we went to the
Boozer in England we could this time
continued the trend but go to a vineyard
Oh classy see now look at this right I
kind of feel like all right like we did
the pub before back in England but I do
think this is a slightly better view how
how qualified do you feel it I know it's
red or it's clearish kind of colour it's
nice and it's not nice it's one of those
that's very binary with my wine tasting
and and I have an upper limit of about
five pounds or eight dollars and if it's
more than that it's probably not worth
it anyway right so I want since we're
here yes we tend to talk about the web
and today I think is no different I want
to talk about libraries and frameworks
ah
yes cuz you're not big on the frameworks
well you know and neither you on the
other hand I am not big on the framework
yes I don't think there's gonna be much
of an argument but I don't want to talk
about it because it bothers me that I
seen I perceive that the default state
of developers is I've got a blank page
here how am I going to fill it out ah I
need a framework which one do I use that
is a problem I have a framework so they
have a way of starting projects like
that there's an expectation to use them
from the offset and I think if you're
thinking what what combination of
frameworks should I use to render this
blank page then I think something is
wrong
yeah for me it's it's entirely from a
performance point of view well no it's
not actually bit okay step one
performance if your page has to load a
ton of JavaScript in order to make a
request for the actual data it's going
to display you've lost the performance
and you can sort of say oh but next time
it's going to be cached they might not
be in my taste code Buster the cache and
it's an assumption that somebody's gonna
come back again right base your goal
it's your goal but you don't
somebody's gonna it's like paying a big
fat hefty tax on the assumption you're
gonna get a repeat view and stuff falls
out the catcher all the time yeah
exactly
so not the serviceworker cache though Oh
human service worker here we go again
service worker one-trick pony Jake
Archie come on but it's got a cache you
can rely on it their eyes okay
performance that notwithstanding I think
for me it's about code ownership somehow
it's about a level of trust that I don't
necessarily feel and what I want to do
is I want to be able to feel like my
application code is the thing that's
running that I'm not running through
something else that I don't necessarily
understand running through something
else is fine because that's what a
library is right that you've got know
you've got hold both ends and you're
running through bits of library that you
don't understand
yeah but that's fine because if one of
them starts misbehaving rip it out I
just hold it yourself or find a
replacement but when you when you're
going through something else
so you're needing something else I think
you have framework and the framework
will then do little bits of it will give
you scraps
get out but then the frameworks you kind
of you're sat in a tiny bubble of the
overall application with a framework and
I feel like to get them also a framework
you need to understand how the framework
is built like and and these very much a
huge I actually feel maybe maybe this is
wrong but it feels to me like it's a
kind of the decision is an ergonomics
one like a developer's saying
myoga naam 'extra the users requirements
I want to feel like you know my job is
easy and what the user gets is what the
user gets and my my whole approach is
very much the other other way I'd rather
go the extra mile and all my users
benefit then my life is a bit easier and
I'll take some of the bad performance or
the the tax have using that framework so
I don't think that frameworks are
inherently evil and to be avoided but I
think you want to be able to transition
to one and say yeah now it feels like
we're getting to the point where we're
gonna reinvent that
and I think you can only do that when
you've got to a certain point with the
build so for you it's start lights start
with libraries as when you need them and
then make the jump to frameworks only if
you have to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
