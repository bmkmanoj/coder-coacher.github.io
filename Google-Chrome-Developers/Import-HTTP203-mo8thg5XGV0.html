we'll recap we have importers of there's
an import statement thing with
parentheses at the end that lets you
async import of a module I got that
right yes you have modules and you can
now not only just declare statically
what you import but use a somewhat like
a function call to put it in the middle
of your code and be like if this and for
that loop import these things now I
noticed a little bit in Matias is
article about this or he has a note
saying by the way import is not a
function then I write and I was looking
at this and it was like I MP ort open
parenthesis URL module descriptor close
parameters that's a function Matheson
like you got it wrong oh it's at Lee a
semicolon and yes of course
what or a dot then or we are civilized
people here yes I am a fan of the
semicolon that's something I agree with
my function like what it has been like
because it is yeah like you said it
looks like one yeah it's it's it's like
a keyword syntax e thing I'm sure it's
one of one of those one of those is
right and one of those is wrong once
again we had something like this before
there's another thing in JavaScript it
looks like a function but it's not a
function
yes super yes Lieber
super super that is and it's and they're
they're both not real functions for the
same reason and it's because it's that
reason Jake right well when you call
imports you're giving it a module
descriptor which is either well right
now it has to be a relative URL in a
particular format dot slash or whatever
sounds doable for function what is that
relative to your face
incorrect it's actually it's relative to
the scripture in okay I mean that makes
sense it's how script tags work as well
right no no if you use URLs in normal
scripts to the euros relative to the
page to climb interesting which would be
like a worker or or something okay so so
you end up with this this bit of
relative this which is specific to this
relativity bit of relativity would be
the correct English word to use thank
you for impersonating me how to speak so
yeah it is relative to the script file
itself okay so that's a property that
makes some sense it was s bit the same
way right if you have relative input
like URL savvy
favicons or yes that their relative to
the CSS file that that it's being used
in right
yes exactly yeah it's very similar to
that but in JavaScript we have this
concept of a realm but all you have
multiple word and that's so kind of tied
to the the global like what yeah the
unlike your ally like if you a
JavaScript environment that you execute
in yes load things in and you know the
files come from all the different paths
but eventually end up in this one thing
the realm the one realm so this relative
URL thing is not a property of the realm
its how could it be if you're importing
modules from all over the place exactly
and this is why it doesn't make sense
because that that call to import like
there's a question of visa well what if
you assign to that import to another
name and pass that to another script
like you've passed a function around but
now it operates differently and the same
goes with super like when you call super
you're referring to like that class yeah
their class so they kind of had this
decision as either it needs to be part
of the language or they do something
very weird with analyzing stack traces
to see which kind of score has having
someone good and that is why it's not a
function so you can't assign something
else it's not type of function it you
can't do call you can't assign it to
something else yeah slate through you
take one
finances sake some is all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
