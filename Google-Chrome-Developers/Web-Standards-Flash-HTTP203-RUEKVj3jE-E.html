mean I say excited it's both with
happiness and sadness
it's the announcement from Adobe that by
2020 flash will officially be retired
yes they no longer like shipping the
player it won't be any browsers it's I
mean for me it's like things that need
to be addressed because you relied on a
plugin and this plugin even though it
did great work was also occasionally
known for being not very safe right you
could run things on your computer it
wasn't supposed to be running on your
computer
oh yeah I love the old ActiveX stuff I
remember there was one released where
you could create a media player in
ActiveX yeah but we used to play media
but it also had a you could also iterate
over everything the CD drives on the
computer and one of the function you
could call was eject it's just like yo
since I found this out I was like wow
there's a mating type II type type send
it to a friend and watch them across the
office
you say enumerated e dress immediately a
picture like good old tower with like 60
I mean thinking about the things that
flash brothers so I think it had a huge
impact on setting a bar watch what needs
to be possible on the web so and it took
us actually way too long to get there I
think absolutely and even one of the
most basic things was if you if you
brought a PNG into flash yeah it would
work like you know even with an alpha
Channel you know fine but then if you
exported it like you'd drop in like a
you know 120k PNG yeah and you would get
this like 30 case without the other end
what it was doing is it was encoding the
PNG as a JPEG but then taking the Alpha
Channel out and keeping that as a PNG
and reapplying and so it was doing sort
of lossy with an alpha channel because I
remember it you could you could control
the quality when you export
from flash and you could get the typical
JPEG blocky fied artifacts yeah it was
JPEG so I didn't know that
I see didn't know that until now but now
it explains everything but if you think
about it like we are still struggling
with that on the web today like we've
got web P yeah but like not all browsers
have it certainly not I think there's a
few alternate formats that have that
sort of law see if now alpha Channel but
it's incredible to think of like the
very first versions of flash had that
and yeah we are still we are still stuck
thinking about everything on video right
yeah web it took opera like many years
later to kind of actually kind of go
right mean we it was the only platform
that did like anything with DRM in the
day which allowed big companies to bring
their content to the web in at least one
shape things with dynamic video like
that we we only kind of fairly recently
have with extended media source
encrypted media done it's the media
source extensions yes
yeah and that's where you know that
because he wrote the media and again no
but the same with like Web Audio like
that came way much later than than flash
K was it I mean even now we're at a
point where web animations are still not
widely supported or have all the use
cases and that was like the basic
feature of flash well to be fair I still
think in flash people were for doing
actual animations people were very
reliance on green sock like I don't
think that in the idea you could do your
animations
yes your animating by code it's like
time time to get green sock out that's
my guess yeah there wasn't like a web
animation type type of thing I mean it
would be great if part of the I mean
green sock it's all a lie brain it's
super good it would just be great if you
could just remove a chunk off their code
and have it on the platform as oh yeah
absolutely much specified as web
animations web animations just the
browser's don't have it fully
implemented and you know they have to
like reinvent the wheel and make sure
like no rasterization happen and all
these things and I'm hoping that this
deprecation will actually all these
things have we talked about the like
push them forward quicker and if and
moving so far yeah I remember when I
nine came out and like SVG became like I
think the thing that we now had across
browsers yeah
and then the war started like developers
were sort of like you know SVG is it's
the answer to all of our problems and
they never come for like Nobu SPG's bad
canvas is the way forward and I remember
sort of like me as a flash developer and
sort of seeing over flash developers say
the same thing we're like well the
answer is both right and yeah and and it
was yeah coming from a flash background
I said well yeah you use the vector
stuff for vector stuff and like Dom
based things for when you need the
interaction but if you just want to draw
something and then or even like yeah you
might want to draw something in vector
and turn it into a bitmap you might want
to take a bitmap and make it the
background to it vector shape and yeah
and flash really was doing there's a
tendency in the entire community to take
a tool and make it the tool for
everything hmm
even though you can't I wanna use
different tools with different purposes
and it's just it's it's I think we're
getting better at this but they're still
offensive like I want to learn one thing
and it should you know cover everything
so I only have to learn this one thing
not bother around the ever-evolving
ecosystem and I don't think the web is a
good place for that mentality honestly
well yeah and I think one of the one of
the things that we need from flash that
we don't have right now it's a good IDE
fiducials kind of animations I know it
adobe of working on it or were working
on it I can't I can't remember which
projects they still have on to go but it
feels like we're losing a sort of a big
group of people who don't want to write
code that are able to me amazing
animations that sort of sort of lost on
the platform or they've had to go to
something like After Effects or
something and and now you know the
developer will have to recreate all of
that sort of in the web so I hope we get
there with something like that I feel
like this fabrication is especially for
big companies to invest forcing them to
invest really into like replacing the
flash to their hat was something at its
native to the web and then yeah
hopefully the entire ecosystem will
benefit whenever I'm writing a talk I
get the same the same problem it's like
you know I run out of things to say and
well that's that they know by then by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
