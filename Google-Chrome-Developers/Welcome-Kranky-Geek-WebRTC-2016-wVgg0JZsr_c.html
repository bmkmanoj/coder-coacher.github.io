cranky web Rajneesh oh this is actually
our fourth event our third event here at
Google we've done one in India and the
fact that actually we're going to SAP
Paulo and Brazil next week to do a
similar event down there so if you
haven't heard of us before cranky geek
we're here to promote and help educate
developers on WebRTC all right so
introduce a few people sorry LaVon levy
runs blog geek me myself I run a blog
Webber see hacks for Weber C developers
and Chris Krunk ax in the back you can
just call him cranky because his name is
impossible to say um I do want to
encourage you if you want to meet anyone
or need help or have any questions feel
free to find any one of us so this
events a little bit unique a little bit
different than some of our events no
surprise here Mobile is big right and
it's obvious that there's an
intersection of WebRTC and mobile so
we've decided to actually focus this
event very specifically on mobile so
we're gonna go a lot deeper and be very
specific about all aspects of mobile
development today and we have a number
of you have top-notch speakers from
actual practitioners real developers
who've done this stuff and can share
their experience so we'd be spending a
lot of time going through that and I
really like to thank our sponsors
especially Google who give us this great
facility and it's been a you know a big
big big promoter in general for WebRTC
and in bringing this open source project
and developing it into a standard and
sharing it with the world
in addition we are very thankful to our
sponsors talkbox Twilio and video and
you'll see some more presentations from
them today and as always a the sfhtml5
group has been great and helping bring
you mostly here encourage you all to
join that meetup group if you're not
already and lastly thank you all for
your donations to a girl development

about that that great organization later
