ER and i'll be talking to you about how
you can make web experiences that work
for everyone around the world so as we
probably know the world is a pretty big
place looking at statistics from the end
of 2014 we have about 3.2 billion
Internet users around the world but when
we're actually developing and building
our experiences some of us might have a
picture of the world it looks a little
bit more like this and if we're really
sort of expanding out what we're
thinking about we might throw Europe
into the mix too but if you actually
look at where the internet users are
it's a lot more distributed than that so
this is a map that shows the number of
Internet users currently online where
darker means more Internet users around
the world for each country so you'll
notice that well the United States has
about two hundred seventy nine million
internet users there's a number of other
countries that are also quite prominent
India for example at the end of 2014 had
about 243 million Internet users so a
close runner up to the United States and
what's more interesting is where we
actually look where the growth is
happening this is a similar map that's
looking at users that came online in
2014 and here in the United States we
had about 17 million internet users come
online for the first time but in India
we actually had 30 million internet
users coming online for the very first
time just in 2014 and put that into
perspective 30 million that's about half
of the population of the United Kingdom
coming online in india alone in just
twenty fourteen and what's more if we
actually look at where we're expecting
the growth to continue to happen moving
forward this is the number of people who
are not yet online by country so you'll
notice that here the u.s. is less
prominent it's a little bit more
saturated we still see that about 42
million users may be coming online but
this is compared to India that we're
expecting about 1 billion and 24 million
Internet users who are not yet online to
be able to potentially come online so in
terms of where we're expecting growth to
be able to happen for new internet users
the United States isn't necessarily the
main focus here there's a lot of people
that will be coming online in very
different areas
so sure that those are some big numbers
but what does this actually mean and
what might this mean for your experience
at your building so I just want to look
at the sort of e-commerce in India and
some of the growth that we're seeing
here so a lot of users coming online
might not necessarily mean that this has
a big impact for you but this is just a
sort of case study of e-commerce so what
we've seen in India is that e-commerce
over the last years has really
skyrocketed and is continuing to grow so
these are some headlines from a number
of e-commerce players in the Indian
market today but just in terms of
projections there's actually expected
that by 2020 the e-commerce market in
India will be a hundred billion dollar
market so we're seeing really huge
growth and actually having functional
impact on the experiences and how users
will be interacting with your site in
some of these areas but there are some
challenges so a lot of us as we
mentioned we often sitting developing
with fast Wi-Fi connections on our
laptops but the users that are coming
online for the very first time may never
have used a laptop I was actually just
in India talking to a number of users
about what works for them what doesn't
how they use the web how they use their
phone and what some of the challenges
what they want what they don't want just
to get a better sense of what's going on
and I was sitting down with a 32 year
old woman in pune we were sitting in her
living room and i just asked her if she
remembers her first time using the
internet and her answer was yes it was
about a year ago she had borrowed her
husband's phone and use the internet for
the first time and this is very
different than my first experience with
the internet and probably a number of
your first experiences with the internet
we have people who are coming online
interacting with the web for the very
first time on a mobile device not on a
big laptop not on a Wi-Fi connection and
often times when we think of mobile
devices we might be thinking about
something like this we might have this
in our pocket or something similar this
is the next six 6p it was released in
2015 it's five point seven inches so a
pretty large device it has three
gigabytes of RAM and storage can vary
depending on which version you purchase
from 32 to 128 gigabytes of storage now
when I was just in India we also talked
talked to a number of store owners and
to get a sense of what sort of phones do
they have what sort of phones do they
sell
what do they suggest for someone who's
coming in to purchase a phone for the
first time and connect to the internet
for the first time and this is just one
example of a phone that they sell so
this is the samsung galaxy j1 it was
also released in 2015 it's 4.3 inches so
a little bit smaller it has 512
megabytes of ram and 4 gigabytes of
storage so just as a quick comparison
here we have about one sixth of the RAM
and best case scenario if you get the
smallest Nexus 6p we're talking about a
one-eighth of the storage space this is
a very different device profile than
what you might have in your pocket what
you might use on a daily basis and what
we often end up in visioning in our head
when we're actually building these
mobile web experiences the good news is
the web actually solves a number of
these problems that some of these
different device devices can introduce
installs as Darren mentioned are not an
issue on the web you don't have to worry
about your actual experience getting
downloaded on the device which can be a
real problem when you're talking about
some of these devices that have limited
storage space what's more is you don't
actually have to worry about the exact
apk size and worry about shaving off
megabytes on that apk so you don't get
blocked because users are just don't
have quite enough space to download your
experience what's even better is once
users are interacting with your
experience you don't have to worry about
getting it up to date because again with
native apps you often see that installs
can be child eights can be challenging
because they also require more storage
space and connectivity so the web does a
lot of things to actually solve some of
the problems or challenges that these
devices can introduce but there are some
other constraints that come into play
that I just want to talk a little bit
about the first is connectivity so a lot
of us here are probably connected to
Wi-Fi right now it might be a little bit
slow because it is a conference but in a
lot of these areas where users are
coming online for the very first time 2g
is incredibly prevalent and the 2g
speeds that we're talking about here are
about 60 kilobytes per second or
sometimes ranging up to about you know
in a good condition sort of 450
kilobytes per second and just to put
this in context globally sixty-two
percent of mobile connections are on 2g
and when you're actually looking at the
countries where users are coming online
for the very first time in India for
example you see eighty-seven percent of
mobile connections are 2g so this means
that a user's ver
a first interaction with the internet
borrowing their husbands cell phone
buying their own sort of first
smartphone they're going to most likely
be connecting on very different network
conditions than what we might be using
and what we may be testing and
experiencing on our own devices and just
some of this in context you guys are may
already be familiar with some of these
stats but a one-second delay in page
time can lead to very concrete impact in
the user experience so a study found
that this one second delay can lead to
eleven percent fewer pageviews on an
experience and this actually also has a
qualitative impact on the user's
experience where it led to a sixteen
percent decrease in customer
satisfaction and this is a one-second
delay which is when we're comparing 2g
networks to 4G networks or the fast
Wi-Fi we might have the seconds maybe an
order of magnitude or two larger than 1
second delays so making sure that you
can really make your experience as fast
as possible is very important and I'll
talk a little bit more about that later
the second is even when users are
connected the connectivity can be quite
expensive so in India it can take 17
hours of minimum wage work to get a 500
megabyte data plan so just put this in
context of sort of web and what we're
thinking about here looking at the
average size of a web page this roughly
translates to one hour of minimum wage
work in India loads about 15 webpages
this is a web page not a website so
every single click on on the web would
count as a separate web page here so if
you take a moment to think of maybe how
many web pages you visited this morning
or how many web pages you visited
yesterday do a quick mental calculation
of how many hours of minimum wage work
you may have been expected to work to be
able to afford that this can become a
really large number I got terrified when
I did this myself and would not be able
to work enough to pay for my browsing
habits so what this means both the speed
the connectivity and the device is that
users are interacting with their phone
and the internet somewhat differently
the first big consideration is that
users are making trade-offs regularly
choosing to use your experience comes at
the cost of choosing to use some other
experience because they might not have a
connection later or they might be out of
data for that day or that month and so
as a result we actually I was talking to
a student in Brazil about sort of how
she uses her phone throughout the day
and what we found is that during the day
as the day starts she actually doesn't
do many doesn't browse as often instead
she just only uses her phone when it's
absolutely critical to message a friend
that she's meeting up with or something
like that later in the day when she has
a sense of how much data she's already
used and how much data she has left she
lets herself explore more use the
browser when she gets home and some of
these other experiences because she
knows she has the data and won't be
stuck in a position of not being able to
do a critical task be it a search or
communicating with her friend when she
actually needs to similar to this
because of the trade-offs that people
are making constantly users are also
turning their data on and off and we've
seen this one user that I was also
talking to in India and mention that
they actually go into airplane mode
about 14 times in one day this is
because they in addition to just the
intermittent connectivity the concern
over data usage is very real and there's
a hesitation for releasing that control
and trusting that the experiences will
be data conscientious and so users are
just turning off data so that data is
not being used unless they know and need
it and finally sort of as a result of
these two in a number of these other
constraints every extra step that a user
has to take on their phone takes time
because of the connectivity might be
limited or intermittent and actually
takes money because each one of these
page navigation takes data and that
correlates directly to ours that they
need to work to afford some of these
data plans so this may seem a little bit
daunting right there's a big opportunity
but there's a lot of unique constraints
so what can we actually do to make the
experience better the first is removing
steps to reengagement so Darren talked
about some of the new features that we
have and those can have a really big
impact so this is just a simulation here
of navigating to a web page on a
simulated 2g connection so you'll notice
here is that I've navigating to google
com though there's a number of other
entry points for how I could get to a
web page be at a bookmark or from the
new tab page or another experience and
every step that has to happen here on a
2g connection just takes time
so this is actually a faster 2g
connection that we're simulating here
there is a broad range and so I'm
specifically trying to navigate to a
vhost voice memo app and the big thing
here is that the each step in addition
to just taking the time that this minute
this video in total will take about a
minute for me to get to my final
destination is also cut costing money so
I had to do two additional page
navigations before I actually got to the
experience that I was going for and this
is going to directly relate to users
having to make those regular trade-offs
if it's taking extra steps that's just
extra effort for the user that they need
to go through that is compounded by some
of these constraints that we see so
Darren talked about this a little
earlier but the features we have such as
the add to homescreen feature can really
help the user and actually get what they
care about as quickly as possible so in
addition to letting Yuri engage with the
user easily by just having this access
point you've also just removed a number
of steps for the user to get to your
experience in the first place so you're
reducing those trade-offs that they have
to make and the extra time and money
that they have to spend to just get to
your experience additionally with the
notifications that Darren also mentioned
and I will be talking about in more
detail later you can make sure that for
the experiences that are most time
sensitive or most critical to surface to
a user they don't have to spend that
time within your app taking those extra
steps as well you can directly link a
user to the experience within your app
that is most important and critical to
them and so with notifications this is
an example of Facebook one you can make
sure to deep link and remove not only
the steps to your experience with those
steps within that so you don't aren't
asking users to take this extra time and
money to get to some of the experience
that may be time sensitive but once knew
about users actually get to their
experience you want to make sure thats
as fast as possible and that your data
conscientious and what you're actually
creating so chrome actually has a number
of features that are aiming to help
already chrome data saver on Chrome for
mobile is already launched and I is a
proxy service for HTTP HTTP content that
can actually save up to sixty percent of
data on average and what we see is that
users around the world are actually
using this and enabling it and showing
that they are more sensitive to data so
globally data savers unable to protect
more than ten
% of users and we see much higher
percentages in some of these areas where
users are coming online for the very
first time what's more is we're actually
currently doing a field trial for data
saver users who have expressed
particular concern with saving data to
make sure that we're proactively giving
them control of where their data is
going so in this particular field trial
we're identifying particularly slow
connections and replacing most images on
the page with placeholders so that the
user can then choose to long press on an
image if they want it or click load
images to load all the images on the
page what this allows us to do is that
on those connections that are
particularly problematic and for users
who have expressed particular interest
in saving data we're actually giving
them back the control so that they can
make sure that the experience works for
them and they're using the data where
and when they need to we also have a lot
of functionality for developers to help
with this as well the PageSpeed module
is already available and with just a
single line of code you can add this in
and make sure that you're getting these
data saving experiences for both HTTP
and HTTPS content on your web page
experience and so what does lets you do
is for we've run some trials with this
and this does all the transformations
for you with functionally no visible
impact on the page for the user and for
users who have clients that have web p
enabled we've actually seen that on
average just causes 37-percent data
savings with the single line of code and
no user visible change so this is a huge
impact with just adding this to make
sure that for all of your users your as
data sensitive as possible and really
creating great experiences beyond that
we also have a number of hints client
hints that are available these are
coming out in m46 so we have dpr width
and viewport width which can make sure
allow you to optimize your experience
depending on the device that the user
actually has so what this lets you do is
make sure that for users who are on may
be on smaller devices you don't need to
send that whole large image you can
actually make sure that you're sending
just the image and the bytes that are
actually necessary for that user what's
more is we're also working on a save
data hint that will be coming out in m49
in chrome this save data hint is going
to map directly to that data saver
feature that we have in chrome so that
if a user has data saver on you will
know that the user is particularly
sensitive to data and you can make sure
that your experience works well for them
so just to give a few examples of some
of the things you could do here so for a
particularly data sensitive user you
could load only the critical images to
make sure that the default experience
really works for them and start building
that trust that you are aware that
they're dated sensitive to data and
you're taking proactive action to make
sure that you're building the best
experience possible can also do things
like changing the resolution of the
video or removing autoplay on any videos
you have so that the default experience
isn't the one that assumes that users
are comfortable using data but rather is
optimized for the user that you're
seeing to make sure that they are feel
that they are in control and that you
can gain that trust that the users know
that when they come to your experience
says data conscientious as possible we
also have a number of features that you
can use to help optimize the speed and
the experience on your web page
regardless of the connectivity quality
that a user's experience so downlink max
I was coming out in m48 as part of our
net info API allows you to not only see
the actual navigation connection type
but see what the maximum expected
throughput of that connection type is so
that you know if a user is on one of
those is currently connected to one of
those 2g connections and you can listen
to this so as users change based on
where they are or what their
connectivity actually looks like you can
make sure that your experience works
well so if you do want to have a
experience that assumes a sort of Wi-Fi
or very fast bandwidth you can but you
can also make sure that your experience
is really going to work well for users
who may not currently be in that
condition and they can adjust as those
situations change and what can be
challenging with a number of these
things is we are connected on Wi-Fi we
do have you know our 3G 4G data plans
and so it's often hard to stimulate and
actually see what your experience might
be like with dev tools in chrome you can
simulate various Network conditions we
also have page speed tests and I know
we'll do a deep dive tomorrow on various
speed related issues but I won't steal
too much from that but with page speed
test you can actually make sure that
your experience is fully optimized and
you can see what it looks like on
2g and 3g connections on device is
actually in a number of these countries
so you can fully simulate experience at
first hand see if it's the experience
you want and adjust it if not to make
sure that it's one that you think will
work for your users regardless of where
they might be so a lot of these things
have been assuming that a user is
currently connected they have a data
plan that they're worried about or they
have a slow connection but sometimes
that's just not the case and if you've
made reengagement really easy hopefully
users can click right into your
experience but you what you might want
to avoid as I'm tapping right into your
experience and being met with the
offline Dino page now I personally love
this game as much as the next person and
I'm happy to compete for high scores for
anyone who wants to later on but if
you're actually trying to engage and
create an experience for your users
something more like this might be
preferable so this is the same voice
memo app and when I'm offline I can
fully see all my memos listen to them
add new ones and interact with it and so
with service worker which I know will be
doing a deep dive into I believe right
after the break and you can do and make
sure do a lot for this experience to
actually make sure that when the users
are completely offline they can interact
with your experience and you can also
what's interesting is make sure that as
the user transitions back to online that
is seamless transition and they can also
any sort of actions that may require you
to be online to complete our
transitioned over smoothly so as users
are going in and out of connectivity
variations whether it's speed or
actually being completely offline and
then back to online you've created a
seamless experience for them across the
board so with all of these things you've
created an experience that's ideally
optimized for all devices not assuming
sort of big devices and the profiles
that we might be expecting or used to or
have in our pocket you made it really
easy for your user to reengage so that
you're not adding additional steps that
can actually just cost time and money
and when they're actually in your
experience your furthering this by
making sure that any clicks or
interactions within your experience are
very sensitive to time and the loading
speeds that users might be experiencing
and the cost that comes with that and
finally you've also adjusted to make
sure that on any type of connection your
experience still works well and can
fluctuate and adjust throughout these
and so with all of these things
can really make an experience that works
for everyone whether it's a user coming
online for the very first time or
someone who's on that speedy Wi-Fi on
that great connection you've adjusted
and built something that works for all
of the billions of users that we're
hoping and expecting to come online
thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
