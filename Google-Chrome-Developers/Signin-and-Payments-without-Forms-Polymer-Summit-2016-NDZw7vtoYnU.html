at Google from Tokyo office and as
Monica said I was born in late day in
general isn't people are said to be look
like younger than people other people
but I'm actually younger anyway um
today I'm going to talk about signing
and payment without forms so last month
I was going to purchase a TV rack I knew
what I wanted so I just searched for the
web for that particular product and I
found the most reasonable deal at a
small ecommerce website so I decided to
protest that using my mobile phone
according to a research sixty six
percent of mobile purchases are done
through mobile web rather than native
apps that's greater here right so I went
to continue to check out form and try to
fill out form but in the end I gave it
up the reason is that you know the
entire experience filling out forms is
so painful like typing credit card
information address information and a
password on tiny tiny software keyboard
is such a frustrating experience right
so the same research tells that the
conversion rates on mobile web is 66
percent fewer comparing to that on the
desktop even for returning users when
remembering and typing their password is
a pain another study shows that 92% of
users who visit your website
Reaves without resetting or recovering
their account when they forget their
password wave forms causing lots of
friction and we need to fix that
in order to overcome this situation web
platform have come up with two new ApS
which are a payment request API and
credential management API so what I'm
going to do now is to show you a demo
website which we introduced at Google
i/o called polymer shop and how we
integrated payment request API and
credential management API play nice
together okay so this is the polymer
shop website it looks nice right so
imagine that I'm looking for a sweater
or some kind of clothes that want the
app for upcoming winter so let's explore
the website by the way this looks all
good right and you want it but these are
not actual shop and please don't send us
email asking when you get the ghost
delivered we actually had that but
anyway let's continue yeah this one this
hoodie looks nice so let's purchase this
the price looks good sorry 885 bye now
and now you see a dialog pops up from
the bottom and this is actually done by
API called payment or except I let's
have a look at from the top so at the
top order summary shows the price of the
goods hoodie sorry 885 that's correct so
let's continue then next one is a
shipping address what is surprising is
that my address information 3 of my
address information of course this is a
fake but showed up and what is nice
about this is that you know that I am
not sign in or sign up to this website
yet but this information are already
available
why because I
in turn this kind of information in the
past using the same browser so browser
naturally remembers my address
information for me so I can use that
them here so let's select one and the
next one is shipping option so standard
shipping or Express shipping so I'm not
in hurry they can just select standard
shipping notice that by selecting one
the order summary has added new price
standard shipping so the total cost has
been changed and now I go to the payment
and like my address information my
credit card information is already
filled here it's quite nice right and
lastly a contact information so my email
address is there looks good okay
everything looks good so I can just
proceed to payment pay then I give my
CBC and confirm and done so imagine that
I wasn't explaining all this right it's
only a few tabs without typing single
letter using a software keyboard it's
amazing experience and now we are at a
calm creation page so the good thing
about making account creation page after
making parties is that users can part
make purchase using a guest checkout
which is much much lower harder for
users and then users are motivated to
create an account
you may provide some reason for that for
example you can provide like 10%
discount for the next purchase or maybe
you can provide like add a berry
tracking feature right so why not let's
sign up so email address is as you see
already filled up it's nice because it
was provided by payment request API the
email address is already filled so all I
have to do is to type my new password
here and sign up and down
and now if you look at the bottom of the
page it's asking me if I want to store
my credential information it's nice yeah
so save this will make my next visit to
this website much much easier so browser
assist me to sign in but here's a new
thing by using credential management API
the things got much much easier by
letting me sign me without a single duck
to demonstrate that feature I'm going to
swap device to a new one so what what is
going to happen is that the credential
information I have just for to my other
device it's synchronized across my
Google account and it is now it should
be now in my other device and hopefully
which we work and yeah let's see to be
honest this sometimes fails so fingers
crossed
okay ready look at the bottom of the
page boom I'm sign-in yeah
imagine that you know you have to sign
in by topping something at least but
with this you had no option required to
get signed in and just continue your
shopping experience this is really nice
okay can you turn back the pitch
slide so sorry
this beautiful integration was possible
because of a payment request API and
credential management API and I'm going
to introduce each of api's now so
payment request API so payment request
API provides a some standard compliant
online payment flow usually making
payment requires you to fill a long form
and submit that to the server but with
payment request API you can instead
filling out form you can just a few tab
to submit the same information
if there are no address or critical
information already available users can
just add them on the fly using the same
native UI the address information can be
stored and synchronized across devices
and available from anywhere for their
future shopping experience the best part
of payment request API is that once
those information is stored to the
browser we basically have all the data
required to get the payment flow gets
through the payment flow and without
creating an account even for the users
who have never visited your website
before can make purchase and it's easy
payment request API also allows third
party payment methods to be part of the
ecosystem anyone will be able to provide
an app or web app to for merchants to
process payment in the future one such
effort is under the pay for payment
request API which is currently in beta
and you
try it out to learn more about payment
request API we provide integration guide
and demo site and so on so you can just
follow the link she does she'll payment
request API so integrating America's API
into a polymer shop we created component
shop payment request nice thing about
making it a web component is that the
sum of predefined parameters can be set
as element attributes element attributes
declaratively like currency supported
methods and request request pay or email
and so on it's a declarative requesting
payment can be done through a function
call because it returns a promise you
can just continue with sending the
result to payment processors when the
promise results and now about the
credential management API so credential
management API provides a programmatic
interface to the browser's password
manager in a secure way so you can
obtain or store uses credential
information on behalf of the user as you
have seen at the polymer shop demo you
can enable out signing by obtaining the
credential information then send that
over to the server on behalf of the user
which is authentication sign-in using a
third-party identity such as Google or
logging is quite popular because it
allows users to sign in just by one top
right and it also good for your security
but the problem is that that kind of
information is not stored to the browser
so you forget forget which identity
provider and use to sign in to this
website right but by using credential
management API it can even remember that
information so by storing the choice or
we are a federated login account you can
let embark identity providers
authentication logic to let the user
sign mean even if you choose not to use
I mean you can still skip the signing
form by using it account chooser without
typing a password this feature is also
useful for those who have multiple
accounts so it's handy Android apps have
similar feature called a smart lock for
passwords by associating your Android
app and your website you can share the
same credential information between them
so if a user stored credential
information to Android app by signing up
he can that the user can come back to
that they're the same website associated
website to get a sign name which is
awesome to learn more about credential
management API we also provide an
integration guide and so on so you can
just follow Jesus CEO / credential
management API and integrating this shop
credential management API and entire
authentication mechanism was we created
by shop account component we put various
features into this for example a form UI
it actually included the UI and loading
UI notification UI as well as
authentication logic a federated login
logic and creation management API and
also managing profile data so it's very
complex and the point is that a lot of
different part of the app required to
access those kind of information or
logic so what we've done is to decided
to split that into two parts so one is a
shop account the same name with all the
UI related things and the new one is
shop account data which handles all the
authentication logic related things as
well as managing profile data by adding
a one meta behavior to the shop account
data we've made it available and through
throughout the app also by returning a
promise things got much simpler by
changing functions to reflect resolve to
the to the UI depending on the context
so recap poor mashup I started with a
polymer shop demo and it integrated to
api's which is a payment request API and
credential management API and how I we
integrated these aps in the polymer shop
and lastly I forgot to mention that what
about the TB rack I was going to
purchase and what I've done was after
abandoning my purchase on the checkout
form I just went home and used opened up
my laptop and continued my purchase and
it's happily sitting in my living room
so I'm very happy and yeah I'm hoping
I'm really hoping that that they will
come soon where I could finish all the
entire shopping experience using mobile
web thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
