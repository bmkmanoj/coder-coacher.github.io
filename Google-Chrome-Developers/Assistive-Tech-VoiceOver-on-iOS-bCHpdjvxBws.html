welcome back to the alley cache show
today we're gonna be continuing our
series on assistive technology by
looking at the screen reader that comes
with the iPhone which is called
voiceover so follow me over here to my
device and the first thing I'm gonna do
is go into the settings menu and go down
to general settings
I'll find the accessibility section and
inside of here there's a bunch of
options that we can turn on or off
we've got voiceover up there at the top
but before I go ahead and turn that on
I'm actually gonna go down here to the
bottom and find the accessibility
shortcut option I'll turn that on and we
want to enable switch control and
voiceover will you switch control in a
later episode but voiceover we'll use
that one today and what this
accessibility shortcuts lets us do is
triple tap the home button and then a
little menu will pop up and allow us to
turn voiceover on or off really quickly
that way so we don't have to keep going
back into the settings menu to like
toggle the state of it so let's see from
there we can switch over to our browser
and I've got a little dummy test page
here that we can interact with to kind
of like you know get our feet wet with
voiceover so the first thing we'll do is
we'll triple tap the home button to
bring up the accessibility shortcut and
then we can enable voiceover and as soon
as I do that this thing's gonna start
talking so get ready okay so since we're
using a touchscreen device the way we're
going to navigate in voiceover is
entirely through gestures similar to the
talkback screen reader on Android if
you're not familiar with all the
gestures that come with the screen
reader you can just kind of explore by
touch so move your finger around the
screen any sort of like important
element that it lands on it'll try to
announce that now any time I'm using a
screen reader one of the first things I
want to figure out is how to tell it to
actually stop talking so in the case of
voiceover you do a two finger tap to
tell it to chill out so for instance
I've got a paragraph here I can start
reading it and I can use two fingers to
silence the screen reader right very
useful especially if you land on a whole
bunch of content
now again it's a gesture based
screenreader so the primary way that
we're gonna move around the page is by
swiping so we can swipe to the right or
to the left to move from major like
container element to the next so we'll
do that and if we want to scroll the
entire page we can do a three finger
swipe up or down now unlike something
like talkback which is kind of doing
like an animated scroll as if you were
like pulling on the scroll bar itself in
voiceover it's gonna do almost like a
like a page up page down action so it'll
move like the entire page at once
without animating it the last thing I
want to do just in terms of like basics
is show you how to click on something so
we'll find a link on the page and then
to click on it and voiceover similar to
talkback we just do a double tap so
don't have to activate for links and
things like that buttons whatever you
interact with all right now one of the
useful things that we've shown before on
the desktop version of voice-over is
this thing called the rotor so the rotor
lets you kind of like do some some power
user commands with the screen reader if
you will and in case of iOS voice over
what will let us do is change the way
that we navigate the page so for
instance we can navigate by heading or
by link the way we do that is with a
little twisting gesture is if you're
sort of like turning a knob so you can
see that here controls thanks.thanks so
now it's in headings mode and if we want
to navigate by headings we just swipe up
or down and it'll move through the page
exclusively using h1 through h6 tags now
one of the things I showed off when
we're looking at voice over in the last
episode where some of the quirks and
limitations and gacho's that appear on
mobile websites and when you're using a
screen reader and we see a lot of those
similar issues when we're working with
voiceover so
I've got a little test page here it's
kind of your classic responsive web page
and we've got a hamburger menu and if we
open that we'll see that there's some
off-screen content right so we've got
this heading here that says menu and
we've got some interactive elements we
got anchor tags that are inside of this
menu and normally this is off-screen so
if I close this let's see it what
happens when I try and just navigate the
page using the screen reader right so
even though that content is off-screen
voiceover isn't quite sure what you do
with it because it is still technically
in the Dom we haven't hidden it using
CSS or anything like that so we'll
definitely still navigate through those
elements so in case it's like that you
want to make sure that you're setting
there's almost two display:none that'll
remove them from the accessibility tree
and make sure that voiceover or talkback
whatever screen reader you're working
with doesn't announce them now let's
also look at some you know unique
interactive controls so I've got a
slider down here which I can focus right
so you can hear the Spaniard told me
there if you swipe up or down to adjust
the value of this slider so cool so for
the built-in control it works really
well with a screen reader but as we saw
with talkback you know if we're using
sort of a custom Aria control we're
trying to build our own range slider
using row label slider or something like
that then we're gonna run into some
issues so I've got this div down here
and when I focus it you'll hear it sort
of announces the same behavior as the
built in slider right so we told me to
swipe up or down to adjust the value but
the problem here is those accessibility
events that sort of increment and
decrement slider event those will not be
passed through to my control and there
really isn't like a good way to handle
those currently not without something
like the accessibility object model
which is a new standard that we're
working on so if you're building like a
custom aureus slider
you might wanna include something like
plus or minus buttons so you can
increment or decrement those fields
that's a
tip from the developer Patrick lab sent
my way on the Twitter so thank you for
that Patrick so yeah that about covers
it for today if you have any questions
you can always leave them for me below
down in the comments or hit me up on a
social network of your choosing
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
