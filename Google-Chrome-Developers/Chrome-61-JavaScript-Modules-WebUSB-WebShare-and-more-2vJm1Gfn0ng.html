modules natively unifying the way that
modular JavaScript can be written you
can now use navigator dot share to
trigger the native Android shared
dialogue and the web USB API has landed
allowing web apps to access user
permitted USB devices I'm Pete LePage
let's dive in and see what's new for
developers and chrome 61 chrome 61 adds
native support for JavaScript modules
via the script type equals module
element that makes it possible for
Chrome to fetch granular dependencies in
parallel taking advantage of caching
avoiding duplication across pages and
ensuring that the script executes in the
correct order this standardized module
system unifies the way that modular
JavaScript can be written and shipped to
the web browser in the future the same
system will be available in node making
it easier for you to write and deploy
isomorphic JavaScript you can learn more
about modules and the aspects of
JavaScript that are affected by modules
from the links below if you want users
to easily be able to share your content
on their favorite network you need to be
able to integrate sharing buttons on
your site for each of those social
networks
it adds bloat to your page doesn't
always fit nicely within your UI and
means that you need to include code from
a third-party site the web share API
available today on Chrome for Android
allows you to invoke the native sharing
capabilities of the user's device
allowing the user to easily share text
or links with any of their installed
native apps in a future release this API
will also be able to share two installed
web apps to use it simply call navigator
share with the details of the page that
you want to share and the system will
handle the rest
check out Paul's update link below for
full details and some of the best
practices that you should be following
most hardware peripherals such as
keyboards mice printers game pads are
all supported by high level web
platform api's but using some
specialized educational scientific or
other USB devices in the browser has
been hard often requiring specialized
drivers chrome now supports the web usb
API allowing web app to communicate with
USB devices after the user has provided
their consent to learn more about the
security and privacy considerations and
how they're addressed have a peek at the
Web USB spec when you're ready to dive
in take a look at France Waze post on
updates both are linked in the
description these are just a few of the
changes in chrome 61 for developers of
course there's plenty more you can now
specify scrolling smoothness with the
scroll behavior CSS property CSS hex
color values can now specify an alpha
transparency by adding digits to the end
of the string you can access the
relative position of the screen content
with the visual viewport API exposing
complex functionality like pinch and
zoom and a more direct way all the
details including links to more detailed
changes Docs specs are in the
description below and be sure to check

notification whenever we launch a new
video I'm Pete LePage and as soon as
chrome 62 is released I'll be right here
to tell you what's new in Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
