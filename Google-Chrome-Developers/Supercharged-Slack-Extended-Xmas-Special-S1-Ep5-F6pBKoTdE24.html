extended holiday edition of supercharged
and pulse Samson Lewis here all ready
for Christmas Center hey I recognize
that name and this is the show where I
take the sites that you've submitted and
I go through them and I try and find and
fix performance issues and today is no
different
yay it's slack that's what we're gonna
look at today
I like slack an awful lot and we have a
chromium dev slack which will be the
target for performance profiling today
so when I said to them is there anything
that in particular that you're seeing
and you know that you think we should
look at and they weren't oh yeah
actually there's this quick switch in if
command K it takes a long time for it to
come up on screen and we don't really
know why fair enough okay well we'll
start there but as it happens I think
there might be a few other things that
we see along the way it's it's bumpy
it's this is the right time of year to
give you extra you know I mean look in
the stocking what's they're all
scrolling issues oh what's in there
layout thrashing Oh worst santur ever
bring me the mince pies cool so what
we'll do
we will hit record and we're gonna hit
command K and then we'll stop recording
yes and we see the key down event over
here and they are absolutely right it is
just shy of half a second in JavaScript
terms here for the keydown event so the
key down just me pressing command K and
coming up on screen so let's have a look
at why well I see these red triangles in
the corner and I see a recalc style
followed by a layout so calculating
styles on the page followed by laying
out elements on the page followed by
calculating styles on the page and then
laying out the elements on the page
which seems superfluous at best and
actually each one of these is really
quite expensive like this first one is
93 milliseconds in calculating styles so
if we click on it the AC just shy of
9,000 elements have been affected by the
style taste that's an awful lot of
elements that could be affected by a
style change you know if you're going to
make some
our change is often quite good to be
very specific about the styles that you
want to apply but it may just be that
there's a lot of elements being added in
this case say to the page for example
the quick switcher elements and that
might be what the issue is because it's
preceded by a power of HTML so that
makes me think there's new HTML coming
in it has it style calculations and then
we force a layout as well same kind of
deal except this has got 13,000 elements
in play and again 93 milliseconds and
this is a fast desktop machine this
would be brutal on other devices so big
problem here then I guess now the good
news is underneath we actually start to
get the call stacks so we can actually
start to figure out why what was it that
was called into that was triggering this
problem and this is it here there's
clicking on parenting this anchor with
book snack I'm not sure what the deal is
there but it goes to jQuery something to
do with that I'm not sure what that is
and then bootstrap with its modal and
then the modal show modal backdrop okay
and then eventually it seems to trigger
and show so something in this interplay
between the roll-up client the roll-up
core and the bootstrap now it's gonna be
very specific to them let's have a quick
look at modal show just out of interest
and it's minified so again you know for
their mode today would obviously go to
your own minified and have a look around
do the same thing again but if we start
to see things like yeah add class well
making a style change we're basically
making style changes yeah we're reading
a class it has class fade add class so
you start to sort of build up this
picture fairly quickly that there's a
check on styles followed by a mutation
of styles and then if somewhere later
and that's call stack somebody else is
reading a style and then writing a style
that's exactly what's gonna land in this
problem let's say it's their code so I'd
say look go and have a look at this you
know that the call stacks are here they
will recognize their own code I'm sure
and then it's a case of trying to pick
it out and say well we should do all I
read up front then all our rights
libraries like fast on will do that for
you
but you can still do it yourself just
make sure that you're orchestrating your
code very carefully it can be tricky and
that's why
first time exists because it will help
you do that and a lot of people use it
very successfully so that would be how I
start for them but while I was here I
noticed this update layer tree that
comes straight after updating the layer
tree is how chrome organizes basically
all the layers in the page so you know
where everything needs to sit in
relation to everything else and that's
73 milliseconds that's monstrously long
really long and again especially so for
such a powerful device so what's going
on well layers is the answer but how do
we find out more about this well we have
a tool we have a chrome dev tool that's
why it's called chrome dev tools tools
inside the tools switch on the paint
profiler hit record again and what we'll
do is we'll do a bit of a scroll and I
can tell you that that is pretty bad we
have to wait when we've got the paint
profiler on there's an awful lot of
extra information that's coming in so it
does take a long time to pull that data
in and actually parse it and get it
ready for us to have a look at so we
have to do the happy dance it's
beginning to so what we can do is we can
see yeah sort of six frames a second
five frames a second and that's where
the paint profiler on so it probably be
near a sort of nine ten frames a second
certainly not the 60 frames a second
that we'd want so if we click on the
layers the frame sorry at the top we get
this layers tab that we can click into
this layer information is not yet
available but it does come up eventually
there we go and we can make this a bit
bigger we go
and we start to sort of see what all the
layers are that's all these boxes on the
screen and I tell you all do is we'll
just move ourselves back and we can spin
this out into 3d space
whoo who doesn't love that nobody there
we are
rotate cut out that's great innit
it looks like basically every single
item in the quick switcher is getting
its own layer and that's gonna be
expensive to manage I would imagine we
can confirm that though because what we
can do is we can hit escape and we would
go to the rendering options if they're
not there for you then you can go to
more tools rendering settings like that
and you can switch on show layer borders
and yep sure's we would expect each one
of these items in the list has got its
own layer and in fact the even the
status icon inside has also got its own
layer and we can spin this down as well
and inside the omnibox which is what
that is yeah there we are
omni box item and then the present so
basically the status now if we click on
one of these items we can see the reason
that it got its own layer
scroll parent is not an ancestor no idea
might overlap or the composited content
now that one I can guess that's
basically something's got a layer and
one of these list items might overlap it
okay and then he says cannot be squashed
because this layer has a different
clipping container than the squashing
layer yeah this one this one taught me a
long long time to figure out when I was
looking at this I was like oh yeah I
even had to speak to a chrome engineer
and I was like just what huh and they
they gave me a few hints and got to the
bottom of it she's good it's kind of
kind of is it gonna work out who knows
is exciting time for me it was you know
always like that with performance work
you get thrown something you like
do some forensics we solve the puzzle
who knows that's why I do this that is
the question whether it is nobler in the
mind to suffer the slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune or to take arms
against a sea of troubles and by doing
so back to the task at hand well it
turns out if you look at the container
element mm-hmm
to scroll up for that apparentiy I'm
gonna get there eventually got it okay
omnibox results is the container element
that's doing the scrolling it has width
as a height but it has overflow why
scroll and overflow X hidden so it's
clipping that list which is great that's
what we want it to do and that makes
perfect sense however every single item
inside the list it too has
overflow:hidden
so each item is clipping its contents
and what bleed does it goes well that's
got its own clipping because it's
overflow:hidden and that clip doesn't
match the parents clip therefore I'm
just going to assume that it has to have
its own layer because of that so if we
switch off overflow:hidden on the
children all those layers disappear and
we're gonna get one big layer which is
probably going to be better we'll switch
on the timeline again switch off the
paint profiler so that it doesn't take
all the affection information we don't
need come on record and we'll scroll now
we're getting something like 30 frames a
second so we're up from about well
there's five six could be nine or ten
without the paint profiler up to about
30 so definite improvement by having in
this case one larger layer rather than
you know hundreds or thousands of
smaller layers but that's still not 60
frames a second which is what we'd want
so I see a lot of purple in this chart
at the top and certainly that matches up
with yeah about 12 milliseconds here of
update layer tree which is
now from 20 odd 24 25 I think 212 so
it's definitely better but it's still
not good it should be a fraction of a
millisecond ideally speaking so let's
see if we can figure out what's going on
well again we can switch on the paint
profiler do a quick run and see what's
what all we need is one of these frames
we'll go and wait for the layers there
we go and we can see we can actually see
the list there we'll reset the transform
you see the list of items in the quick
switcher and yeh see here it's 66
thousand two hundred sixty-six pixels
high that's enormous that's a huge layer
that needs to be handled and it's just
probably putting blink under pressure we
can prove that I think by going through
to the elements and what all those are
all slates the omnibox item and we will
say display non and that's going to give
us nothing in the the list which is not
so great but what we can do is we can go
and we can override that for a few of
them and so we've got something to
scroll this is going to take us a minute
or two so we've got a few in the list
now so we've we've enabled like ten of
them or something like that and so it's
this list is basically nothing like the
size it was and we'll do another
timeline recording and we'll switch off
the paid profiler here we'll just have a
go without and stop that and yeah we're
basically at 60 frames a second now and
the update layer trees gone from that
1213 milliseconds down to three
milliseconds so it's clearly the size of
that layer is a big big factor but that
still bothers me because it's still
three milliseconds and it should be a
fraction of a millisecond so something
outside of this quick switcher is
probably causing an issue too and my
hunch is having looked at this before is
it's going to be the actual content of
the page in fact we can confirm that
because what we could do is we could do
a paint profile
and we will do a quick scroll of the
page content is 60 frames a second so we
could stop here and that would be okay
but I would imagine that since this
loved aleatory is still quite big we
should see if we can figure it out and
yeah so looking at this the actual the
page dividers we got a message scroller
there is twelve thousand five hundred
and twelve thousand four hundred and
forty four pixels and the actual daily
divider which seems to be the previous
day's content that is twelve thousand
and so again and by ten thousand so
those are huge layers and you can see
that actually here if we let me get rid
of that and we will zoom we will zoom
out there we go yeah it's the actual
page in the bottom corner and this is
what it is I mean even there we are
that's what it actually looks like
there's the page content we have another
one here and the footer as well for
reasons not quite sure why but it seems
to be that it is massive as well so I
guess if I were them for this and the
quick switch I would say go to something
that's like a recycler view where you
know you've got a few much smaller DOM
and your recycling elements that means
that the layout should be cheaper the
style calculations should be cheaper
everything should be cheaper and you can
use something like request idle callback
to only do those mutations to the Dom
when the users in idle and if you need
to put up a spinner or something like
that okay but you know maybe you sort of
take a slightly more nuanced approach
where you use requests that will call
back or if it's getting quite pressing
you just do it immediately and you take
the hit and maybe your frames per second
will just waver a little bit but it's
certainly going to be a lot lot better
than having this huge set of layers that
you know is just putting blink under
pressure here so there you go a bunch of
stuff the layers panel the paint
profiler just dev tools in general and
scrolling performance issues definitely
want to take a look at this holiday
season yeah if you find yourself with
scrolling performance issues and it's
not something like paint it might be
something like you
layers check that out have a great
holiday and I'll see you in 2016
it's exciting brand new year it's leap
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
