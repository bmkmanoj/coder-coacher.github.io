with the payment request api the web

Pete LePage let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in chrome 53 HTML CSS
and JavaScript are powerful development
languages but they can be difficult to
maintain in large code bases and if your
app embeds third-party content you need
to ensure that it's included styles do
not affect other parts of your app
chrome 53 supports shadow Dom v1 which
allows an element to encapsulate its
style and child dumb away from the main
document shadow Dom v1 has some
significant changes from v-0 and is
broadly agreed upon by major browser
vendors chrome will support both
versions of the API until enough of you
have moved to b1 Eric bidelman has a
great primer on using shadow Dom to
create self-contained reusable web
components on web fundamentals check it
out completing payments on the web can
be a cumbersome process for users
autofill has made it easier to enter
information but trying to complete a
checkout form on mobile is still a
challenge chrome 53 on Android adds
support for the payment request API a
new spec from the w3c that provides fast
seamless and secure payments on the web
using a credit card or other payment
provider like Android pay it also lets
users provide a billing address shipping
details and other payer information
without having to type anything expect
to see support for more platforms coming
soon but in the meantime check out a G's
payment request API integration guide on
web fundamentals at juco slash payment
request API the web Bluetooth API is
available experimentally on some
platforms as an origin trial allowing
sites to come
eunuch eight with nearby devices using
the Bluetooth generic attribute profile
sites that send notifications to Android
devices running marshmallow or later to
now provide the pad shown in the status
bar instead of the chrome logo and
finally chrome on Android now allows
muted videos to begin playing without
user interaction if the video was marked
as muted and has the autoplay attribute
chrome will start playing the video when
it comes visible to the user these are
just a few of the changes in chrome 53
for developers check the description for
more details and links to the
documentation and specifications if you
want to stay up to date with chrome and
know what's coming
click that subscribe button up there up
there somewhere there anyways I'm Pete
LePage and as soon as chrome 54 is
released I'll be right here to tell you
what's new in Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
