little confession for you today I've
been using the data binding system in
polymer for almost two years now but up
until very recently I didn't actually
know how it worked
sure I could use the binding syntax to
pass data around inside of my app but
because I didn't understand what was
going on under the hood it sort of all
felt like magic to me and ultimately
that made the application a lot harder
to debug so I wanted to create this
series of videos so you could understand
how bindings are working in your own app
now to do this we're gonna have to first
know about these things called binding
annotations these are the little symbols
that you write in your HTML to tell
polymer that you want to create a
binding at that spot one way annotations
which are signified by square brackets
allow you to flow data from a host
element down to a target but never back
from the target up to the host to do
something like that
you want to use two-way annotations or
where sometimes called automatic
annotations this lets the host and the
target pass data back and forth now I'll
explain this a little bit more in a
minute but first I just want to stop and
think what's actually going on inside of
my app when polymer encounters an
annotation okay so when polymer first
sees your element you're trying to
register it and everything polymer is
going to parse your elements template
and actually look for these nodes with
these binding annotations and when it
finds these sort of binding annotations
it's going to create what it calls
property effects and a property effect
is a little object that knows which node
in the Dom to update whenever this
property has changed so in this example
polymer is going to create a property
effect for this div right here and
another property effect for this paper
input element so we'll have two property
effects and all of these property effect
objects get stored in an array now I
like to think of that array of property
effects as kind of like a checklist of
action
that need to run anytime that property
updates and you can actually go and look
at this actual array if you want you can
hop into the dev tools and this is an
element that I created it can use that
little trick that I've shown you before
where you can select it in the the
elements panel and then just do dollar
signs zero and type dot underscore
property effects now this is a private
you know part of polymer it's not
something we should be messing with but
we can inspect it it's kind of fun and
it'll give you this object with this
this array and you can see here there's
there's two objects inside of here these
are our two property effects and you can
see a little bit of info about the
property effect itself it's a text
property effect it's set to use like
curly brace mode which I'm assuming
means it's it's you know in some sort of
two-way binding mode etc so it's just
kind of interesting that you can go in
and you can kind of inspect this check
list a little bit now looking back at
our example I'm gonna simplify things
just a little bit so there's less than
work up to look at okay so this is our
template and this is our polymer element
definition now the other thing that
polymer is gonna do aside from creating
property effects is it's going to create
a setter for this property that we've
got here this this food property so you
can see we've got this little set foo
Center down here and if you're not
familiar with syntax like this I'll link
to a little dock on MDM that talks about
Java Script setters and and and I should
stress this is not the exact syntax that
polymer uses it does that you know kind
of a little differently at runtime but
but essentially what happens is once
it's created property effects for a
property it also creates a setter for
that property and inside of this setter
there's a few interesting things that
take place the first is any time the
property changes polymer is going to do
what it calls dirty checking so a dirty
check is when you compare an old value
to a new value and you see if they've
actually changed and what polymer does
is it actually stores this food property
in a super duper private variable called
underscore underscore data underscore
underscore and you can you can kind of
poke around and see this in the dev
tools as well it stores the original
value over there and whenever someone
changes the property it changes our food
property if they if they changed it
through JavaScript or changing the
attribute or something like that it's
we're just going to check to see if the
old value and the new value are
different because if they're the same
there's no point in doing a bunch of
work if they are different if we do pass
the dirty check then we're going to hold
on to that new value and the next thing
we're after that is we're just gonna
loop over all of our property effects
give them that new value and then that
tells them to go update these nodes in
the Dom so if this is sort of our fake
checklist of property effects and again
this is all just pseudocode that's just
kind of what they look like right
someone passes in a new value we say hey
it's different from the old value cool
let's hold on to it now let's just start
walking through that checklist of
properties and we'll say alright let's
set that new value up here on this div
ok cool done next one let's set that new
value over here in me in the the input
element and so on and so on and if these
elements within themselves have have
property effects those will kick off and
run and and basically that's how data
gets passed all the way down the line
through all the different children now
I'm sure some of you are seeing this and
saying well what about the properties
object because like I know this is also
part of the mix right like how does this
thing get involved
well the properties object basically
allows you to add what I think of as
sort of like metadata to your property
setter if you will so here's our example
again and I've got this properties
object now and I've got my foo property
inside of here and the setter is already
set up so you know it's gonna first
dirty check for new values it's gonna
run the property effects if things are
different and let's say in my properties
object I add an observer right and I say
okay well when foo changes I want you to
run this observer function right here
well what happens is inside of the
center polymer is just going to you
literally call that function I know it
seems like it might be doing something
more magical but really
just it it's just gonna call that
function as soon as it's done doing any
other work if you give it a notify true
flag right and this enables two-way
binding throughout the polymer system
well what this is actually doing is it's
just calling this dot fire which
dispatches an event and it's just just
patching an event called foo - changed
and passing along the value the the
brand new value so anytime you do this
on a property polymer will always create
this sort of event dispatch in the event
it's always called something - changed
whatever the property name is - changed
and this is really interesting because
it means you know if you're if you
yourself er are binding to an element
like here I'm binding the paper inputs
value attribute what polymer does is
when when it first boots up as it says
okay I found an annotation here let me
create a property effect and everything
are we bound to some other elements
attribute is we are I can see that we're
bound to this value thing okay so if
this then fires a event called value
changed then hearing that event is gonna
tell me to update this property right
here so really that's all that's
happening in properties to a binding
system your your element fires a changed
event some other element that that is
bound to it listen to that changed event
and it updates its own property because
of that now here I've got a two-way
binding and so you can see you can
actually see this system in play that I
just described so I'm gonna go in here
and this is a representation of our
element and I can type in to the paper
input field and it's gonna fire those
changed events and then that means I
update foo and because it's gonna go
through and play through all of my
property effects that means the foo gets
updated right here as well and you can
see that here so they end up matching
but what if I'm using a one-way binding
right so here I'm using square brackets
now instead of the curly braces
well that just tells polymer hey um
don't set up the event listener for
value changed that's that's really all
that happens there so now I go in I type
in this input field and because I'm not
listening for those events I
here anything and this this property up
here remains what it always was so we're
not pushing any new data up there okay
so the last thing I want to talk about
our read-only properties so you know you
can set a read-only flag and that means
that you know an outsider using your
element can't push data into it in any
way so what happens there is polymer
just doesn't create the setter right it
doesn't create a public cetera at all
because we don't want someone
accidentally calling that and instead
because it does still internally need to
work with that data it creates a little
private setter that it prefixes with
this underscore and you can actually
work with these this is the actual
syntax that it uses so if you need to
work with your read-only property from
within your element you can use this
private setter to update it and that is
how that works all right so now you know
the basics of data binding but there's
still a lot of cool stuff to cover
binding to arrays and deeply nested
objects and computed properties and
change records and notifications well
anyway I'll save that for another
