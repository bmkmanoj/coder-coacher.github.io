Paul aah-aah-aah that's why we don't do
a live-action the show where I take the
sites that you've submitted and I go
through them and I look for performance
issues and I recommend some fixes that's
the show welcome today I have player FM
and player foam is an interesting one
for me because it's run by Mike mom of
who is a small business owner and so
he's dealing with the site and the app
that he's built and you know lots of
other things besides and so for him I
suspect that performance is it's
important but it's not necessarily you
know what's on his mind day-to-day he's
just trying to you know run his business
and do well there so it was an
opportunity to look at something where
the the constraints are a little bit
different at least from the business
side serious performance work about to
take place
mmm-hmm yes one has goggles not strictly
necessary but they do make you look
fabulous I have the homepage up on
screen here and what I wanted to do was
just do a web page test first and
foremost and have a quick look and just
see if there's anything quick and easy
to fix in there and I've gone to the
filmstrip for you which you can get if
you check check check check
G check if you check the box that says
capture video it'll capture a video and
that will give you the filmstrip view
which is what we're looking at here
the thing I noticed first of all is that
when you sort of look at where the first
paint happens which is here especially
that green line there on the waterfall I
believe you can see that's actually
blocking on a few things
there's the the fonts there's the the
page CSS which is quite big as well it's
like 100k or so so you'd really feel
this on 3G now I'm not doing on 3G today
because I figure for most people if
they're on mobile they probably got the
app for example so I opted to go with a
kind of a desktop audience here so we
have the page comes in then there's the
CSS there's an image there's the
JavaScript there's the fonts which then
need to be transferred there seems to be
some what's this there's a there's a
Google JavaScript client there and then
there's the web fonts and then
eventually it goes right now I've got
enough to render so I think the first
thing I'd say is it's a critical
rendering path job here is to inline
some styles let's have a look see if
there are any in the page source yeah so
I suspect there aren't any mmm because
they'd be here if they were and I think
that's probably one of the options that
we have here is to try and reprioritize
the page load to try and get critical
rendering path done but even with that
in play there's something quite
interesting about this home page which
is the scrolling performance let me
bring up dev tools and this has recently
changed it seems and you can find the
old-school rendering tools under more
tools and then rendering settings and
then you can go to enable paint flashing
as you scroll you'll see that the whole
page goes green right and that basically
means the whole page is painting and
also it's painting you see it's pretty
slow to paint so let's have a look at
why well we're in the time line we can
hit record and we'll do a scroll test in
the background stop scrolling
and you see these red triangles here in
the corner is basically where Chrome's
telling you that it's not able to hit 60
frames a second and it's a little bit
forgiving around the 60 frames a second
mark I can't remember the exact numbers
but we are eight frames a second ten
seven so for something that should be
scrolling at 60 frames a second we're
really struggling and what we can do is
we can have a look at why and you see
these tile workers which are basically
the parts of chrome that are doing the
painting they're all very very cloaked
up so we can have a look in we can hit
the W key on the keyboard which is like
the zoom in and it says rasterize paint
and that correlates very closely with
what we saw that sort of green paint
that we saw earlier so let me see if we
can figure out why and I'm I'm betting
it's the parallax thing that's going on
would be my guess because I've seen
sites that do similar things so we'll
just inspect that element see if we can
bring that up section yes we have
background position sort of 50 by bar so
these all look like yeah they've been
changed by the JavaScript you can see it
you can watch the numbers change up here
and the problem we have is that this is
causing it to paint what we'll do is
we'll stop it doing this and then I will
show you how you can actually have a
proper look at this in more detail
yourself so what I'll do is I'm just
going to set background of this mm to be
I'm just gonna do was he got like
roughly 50% zero and I'm gonna put
important on it just so that it never
changes and those images are fixed right
now so when they're fixed when we scroll
what's going to happen is Chrome's going
to go well it's got to be there still on
the page so it paints it again and again
and again and again so what we can do is
we can find presumably a background
attachment fix yes here it is
I'm just going to toggle that off for a
second so they scroll with the page
content now even though these styles are
being updated by the page in the
JavaScript they're not going to change
the actual position because we changed
it to important and don't move so with
that all in place let's now go back over
here and we're gonna hit record and
we're going to scroll and we are pretty
much back
60 frames a second there are a few
things like these image decodes and so
on but the main gist of it is that by
just not doing that background position
scroll thing we're in a lot better state
yes so a while ago I wrote this post
about parallaxing and in here is the
option to which is what I would suggest
it would be worth doing here for player
affirm it's using Dom elements rather
than background position put those
images on to their own element and then
use a 3d transform or even a 2d
transform with something like will
change or translate Z hack that's right
I'll hack if necessary quite pragmatic
around these parts and you can here see
what it's like if you just use that
approach and now one of those other time
I'm recording just so that you can see
it and scroll up and down and it's
pretty much 60 frames a second
everywhere and the reason it's 60 frames
a second is because we're using
transforms and transforms we can do if
it's on its own layer it can be done by
the GPU and that's extremely fast so you
can do 60 frames a second parallax
effects I think right now the way that
it's being done on this page where it
uses background position that's not
gonna be 60 frames a second but when you
can do it with the transform and have it
on operate on individual elements that
you can do a car juggle like I don't
even know why I tried alright cool so
that's the homepage dunt what we'll do
is we'll actually switch across and
we'll look at a details page as in for
one of the series and it just so happens
I have exactly the right URL up my
sleeve which involves two idiots me and
weiqi JQ Vegas doing an HTTP two or
three podcasts it's a subtle plug if you
you just pay the slightest attention
it's almost like I'm saying subscribe
subscribe subscribe subscribe subscribe
subscribe subscribe this time we don't
have any I don't think any scroll
performance issues particularly
basically because the page is fairly
static however I think what we can do is
we can have ourselves and on the sneaky
peek at webpagetest
so let's pop that in there do that we'll
do it on Chrome cable seems good capture
a video so you can do that
video filmstrip thing oh no yes we're
waiting what's he going to do next
yes that's right he's going to jettison
his career here are the results we've
switched up 2/10 of a second for the
intervals and yet similar kind of story
I think to the home page except this
time we look to my eye
like we're blocking on they obviously
the page but then there's some
JavaScript and then there's some CSS
bunch of image assets which is fine it's
kind of expected but then there's web
fonts and then only after the web fonts
have arrived do we actually do the
initial paint and yeah actually you can
see if you to look into one of these
pages you get that kind of blank white
screen before the font is actually
available so that can be quite
frustrating for users depending on how
long it takes for the font to come down
one option is to have the font
essentially not be there user a system
font and then try and get the web font
for the next time so it's lazy load it
and then deal with it next time that
could be a bit of an itch allenge to
kind of orchestrate which is hopefully
where things like font display will help
but for the time being it might just be
worth switching that this font back out
to a system font if it is a web form it
looks like it is or just using the web
font for titles and leaving the system
font for them the majority of the
content there's a few things I would
look at on both the home page and the
individual podcast pages and you know
that's great so don't forget you can
submit your sites don't forget to
subscribe you should click that button
I'll be awesome and I will catch you
next time I'm gonna load out of this
room in three weeks
put makeup on you before you go and
Camerino there they said they Paul
