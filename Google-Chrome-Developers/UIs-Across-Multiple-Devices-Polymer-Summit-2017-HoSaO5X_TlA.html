towards my PhD at ETH Zurich in
Switzerland and so for my research I'm
experimenting with you eyes that are
distributed across multiple devices and
in this talk I'm going to tell you how I
use polymer for that so we have more and
more devices including phones tablets
watches and TVs and I so many people
around here that have brought their
laptops and I assume that Mouse or maybe
even all of you also have brought the
smartphone's
so you already have at least two devices
with you however we still mostly use
these devices in isolation except maybe
for some cloud-based synchronization for
things like files and email however
there could be benefits if we could use
multiple devices in combination for
example to have more screen real estate
and I took this photo here of someone
who is shopping for vine on the train
and they're using their phone to access
the shop and at the same time they're
using the tablet to get reviews on a
specific client so for the same vine
that they're looking at in the shop
however in this case there is no
coordination between the two devices so
the user has to manually select the same
vine first on the phone in the shop and
then go to the tablet and look at it
there as well so for the user it might
be nicer if they could just select the
vine on the phone and the tablet would
automatically show the review for that
same vine another benefit of combining
devices is that we get a richer set of
input and output modalities so in the
scenario that you see here it's easier
to scan a document with your phone
because it has a camera and it's more
mobile but once you have done that it
you may want to continue your work on
the laptop because it has a larger
screen and it has a keyboard so that
might be more convenient you guys for
multiple devices are also interesting in
collaborative scenarios here for example
you can see a group of people using both
personal devices like phone or laptop
and shared devices
like this tabletop or a tablet so
researchers call applications that make
use of multiple devices at the same time
cross device applications and as part of
my research I'm trying to make it easier
for developers to build such
applications and for that we have
created a library that uses polymer so
if you wanted to build such a cross
device application you would need to
address at least the following three
things on top of the usual single device
development tasks that you will need to
do anyway
so first m-state needs to be
synchronized across devices so if user
clicks a button on the phone the other
connected devices need to be informed
somehow that something has changed
second the UI needs to D to be
distributed across multiple devices and
you need to decide what part of the UI
should be shown on what device and for
that you also need some information on
the kinds of devices that are involved
in working together and third the
devices need to be connected somehow so
there needs to be some way to tell the
system that these two devices over there
are working together and the other three
devices are also forming a group and so
our library offers support for all these
tasks using web components and we are
going to look at how you can use the
library to build cross device
applications by looking at this example
application of a webcam viewer so it's a
pretty simple application that shows a
large image of a webcam on the large
screen and the user can pair a phone and
then use the phone to control the camera
angle and select the select the camera
to show the application was built using
less than 300 lines of code in client
and server combined so also mostly in
the client and you can find the the card
if you want to have a look at there's a
link to the github down there so here's
the screen cast of the application to
pair the phone I could just scan the
cure code that you can see there or I
can just copy it on to this emulated
then I can use the buttons to control
the camera angle I can go back and
forward in time and then when I flip the
phone I can choose a different location
to display and let me show the most
important steps now for building this
application and we'll start with state
synchronization so if a user interacts
with the device on the Left they trigger
an update to a shared view so that to a
shared model and the model is shared
over the networks with the other devices
and will then trigger updates to the
view of these connected devices this is
somewhat similar to something you might
already be doing with firebase however
we use WebRTC peer-to-peer connections
if the device is supported so WebRTC is
a newer protocol that allows devices to
communicate directly so they don't have
to go via a server which you would do
with WebSockets so this lower latency
significantly especially if the devices
are in the same room and the server is
remote and this is kind of our expected
scenario in cross device applications
and here's how you can do this in
polymer using our library in our
application we define what should be
synchronized by creating a property with
our state here I've named the property
synced but you couldn't choose any name
essentially and at the moment you can
synchronize the reisender and objects
and you need to provide a label for each
in this case we use time camera and
position as our labels and with this we
synchronize the the time of the photo to
show which camera to select and the
angle of the camera then you can use
this XD MVC synchronized web component
and use two-way data-binding to specify
that the synced property should be
synchronized now you can write code as
if all of your code was running on the
same device but the library then takes
care of the synchronization for you for
example I could have a bit up there with
the irony like
where we select which camera to show and
then use this information to display the
correct image in the code as I said you
can write code as if it was all running
on a single device but you still might
want to specify what part of the UI
should be shine on what device and for
that we provide a couple of templates
for what we consider and common
distribution patterns and one of these
is the remote control patterns where we
use phones and to control a larger
screen and we call the phone's
controllers and the large screen we call
the viewer and again here's the code so
you add this controller layout component
to your application and then inside this
layout components you need to add a
controller class to everything that you
go to the controller devices and the
viewer close to everything that should
be shown on the viewer devices and
that's it
finally the devices should be associated
somehow and we chose an approach with
identifiers in the URLs so when you load
the application on the large screen it
will modify the URL and a disconnect
parameter with the random ID when
another device loads the new URL the
devices will be paired and the Europe
URL can be encoded into a cure card and
scanned by a device or in another
scenario you could also send it over
instant messaging or transmitted using
NFC and we call the device that this
place the decode the connect D device
and the device that scans the code the
connector device and again this is how
you add the functionality in your
application there's again a custom
element for that so yeah this URL
pairing component and the component will
take care of modifying the URL for you
and it will handle the pairing for the
webcam application we specified that the
connector device should be assigned the
control role and the connected device
should have the viewer role we then use
this information for the UI distribution
that I showed you in the previous step
but if you don't have any use in your
application for this information you
don't have to use it so I've shown you
how to build the application and next
I'm going to speak about why we chose to
work with polymer
I think custom elements are great
declarative code is very readable I can
get a quick overview of an application
by just looking at the HTML and for us
it was also important to have code that
works across platforms and on all kinds
of devices so if you look again at this
picture that I've shown you in the
beginning you can see there are a lot of
different devices and we want the code
that we could just write once and run
everywhere and in polymer meets that
requirement then the polymer concept
concept just seemed to be a good fit for
what we're trying to do so two-way
data-binding
integrates well with our idea of state
synchronization you just hook everything
up and it works and under the hood we
use conditional templates for the UI
distribution so we're at things in atom
is and decide whether it should be
rendered or not modularity is also
important as a developer you can choose
the level of support you need maybe you
want your own way of distributing the UI
fine then you just don't use the pattern
templates the same goes for pairing you
don't have to use the cure cards you
could implement your own pairing
component if you wanted to as a PhD
student I don't only do research but I'm
also involved in education we have used
our library and polymer in various lab
projects as well as bachelor and master
teases and students had varying levels
of experience with web technologies and
some had even no experience at all and
none of the students had any experience
using polymer but this using students
usually become productive quite quickly
and I think the declarative style is
helpful for that and I have to admit
that the documentation of our library is
not in a perfect State
but the students learn how to use it
quite quickly by looking at sample
applications they can use the dev tools
and click on a component and and inspect
the application and for this it's
important that polymer uses the platform
and the component is a custom element
and that they can inspect and it's not
just a bunch of disks now I'd like to
give you a quick tour of an application
that was built with our frame with our
library and polymer it was built by
three computer science master students
at ETH and they did it in one semester
which is around 14 weeks they were
expected to work around 300 hours each
on this project so Switzerland has this
stunning landscape and it's a perfect
country for mountain biking that's their
projects the student built a mountain
bike trip planner there are other tree
planners out there but they tend to not
work too well on mobile devices because
there's so much information like charts
and maps that are is really hard to
squeeze it onto a small screen so our
idea for this application that was that
when you write with your friends or your
partner you could just pair your devices
and then you'd have a bigger screen but
we did not want to limit ourselves to
just using smart phones so for example
if you had a TV in a hotel room you
should also be able to use that so we
wanted an application that adapts to
whatever devices you throw at it and
here's a quick video of the result two
phones on the left are already paired
one chose a map and the other shows a
summary of selected routes and they are
synchronized so when the new route is
selected on one device the other device
updates and when we add a third larger
device the UI redistributes and there is
room for more information like the
elevation chart in the left corner
so what were our experiences in these
projects as you may have noticed the
students have used material design and
the paper elements to build these
applications and our students usually
don't have that much experience building
UIs when they arrive in our courses but
I think the paper elements here were
really helpful for creating a
nice-looking application and because the
students could use our cross-device
library they did not have to spend much
time on implementing the cross-device
functionality and instead they could
focus on the main features of the app
they enjoyed working with polymer and
also found the concept of web components
very intuitive and one student told me
this is how we should build web
applications and on that note I will end
