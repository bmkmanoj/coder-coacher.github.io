don't have any bundles you don't you
have any JavaScript bundles I don't
write JavaScript anymore this JavaScript
fatigue finally gotten you yeah that's
it I'm just I'm dead now what's what do
you do these days I come and meet you in
a coffee shop and get free coffee
because any my full human being like any
normal developer I see okay so for
everybody else out there working on
JavaScript there's a really cool tool I
recently discovered called source map
Explorer get it on NPM this is sort of
useful for understanding what is in your
JavaScript bundle which are shipping
down to your users so how is this
different from just normal so smap's
what is it what what does it give you it
sort of understands your dependency
graph and dependency tree visualize it
for you nice Pleasant way okay so I'm
gonna run it against a source map that
was generated from one of my vendor
bundles and just show you what this
looks like so here we've got Chrome open
I've got the source map Explorer
dependency graph sort of visualized here
and this is kind of nice because I can
take a look at any one part of my graph
so I can see here all these are all the
different bits and pieces of react that
I'm using
I've got react router over here in the
corner and I can zoom in and out it's
nice and pretty but I've also got I can
see that you know what percentage of my
bundle is being taken up by different
libraries here I can see that in this
case firebase is taking up quite a lot
of my bundle but I wanted to show you a
pro tip that that I was walking through
with David East the other day so and and
source map Explorer visualizes this
quite nicely so I can actually just
require in the pieces of firebase that
I'm actually using rather than a whole
massive box right there the whole thing
so a few minor changes I can go and do a
new build and if that all works out I
can show you the before and after thanks
to some movie magic now we're gonna go
and run it against the new vendor bundle
and we can see now is that a we've got a
much smaller bundle on the whole but B
we've also changed the look of this
graph so earlier we
fire base about 304 kilobytes sort of
that's unmet afire on gzipped or
anything like that
but it contained database authentication
storage and app I really only need app
and database so I just switched my code
over to using those atomic modules and
here you can see that we've actually
managed to make our app a tiny bit
smaller it's a hundred and thirty eight
kilobytes before we've minified it in
Jesus all you need to use this is just
the source map you don't need the
original source or anything like that it
just works on source Maps
so notice normally like for a dev at
least I usually have my source maps on
my JavaScript files yeah it's kind of
nice because I guess if you strip stuff
out the actual main source by whatever
tolling that then gets accounted for in
the source map yeah there's much
different bundle analysis tools are
available web pack bundle analyzer is
another one that's got colorization in
place and it's super sweet specific to
web pack I think at the moment but it's
also we're checking out but yeah it
seems like this are just great for
understanding exactly what you're
shipping down to your users so it's good
to ask yourself what's in your bundle I
see what you did that nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
