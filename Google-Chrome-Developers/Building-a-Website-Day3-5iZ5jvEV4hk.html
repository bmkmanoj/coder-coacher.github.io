bit of coding as well today which is
always handy because towards the back
end of this week actually speaking at a
conference so I kind of got to get a
move on and get some stuff done so
mostly what I've been doing is kind of
setting up a little bit more
infrastructure just making sure that
kind of everything's all set and I've
got hopefully a really solid foundation
that I don't need to change too much on
the way through mainly what I did is I I
don't know if I mentioned it before but
basically what I had was I was serving
up the static files and I did all the
hashing stuff which is cool but
everything else they're kind of
non-static was always going to the same
index.html so what I've done is I've
just updated that little bit of code now
where I'm a match against everything
that kind of came after dev summit and
then I'm looking for that particular
thing in the sections so like for
example like location dot HTML so if you
go to dev summit slash location you're
gonna get the location to HTML which
extends the base HTML in the template
here which basically has a header block
for the content which is actually then
filled out by that by the actual section
and then the footer all fine that's
working just as I'd hoped so that was
that's one thing that's definitely
changed in here other than that oh yeah
a lot of changes in the in the build
file got a lot of lot of scripts I
wanted to avoid this time doing a full
on gulp grunt whatever build system I
thought most of the time I'm actually
not doing anything overly exciting I'm I
want to use sass because I know I want
to probably make all my sizes based off
a baseline so it's an 8 pixel baseline
grid and then off the top of that I
figure well if I've got a few variables
or whatever sass is probably going to be
the right thing but I'm still going to
keep it fairly minimal here though I've
got an inline CSS and a linked CSS and
this is something I'm trying out this
may not work and it may work and I
really don't know so
well bear with me as opposed right what
I'm doing is anything to explain this
quickly let's see so I have notionally
inline CSS and linked CSS so in the page
for example there's going to be it's in
it is in the header there is the inline
Styles right so this is the kind of I
want to get a fast first render and I
want some inline stuff so what goes into
the inline Styles basically it's you
know I have a couple of standard kind of
import including things and then I've
got specific styles at the moment just
for the header and my theory on inlining
Styles is that I want basically things
like dimensions and color and that's it
as in if it's like white block or a
green block that's the thing I want to
reserve that's all I care about and
pretty much everything else will
probably be like sort of font cause or
whatever but no kind of background
images or any of that that can come in
later this is like reserving the space
for a content and I know the height of
the header I know the height of the
masthead I should be able to do all of
that stuff without actually doing
anything else in the background once so
that's all that inlining stuff is is in
one place and I'm separating out my
header into a full and an inline and the
inline is just basically like see the
base line with background a box shadow
these are just sort of placeholder while
I was just testing the theory and then
the full one is like it it takes the
inline but then it adds the stuff on and
I and I've been in two minds as to
whether i duplicate the inline stuff
here because that CSS is going to exist
but I have a feeling that later on it's
going to be useful to have something
with the full styles in it and I can't
quite put my finger on why just yeah
thinking might be because of the to do
with the hot swapping of sections so
anyway so so I've got the inline Styles
and then in the let's see in the scripts
I have
a yeah I've got this where our load
styles and basically I load the styles
and you can see it's the same kind of
hashing system that I used previously
for this JavaScript that's still going
to work this is going through the
templating system it'll convert this to
a CVS dot whatever dot CSS and in the
load Styles I basically do an xhr and
then when I load it I know it's in the
HTTP cache and it should have the
whatever I gave it like a one-year
caching time on it then I can inject an
actual stylesheet into the head with
that URL it'll make the request which
will be satisfied from the HTTP cache
and we should be good to go so that is
what happens so just to show you like
the the inline stuff for the header
doesn't have say a color but the full
one has Rebekah purple as they as the
thing and you can see actually maybe
I'll take two I'll change it to red
which won't work because I don't have it
built so I can actually do NPM run build
I could do a watch that would actually
oh it failed cos it failed well done me
terrific oh good yeah it's because I
didn't okay come in changes just as well
this isn't the
yeah that's fine okay just as well I
didn't actually say I might change that
because I was annoying right there you
go it goes it goes red now anyway and
the versions been bumped and so by
default we have the I don't know I have
the inline Styles like so which has been
squished and compressed than everything
else and then there's the link rel
stylesheet' which actually has all the
other stuff and so that you can see that
the actual color is set to red
there you go inherited from but it's
still there so there you go that's kind
of what I'm currently doing giving that
a whirl seeing how that goes
the the next step is to actually start
for real styling based on those the
mocks and actually start fleshing it out
which I will be building while I design
desktop first I actually build mobile
first and I have in my head the mocks or
roughly what's going to happen but I am
definitely gonna be winging some of it
as I figure out exactly how this should
all go so there you go good days bad
days every day is interesting when
you're building in it so there you go
thanks for coming along on the journey
as always and thoughtfully subscribe
they make me say it they don't make me
say it I want you to subscribe because I
know there's loads of stuff really
interesting stuff on the channel so yeah
you can find me on the Twitter if you
want to chat at arrow twist and of
course you can leave comments below as
well catch it
probably in the next entry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
