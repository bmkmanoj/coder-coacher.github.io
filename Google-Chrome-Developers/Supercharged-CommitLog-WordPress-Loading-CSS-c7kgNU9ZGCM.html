our singular PHP to render our blog post
listings as well as our individual blog
posts the next step is to implement the
design that I had in mind I'm not gonna
talk about that too much you're welcome
to go to the repository and take a look
at the CSS files there shouldn't be any
surprises here it's just CSS it's mostly
just flexbox and some colors but all
right you want to talk about is what
happens when I put our phone on a 3G
network and see how loading is
performing 3G network basically means
low bandwidth high around ten trips and
occasional packet loss so let's take a
look at how the block behaves so I have
removed the block entirely from the
phone kill all the cache misses it's as
if this phone has never visited the
block and so if I now reload the block
you can see that pretty much in one two
seconds the block is there the content
is there it's still pretty room enter a
like off styles are missing but the user
could start reading after about 10
seconds you can see the embellishments
are there the header logo has completed
and the block seems like it's done
loading over a 3G network the
interesting thing here is that in the
background the loading is actually
continuing right now and will continue
to do so for the next 40 or 50 seconds
but that doesn't matter because for the
user
it seems complete they're done loading
and they can just start interacting with
the page and that's exactly what I want
to talk about this time I want to talk
about how we can structure your CSS so
it loads efficiently while still giving
you all the creative flexibility that
you need I've adopted a fairly simple
technique here and so for every
component that I have on the page and
the component is something like a header
or footer or an article I have two CSS
files and one of them is full of
critical Styles and the other file is
what I call the lazy Stahl's
to explain this a bit more let's look at
an example as an example let's look at
the styles for an article if you look at
the critical cells you will find only
things that are concerned about layout
and color
and visual space allocation nothing
about box shadows or images or fonts all
these embellishments are in the Lazy
styles the reason I want to allocate the
space for the element as soon as
possible is that when the Lazy styles
eventually come in I don't want to start
things jumping around on the screen
we've all seen it on some website where
you start reading and suddenly things
shift to the bottom and that's just
annoying so I definitely didn't want
that to happen so all my critical styles
make sure that the layout is there and
that an element allocates as much space
as it will need throughout this lifetime
but here's the twist the critical styles
are actually in line so if we take a
look at the header.php we can see that I
use include to basically read the file
and put it into the HTML file itself
that might not be very WordPress II so I
apologize if any wordpress developer is
offended by this approach but it works
so it's kind of good enough I guess but
the interesting thing is that even if
the user only gets index.php and all the
other requests for lazy styles and
whatnot take forever to to arrive the
page is still useful to the user they
can start reading my blog post and
that's exactly what I want we can
actually emulate this doing with dev
tools by using request blogging so I
will block all requests for JavaScript
and force tiles so that means only the
index.php will come through and if I do
this and read up the page you can see
that immediately the con is there
nothing else happens and I mean sure
it's kind of it's a great experience
it's not as stylish as I would like it
to be but the functionality of the blog
of reading my content still works I can
actually still even click links there's
not gonna be a nice transition but it
still works and that's what I think is
really important to take away here so
this is my core technique to get on
screen as fast as possible in line
everything that you need for a first
content full pains and lazy load
everything else if you do this and put
everything that you need to render in
your first response for your index.html
whatever your landing page is you will
smash the time to first content full
panes metric let's talk about the lazy
styles
if you look a bit further down in my
header PHP you can see that I put all
the lazy styles in a no script tag this
is a little trick I've been using for a
while now and I wrote a piece of
JavaScript that waits until the page is
fully loaded and then looks for no
script tags that have the lazy load
class on them and then it rips out all
the children and append them to the head
basically at that point triggering the
load of the lazy styles the interesting
bit here is that if the user has for
some reason javascript is abled or it's
not working that the no script tag will
just enable these children by itself
because that's the purpose of the no
script tag and it will load these styles
right away loading styles by default is
a blocking processor that means if you
don't have Jasmine enabled you will
still get the full experience in terms
of style but it won't load as
efficiently but if you have jobs been
able my own loading pipeline will kick
in and will load the page much more
efficiently which is basically the
trade-off that I'm choosing here it's
probably worth noting that instead of in
lining my critical starts I could have
also used HTTP to push to push these
resources down to the clients but after
reading Jake's are to get a link to the
description I was kind of worried that
it's way too hard to get push rights and
worried about browser compliance and
pushing things that I don't really need
because they're already in the cache so
I was choosing to make a trade-off
between compatibility and caching
efficiency speaking off that's exactly
we're going to talk about in the next
episode caching headers something that's
very important to me it allows you to
conserve a lot of bandwidth by only
downloading things that are not already
in the cache and even something that can
be applied to dynamic content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
