session on standalone Google search with
structured data in search analytics my
name is andres Valenti I'm a Technical
Program Manager in search and this is
Duncan Horseman a product manager in
search thanks for joining us today
so the first thing I want to do is to
give a little bit of perspective as to
how we arrive where we are by going a
little bit back to the evolution of
search as you know googles mission is to
organize the world's information and
make it accessible and useful but how
we're doing this is changing over time
users are not satisfied anymore with us
providing a link to a possible answer
they want us to provide the answers
whenever false before I help them
navigate through the space of possible
answers or possible alternatives and in
fact you can see that many of our
products including of course the
assistance are now having this theme of
Google providing assistance to our users
so before and in fact until now in many
cases what you have if you put a search
like dessert recipes is a link a set of
links that you can explore you can try
out there you have some snippets that
try to give you an idea of what is
behind those links but users that land
on your page once they click don't have
enough context and it's not clear their
intent so we try to make this better and
last year we launched this idea of rich
cards the idea of rich cards is that the
residual modules that organize the
information on what used to be a blue
link and such a way that it's simpler to
read more visually appealing and easier
to navigate these cards were sometimes
organizing to care in to carousels like
you see here so you would be able to
scroll right and left and sort of see
some possible visual answers to your
query and now particularly in the last
year or so we have evolved even further
into this notion of immersive these are
sort of meaning applications you have
where you can explore the raises answer
so not only you have the digital
components of these rich cards that we
had before
but you also have things like these step
targets so for instance you can refine
your query and say well not only I want
to show their type recipe I want one
that's lutein free and this way what
happens is that somebody who clicks on
this has a very clear intent of what
they want to get now what happens
however is that in addition to all the
information that Google has in its
knowledge engine what wiII happen what
happens that we use a lot of structure
third party structured data to power
this and what that means is that there's
an opportunity for you if you have a
site where you have relevant information
you can try to organize that site and
optimize its performance in such a way
that you can participate in these
features what we have found is that the
sites that implement structured data
typically see increase increase
click-through rates and increased
engagement in other words the users
account to you a better user so for
example here is one use case that we
found Rotten Tomatoes implemented
structured data in more than 100,000 of
their changes that attracted billions of
impressions but the more interesting
part is that these pages resulted in 25%
higher click-through rate which is
really very hard to achieve with any
other means compared with the patients
they have that didn't have structure
them in other words you can do these and
they're sort of good results for you
later on we're going to have more case
studies that are explain the details now
in the remainder of this talk we're
going to teach you how you can use
structured data to optimize your site's
performance we're going to tell you how
you can use this to stand out pick up
the right markup that are going to put
on your site and how to measure the
impact once you implement it now next
Duncan is going to talk to you about how
structured data appears on Google search
and gives you more details
thanks Andre hi there I'm Duncan Osborne
I'm a product manager on search so Andre
is going to get into how you implement
and measure structured data in just a
second but I thought first we go through
some of the features that we built that
utilize structured data so that you can
see how it then appears to users and
then we'll go through the implementation
later so we have quite a broad set of
verticals that support features that
have structured data in them I'll go
through just a couple examples but I
guess the key here is there's a fairly
large number of verticals supported now
and we have a good set of partners in
each one so there's a good base to learn
from and we're constantly thinking of
new verticals for OLAP structured data
features into so I chose just a couple
queries to show off structured data
these are just random from my search
history let's get started from recipes
so this is a great example of a vertical
where we've invested in structured data
features at several levels namely the
page level the domain level and finally
the result level and so I'll walk
through one of each of those and it's
dangerous to show cookies at snack time
but here we go
this is at age level so in this case
what we've done is we've taken all of
the recipe leaf results as we call them
which just means a single recipe result
and we assemble them into a single
carousel at the top of the page which
makes it easy for users to access all of
the recipe results in one single place
and make their decision and finally land
on the one that they've chosen you can
see here that we're featuring several
different kinds of structured data first
we have the rating we have the calorie
count and we have the cook time all
those are sourced directly from the
markup on the third-party site it's also
important to note that one click away
from this experience is another
interface that we've even more heavily
optimized for browsing large numbers of
recipes in this case and here again
we're using the same types of markup but
we've just restructured them so that
they fit better in the UX that we've
chosen in this case one of the things
that's important is we see several
visual ramifications of structured data
here in terms of rating and calorie
count but what's behind this experience
is actually the markup at the
level which tells us that it's a leaf
result a recipe page and so that allows
us to make decisions about how we then
present them to users so both kinds are
important the signal and finally how we
decorate that result for users so that's
a page level now we move to domain level
at this point we're assembling all the
results but the results that are in a
single listing page or recipes which by
definition comes from a single domain so
instead of concatenate in many different
domains in one place we now give the
site owner a single property for their
content so once again we've refloat all
the content you see here in terms of
ratings cook time calories just in a
smaller card format so a good example of
how we're fairly flexible and how we
display this data but the other
interesting point here is that this list
of content is customizable both in
content and in order and that gives you
a fairly visible level of control over
how your results appear in search which
is pretty cool okay that's domain and
finally at the result level if we have a
result that ranks that's just a single
leaf page we won't just leave it as a
blue link we'll use any data that we
have to decorate that results that it
looks really good and also allows users
to make decisions directly on the search
results page and the next one I wanted
to show you so moving on from cookies to
something to make you even hungrier is
restaurants in SF which is what cool
people call San Francisco so in this
case we again have the domain level
results so we've taken all the
restaurants that are in a listing page
and assembled them into a carousel but
what's interesting here is in this case
the site owners only just provided the
title and we just shrink the card to
adapt to that kind of data but in this
case the site owner could also add
things like the cuisine type or the
location for the restaurant so it's
generally a good idea just to take a
look at our developer guidelines and see
what's possible for a given data type
and then you can decide in that case how
you want us to render the cards for
example they could have also added
ratings and those would
appear right between the location and a
title and then one other point here when
you're doing domain level markup you're
only affecting your results so we don't
actually switch to results as a result
okay so to burn off the calories we're
now moving to running shoes and we're
also switching to a different product in
this case image search so here instead
of going to web search I went to the
Image Search tab and I searched for I
searched for Nike free earn which is a
shoe so in this case this is a good
example of a query where you have users
that want a fairly visual exploration to
start with that's because they're
exploring options and comparing how they
visually look but at a certain point
they want to move to the point where
they make a purchase there you need
additional information as a buyer and
that is where structured data comes in
handy so here in this case we've
included the price and the rain directly
in that result once I tapped on the shoe
that I wanted to buy and then of course
there's the link at the bottom of the
page that allows me to visit and
eventually purchase great let's wrap up
these examples with a brand new feature
that we launched this about a week ago
this is for events so in this case I
searched for concerts in NYC where I
live and here right at the top of the
page we have a single box that assembles
all of the events for my query and so
again we've assembled things but we rely
on structured data to make this look
good so much of the data that we see
here the date the time the location and
even the image are provided to us by the
site owner so this is once again one of
these great features that we can provide
to users based on the data that we're
able to share with publishers okay
Andres here to walk you through how to
then implement all this markup Thank You
doc
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
walk you through sort of the journey of
implementing this on your site on your
property before I do that I just want to
highlight and piggyback on a couple of
elements that Duncan talked about about
what is structure there what does it
look like I know most of you are
developers we'll just in case
so you see here on the left side a
specific card with the recipe and on the
right side I'm going to highlight a few
elements so that you can see how they
match so you see this is a script tag in
json-ld and it expressed finds that this
is a recipe according to the schema in
schema.org that's a public specification
and then each of the property is going
to match components that can go into the
cart so in this case for instance the
name your basic case of the University
becomes the title you see here as we
continue more tags the image gives you a
URL for the image that we're going to
display on the image on the left and the
description can give you some elements
that we could use for instance in the
snippet on more structural components
for instance this is how you would
specify an aggregate rating and then we
didn't translate this information into
the Stars and the number of reviews that
you see on the left and then finally you
have here the total time the cooking
time the ten minutes as well as the
number of calories and this is how
they're specified so the lesson learned
here is each specific markup each type
you have in this case recipe it's going
to have its own specification and you
can see how they translate into the
elements of the carb now this is sort of
the overall journey of the thasians in
addition processing I'm going to walk
you through each element of it so the
first one is you want to identify the
best markup match so you're watching
this talk and you're thinking right it's
something I could try to do now
throughout this journey I will talk
about different tools and here is a
summary there's the search gallery the
structured data testing tool and the
search console these things of course
are available to you hope you can get a
take a moment and try those out after we
talk the first starting point is the
search gallery the search gallery
basically allows you to figure out what
are the places where you can
structural data and the kinds of things
that you can do the first part I want to
highlight on the left top on this list
by the way this is a brand new version
of the search gallery that's being
published this week you see these
enhancements and these are things that
are you can do more or less independent
on the kind of information you have so
you know a recipe is markup unity if you
have recipes on your site but these are
things that can enhance your result in
Google search independently on what you
do so for instance you could have
improved how the breadcrumbs are
structured corporate contacts logos
you'd be surprised how many people don't
give us a good specification of what
their logo is so we could show it is
necessary once you sort of you know look
at these opportunities all sort of
low-hanging fruits probably everyone can
do that and then you see the second part
which are the vertical content Heights
that dunkaroo subscribing to you so you
have data set design spec tracks music
podcasts itself so this for instance is
the specification the documentation for
recipes and you see that there's
actually several kinds of markup I can
have on the left side it's like a single
recipe or a single query and then on the
top on the extreme right you see a list
so Duncan was talking about how you can
sort of make a list page this is how it
would look like now look carefully at
the specification here this is all on
google dev site and towards the bottom
of the content page we always show you
the property so earlier on I was talking
about the schema well here we kind of
give a summary of the things that we
expect and stick special care to look at
which things are required because you
know not all the pages you see don't
have all the required elements they they
want to actually be published and of
course it's a good idea for you to put
the recommended fields as well because
that will increase the quality result
the quality of the car that we could
show and we'll make you look better so
for instance like number of calories in
the recipe it's not obligatory but if
you put it the information would be
added as Duncan go subscribe okay once
you identify the kinds of markup that
you want to have now the next step is to
actually draft some of it and sort of
play with it well back to the guide to
the
to the to the page where the
documentation is you see there's these
links with see markup and for each of
those we actually will then give you a
sample of what the mark-up is for that
kind of structured data and that will
bring you to the second tool in our
three two parts called the structured
data testing tool which we're going to
get to later as well the structured data
testing tool opens with a sample of that
specific kind of page so that you could
use it as a starting point the idea is
that you can kind of play with it see
what it looks like generally you try to
make it really complete so it has all
the components and you could use this to
as sort of a starting point now we
recommend to you that you create a
version of a sample page don't take a
page of your site for instance that has
a recipe or something and then add the
markups to that and test it out so you
can actually give the address of the
page and sttt will circulate the testing
to SCTP will go pick up that page
analyze it and tell you what happened
with it and give you whatever errors and
warnings there might exist now if your
sample page Franks is made in a
pre-deployment environment you are ready
to publish yet you can still mark you
can still cut and paste the market here
so you can still test it it's just a
little bit more cumbersome now once you
see it verifies for some structural
structural data element the next step is
for you to see how it looks like and you
have this preview function here once you
click preview you see a sample car as
Duncan said it depends a little the
context how much information we display
but you could see what your elements
would look like in a realistic card that
would be shown in search and that helps
you also tweak your content so maybe you
try different pictures or different
images to see what's the best way to
showcase your search with it okay so at
this point we you know we understand
what we want to do we tested one to see
what it looks like and now now the next
step is to deploy this for some pages or
sort of a subset on your site we
generally recommend that you don't do
this for everything at once get a subset
of your site and execute one page back
that you use a subset of your site and
use that to try out so
this too just perhaps even manually to a
few HTML pages just to get a notion of
what it would look like now I'll get a
more technical so there's actually two
ways in which you could add your
structured data so one is the same kind
of script that I showed you earlier in
json-ld you put in a script tag and it
will show like this and it's actually
the most common way in which people do
it there's another one you can actually
use Micro data inside a div tag like
this so there's more additional
documentation on our website if you want
now of course the kid implementing
things manually but that's not a great
idea what you really would like to do is
to use your CMS I imagine most of you
who have large or even sizeable or even
snot that that large web properties have
a content management system to manage
your content but you really want to do
in the most common way we have found
that people do it is that they pick up a
suitable structured data CMS plugin
there's many CMS's that has plugins that
you can get it to try a few different
ones we don't have any specific
recommendations but the idea is that you
know you publish your content you
standard HTML content but it ends the
search for data with it so you don't
have to manage things one by one all
right so once you put this in a specific
subset of your site it's time for you to
review the stats and what this would
look like and for that we get to our
third - which is the search console now
search console is similar to Google
Analytics in a way that it focuses on
Google search so it tells you sort of
how search looks at your site and and
what elements of that appear in search
results and how many times it appears at
seven now different from the structured
data testing - in a search gallery which
were fundamentally just open the search
console requires a little bit of setup
because you have to sign up and verify
properties now I'm curious how many of
you have actually verified or used
search console just that I get an idea
not as there may be a third fourth
alright so we'll give you a little bit
of detail and it's you know there's more
to it than that but the first step for
you is to get associated with an account
so you have anybody can get an account
or search console that's straightforward
but then what you have the verification
process that proves that you have rights
to the site
want to verify again to test or use on
search console again much like Google
Analytics is the same process commonly
you do this by uploading some status or
file to your site or perhaps to a domain
one of the components of your domain and
your domain name provider now you might
want to if you have a larger
organization you might want to check
it's frequently the case that somebody
else might have used and set it up and
in this case they can they can authorize
it and makes life a little simpler so
once you register your site or you
register the ability to manage your site
through search console the first thing
you want to do is to add sitemaps and
sitemaps are a way for us to look and
see what information you have now of
course we already look at sitemaps if
they are available but this helps
because it helps us understand which is
the sitemap that you prefer to use so
Franks is imagine you deploy some you
stuff and you have a sitemap and you
give us that site mapping we sort of
used that to figure out what the
components are of this site so for
instance you could do this for a section
as a site while you'll see with things
out this is what search console looks
like much like Google Analytics also
it's there's a lot of stuff here so a
lot of different reports and it's not
always very easy to find but let me walk
you through some ways in which you can
dig into the data for your
implementation first you could use this
rich cars report that sort of marked on
the left and that monitors which
structured data elements were correctly
found on your pages after crawl and the
first thing you want to do of course is
to look at whatever issues were found
so like the structured data testing to
allow you to test one specific markup
this basically looks at what elements
are all your site and what do they look
like keep in mind by the way that it
takes a while to crawl your site so once
you implement everything you might want
to give a couple of days until we catch
up to this what you want to do of course
is to look at all the critical issues
remember those sort of an obligatory or
necessary properties so for instance you
may want to look at those because those
things may actually prevent us from
showing our structured data into a car
could also look at non-critical issues
as I said before because they could
include the quality now let's look for
instance at the issues that are
affecting the recipe card type so see
below this specific site implemented
both recipes and local
so if the click on recipe then we get
sort of a subset of the report only
about recipes and you could see here
there's 218 invalid cards and then the
bottom you see the problems that were
found so that gives you a very good idea
of what is it that you need to fix as
you see in this case there's a bunch of
opportunities that you have my heaviest
in terms of like Eddy nutrition but the
most important one is that there's 200
in 18 pages in fact all of the ones that
are invalid and are invalid because they
seem to be missing a field in this case
image if you click on that same line you
can dig even deeper and find examples so
search console can actually sort of
guide you to the specific pages on your
site
where that problem was found and in
addition if you click on one of those
further you can actually get a dialog
that will eventually lead you to the
structured data testing - with that page
and with that markup where you can see
girl exactly what went wrong so we try
to help you debug this at a relatively
fine grained level so for instance in
this case you see on the left side the
image that you're listing is marked
there's no image here on the right side
you see marked in blue and in the list
of the scheme of the properties that
that property was not filled and it's
obligatory so basically trying to sort
of know connect sort of the lowest level
of the specific page to to do for all
implementation of your site alright so
now you review all of this we want to
six and and launch recrawl reindex again
keep in mind is to take a couple of days
until we we actually get to all of it
and now you're ready
so you publish the stuff and the
question for you of course the most
important one is how do I know my return
on investment how do I know that this
was useful and how do I know what the
results are
in terms of the effort that I put on
doing this so these are some of the key
stats these are standard kinds of things
for for webpages clicks impressions the
number of times that the information was
shown the card was shown click-through
rate the average position in which this
was shown is when you came in a search
results page
and you could get all of this through
the search analytics report and search
analytics report gives you a lot of
different ways of sort of parsing and
filtering information to find out how
each part of your site did and in fact
it also can help you do this both with
and without the markup - the great way
for you to compare in one of the ways of
course our partners use to figure out
what happened so you can view
impressions click CTR in position as we
discussed before and you can filter
based on things as a search feature type
solo in spidery that's something this
can appear both as a rich and no rich
result given a certain query depending
on the context so any what you want is
you want to try to analyze what are the
pages to have the high CTR so basically
you could use this to detect what's
working well what are the places where
your implementation had the best results
make sure a few ways in which you could
filter this the social peer and filter
tells you like how pages with markup
perform so in this case you can select
rich results which are the results that
have structured it can also filter based
on a pattern of URLs so perhaps remember
earlier I said you might implement is on
a section of your site well maybe it's
under a specific folder or a specific
URL pattern you could specify this here
and then sort of compare how this looks
compared to the rest of the site you can
also look at Ray date ranges which can
be useful for instance if implemented is
like you know one week and then the
following week you can compare like
before and after so this is sort of an
overview of the process for implementing
structured data among these verticals
and now Dunc is going to tell a little
bit more about how the sites that has
islem into structured data
what kind of ROI do they get thanks okay
final stretch
what our walk you through again some of
these partners that we've seen across a
few different verticals but also across
several different gos to show that the
diversity of success that we've seen so
far so let's start with the one that you
just saw Rotten Tomatoes again a good
adoption of structured data which led to
a 25% higher click-through rate for
those results but they weren't alone
here we saw a food calm which is one of
the primary providers of recipes online
they also had good coverage of
structured data with 80% of their
results as rendered in Google search as
rich results and they saw a 35% increase
in CTR which is super encouraging next
going over to Europe but also going over
to a different vertical so in this case
local restaurant listings la bruschetta
put markup on 90 percent of their
results and they saw again a fairly high
increase in CTR
we're going back to recipes put over to
Japan so here this is an interesting
case because not only do they see an
increase in interaction on those results
but the resulting session as users
landed on those pages was of higher
quality so if you're in one of those
verticals that depends on the quality of
a user landing on those pages this is a
great time and finally will be to South
America we thought Nestle Brazil with
82% higher CTR so this is again super
encouraging and hopefully we will see
some of you on this list next talk so we
covered three things in this talk the
first is the opportunity which is
literally to stand out on search one of
the rare opportunities you have to
customize your results visually for
Google users and we have quite a few
verticals for now and we're constantly
thinking of new verticals or odd so if
you're not on the list that I showed
before stay tuned
second we show you the tools that you
can use to implement all of that
structured data and to measure the
impact and of course the results as
we've seen can be very promising
so just to wrap up this is a quick
reminder of the links that can hopefully
help you get started if you haven't
already first a search gallery to see
what the options are it's good to click
through the
types of content that corresponds to the
content you have on your site second
once you start to implement structured
data the structured data testing tool is
there to diagnose and to indicate any
errors that you have in your markup and
also just guide you through the correct
practices to make sure it's working
properly and finally in search console
once you manage to ship all of your
structured data you can enjoy the
results with the analytics that are
contained therein and that's about it
there are search office hours for any
questions you may have please take
