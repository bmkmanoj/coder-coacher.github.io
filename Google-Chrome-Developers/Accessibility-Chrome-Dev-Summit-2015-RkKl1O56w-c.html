my name is Laura Palmeiro I'm the
program manager for the chrome team for
accessibility specifically and I'm
almost box full and I'm a software
engineer on the chrome team also working
on accessibility we're really excited to
be here with you all today and talk
about polymer accessibility so first of
all when we say accessibility what do we
actually mean so accessibility refers to
the design of products devices services
and environments for people with
disabilities and to give you a sense one
in six people have some form of
disability that's over a billion people
in the world and that's a really
significant population size obviously
and a very powerful statistic but when
we think about disability it really
impacts us like each on a very personal
level to give you a little bit of my
personal story when I was 14 years old I
essentially went from having 20/20
vision to being legally blind within one
week I was diagnosed with a super rare
visual disorder which impacts my central
vision so while everything peripherally
is still intact for me anything that I
looked directly at is this mixture of
distortion and darkness and little
flashing lights that kind of pulse
around and I've been told that it takes
a lot of drugs to simulate that effect
so I've got that going for me but when
all this first happened I was quite a
transition so I was just about to enter
high school big new school and all of a
sudden I could no longer read a book or
see a blackboard or distinguish my
friends faces in the hallway so this is
a really big change for me and my family
and quite honestly those first few years
were were struggle so I'd come home from
school and my my father would teach me
my math classes because they couldn't
quite figure out what to do with a
student who couldn't visually see the
blackboard my mom and my brother would
read to me when it came to taking the
SAT exam I sat in the room with a
wonderful woman who read it out loud to
me it took nine and half hours and that
was not a fun day I can promise you that
so thinking back to this time it was a
struggle and it was honestly I'm so
thankful for all the support that I
received my family was
incredible I don't know where I'd be
without them today but when I think back
this was really the definition of
disability and dependence to me and I
hated it so over there was a couple of
years my vision shifted a little bit and
I did happen to regain a tiny essential
field in my left eye which is about the
size of three letters or so so if you
can imagine tunnel vision and then I was
able to kind of aggregate the right sort
of assistive technology it's who really
regained a lot of my independence back
so to give you a little glimpse into my
world and what I see
first I three weeks ago adopted a really
loveable black lab named a bow so if I
wanted to go ahead and figure out what
sort of dog park to take bow to in San
Francisco I could bring up Google Image
Search and type in a search result and
once the images are there I can go ahead
and really easily zoom in to get it to
the right level of magnification for me
so that I could use my peripheral vision
as well as that little central field and
piece together the image the best way
that I can see possible so the important
thing to know is that you know when we
all in this room and on the live stream
when we're all looking at these images
we may not all be seeing the same thing
but the really crucial part is that this
UI is flexible enough so that I can
customize it and use the vision that I
have and see it the best way that I can
and success we made it to Lafayette Park
and this is both soaking up the Sun
alright next this is how I interact with
Gmail just to give you an example so as
you can tell I've got the white text on
black background instead of the typical
reverse this really helps to reduce eye
strain and I'll blow it I'll go ahead
and show you an example of how I use
magnification and text-to-speech so I
can go ahead and zoom in just by
pressing command + or ctrl + C an email
from Alice hey are you bringing your dog
to work today I can't wait to meet him
then I can craft a response and
highlight it and press a key stroke yes
we're on our way
what treats men tennis balls and then
it's read back to me so this technology
has literally transformed my life
so when I think back to to my college
days we used to buy physical textbooks
and strip their bindings off of them and
then run all the pages through a
high-speed scanner then use OCR software
to convert to text and then I could use
this mixture of magnification contrast
and text-to-speech to go ahead and
access those materials finally so it was
not a pretty process but it completely
changed my life and it was at this point
that I realized the amazing impact that
technology can have on individuals and
it's really just inspired me ever since
and fueled my passion to progress
accessibility so I'm just one example of
a low vision user who greatly benefits
from assistive technology but when we're
all designing UI which is often quite
visual in nature we need to be really
conscious and aware of the many
different ways that users might be
interacting with the UI so we need to
think about people for instance who are
fully blind who might be using a screen
reader or a Braille display we need to
think about people who are hearing
impaired who are using captions or even
example in this room of using you know
live captioning of speaking of exactly
what I'm saying right now we need to be
considerate of people who might have a
motor impairment or dexterity impairment
and might not be able to use a mouse and
might rely fully on using the keyboard
to interact or maybe typing is actually
really difficult and instead voice
control would be better or switch access
with a switch controller device or even
a head tracking system or eye tracker we
also need to be considerate of people
who might be neurologically diverse with
autism or dyslexia etc who may benefit
from instead of typing they might really
benefit from dictating or using
spellcheck more heavily or the auto
suggestion of words we also want to
think about the aging population who you
know as we all get older we're gonna
potentially experience a bit of slow
deterioration of vision and hearing and
lastly we want to think about temporary
or situational impairments so
essentially you know what if I break my
arm what do i do then or even just the
instance I've hey if you're in a loud
bar and you're trying to watch a
football game and you can't hear what's
going on
you're gonna rely on those caption
to hear what the commentator is saying
so this ability is a really broad
spectrum and by no means are we saying
that when you're out in designing that
you need to test your UI with every
single different type of assistive
technology that exists in the world but
we are saying that there are a set of
design principles that we can all use
that'll help us to really create
products that are usable by the greatest
number of people all right sir that's a
lot to take in obviously what can we do
as developers to actually make sure that
we're not at least breaking
accessibility and obviously the first
thing we can do is to take advantage of
any built-in accessibility that we can
so html5 comes with a lot of built-in
accessibility that's being designed into
the platform so over the years and built
into browsers and anytime we can use a
native HTML element to express semantics
that's absolutely what we should do if
we can if we need to move beyond the
standard HTML vocabulary for whatever
reason then that's why custom elements
can come into the picture and help out
so polymer obviously provides a suite of
custom elements that are also going to
make certain guarantees about
accessibility now we're going to talk a
bit about what polymer what guarantees
polymer makes about accessibility and I
want to stress that this is software and
it's never going to be done it's never
going to be perfect so we can say
certain things are at the moment and
obviously that's it's always going to
improve with time so I've got the paper
elements Google web components and gold
elements that have had a lot of work
done already on accessibility that you
can draw right into your pages today if
you're rolling your own custom elements
or need something a little more
bare-bones
they also have the iron elements which
are going to provide extra functionality
or UI patterns that you can build on top
of and build your own UI and you're in
look great so as we're leading up to the
1.0 launch we really wanted to be able
to stand behind the accessibility of
each of these elements in the library so
to do so we built an executor to really
firm strategy which had four prongs so
first up scaling the team we really
focused on educating the entire team
about accessibility so instead of just
appointing one expert we wanted to
educate all on the front end
so that they could actually you know
resolve the issues that we're currently
existing and then also incorporate
accessibility into the forward-looking
design second we wrote and ran automated
tests to be able to catch low-hanging
fruit as well as regressions and while
the automated tests are fantastic we
can't ever really expect them to catch
every single usability glitch or issue
so in this strategy manual testing was a
really critical component and the only
true stamp of accessibility is that the
product or service or site you know
works for every user but drawing from
experience we can tell that you know we
can actually capture quite a bit of the
potential issues by using a standardized
checklist for testing and to create this
checklist we leverage the gold standard
web component checklist and pulled out
all the accessibility related pieces and
crafted our own accessibility specific
checklists and then use that to run
across each individual element in the
polymer library great and these the the
testing checklist falls into three
buckets so first focus in keyboard since
keyboard interaction is absolutely
fundamental to accessibility second
semantics and third is working on
flexible UI and we're gonna dive into
all of these later in the presentation
all right the fourth part of our
strategy was prioritization so as you
can imagine waiting up to the 1.0
launched there were a lot of different
moving pieces and we had to figure out
how to work accessibility into the
broader scope of work so we aggregated
all of the testing results of what sort
of issues existed well what else we
wanted to improve and then we figured
out how to prioritize on two axes so
first how critical was the user issue
and second how high traffic did we
imagine that that element would be and
here's just a really quick example of
our progress snapshot leading up to the
1.0 launch so to walk you through the
process that we took to test and
identify issues and then resolve the
issues we're gonna walk everybody
through a case study of the
paper-checkbox element so let's start
with a keyboard
so if I was a user who was going to use
the mouse pointer in a traditional
fashion I could go ahead and hover with
the mouse pointer I could click and to
check or uncheck the boxes I get a nice
little visual animation this whole
process works really smoothly
right but what if I can't actually use
the mouse what if I have to rely on the
keyboard only so let's see in this early
demo what the experience is like with
just the keyboard alright so you might
hear that there are some little dings
that in the background that's me tabbing
around trying to see where focus is
trying to actually use this with just
the keyboard doesn't work at all major
fail so what actually went wrong here so
first we're not able to focus anything
therefore if we can't focus on anything
there's no visual indication to focus
and third we can't actually interact
with this at all using just the keyboard
let's address those one at a time so we
probably all have some notion of what
focus means although we may not have
actually interacted with it but if
anyone has ever filled out a web form
using the keyboard I do this all the
time because I really hate using the
mouse if I don't have to you've probably
encountered a situation like this where
you get to the end you've got these two
checkbox it's like yeah I've totally
read and agreed to those 10 pages of
terms and conditions absolutely sir okay
yep checked that and I can hit tab get
to the next checkbox which says your
ideas are checking to mirror and I wish
to subscribe to your newsletter all
words so that effect basically spam me
forever please no I do not want that I'm
gonna hit spacebar uncheck that hit tab
again get to the submit button submit
the form wonderful takes you know maybe
three seconds if I'm really slow that
day so that's really great that is old
so that form is you're all using native
HTML elements which have the focus
ability have that focus styling and have
keyboard interaction all built in the
way that we can actually add focus
ability to any kind of custom UI
including custom elements is using the
tap index attribute which again probably
most of us have come across so I'm just
gonna quickly run through it can take
three classes of values if
tabindex zero it's gonna put it in a
natural tab order based on the da matta
so this is exactly what you would get
using a native element if that tabindex
is negative which you can apply on
Elliott any element including native
elements the element is going to be
programmatically focusable but not in
that tab order so I could move focus to
it say for example I'm moving it onto
the screen or I it's part of a menu that
I want to actually have finer grained
control or maybe I need to shift focus
based on a user interaction then I can
use that a negative tabindex to actually
control and focus moves to that element
greater than zero tabindex puts the
element in a manual tab order obviously
on a custom element this makes no sense
whatsoever as a default value it can
make sense in certain situations but in
general it's usually you want to avoid
that so Laura mentioned that we need to
make focus visible so this is what it
looks like if focus is not visible so
I'm got to the end of the form and my
focus is on one of these elements and I
have no idea which one it is so it might
be unchecking the terms and conditions
checkbox that's not so bad I can fix
that it might be unchecking the family
forever checkbox which is good which is
what I want but it also might be
submitting a form which is gonna do me
to another 60 years of spam from this
airline until I finally figure out the
right sequence of links and whatnot to
actually unsubscribe I like to call this
focus roulette and it is really not a
nice thing to do to your users so if we
are in a position where a designer has
said now you really have to kill that
native focus ring we need to make sure
that we're actually styling focus and
it's pretty straightforward we just need
to use that focus so you know selector
so in this case we're matching focus on
the host because we're going to make
sure that that first host is focus of
all using that tabindex attribute in
this case we're actually using the
Palomar host attributes object to set
that tabindex attribute on the element
once it's rendered in the page and then
we can just set a nice background color
to say okay make this element I have
this particular background color when
it's focused finally we need to actually
make good on the promise that we're
making by making it l1 focusable and
showing that it's visible
fortunately this is one of the rougher
areas of programming for the web I can't
lie to you so many good libraries exist
to sort of paper over this so to speak I
on accessibility keys is one that I
highly highly recommend it's really
great if you're using polymer and can
use this library it puts a nice thick
layer of spackle over all of those sort
of giant fishes in the web platform it
provides a mixing behavior for keyboard
handling and abstract away the nasty
cross browser differences and provides a
really simple usable syntax for defining
those key combinations that you want to
listen for and the listeners that should
be fired so a quick example of that we
need to import that iron accessibility
keys behavior add iron accessibility
keys behavior to the behavior array and
then we can provide this keyboard key
bindings object which uses some readable
syntax for what keys to listen for and
what to do when those key events happen
all right so let's take a look at the
fixed experience so here we can tap
around or pressure
tab to go in Reverse we get a very clear
visual focused indication and we can use
the keyboard to actually check or
uncheck those checkboxes which is just a
much much smoother experience for
keyboard-only users it wasn't that hard
right all right next part of our testing
strategy was to test with screen readers
which are software that essentially
allow visually impaired or blind
individuals to navigate the UI using
Audio spoken feedback so just for a
moment I'd invite you all to close your
eyes let's take a look at what the
experience is like with the paper check
box using a screen reader Carbon uncheck
checkbox hydrogen check checkbox
nitrogen check checkbox all right you
can open your eyes or keep them close I
know it's been a long day so and so
essentially this is the smooth
experience you're able to navigate
through you hear that the what the
specific checkboxes are for we know that
they are checkboxes as just to start we
can hear the state of whether or not
they're checked or unchecked and then
from there we can infer that we can also
use the keyboard to change that state so
this is a really smooth experience
just to give you a sense there are a lot
of free screeners out there that are
most many of which are actually built
into your operating systems this is just
a few of them and there are also
additional screeners that are available
for purchase or for download we on the
polymer team do our testing across a
wide variety of screen readers operating
systems and browsers just to get really
comprehensive testing results alright so
let's take a look at an experience
that's not quite as smooth group Group
group Group group group awesome that's
so awesome fail alright so what went
wrong here so first of all we have no
declared semantics and second we don't
have any sort of labels so we have no
idea what this UI is for alright so
taking a look at semantics what's
actually involved here so the browser
creates this thing called the
accessibility tree which provides an
interface which accepts that assistive
technology can actually use to interact
with the page so this is this
accessibility tree is this very
beautiful diagram indicates instead of a
simplified version of the Dom so it
takes out most of the presentational
information sort of any any unnecessary
sort of elements sort of a bunch yeah a
bunch of the extra detail just doesn't
need to be there the assistive
technology can then use that to provide
a different type of output to the user
potentially so for example in the case
of a screen reader it's going to provide
speech output in the case of a Braille
reader it's going to provide Braille
output the user can then you interact
with the page via the assistive
technology so for example in the case of
a screen you know it's often based on
keyboard shortcut that can simulate a
mouse click and so on in the case of a
speech in sorry speech control device
it's not going to provide any actual
output because the user can often see
the page but it might allow the user to
provide verbal commands the assistive
technology then routes that action back
to the accessibility tree where it takes
action in the page so what do we what do
we how do we translate the Dom Turing
into that assistive technology tree so
when
we create an element in the page
typically we'll get this really nice and
visual rendering giving a visual
indication of what role that elements
playing so in in the case of a checkbox
you get this little rounded box we get a
checkmark telling us what this is
something that we can check and uncheck
like a ballot box we get a Dom object
that we can interact with
programmatically and we also get this
accessibility node so I know you'd in
that accessibility tree which is used by
screen readers and other assistive
technology the semantics that we can
actually provide on element include its
role so is it a checkbox is it a radio
button is it a text box and so on its
value its state so something like is it
checked disabled does it help pop up and
so on and a bunch of other properties
some things like a minimum value for a
text sorry a numeric range and so on for
custom elements we actually need to
provide those semantics ourselves and
this is what happens if we don't so we
still get that visual rendering because
obviously that's what we spent all of
that time doing we get that dumb object
and we can still interact with it
programmatically which is again really
great it's what we need but we don't get
that accessibility instead we get a
completely generic node because the
browser has no concept of what role this
element is supposed to be playing it's
effectively just a div the way that we
actually provide those semantics in the
cases of custom elements or any other
kite type of custom UI is by using Aria
which stands for accessible rich
Internet applications which allows us to
specify those role state and value in
properties semantics via HTML attributes
so in the case of the paper checkbox we
actually need the element to write out
its own Aria attributes and it's going
to give itself a role of checkbox and an
aria checked value of true so again we
get that visual rendering nothing's
changed there nothing's changed in the
Dom object except that has got these
extra attributes but now we actually
have that accessibility node which is
comprehensible and usable by the screen
reader and other assistive technology
the way that we do this in the paper
checkbox is again using this host
attributes object so that is going to
provide that allows us to say okay write
this attribute out to the dom once the
element is rendered
but it also respects any author provided
attributes so for example if I wanted to
inherit from the paper-checkbox for some
reason and say okay I know you'll say
your paper check box but I'm getting you
to act like a radio button I can give
that a roll of radio button then we need
to make sure we keep those semantics in
sync with the elements date so in this
case we want to make sure that that
aria-checked value keeps in sync with
the checked checked property
okay so we've declared some semantics
let's see what the experience is like
now uncheck checkbox checked checkbox
checked checkbox
okay so this is a slight step up we know
that these are checkboxes and we
understand whether or not they're
checked or unchecked but what are they
for
all right so pretty good quick Welwyn
tour of all of the options we have for
explaining what things are so when we
have native label label elements like a
check box we can use the label element
you can use it wrapped or you can use an
ID another great side effect it has is
it I can actually now click on that text
to check and uncheck the check box so
anyone out there who is not using this
you get my look of disapproval because
that drives me crazy all right we have
the alt attribute for native images so
in this case we have a lovely image of
Peru and then if that image doesn't load
we get a little bit of text saying bow
turning off his new red leash this is
also used for for screen reader users
obviously because we can provide
completely useful text alternative to
the image quick note alt and title or
any other tool tip or caption are not
the same thing
so alt is intended to provide an
alternative to the image a title or a
caption is some kind of like augmented
information to the image so in this case
we've got a title saying this is blue
because you can't tell that from the
image you can tell from the image that
he has a new red leash all right another
option we have is element content which
is going to work on most things we also
have some options from aria so we have
an aria label attribute which we can use
to provide a string which is used for an
assistive technology only label so in
this case we have something a bold menu
sorry toolbar button as someone who can
see that button I can say yes
seen that icon before I know what that
does screenreader user has no way of
telling what icon that it has so they
they get a little bit of extra
information and in this case it actually
provides information about the keyboard
shortcut so that they don't need to
actually find a button again we also
have Aria labeled by which allows us to
specify an ID of an element in the page
even including an element which is not
rendered and use that element as the
text alternative for the element so in
this case we've got a comic image which
has a lengthy transcript we can use Aria
labeled by it and tie that transcript to
the image finally I just want to point
out that all of these labeling options
compose so for example if we have a
button which contains an image the alt
text for that image will be used as a
label for the button okay so let's take
a look at the smooth experience one more
time Carbon uncheck checkbox hydrogen
check checkbox nitrogen check checkbox
so this is a vastly more accessible
version for non-visual users the polymer
team also do regression testing on these
things so when we find a bug like a
label is missing or it needs to have a
particular role they will actually write
a regression test like this to assert
that those attributes and properties are
provided all right so the third bucket
within our manual testing checklists is
ensuring flexible UI and that has three
main components that we want to talk
about today so first entering redundant
color second magnification and third
contrast so let's start with redundant
color so one in twelve males are
colorblind and one in 200 women so this
is a very large population of people so
the main concept that we want to take
away is that we never want to use color
is the only way to indicate any sort of
information so here we have an example
with the gold email input element and we
have essentially the indication that
this second email is incorrect just
through the red text so to somebody
who's colorblind or to someone like me
who has just trouble perceiving color as
a whole we can't actually tell that
anything is wrong here which means it's
just a frustrating experience
and just a quick note that we're using a
Chrome extension here called no coffee
which allows you to kind of visually
simulate different visual conditions so
the next step up that the polymer team
provided was to use this thicker red
line to underline the mistake but again
if you can't see that that's red it
might just look like a stylistic change
and that's still not giving you the
right context so the best way to
approach this is to use what the polymer
team has provided and use the custom
error messaging so this is great for
people who can't perceive color it's
also really great because that custom
messaging can then be pulled in and used
as the label for the screen reader so
this is definitely the most accessible
version okay great so next we've got
magnification and we want to ensure that
the magnification is working smoothly if
you zoom in using ctrl + or command + so
as i zoom in on the paper checkbox lmn
example you can tell you know the labels
all stay in the same place every all the
formatting is still intact I can still
use the keyboard and get that clear
visual focus ring it's a really smooth
experience which is great alright and
third we want to ensure sufficient
contrast so the would CAG accessibility
standards specify that the minimum
contrast ratio of texts and its
background color should be 4.5 to one
unless you're dealing with large text
size 18 font or larger and then the
minimum is three to one
and contrast is something that's really
important so not only for low vision
users like myself but it's 25% of all
adults have vision that is in the range
between 2020 and 2040 meaning that the
three point one ratio is actually going
to be really hard to see but four point
five makes it so much clearer so this is
a really really key concept to include
in all of your sites and apps and I'll
give you a real-life example
so last week I was about to make
brownies for a friend's birthday and
this is what the box looked like
unfortunately so the ratio is on this
box are actually only 2.2 to one and two
point six to one clearly well below the
four point five to one minimum ratio so
I had to go as far as to look up the
recipe online and
an ice-cream eater so you actually
listen to it and access it which was
honestly just unnecessary a little bit
silly so if we boost this up so that
we're meeting the wicked guidelines of
four point five to one minimum this is
what the box now it looks like which is
honestly a really great improvement but
it's still a little bit tough for me to
see that so the best approach is to use
what the wicked guidelines specify is
triple a seven to one ratio and you can
see this is just so much clearer for
everybody to be able to see all right
it's quickly another tool that you can
use to actually test for accessibility
sort of along the lines of a lint
obviously it's not gonna find all the
bugs but it will catch some low-hanging
fruit issues including color glue color
contrast is the accessibility developer
tools extension so it'll run an order in
your page but also gives you some
context sensitive information in the
elements pane as well so in this case
we've got this the website for this
particular company and we can see that
the contrast ratio of the text on the
page is a little better it's three point
nine eight but we can applied some
suggested colors here so for the four
point five or the seven seven point zero
ratio and the same rules that that
extension uses for its accessibility
audit are also used by the polymer team
in all of their automated testing so
they're gonna run that same lint on each
test case for their elements just to
make sure that they catching any
low-hanging fruit before it gets to
manual testing all right so that's where
we've been where to next so we on the
polymer team really want to be leading
the charge when it comes to
accessibility so we have it woven into
our entire forward-looking roadmap so we
have continuous automated testing and
regression testing that runs we have
regular manual testing schedules in
place and we're also working on making a
more sophisticated release process so
that we can actually add accessibility
as a blocker to any sort of stable
releases of elements and with that we'll
be able to have more transparency around
what sort of testing was done for each
element version so to wrap up we often
like to say that hope is not a strategy
so we all have a really important role
to play in up leveling and stay
accessibility on the web as well as
beyond so the world's health
organization made a statement that
really resonated true with us it said
the disability is really the
unsuccessful interaction between an
individual with a health condition and
their environmental factors so this is
when barriers are really put in place I
think back to my early days and math
classes where I was just sitting there
in that classroom really frustrated
because there was just no other way to
get that information
I couldn't visually see the blackboard
so the amazing thing is that with all of
these technological advances and the
more that information shifts into
electronic formats many of these
barriers just no longer need to exist so
I can customize my own setup I can
access a site you know assuming that
it's built in an accessible way I can do
whatever I need to do I'll be it
slightly differently so this is just
extremely powerful we really hope that
you found this talk informative and that
you all will incorporate accessibility
into your design and development and
help to make for a more accessible world
thank you
