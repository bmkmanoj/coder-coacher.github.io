work on polymer tools so normally I'd be
up here giving you a tools talk but like
Matt said I like experiments so right
now I'm going to do something a little
bit different and talk about or give you
a sneak peek on this library we've been
working on that we're very very excited
about and this is only a 15-minute talk
so I'm going to go really really quick
so hold on alright so I'm going to talk
about templates and obviously we're
going to talk about HTML templates and
so we're very familiar with those here
because templates are pretty central to
the polymer developer experience but
HTML templates and other techniques for
updating Dom have been around for a long
time and they're constantly evolving so
before I get into this library I'm so
excited about I wanted to give you an
extremely brief history of HTML
templates so in the beginning we had
manual Dom manipulation you had to
create some nodes individually wire them
together in a tree and then maybe hold
onto some of these nodes so you could
update them later and this is a lot of
code it was verbose it was not very fun
to write or to look at alternatively you
could try to use inner HTML you could
build up a string of HTML then you
inject it and let the browser take care
of creating the nodes but then if you
wanted to update it you had to traverse
this tree or use query selector or
something like that it didn't end up
being a lot better so then we have this
Cambrian explosion of declarative
template systems that embedded
expressions inside of them and then
control flow constructs like ifs and for
loops in polymer belongs to this
category here as well with systems like
angular or ember and then a few years
ago react introduced JFX and V Dom
virtual Dom into the world which take a
different approach
both syntactically and functionally so
JSX isn't standard JavaScript syntax
it's an extension that embeds markup
into JavaScript which is then compiled
out with a transformer and virtual Dom
took a new approach to updating the Dom
instead of pinpointing exactly what data
is embedded into the Dom it just goes
ahead and rear enters the entire tree
the entire template and it does this in
a virtual tree and then it compares that
to the last data head figures out what
changed and it applies those changes to
the Dom so with all this evolution of
templating solutions what come
next something does come next right
there's always a next well we have one
idea and since its 2017 obviously that
means that idea is going to come from es
2015 and that we think is JavaScript tag
template literals template literals are
one of the most unsung features of es6
or ES 2015 because they're way more
powerful than they appear at first
they're basically strings but instead of
quotes you use backticks and they can
span multiple lines and you can also
embed JavaScript expressions inside of
them too which is great for building up
strings from data and this is where
people usually stop with template
literals but interestingly and very
powerfully they can be tagged and a tag
is a special function that processes the
template literal both the literal and
the expression parts and it can return
whatever at once it doesn't have to
return a string so this is interesting
temple literals are actually designed to
allow domain-specific languages to be
embedded in JavaScript and HTML is a
domain-specific language so you can see
how these features together let you
write something that at least
syntactically looks like the HTML
templates that we're already familiar
with so this seems like a promising
direction to explore especially because
of our move to JavaScript modules that
we announced yesterday polymer templates
inside of modules are just strings and
when we work with this a little bit we
wanted something a little bit better and
we really wanted to be able to take
advantage of the fact that when we're
writing templates in JavaScript we can
be right in the JavaScript scope that
holds the values that we want to put
into the templates in the first place we
also wanted to take advantage of the
fact that we could use real JavaScript
expressions which are going to be as
fast as possible
the key though was figuring out how to
keep updates fast and make minimal
updates into the DOM and we're starting
to see another a number of other
libraries now that use a similar
approach including libraries like hyper
HTML hyper X Bell and t7 and now I'd
like to introduce you to the library
that we're so excited about which is
called lit HTML now let HTML is still
very very experimental in under
development but we wanted to give you an
idea of what templating in a module only
the world might look like
so we call it lit because well it uses
literals and it's very little and we
needed a name in this name was cool so
what is that HTML let HTML is a
combination of JavaScript template
literals the HTML template element and a
render function that lets you
efficiently render and re render these
templates to the Dom let's see what this
looks like
so let's tml templates are just
JavaScript template literals they
contain embedded JavaScript expressions
and they're tagged with a CH tml HTML
tag and then we have a render function
which lets you render a template to
someplace on the document now on the
surface this looks like it we could just
be building up an HTML string and using
inner HTML to set it on the document but
that's not what happened
that's not what's happening at all if we
were using inner HTML we could just
replace the expressions with their
values join them together into a string
use inner HTML and then we've have our
template but this would be very
difficult to update because we've lost
the locations of the expressions from
our template so instead what lay HTML
does is it replaces the expressions with
these placeholders and it creates a
string out of that and then it uses that
to create your template and after it's
created the template it goes through and
it finds the placeholders again and it
remembers where they are and we call
these things these places where these
templates these expressions are our
parts and that we remove the
placeholders from the template and now
we have a template that we can use over
and over again to create DOM and because
we remembered the locations of these
dynamic parts we can replace them with
values after we've created that DOM and
because we have those locations we can
efficiently update them with new values
when the values change now here we're
probably going to use templates mostly
to create shadow Dom for custom elements
so what would it look like to combine
the HTML with polymer well here's a
polymer 3.0 element in a pure JavaScript
module and we have an inline template
here that's returned from a static
method the template method if we convert
this tool it you can see that it's very
very similar except for then instead of
a static method we have an instance
method because we want access to that
level state and even though this doesn't
appear very different the develop the
developer experience is actually a lot
better because the expressions are real
regular JavaScript so now you get all
the syntax highlighting linting
formatting type checking if you use
typescript all those features that
you're used to from your tools because
it's just JavaScript it's also more
powerful because it's just JavaScript
you can do arithmetic in expressions you
can call functions you can build up
templates from parts using if statements
and for loops and you don't have to hang
everything that you want to access in
expressions off the prototype anymore
you can just import it or declare it and
use it next I want to talk about the
three main goals of lit GML first we
want to make it efficient because
quickly rendering Dom is one of the
primary tests in the template system
then we want to make it expressive
because you should be able to build very
interesting templates or with your
template system and then finally we want
to make it extensible because no
template system can build in all the
features that you're ever going to need
so first let's talk about what makes a
little HTML efficient so one of the
things that simply literals themselves
they have some really nice properties
that we take advantage of one is
separating static and dynamic content
let's look at why this is really
important so every HTML template system
is responsible for creating a tree of
Dom notes but only some of those nodes
are ever updated after they're created
so tip let's have this structure there's
a separation between static and dynamic
parts and then you have the updates not
every dynamic part changes at once
sometimes you update just one value in
so when thinking about the cost of
templating it's useful to have these two
questions in mind how many nodes are
updated and what's the cost per node and
if we look at something like polymer we
notice that polymer has this association
directly between the data and the nodes
that depend on it and so polymer can
scale its cost with a number of changes
that you have if you only change one
thing polymer only has to do one thing
to apply that change and if you look at
something like V Dom it takes a very
very different approach V Dom rear
Enders an entire virtual tree every time
any of your data changes so it actually
scales with the total number of nodes
that you have in a template but they try
to make up for this by driving the cost
of each node down very very low by using
a virtual tree was lit HTML we try to be
somewhere in the middle and get the best
of both words worlds here we're only
going to update the dynamic parts of
your template so we don't update every
node in the template but we also try to
drive that cost down very very low so we
can be as fast as possible and this all
falls out quite naturally from using
template literals because with template
literals we know exactly what parts are
dynamic and might change and what parts
are static and will never change and we
don't even have to do any work to figure
this out the syntax of JavaScript just
does it naturally for us so besides
separating static and dynamic sections
they also have this property where
literals that are passed to a template
tag are exactly the same for every call
to that tag this lets us do one-time
setup work like the HTML template
preparation I was talking about let's
take a look at example for that so let's
say you have a function that takes some
data and then puts it into a template so
we're going to call this function we're
going to say hi to Amy and this function
is not going to return Dom this function
is going to return a template result it
contains the template that we run a
render and the values that we want to
render into that template and then if we
call this function again now we're going
to say hi to Alex we get a new template
result which contains the template we
want to render and the values that we
want to render into it well it turns out
that these template objects they're not
the just the same they're exactly
identical so we only have to create it
one time the first time we ever see a
template from then on every time we call
this function all we're doing is passing
along the values that came with it and
that's very very very cheap so another
reason why template literals are great
is because parsing strings in JavaScript
is extremely fast parsing streams is
somewhere between three and four times
faster than parsing generic JavaScript
JavaScript expressions which is what
most HTML nsj solutions use so also
we're fast because we try to use the
platform as much as possible we use the
built-in JavaScript and HTML parsers we
don't ship any parsing bits ourselves
and we use the template tag for fast
deep content cloning of our templates
this is the full minimized source code
of leyte ml I stole this slide from
Jason Miller of pre-act where he did
this one time showing pre-act on the
slide
and I wanted to show that we can put it
all in here in 18 point font with room
to spare it's less than 1.7 K minified
it was conservative and I put less than
2k up there big so it's quite small and
this helps us be fast too because it
doesn't have to load much data over the
network
so that's efficiency now what what let's
look at what makes it expresses let's
take a look at what kinds of values you
can hand off to lit so you have simple
string values we can say hello from it
we also have expressions inside our you
can put expressions like imagine you
have your showing a page number on a
template and your users are probably not
computer scientists so they're expecting
a1 based index and you have a zero based
index that represents your page number
you can just add one to that inside the
expression so things like this are
extremely easy
you can also set attributes obviously
here we're setting the value attribute
of an input element but you can do some
more interesting things like you can
directly hand knit live HTML Dom nodes
so you might have some complicated
structure that you want to create and
it's easier to do that imperative ly by
hand once you do that you can just hand
the result off to lint and lint will put
it in the right place in the template
you don't have to worry about using
query selector or some other method of
finding that dynamic spot that you want
to manage we also support nested
templates so you can build up templates
by parts and you can share these parts
around with different templates here
we're injecting a header into a
container template and because we
support master templates you can build
up templates dynamically with logic so
if you were going to show different
methods to the users based on whether
they're logged in or not we support
arrays so if you hand an array tool it
will just render every item in the array
and this becomes extremely powerful when
you combine arrays with nested templates
so now you can take an array of data map
it over a template and you get an array
of templates you hand it to lit and lit
will efficiently render that to the Dom
there's some other interesting value
types of a handle like promises so let's
say you do a fetch of some content over
the network you can just hand that
promise to lint and when that promise
resolves lit will render the result in
your template you don't have to do
anything there for it so if you put all
this together you can see that we can
create some really complex
russer templates you can take a string
and split it by new lines and generate a
paragraph element for every paragraph in
the string you can dynamically choose
what kind of data
what kind of templates you want to
render based on the data and it's then
at the end you can put this together in
a more declarative form because we
support that too so we try to give you
the spectrum of doing things very
dynamically and imperative ly to being
able to do things declaratively and very
structured alright finally let's look at
extensibility there's two ways that you
can extend the HTML one is with
directives so directive is a function
that lets you customize how a value is
handled by late 80 ml so I told you
about promises where you could give a
little promise and when it resolved
would render that content well a lot of
times you want to render some default
content a placeholder the renders until
that promise is ready and so that's what
this until directive does you give it
both a promise and a placeholder it
renders the placeholder then it renders
the promise when it's ready and I wanted
to show you how easy this is to
implement so this is the entire
implementation of the until directive
and a directive is basically a function
that gets a part and a part has an API
set value as the method it has and so
you can just call set value here we call
set value with the default content and
then you can call set value again when
the promise resolves and that's your
entire directive right there so it's
very easy to extend and customize thank
another directive that we bundle is a
repeat directive this is very similar to
dom repeat and polymer this lets you do
efficient list where you can reorder the
items in the list so if you change the
order of the list and then give it back
to lit it can track what data went to
what dom node and then just rearrange
the dom nodes without having to remember
we render your entire list okay another
way to customize lit is by using custom
parts custom parts let you change how
values are handled across an entire
template and we've bundled a couple of
these together in a library we called
lint extended which gives you polymer
style sugar on top of text nodes and
attributes you get property bindings by
default and we have declarative event
handlers so for property bindings let's
say you have a custom element and it has
some property where it's expecting some
rich data to be bound into it you can
just go ahead and
with lit extended use the normal binding
syntax and you get a property binding
but notice something here notice that
capital P up there it turns out that
because we're storing the attribute
names in JavaScript we can go back and
get the case preserving names of the
attributes there so now we don't have to
do this kabab case to camel case mapping
anymore we can just use the real
property names and that should eliminate
a lot of errors that people accidentally
get into sometimes we can also fall back
to attributes if we need to by using the
dollar sign suffix just like polymer and
we support declarative event handlers
this looks like polymer because we have
the on - prefix but it's a little bit
different because we actually take a
function value into the binding
expression and so you can write in line
handlers like this or you can just
reference a method on your on your
custom element okay and that's what
makes it extensible and that's basically
all over HTML the next question is where
to now like matt said this is currently
a bit of an experiment so we have a lot
of testing and optimization and
benchmarks to do to make it real but
from what we've already done we know
that litt is very fast and that it works
great on the modern browsers and then we
want to write a mixin for polymer so
that you can use this together with your
polymer base classes and then finally we
want to add tooling support so you can
get syntax highlighting code completion
hover over documentation all the
features that we give you in our polymer
IDE plugins so if you want to follow
along there's a github repository at
some polymer labs lit that HTML and you
can already install this from NPM I'm
going to push a new version this
afternoon and you can just npm install
that HTML and if you follow me on
Twitter I'll be talking about this as I
develop it alright thank you very much
