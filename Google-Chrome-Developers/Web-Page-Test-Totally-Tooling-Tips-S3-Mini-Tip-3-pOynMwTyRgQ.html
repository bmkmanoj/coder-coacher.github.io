okay so webpagetest is this great tool
for testing the performance of your site
from multiple locations around the world
we use it a lot when we're building
progressive web apps at the moment so
this is like the interface to web page
test the basic idea is you just go in
and you fill out slightly you want to
test out what we usually do is we go to
Advanced Settings and we first of all
set the number of tests to run because
these can vary because web page test
often runs on actual devices and you can
set you know location that you want to
test from around the world we set to
three so that you get a relatively
decent set of different pieces of data
and it's just gonna a bridge them out
for you so when you go and you run your
test it's gonna look a little bit like
this so this is testing Paul Lewis's
voice memos app out and you get this
nice little table at the very top that's
got data like low time start render and
the speed index Matt what's the speed
index I believe the speed index is
basically the visual completeness of the
page relative to all the pages on the
Internet
you were right sir all right includes
like the timeline breakdown and
screenshots just showing you all that
nice stuff but for speed index you
basically want to try getting for at
least table as close to a thousand as
possible and if you're targeting like 3G
you're looking at maybe around three
thousand and I'd also argue on the
repeat view you should basically be
getting as close to like zero as humanly
possible like repeat view is basically
like the page everything's loaded once
everything should be in the cache so you
should literally be pulling everything
from there HTTP cache and it should be
superfast and in this case Paul Lewis is
using serviceworker so you'll see that
he's getting a pretty decent speed index
which is good so just try to get that as
a low down as possible when you're in
your advanced settings page you'll also
notice that there's a section called
connection because a lot of the time
your users might be on the go there
might be like on the train or like
running away from the cops or something
I don't know
you should probably also try out the 3G
settings and see how while you're doing
there so just select mobile 3G go and
run your test again that will look a
little bit like this so very similar to
the page we had before you'll notice
that the speeding duck score is now
changed so this is still you know it's
under 3000 it's doing pretty well
speeding next for repeat views also gone
up it should probably be a little bit
lower
I think it's nice basically to get
something that is out of your control I
think it's that's the main reason why I
use this is something like my
environment where I'm running these
tests can't be affected it's just
webpagetest is an independent party so
it's good so another thing that we
usually check is the capture video
option so capture video is also an
advanced settings just capture start the
test and when you do that you'll get
this video so on that tab that we were
on before you'll notice that there's
this little link called filmstrip view
click that it'll actually give you a
filmstrip showing you all of the frames
that were captured over time and this is
super useful for actually getting to see
things like first meaningful paint so
here we can see it around 2 seconds we
actually got like some of the top
toolbar being drawn and the material
design fab I con we have some text we've
got a loader showing and you can see the
progressions free too I would say I
would say 4 seconds is about when you
get your your proper first meaningful
paint in place some members of the
chrome team say first meaningful paint
is when you've got like actual text
showing up on the screen so four seconds
is how long it took and this is 3G as
well Palouse does really well on the
cable scores for this stuff you can also
get a video view so remember we captured
video if we go to the video of you here
you can actually see ok well all these
flames are playing back and it shows you
the progressions through 1004 seconds
until we've actually got the visual
completeness so that's useful as well
back on webpagetest if you go to chrome
so there's a dedicated chrome tab here
with a few extra options in there one of
them is capture dev tools timeline now
if you check that and you go and you do
recording you'll actually get this
little timeline option
in the very left in a column you can
download a chrome dev tools timeline
there and then you can open up in dev
tools you can just like go to your
Timeline view load the JSON file and
load that in there you can also just
click view and I'll show you that
timeline in a tab there's another tab on
webpagetest here called visual
comparison now this is super useful for
like let's say you you've got some
assumptions you want to check out like
you've got a new UI that you you want a
ship and you want to see how much you
know how well it compares performance
wise to your old one or like you want to
see you know what the impact of ads are
on your page and stuff like that like
it's good if you had like stay tuned vs.
release and you've done load of
performance work you want to make sure
that you are actually doing well because
I'm a jerk I'm just gonna use this to
compare the performance of like some of
the apps our team have been building
like this I've got Palouse Jake Kinlan
and me and you can see the progression
of visual completeness here you know
half a second we still have a white
screen then around 0.7 look Jake Scott
Jake's got some content letting you up
and Paul Kinlan zero in a wrap which is
basically has nothing but it's the
fastest thing there is there I do like
how it loads and then it's just like
done but you can see the progression
like around one second I've actually got
some content here Jake's already got all
those text and everything going I think
he's using streams and other you had to
say it didn't you streams streams no
magic and this is this is just really
nice for being able to compare visual
completeness across a few different
builds of things another option on
webpagetest under advanced is the
ability to disable JavaScript which is
useful if you want to like check out the
impact of like third-party resources and
ads and stuff like that it's also useful
if you just want to see like what
happens if you're in a browser where
like let's say upsetting your JavaScript
failed and you're relying in heavily you
can find out yeah and if you need even
more granular control over this type of
thing you can also block requests to
specific resources over in the block top
you wanted you talked about test history
so I had no idea that this was a thing
yeah so I think what I was doing was I
was changing my website and I actually
wanted to retroactively Lee compare
new and old runs of my site and it turns
out webpagetest actually logs a lot of
this information so you can literally
select like runs from the past year from
any user that's just stuff to your site
through webpagetest and as you get
access to those test results so if you
wanted to compare like really old builds
versus new you can totally do that
through webpagetest it's all just there
which is awesome
one last thing there's something I only
recently discovered
so webpagetest also has this JPEG info
tool so webpagetest at work / JPEG info
you can just add in a URL to any image
here and analyze it and we'll actually
do is it will show you like what
compression savings you can get by going
for lossless compression or changing up
the image quality to something a little
bit different to what you've got right
now like size 8 like 85 in this case
we're just still saving you buy
something on the original 140 K image
but it's just just a nice little extra
thing webpagetest does not a lot of
people use is like no this tool exists
but it's gonna need that's pretty cool
cuz it also tells you like gives you a
score of light image compression on your
runs and everything there's a ton of
other options on web page test of guard
you can keep your test private set
labels you can set custom user timings
so if visual completeness requires
better markings up in the the waterfall
view that they've got you can check that
stuff out sports authentication and a
ton of other stuff so web page test is
awesome go check it out yes use it every
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
