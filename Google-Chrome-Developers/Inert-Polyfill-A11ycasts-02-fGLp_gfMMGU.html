first official episode of alley casts
today on the show what I wanted to do
was just kind of like get my hands dirty
and start hacking on some real-world
components to show some accessibility
issues and how we can fix them over here
on my laptop I've got a little side nav
that my teammate Paul Lewis is built
over on his show supercharged and the
side nav many of you I'm sure are
familiar with this you go over and you
click on the little hamburger menu and a
drawer slides out and inside of that
drawer you've got a bunch of anchors
that you can click on to go to different
sections of a website now the
interesting accessibility issue that
this side map presents and which I see
on a lot of websites in fact is
particularly around focus and for our
keyboard users so let's look at what
happens when I try and tab through this
experience so I hit tab and my focus is
directed to that hamburger menu right
and then you would think that since I
had this link down here the next time I
pressed tab my focus would travel down
there into the main content of the page
but what actually happens as we press
tab is that focus just seems to sort of
disappear right and I'm tabbing and I'm
tabbing and I'm tabbing and I'm not
really seeing anything until it
eventually arrives back in our main
content so what's going on there well if
you remember inside of that side nav we
had a whole bunch of anchor tags and and
a button other sort of focusable things
so focus isn't really disappearing it's
just moving off screen and focusing
other elements the problem with this is
if you're a keyboard user or someone who
relies on keyboard focus that can be a
pretty confusing experience especially
if there's you know a complex sidebar
with a number of interactive controls
off screen when all you want to do is
tab down and start interacting with the
main content it can be pretty
frustrating so there's no real easy way
to fix this problem we could set the
drawer to display:none but that will
actually cause our animations to jank
when we slide the drawer back in we
could try setting tabindex negative 1 on
all of the focusable children and that
would kind of work maybe or we could try
setting maybe pointer events none but
that's probably not going to affect our
keyboard behavior so basically we're
kind of missing
a core primitive in the platform some
way to take a tree of elements and make
all of them inert so they could still be
in the dom we can still animate them
really fast with transforms but they
wouldn't be keyboard focusable now
recently a group of folks have been
working on a sort of new part of the
HTML spec a new attribute called inert
and if we go over to github we can
actually see that there is this github
repo on the WICHE github org for this in
their attribute there's an explainer
written by my teammate Alice Boxhall
on why we need a nert and why it would
benefit developers who are trying to
roll accessibility into their apps and
most importantly there is this awesome
little polyfill that we can use to
actually start working with today in our
applications so that's what I'm going to
do here today I'm gonna add this inert
polyfill to our side map and see if we
can improve the focus experience so over
in github I'll just grab the raw GS
version of inert I'll switch over to my
code editor and I want to create a new
file for in there jeaious and I will
just drop that polyfill in there and
then over in my index file I've already
gone ahead and I've got the side nav
setup and everything so the first thing
I want to do is just add in the script
tag that includes inner jeaious so I'll
drop in an inert j/s as a script at the
bottom of the page and then we need to
have the side nav sort of self apply
it's inert state so if we go to our side
now j/s inside the constructor for this
element there's a bunch of things going
on here but basically it's just kind of
you know getting itself ready to be
interactive setting up handlers and
things like that so this seems like a
good place to go ahead and just say
alright when this thing first boots up
let's set its inert state to true so the
element is inert it's initially
off-screen the users not gonna be able
to tab to it or anything we go over to
our browser and refresh the page we
should see now that I can tab to that
first hamburger menu I tap again and my
focus moves right into the main content
area right to that click me link which
is what I'd expect now we need to
unearth this element when the drawer
slides out so going back to our code
editor
we'll drop down into some of these event
handlers we've got one here called show
side nav so if the side nav is showing
we do not want it to be in there so when
that gets set we'll just go ahead and
say this dot side nav l dot enter equals
false and the flip side to that when we
hide the side nav we'll set under back
to true pretty easy so far let's go
check that out in our application so
we'll refresh the page I can tab to the
hamburger menu I can tab down into the
main content area that looks like it's
working I can press ENTER to open the
drawer and I can tab through the
interactive elements inside the drawer I
close it again tab to the hamburger menu
and tab down into the main content area
so pretty easy we didn't have to do a
ton of work to add proper accessibility
to this side nav and the experience for
our keyboard users is just a lot better
now there's a bunch of other topics that
I haven't touched on today I haven't
really gone into the the core foundation
of how focus works and and how tabindex
works and all these other really cool
things I want to save those for some
future episodes but for now if this
seems interesting to you definitely be
sure to go check out that inner polyfill
you know go leave some some plus ones on
on the github there to encourage the
folks who are working on that and if you
have any questions about the stuff that
we showed in this episode of today you
can leave us some comments down below
I'll be happy to answer all those
questions as always thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
