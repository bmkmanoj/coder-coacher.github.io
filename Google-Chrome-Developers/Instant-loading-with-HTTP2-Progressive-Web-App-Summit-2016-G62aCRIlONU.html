be your on stage because a few days ago
it did look like I would be here I had
like this massively thoris throat and
didn't have any voice left which what
you kind of need when you want to be on
stage so I went to the doctor the next
day and he did the whole wooden spatula
flashlight thing looked and then he said
oh yeah I see it and I was like what and
then he grabbed a pair of pliers went
into my mouth and pulled out like an
inch of bamboo fiber is splintered I
apparently swallowed and it just lodged
in the back of my throat and five
minutes later everything was fine again
my throat was normal my voice was back
and I thought great then I flew here and
caught a cold on the flight
I guess that is bad luck also if you're
wondering if I story had anything to do
with my talk it absolutely didn't so my
name is Surma I work with the Google
Chrome team in London and I'm here to
talk to you about instant loading and
how hb2 ties into that whole story so
insert loading you probably know the
experience you have something on the
home screen of your phone you tap that
icon and you expect the app to be there
instantly to open up and to be all ready
for you to work with and that is
something that shouldn't have any white
screens or spinners ideally so you just
want to be the app the app should be
there right away for you to work with
and I need to talk about how we can
achieve that with your web apps and it's
actually pretty easy you take a service
worker you slammed onto your web app you
make a cache everything offline enjoy
your instantly loading app done end of
talk see you later
obviously my talk is supposed to be a
little bit longer so it was more of a
setup however that that advice is
technically correct you can't load much
faster than loading from local cache
with a serviceworker however how do you
get all your things into the cache that
the serviceworker uses and with the web
apps that involves the network because
you have to download them into the cache
and then you have new bottlenecks you
have the network and you have latency
and all these kind of things and what do
you do when some of the assets have to
be updated individually and this talk I
want to talk about these kind of
I will not even cover serviceworker
because there's so much that you can do
before serviceworker actually get into
the whole equation because on the first
load the serviceworker is not there and
on the first load that is your first
impression so you have to get that right
- so let's rewind rewind a bit yes we
want to achieve instant loading but that
includes the first load as well and with
the web and with the app with the web
that involves the network and
downloading with a DVD before the
serviceworker is there to a certain
degree all the optimizations that we're
going to talk about also benefit the
serviceworker because for loading from
cache is kind of similar and however the
impact will be a little bit smaller so I
will tell you sorry I'll focus on the
first load because that scenario is the
worst-case on the web you have nothing
there locally so you have to get
everything on the web if you have
something cached for that resource you
already removed one of the biggest
biggest bottlenecks that is the network
the overarching theme as you will
realize of this talk is cheap your
assets small if your markup is small it
will be it will go faster over the wire
the power has less to do and it will be
done sooner same goes for JavaScript
same goes for stylesheets so just keep
all your assets as small as possible
once we have that then we can actually
look at the remaining optimizations in
the instant loading problem space so to
speak and as I said I'm going to tackle
this entire thing without even talking
about serviceworker we're going to look
at the features of the web platform as
well as the HTTP protocol and if you
don't know about the edge of protocol
all too much good news is we just
launched a new your density cores today
and if you want to sign up for it just
go to the URL with is on the slide right
now you can sign up and we're going to
start from zero and check you all up to
the all modern things of LGBT - so let's
get back to the actual talk the SS what
actually are assets well actually
something like your index.html of the
images the style sheets the JavaScript
everything
it needs to be requested as a file is an
asset and if these assets are not
delivered fast your app won't be fast
because your app won't work without your
assets it can't operate without them and
there's a lot of opinion discussions out
there
what framework to use or what CSS
preprocessor is the right choice and
this is not what this talk is about
because whatever you choose whatever
framework you choose a preprocessor the
files still have to be delivered to the
user so get your infrastructure right
first and all the other choices can be
made after that you might be asking why
is instant loading important anyways and
gobber made a really interesting
observation here which talks about
conversion every step that you make a
user take before they get value out of
your app will make you lose 20% of your
users and loading it's definitely step
both for native and for web apps because
you're forcing your user to do nothing
to just sit there and wait and
installing is actually another step and
the web is great at that step because we
have no installed step you just open it
up and you're right there while a native
here mostly have to actually install the
app so if you do it right you can have
much more users on your web app than a
comparable native app and additionally
multiple companies in the e-commerce
sector have independently researched and
confirmed that a reduction in load time
also correlates to revenue so for
example amazon has famously stated an
increase of the loading time by just a
hundred milliseconds will cost them one
percent of the revenue and that really
makes you think about how much it is
worth to spend time on this but let's
get down to tech let's talk about how we
actually tune our asset delivery to the
max and there's all the facets that can
be tuned and it have varying degrees of
impact and require varying degrees of
commitment and investment by you so
let's start with something it has a very
high or at least medium impact and
requires almost no commitment at all and
that is compression if you take one
thing out of this talk
and able compression there's a lot of
sites out there that don't do it and it
is so easy to do you mostly need usually
one line in your bag and configuration
to enable it and your content doesn't
care the browser of a user can be very
old is so that so well supported your
logic doesn't care it is performance for
free it is practically money in the bank
and some people say they are concerned
about increasing their CPU load on the
back end and I think it is only
partially true because at least for
static content you can compress ahead of
time or Cashel a compress response so it
never have to compress again and if you
choose to enable compression just for
aesthetic assets for now it would still
be a big win for everybody involved and
when I say big win I actually may mean
60% to 80% data savings without you
putting in any actual effort the
compression ratio and you have to
realize that is actually both money safe
and traffic and speed gains and loading
time in general talking about this table
minification plus compression will give
you a little bit better results than
just compression alone if you look at
CSS files that will mostly have almost
the same size while the gap between
compression and minification plus
compression will be a little bigger when
you talk about javascript and that is
mostly due to the fact that javascript
tends to have comments in it which are
stripped away by modification but remain
there if you only compress one of the
main causes of slowness of the web today
is a network latency mostly we have
solid connections and rather predictable
speeds but the time it takes for a byte
to go from A to B and back varies widely
across the world and that has a huge
impact on how your web app performs
these round trips are deceptively
expensive even on a wired connection
when you're visiting a highly optimized
web site a round trip can cost you or
will cost you 20 to 50 milliseconds and
with HTTP that means when you send a
request
you can't use the connection for
anything else until the response has
been sent back so this is time spent
waiting doing nothing and then you have
to realize the average website nowadays
makes roughly a hundred requests so with
a little bit of back of the napkin math
it turns out that when you have 100
requests and at most six connections to
the same server that means that the
browser will spend at least 833
milliseconds waiting just because there
is a round-trip and that means that that
means that shaving off a single
millisecond off your round-trip time is
worth the effort because it has a huge
impact actually multiplies the impact of
the round-trip a lot and for example
redirects are something a counter very
often that mostly don't bring any value
to the user and can be easily avoided
most of the time which which for example
H STS is for that Emily just mentioned
and on the contrary redirects can
actually be even worse because they
usually mean not only another round trip
but also a new connection a new TLS
handshake and therefore I'm even more
expensive and just delay the user
getting to your site but so far we have
mostly talked about how we can make
things go faster over the wire and
that's good that it's really important
however our job as web developers is not
done when the data arrives on the user's
device we also have to structure our app
in a way that it loads fast and also
it's interactive as soon as possible and
interactive or visually complete is
something as you leave psychological
measurement and a screen with a few
empty boxes will be much more pacifying
to the user then a white screen and if
you have content above the fault
actually fully read that's even better
and that will influence the opinion of
you of the user about your app very
heavily and one thing you can do very
easily to increase the time to be visual
earlier is to delay your JavaScript
until the HTML has been parsed by
default without any attributes a script
we'll be blocking that means when the
HTML parser is going through your
document and it encounters a script tag
the HTML parser will pass until that
script has been executed if that script
is an external script that means that
the possible pass it will open up a new
connection it will possibly do Chile's
handshake it will request the file we
download the file parse the file execute
the file and then the HTML parser can
finally continue this is actually
something that will delay your render
quite significantly and with the async
keyword you can tell the browser that is
all right to keep parsing HTML while it
is preparing the Java Script to be
executable and will pause when it can
finally execute the fur on the other
hand is even stronger that means you are
fine with deferring the execution of the
jobs to the point when the HTML is done
and that means that you can be sure that
the Dom has been parsed has been put on
the screen and you have something visual
to keep the user busy while the Java
Script is spinning up and if you're like
me and you can't remember which one is
async and which one is differ just be
like me and put both because defer is
stronger than async and you should
always be doing before anyway so will be
and you will end up doing the right
thing can't go wrong
sadly link tags which we use to pull in
CSS don't have support for async or
defer so but just like JavaScript they
do block the power so we are kind of
screwed in that regard so what do we do
about CSS well there is this tiny piece
of code by the filament group that
allows you to dynamically load CSS and
that's a great tool however be careful
to not just slap it onto all of your
style sheets because you will end up
with flash of unstyled content because
now you have deferred everything your
HTML will be rendered without Styles on
the page and then all your cells come in
and we'll have like things moving around
and changing colors and it will be a
really really bad experience so we have
to find a good middle ground between
putting everything in the head and be
blocking and deferring everything and
have a flash of unstyled content and
good advice is here to use reasoning or
critical CSS
one practice is to inline the styles for
things that you consider critical and
defer everything else this also gives
you a chance to prioritize which style
sheets need to be loaded next and in
which order so you have more
controllable when bandwidth should be
allocated for what job regional CSS ties
into that that is the part of the CSS
that make elements assume the size that
they're gonna have once the entirely the
full styles have been loaded basically
that means that you won't have elements
jumping around on the page when the full
Styles come in because they have already
assumed their their final size you could
even go further and inline the styles
and Cheerilee for you above the contents
above the fold content to basically keep
these are busy while everything out of
screen is rendered later a good example
for reaching CSS is Paul Lewis s guitar
tuner app what you see on the left side
is the stars that have been in lines and
the mark up fret is really really small
in this therefore on screen very very
early and then the JavaScript is being
boosted in the background and when the
app is finally loaded it will look like
the image on the right but this is a
purely psychological trick but it makes
it goes such a long way on how the user
feels about this app because it feels
like it's there immediately even though
it is actually not another issue is I
friends iframes are a resource and that
means that a page is not allowed to fire
its load event until all the iframes are
completely loaded themselves and if the
eye frame contains iframes things get
even worse basically what I'm saying is
iframes make you lose control over your
pages load event that is bad because
most libraries and a lot of frameworks
actually use the loading what event to
know when to start working so what can
we do about this you want to fire you
want to have an event fire rather sooner
than later because you want your
framework to spin up so if you have
non-critical iframes I wrote these three
lines of JavaScript that basically say
put your source for the iframes in a
data
element and you can have this job we've
run after the load event that will move
the data source attribute to the source
attribute and then the item will start
loading and the load event has already
fired you have gained back control or
besides however keep in mind that these
iframes won't work if javascript is
disabled or doesn't run for some reason
so use it for non-critical iframes so as
I said conserving data is probably the
easiest way to make apps a lot fast if
your app doesn't need a lot of data to
get running it will be fast by very
definition and that's why a good caching
strategy will improve the loading times
even more and I know we have
serviceworker and but the serviceworker
you can do arbitrarily complex offline
strategies and caching stories and
whatever however service workers the
foundation of serviceworker is
progressive enhancement and that means
that your app should also work when the
browser doesn't support serviceworker
and ideally it should even perform when
there is no serviceworker and so I think
this is a good time to look at what a
HTTP the protocol actually offers in
terms of good caching most HTTP
responses contain both a last modified
and an e-tag header the last modified
Harris s well when the document was last
modified and the e-tag header actually
contains a unique value that is solely
based on the contents of the file
most server implementations actually use
a checksum like sha-1 that is solely
based on the color of the file and will
only change if the contents change and
both these headers can be used to avoid
read a loading a file if there is
already a cached version locally
available if the browser has a version
locally available it can add any of
these two headers to the request
basically telling the server which
version it has available the browser can
check and the server can check if the
document has changed ever since and if
not it can respond with a status code
304 that means not modified basically
telling the browser to use the locally
cached version available and what we've
just did we basically saved the user
from free downloading files that they
already had and that is really important
as you can see an example action
specifying both headers is allowed and
etags will take precedence over date
based headers ask they're considered
more robust however it is still a
request and response is an entire round
time trip so there's still enough time
being wasted here and this is where
actual HTTP caching comes in caching
tells the browser how long it is allowed
to consider this version of the document
fresh and to deliver it straight from
cache without even checking with the
server expires is the older HTTP 1.0
header for caching and cache control is
the newer HTTP 1.1 version for cache
control cache control is much more
powerful and complex it supports
multiple variants of different cache
types like public and private and you
can get very granular control it
actually has its own domain-specific
language kind of so a little bit
overwhelming but most of the time it
should be fine with what you see on the
screen right now public and the max age
which is the number of seconds until
this document expires and the next
question
almost immediately comes so what I'll go
to values should I cash my JavaScript
for ten minutes and images for an hour
or a week and I think Jake has a really
good answer here because he said with
interdependent resources which
JavaScript and CSS mostly are the only
sensible HTTP caching options are must
revalidate or a year's worth of max-age
so what does it mean this means that
something like your index.html should
never be cached it should always be
revalidated with a server as we saw
before with one of these if modified
headers something like web fonts should
probably be cached with years was worth
of Mac's edge because they will never
really change and now we are still at
the point that every resource would be
revalidated with a server which is not
really what we want and this is where a
trick comes in where we incorporate the
hash of the file into the file name and
crank up the caching time to a couple of
years because the index.htm hTML is your
entry point
it will pull in all the resources with
its file name and that means whenever a
file change changes the file name
changes now and the index.html will pull
all in this resource and the reasons
that haven't changed we'll still be in
cash and can load much faster from the
local cache there's actually a golf
plugin that does this for you it
basically goes to your files and renames
them at the cache at the the hash to the
file name and gives you a translation
manifest that can be consumed by
additional plugins that you can find in
the readme office plugin of the scale
plugin to rewrite your HTML files or
your JavaScript files to use the hashed
version of these files and now let's get
to the Highland let's talk about HTTP to
HTTPS as the name suggests the successor
of hd1 and a gt2 was based on speedy and
experiment by the chrome engineers and
this picture has been passed around a
lot on Twitter saying the picture says
more than a thousand words I personally
think that picture only says more if you
already know what hb2 is about so I will
give you a very quick overview on hb2
the biggest improvements is probably
that instead of using six connections
HTTP 2 only uses one connection and that
sounds very bad at first but let me
explain basically what used to be a
connection and HTTP 1 is now considered
as stream in HB 2 and all streams share
that single connection the stream is
broken up into frames and when a stream
is done putting its frame onto the
connection it because it's blocked or it
has to wait or it is just done then
another stream can take over so this one
connection will always be fully utilized
the problem that we had before where you
sent out a request and have to wait
until the response came back as head of
called head of line blocking because one
request blocks the head of a line of the
rest of the requests that are waiting
for being sent so yeah as I said most
streams can be the streams can utilize
the connection very well
and that alone is a huge improvement
when you have a lot of small assets and
therefore a lot of requests a g1 becomes
unbarring ly slow which is why
concatenation and spriting is a thing
right now you pack up multiple assets
into one big asset which you can get
through a single request and unpack them
on the client side because that is more
efficient in HD 1 so I made this website
where I sped up an image into multiple
tiles basically artificially blowing up
the number of requests I need to show
these this tile image I just included it
with simple image tags and then loaded
this website over 81 in HB 2 I'll let
you guess which one is which everyone
else had earlier heavily implies
multiplies the impact of the round time
trip while HB 2 does not this is an
emulated 3G connection and even then hv2
seems to load instantaneously the second
big improvement of HB 2 is that we have
frames and these frames are used to
distinguish between header data and
actual payload data that is really
important for us because amongst other
things we can now finally compress
Harris in h1 if you enable compression
only the payload will be compressed the
actual body in HB 2 we can now compress
headers and actually the engineers went
a step further and came up with their
very own compression specifically
crafted for HB 2 the compression works
on a per connection basis means that all
the streams share the compressor and
that is really really handy because that
means if the compressor realizes it has
sent a header before it will not resend
the header but just says same header as
before so some centers have never
changed like host or accepts or cookies
will not get resent and that will save a
lot of bytes and not just bytes for most
web sites will save hundreds of
kilobytes on average but most
importantly in case you're scared a GB
to is backwards compatible to HB 1 that
means if the browser doesn't support HB
2 which it really there should be no
browsers out there really at this point
it can fall back to 81 and the semantics
stay exactly the same - you still have
request/response you still have a hetero
section and the data section you still
have the same methods of the same verbs
the bottom line is just by switching to
HTTP - right now you can reap most of
the performance benefits without doing
anything
however there's additional features in A
to B to like push that do require you to
do a little bit work on the backend but
might very well be worth it pushes the
technology in HB - that allows you to
respond to a request that hasn't even
been sent yet and what I mean is I guess
the best example is just your index.html
somebody requests your index.html you'll
respond to it but you know that in 99%
of the time they also want the main
stylesheet and your jobs good to just
send that along with it and the browser
will already have it in its local cache
when it realizes that it now needs those
files you basically reduce the round
trend trip to zero milliseconds which is
amazing of course pushing everything is
also not the optimum for the best
possible performance or the best portal
experience for the user and since
browser now actually have good support
for push we thought it's a good time to
look at how to use it right and the
polymer team actually came up with the
pattern that is called PRP l it is an
acronym because you a more acronyms that
allows you to that guides you towards
being interactive as soon as possible
but the first step is pushing the
resource that you need for first render
pushing or use inlining when you don't
want to use or where you can't use HP -
you have at all in the first request so
they can get on the screen as fast as
possible with a response to the first
request and you have the first two steps
already done the next step is pre
loading the things that are very likely
for the user to do next so for example
if you know it is very likely for
Madeira to open up the sidebar load the
Java and the styles for the sidebar and
have those ready for when the user
actually starts interacting with the
page or if a navigation is most likely
note the next view or the next route
whatever is appropriate in the context
of GAAP and everything else should be
lazy loaded on demands there's a talk to
talk by Kevin share from the polymer
team from I own a link to at the bottom
which goes into more detail on the whole
topic if you want to play around with HP
locally I wrote a tiny tool which is
just like pythons simple HD server but
you know uses hb2 and also has support
for push I wrote it and go
so there's binaries for Mac OS Windows
and Linux alike in the release section
this tool also takes care of generating
a certificate for you because for hb2
you always need a TLS certificate but it
is taken care of in this tool for you
and all the details you need are in the
readme in the repository so go there if
you want to play around with it
and this is all I have for you today
here's a little bit of a summary that of
the things we talked about it was quite
a lot if you have questions about this
or you want to know more details I'll
probably be in the collab area today or
be at the office hours tomorrow and next
up we have Owen who is going to talk
about you about push thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
