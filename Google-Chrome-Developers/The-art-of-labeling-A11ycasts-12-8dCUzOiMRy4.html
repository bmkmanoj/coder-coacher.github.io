back to the alley cash show so today
we're going to be talking about the
importance that labeling can play in
your applications now if you if you
follow the web content accessibility
guidelines which is really a set of
criteria for making sure that your app
is accessible the very first thing
you'll see in their guidelines in
section 1.1 is that you need to provide
text alternatives for you know controls
and images and things like that in your
page so looking at section 1.1 not well
we can see that if non-text content is a
control or except user input and it has
to have a name that describes its
purpose and you'll see you know mention
of things needing names and we tag
guidelines in a lot of different places
it can be able to confusing when you're
reading these guidelines to it to sort
of understand what they mean by that
right because I thought we're talking
about labeling but it's saying names the
term itself name is a bit overloaded in
some of the accessibility specs you'll
also see sometimes it's referred to as
like text alternatives and things like
that but really what we're talking about
here is for any sort of you know control
or image on your site it's going to have
a few different attributes to it it's
going to have a name or or label we
often use those interchangeably can also
have a role so you know it's going to be
a role button or a role of a checkbox or
something like that
I can also sometimes have a state right
so like a button could be disabled or
not so today we're going to specifically
talk about you know the name or the
label of controls and really why it's
important how you can label elements
differently or the different techniques
you can use in your application so if
all the way over here to jf bin I'm
going to walk through just like a few
examples the first is we're going to
start with a very simple button right
just a very simple button element and
one of the things that I want to show
off is how to use the new experimental
chrome accessibility dev tools to
actually figure out what the the name
and the label for your controls is so
I've shown this off maybe a few times
but I realized I actually probably
didn't do a good job of teaching folks
how to turn these dev tools on so the
way you do that each should go to Chrome
colon flash flash flags and this will
open a bunch of features that you can
turn on in your browser these are all
often
experimental things you got to be
careful about just like flipping stuff
on but think we're going to look for
here is will look for the word dev tools
there's a line here that says enable dev
tools experiments right here
well quickly an able button and then
down at the bottom of the screen will
have this prompt to tell me to relaunch
I'm going to relaunch everything ok wait
for Chrome to restart and once it comes
back online we now know that our our dev
tools are all ready to start working
with so I'll go over to jsbin where I've
been working on a little button example
open my dev tools using command option J
on my Mac and then I'm going to click
the little context menu over here on the
right hand side it's like three dot
thing go to settings and we should now
have this experiments tab in our dev
tools I'm going to click on this what
would be option to turn on accessibility
in section and then I just need to close
my dev tools and open them again and now
we're actually able to use these cool
new accessibility dev tools so for
instance I can go over and I can inspect
this button and looking in the elements
panel let's see over here where you got
the sort of like a style tab and things
like that go over a little bit more will
see that we have this new accessibility
option and we'll send a little bit so
it's good easier to read here less
actually will dock the dev tools to the
bottom of the screen so we can have a
little bit more real estate mmm
scoop this up alright we were
accessibility boom okay so now we see
all sorts of cool accessibility related
information for this button element you
can see right here there's a name field
where it says add to cart' right and
that's the exact text that we've placed
inside of that button I'll zoom that in
a little bit more so you can see the
button up there at the top of the screen
as well so how is this name being
applied to this button where does it
actually get that value from well if you
look at the dev tools you can see
there's a few different ways that a name
can be calculated if the element has a
title right now it says it's not
specified for some elements it can
actually take the content of the element
so since we actually put some text
inside of our button right here right
it's actually using that content to
provide the name
for the element but there's other
options as well right so to be from
label can be Aria label and Aria labeled
by as well and I'll talk about those in
just a little bit right but so this is
sort of like the the basics of how we
get a name for an element and we can
assert that things are you know working
as we expect by turning on a screen
reader and I'll move this box appear so
you can kind of see what voiceover is
saying turn on volume inside of the
frame to watch magic our button
voiceover all right so you can see that
the screen reader announces the name of
the control when it lands on it so it
should add to cart' and it announces the
role button right now for some elements
something like a checkbox for instance
you usually don't have utility like put
text inside of the tag so it can't
generate a name from its content so to
another example here we'll do input type
equals checkbox we'll get rid of that
add card button the input type equals
checkbox maybe we'll mark it as checked
already
right so you can see this this little
guy over here is checked you know what
you might do sometimes you might just
say okay cool well I'll say like sign up
for our newsletter right so a sighted
user is going to be able to see that
text on-screen and they'll know that
okay that that text is associated with
that checkbox right there right next to
each other but if we inspect the
checkbox we can see that it actually
does not have any sort of like computed
name right now so the problem here is if
I'm using a screen reader and I just
land on this check box all it's going to
do is say you know a check box
I'm not actually going to tell me
anything else about it so how do I give
this element and name well the way we do
that with a lot of the built-in controls
is we use the native legal element so if
I just wrap this in put in a label tag
and put that text inside of there so
I've got both the input and the text
that's labeling it inside of this label
tag and now if I go and I inspect the
input element and we look at our dev
tool we can see that its name is now set
to sign up for our newsletter because it
got that from that label element another
technique that you can use if for
instance maybe like wrapping some
the label doesn't quite work for your
needs is you can give the elements and
ID so then give this input an ID I'll
just call it check something like that
and I can give my label and I are sorry
I can give my label a four attribute and
I can associate it with the ID of that
element so I'll say my label is for that
check element right so I'm matching it
to its ID I'm matching its ID reference
and now if I go and inspect these things
we'll see that we still get that name
and one thing you might note is in the
accessibility dev tools right now it
says from label for label undefined so
it's a little bit of a bug in this dev
tool again these are still experimental
so you might uncover bugs from time to
time but when that bug expects we'll
probably look something like label four
and I'll you know specify this label
element right here tell us that's the
label that is providing the name for our
element okay cool so so that works for
native controls you know button input
select things like that right you can
use the label element on those but there
are instances where the label element
itself doesn't quite work for your needs
either so I'll give you another example
here let's say we're making a button and
I've already written some CSS or this
button and it's going to be one of those
sort of classic hamburger menu buttons
I'm sure you've seen these on responsive
websites before right so usually when
when you're using a hamburger menu
button you don't put any text on-screen
near it now you can you could write the
word menu underneath and you could use
that to label the element which would be
cool but you know some designs folks
don't do that so how do I give this
button some sort of you know a name how
do I give it some sort of a label so one
technique that we can use to do that is
we can use the Aria label attribute Aria
label attribute is basically going to
provide a name for the element and if
that element already had like text
content or something like that like a
like actual button element the Aria
label element is going to trump that
text content and that will be the only
text that is used what is inside the
Aria label so in this case for this menu
button I'm going to give it Aria label
equals we'll just say menu right and
how we going spec this element using our
dev tools we can see that the name for
the element menu and we can see that
that value is coming off of that
aria-label attribute and even sites that
we've got some re attributes here right
cool so that is another technique that
you can use you know if you need to
label something but you don't have the
ability to put on-screen text on the
page this is a very very handy technique
again if you are building any sort of
site for furs or any sort of site in
general but you want your screen reader
users to be able to use so it's like
take out the controls that have non
visual labeling this was a very helpful
technique the last thing I want to talk
about is how you can associate other
elements as your label for things like
custom controls so let's say I'm
building a a really really fancy custom
widget maybe a custom checkbox or a
custom drop-down menu something that
doesn't have a native analog in the
browser I can use another attribute
called Aria labeled by to associate a
label with that element the reason why I
want to use Aria labeled by is because
the native label tag only works with a
few sort of like select built-in
elements so it works for button input
and select but if I'm making custom
controls and things like that's
unfortunately the label element is not
able to provide those I wants a label so
what I'm going to have to do is use the
Aria label by attribute so let me walk
you through an example of that let's see
I've already written some CSS for a
custom button now if you watch the
previous episode maybe we can include a
link like over here or something like
that you never ever ever want to make a
div button now I'm going to do it for
this case just to demonstrate a scenario
we're just using the label tag is not
going to work for an element so I'm
gonna give I'll say class equals button
and we'll say shop now okay so I'm
making a button that lets so shop for
some stuff right
we're gonna role equals button right so
that'll identify this elements role
we're giving a tam index of zero so it's
focusable right that's important cool so
if we go and we look at this element in
our dev tools it says this thing is
really cool button itself has a label of
shop now right because it's pulling it
out of its text content and that's
that's useful but maybe we have a bunch
of shopping app buttons on the page
maybe we have a bunch of different
sections where someone can shop for some
stuff so let's say this one in
particular is under like men's shirts so
some of it land on this button and say
shop now but it doesn't really tell them
what they're shopping now for I want a
way to associate men's shirts with this
shop now button and I can do that using
Aria labeled by so the same way that we
did things with with the the four
attribute and label element we're going
to give this heading an ID an ID of
men's shirts okay and then we're going
to associate that with this custom
control will say Aria labeled by which I
always misspelled equals men's shirts
okay so open that up look at it in the
dev tools look at our accessibility tab
here and we will see now that the name
for the filament is men's shirts ok well
that's kind of what we wanted but we've
lost the other bit where it says shop
now we kind of have to add that back in
and so this is where we see actually one
of the really cool features already
labeled by which is that it can compose
labels together by referencing different
elements in fact the element that's you
know containing the Aria label by
attribute can even self reference you
know its itself and use that to compose
a better label so let's give that
element an ID as well so we'll take our
our div button here I'll say men's
shirts button
I'll say are you label by men's shirts
men's shirts button right and now we go
back we inspect this control
let me look at the accessibility and
we'll see that now the screen reader
lines on the elements when you say men's
shirts shop now button you can verify
that using a voiceover voiceover on tral
check men shirt shop now button
voiceover off right on that's really
nice and we also see down here in the
dev tools we get references to the
elements that are the ID for the
references that are being used for
aria-label by which is really really
helpful so that about covers the the
basics of labeling if you have a site
today
you maybe you haven't gone through with
a screen reader just yet maybe give that
a shot if you got some controls that
perhaps they're just announcing the role
but not announcing the Associated label
and consider using some of these
techniques to make sure that those
elements have a proper label proper name
right if you have any more questions for
me you can always leave them down in the

network of your choosing and as always
