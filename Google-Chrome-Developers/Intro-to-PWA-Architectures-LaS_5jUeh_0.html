dinosaur we talk about caching and the
serviceworker which can enable your app
to work offline but we haven't talked
about what to do with slow or unreliable
networks we also need to think about
performance and make sure your app
remains fast to load under all
conditions building a PWA does not mean
starting from scratch you can implement
the steps progressively first you need
to secure your connection service
workers require HTTPS to keep malicious
scripts out however given the importance
of security and privacy you should be
using HTTPS anyway then you can cache
your site's static assets using the
serviceworker and cache API s this can
improve the performance of your app and
enable offline experiences the next step
is to migrate to an app shell an app
shell separates dynamic content from the
logic used to render it if you're
building a modern single page app then
you're probably using something similar
to an app shell already using an app
shell is the recommended approach to
migrate existing apps and structure your
PWA this architecture provides
connectivity resilience and it is what
makes a PWA feel like a native app to
the user giving it application like
interaction and navigation and reliable
performance once you have an app shell
adding a manifest file and meta tags
enables add to homescreen adding an icon
to the home screen makes it easier for
users to return to your web experience
finally you can enhance your app with
features such as push notifications
integrated payments and automated login
these are built on the same underlying
framework that enables pwace here's an
example app shell the two screens on the
Left live in the app shell and contain
all the common navigation parts the
screen on the right shows the content
which has been loaded from the network
displayed in the app shell Netflix looks
familiar it's essentially a single page
app
the serviceworker can cache this locally
to make it available offline then as the
user navigates around the app the shell
loads the content the app shell plus
dynamic content model keeps your UA
local and pulls in content dynamically
this greatly improves app performance
and works really well with serviceworker
caching as a progressive enhancement
it's the secret to reliably good
performance let's talk about the first
step after enabling HTTP adding caching
to your app how you cache the app will
depend on whether you're rendering it on
the server or using a single page app
that renders on the client server-side
rendering is a familiar technique used
by many developers where the server
builds the whole page this includes
content driven sites using a CMS this is
a difficult scenario to make work
efficiently offline since the server
returns the whole page client-side
rendering is also a familiar technique
normally written as a single page app
and in this case the server has a static
page with the content template and the
client-side code JavaScript running on
the client makes requests to get data
and display it on the page and this can
be a good fit to the app shell model the
app shell also separate content from
presentation though you may need
additional code to cache data for
offline use caching server rendered apps
is simple cache the static parts that
you can that normally include your CSS
files JavaScript frameworks and some
images if your server is rendering a
small number of unchanging pages you
could cache them though any forms will
need logic to detect if the app is
offline and disabled reformed you can
detect if the browser is on or offline
by checking the Navigator offline
property and you can also listen to
online and offline events on the
navigator in any case you should check
your network request for errors and fail
gracefully this will handle both offline
access and unreliable networks caching
client rendered apps is also fairly
simple single page apps have a core that
always lives on the client so cache
that but they also depend on dynamic
data so you need to add code to handle
that we'll talk about this again after
you've seen indexdb but the general idea
is that things with a URL go into cache
and non URL data goes in the database
one nice feature is to detect when the
app is offline and remember user actions
for example you could let the user build
a shopping cart while offline and send
it when they're online we talked about
porting your existing app to include
caching now that gets you most of the
way there but we also need to think
about some techniques for fine-tuning
the user experience users will expect
your PWA to act like a native app so we
have to take some pains to get things
right many initial efforts to build a
progressive web app always retrieve
files from the network or from the cache
but we can use combinations of the cache
and the network to improve your app in a
cache first strategy the serviceworker
looks refil in the cache and uses the
network as that fails server rendered
apps might use this if they are also
caching rendered pages and the app sees
a new URL on the other hand a network
first strategy tries to get the file
from the network and uses the cache if
that fails use this strategy when you
need the latest content such as stock
prices or the weather but are willing to
fall back on a cache when offline in
some cases you may want to ask the cache
and the network at the same time in most
cases the cached data loads first and
that is returned directly to the page
meanwhile the network responds updates
the previously cached entry and this is
useful for assets that change
infrequently but that you want to keep
up-to-date such as user icons the next
time the user loads the page they'll see
the updated asset the good news is that
we provide the code for these caching
strategies these libraries automate many
of the details for you while also
following best practices and avoiding
common gotchas sw-toolbox is an open
source library on github that builds on
top of serviceworker cache and fetch it
implements each of the strategies we
discussed and make
easy to integrate into your app
sw-precache libraries is an open-source
tool also on github that can generate a
serviceworker script for you you can
call it from the command line or
integrate it into your build process you
can also use these tools to simplify
your implementation they support all of
the standard caching strategies or you
can add your own and include control
over options such as maximum cache size
and item lifetimes I highly recommend
you take a look at them
even if you want to build your own
solution now that you have an app shell
in the cache let's see about adding
other PWA features since your PWA
behaves like a native app the user will
want to add it to their home screen each
of the major browsers does this a little
differently so you'll need to add both a
manifest file and meta tags to enable
add the home screen you might also add
push notification support we'll go into
the details in a later module but at a
high level the service worker receives
push message events displays
notifications and responds to user
actions on the notification progressive
web apps can also simplify ecommerce
instead of filling in a form with
payment and address details the browser
pops up a simple UI for choosing these
and then create a secure transaction for
the merchant server the credential
management API can securely remember the
login details for a site and provide a
one tap login both of these depend on
the user being authenticated to device
either by password or biometric we
should take a moment to talk about
performance caching can speed up your
application but don't depend on caching
alone for speed users with browsers that
don't support serviceworker or users who
are seeing your app for the first time
can suffer slow downloads if you're not
careful
remember caching can only improve
performance on subsequent page load all
in all we recommend four possible
approaches now the best option is a
combination of server-side and
client-side rendering your server can
draw the first page quickly and then
JavaScript takes over and renders future
pages using dynamic data this also works
for users
with browsers that don't support
serviceworker the next best option is a
pure app shell single page app approach
you should cache the app shell and you
can speed this up using HTTP streams to
begin rendering content as it comes in
option 3 is to use server-side rendering
and cache everything that you can
finally we come to the single page app
that renders all its own content now you
might be surprised this is at the bottom
of the list but it's often slower to the
first render than server rendered apps
that's due to the time it takes to load
the JavaScript before rendering begins
the difference between this app and the
app shell is that the app shell can
render at least and navigation instantly
and also often contains default content
before I go I want to emphasize two
things first now this is our recommended
approach but there may be use cases for
each pattern pwace can be built with any
mixture of server-side rendering and
client-side rendering that best fits
your needs
second the textbook that accompanies
this video has a detailed chapter on PWA
architectures with updated advice if you
want to see some real-world examples we
have a list in the slide deck and these
are just a handful of businesses reaping
the benefits of progressive web apps CPW
a rocks for a great showcase of
businesses using PWA technologies to
enhance their mobile web experience
there are loads of resources available
where you can learn more you can access
these from the materials that accompany
