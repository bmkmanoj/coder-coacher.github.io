probably got to the point where I had
styled things up yes that's where I've
got to and since then it's been a lot of
plumbing work if you like just to do
things like offline but I will come back
to that in probably the next entry in
this century what I want to talk about
is a relatively straightforward thing
which is lazy loading of images so I say
straightforward I mean straightforward
in the sense that it's it's not an
out-there concept I think many of us
kind of realize that we probably want to
differ loading of some stuff and many of
us would probably do it on something
like a school basis and possibly even
have a scroll handler to do that kind of
stuff well well I've done it but I've
done it without scroll handling I've
used an intersection observer so I
thought I'd show you that little bit of
code today and you can just have like a
look I mean as I said that I said you
could have a look and then I just said
it twice what an idiot anyway let's have
a look at what it is if you look at
what's on my screen you'll see that I've
got the site up and I've got the network
tab open and it's recording so that's
the network a bit there and it's
recording and when I scroll down here
ready study these two posted images here
for these two episodes they lazy load on
the fly based on the scroll position
where so the scroll is based on
intersecting with the viewport so let's
have a quick look at what the code looks
like for that I have myself a lazy load
images class and I do a quick check to
see where the intersection observer is
supported because you'll see what
happens here is I basically early on I
look for anything which has this just
lazy image class on it and if it does
then I set things up to go but if I if
we don't have support for an
intersection observer I just kind of
fall back to what I think most of us
would do today which is just go well
look I can't do an intersection observer
I'm just going to load everything and
that's that's okay when this is a
progressive and handsome of this is some
we can use to improve our experiences
and you might say I'm not going to load
images immediately what I'm actually
going to do is I'm going to fall back to
a scroll handler based one you might
choose to do that I would suggest
typically you want to avoid anything
that's coupled to the scroll handling
just because it's typically the case
that our scrolls and animation and it's
very framerate sensitive and so you
probably want to be careful about doing
something that has to fire on a scroll
handle scroll humbling anyway not always
standing I've decided that if we don't
have an intersection observer we're not
doing anything but what do we do when
we've got an intersection observer
available too as well we create one of
these and we have it observe all of the
images which have the J's lazy image
class on it so if they don't have that
class on or not bothered if we do then
we we we observe them and what do we
observe well we have a threshold which
is how much they have to intersect by
default it's going to intersect with the
viewport and I have a 50 pixel margin so
when you imagine a viewport and then add
50 pixels either side that's the that so
that's the area of interest if you like
and I'm asking when does an image
intersect let me know if an image
intersects at that viewport plus 50
pixels on either side and there's a
threshold that I need to know so what it
does is if you imagine the image being
completely inside the viewport that
would have a value of 1 if it's
completely outside is 0 and then as it
passes it's going to go between 0 and 1
and so there's a threshold so you've
passed that threshold I need to know
about the intersection and that's that's
a hard way to hard-coded value which is
not pointing or 1 so it's it's what 1% I
guess of overlap between those two areas
so what happens when we do actually see
that where you can see I have this
stopped on intersection as you can see
here which is called and we get because
it's an observer we get an array of
entries because it's possible that with
an observer you're going to get a
backlog of entries because things could
go in and out by the time you
to get to them you need to you know you
muted maybe sort them by date actually I
don't know if they are already sorted I
should figure that out in any case with
this something like this it's it's not
too bad I just need to know whether or
not they've actually intersected with a
viewport and if they have I'm fine with
just going ahead you might need to do
something a bit more nuanced than your
intersection observer callback where you
say well actually you know is it you
know it is it the most recent record and
all these kind of things that you can
you see hopefully that you could do some
further work on those records right if I
decide or if I find that in my entry
that the intersection ratio is less than
zero as in its it's no longer
intersecting or whatever don't worry
about it forget about it don't need to
know about it if I have already tagged
the image that is now intersecting if
I've tagged it with my handled plus so
that's what I do
I tagged something so if something goes
in out and then back in again I don't
need to know about it the second time so
the first time it comes in and the first
time I see an image intersecting with my
viewport I can't get with this class and
so right you're done and if I see that
that handles plusses on then I return
and then the last thing I actually do is
preload the image so I'm going to put
this we what I do is I actually set a
background image and I fade it in that's
just the way I'm choosing to do this
particular concept it means that I can
have like a placeholder with a little
icon so if it takes a long while to load
the image then we sort of we can just
put something up on screen and fade it
in so i preload the image here which I
have a thing that goes off makes a new
image set the source and then does an
onload and then resolve the promise
which you can find inside the utils
right let me show you it since we're
here preload image there we are making
your image set the source and then I
just use resolving rejects as the
handlers for unloading on error so when
the image is actually being preloaded we
apply it so we find the element that we
were talking about which is image and
find the actual a sub-element child of
that which is as the class of just
the image content so you see I have J
laser image and genitally laser image
content of my two classes if I can't
find it don't worry about it if I can I
set the background image and then I add
this fade in which is an animation that
fades the opacity from 0 to 1 so the
idea of pre loading the image is to make
sure that because it's a background
image here's the thing because it's a
background image there's no guarantee
that if I just set the background image
and they started fading in that the
image wouldn't be sort of part loaded
during the fading you kind of get that
bizarre it's fading but it's also
loading at the same time fail so I
preload it which is make sure it's
definitely in the cache and we talked
previously about my caching headers so
the image should come with good caching
headers preload it get it make sure it's
here and then we can sit background
image so when we set the background
image it goes oh I better go and get
that image and it goes old it's already
there in the cache let me just use that
and it means that we don't get that
partly downloaded kind of feel with our
images and that's it
so using intersection observer it's a
nice progressive enhancement move I'm
enjoying it it does the job perfectly if
we don't you know if we have a long page
with a lot of content in and somebody
doesn't scroll down why bother loading
those images no need so it's got a lot
of code is it 115 or so lines of code to
stand all that winning so there you go
next time I'm going to have a chat with
you about what I've been doing in the
world of offline and prefetching video
and all my goodness have that being a
journey anyway don't forget you can
subscribe don't forget you can drop your
comments and your questions in below and
I will catch you next time
Allen thanks for watching if you enjoyed
