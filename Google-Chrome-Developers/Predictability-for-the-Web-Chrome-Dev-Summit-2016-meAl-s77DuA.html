presentation about predictability but
first things first we are Rick and Rob
which kind of sounds like two cops on
stakeout you know just just go with it
and since I got the opportunity to put
together this slide I got to pick which
picture to use of Rick this was the best
picture that can fight of Rick thanks a
lot this is Rick hi I'm Rick I I lead a
team of software engineers working on
the web platform and my name is Robert
and I work with developer relations
around feedback and community and then
much more this is the worst picture of
me available on the internet don't check
and the things that we're going to talk
about today is what is predictability
you've heard many interesting talks
today about new features and all the
progressions are happening on the web
but what we believe we're covering today
in this talk is the most important thing
and that's having a reliable platform
for developers if we don't have that we
don't have anything and web browsers
love the web right well so-and-so right
there are still a number of issues and
challenges that developers come across
so we want to be honest about this um
this is like an uplifting talk at the
end of the day we want to be honest
about this the web does have a problem
working cross browser has historically
been really really hard it still has a
number of challenges and also with
inconsistencies between different
browsers in tropical interoperability
between different platforms and devices
and all that so we want to make it
better for you so we have one joint web
platform so that's why we started the
predictability project about six months
ago and maybe you've been working with
square wheels so far but we see this as
our responsibility to make sure this is
actually good for you and expect that
you could spend the time on the right
areas
and we put our most neutral people
working on that so i'm swedish rick is
Canadian so basically you can complain a
lot to us and we're gonna say we're
sorry to see the theme here and actually
thinking about the team we have a number
of more sweets and Canadians on it this
is not a coincidence and the main areas
you want to go through today is how
chrome is trying to improve readability
for developers all the work we're doing
to make things better and well more
predictable also how we work with other
web browsers to make sure it works the
same way across the board this is not
just about us this is about the web and
how we do things together having
browsers fight against each other's it's
just a weight of waste of time the
important thing is the web and finally
it's about how web developers how you
can help improve the platform as well
basically we want to web to just work
for developers that's it and it's it
shouldn't be that hard but there are
some challenges around that so there are
five main areas where we want to address
this first we want to make sure that you
fight the platform less ah you know less
need for browser specific code pass
making sure you don't have to have too
many workarounds for regressions
basically things that used to work and
then three months later it just stops
working you have no idea what happened
also trying to get away diminish or even
just completely get rid of all kinds of
polyfills and shims and all that just to
cover up for interval t that's not the
way it should be we also want to make
sure sure that we don't ship any
accidental regressions and when we
deprecate features we really want to
understand that we do know when what
we're doing and what the cost is for you
how will this affect you not just like
yeah I never like to set the eye so we
want to sure to actually know what's
gonna happen we also want to be way way
more open about interventions and the
rick is going to cover in front is more
later in his part but basically giving
you options to
well solve issues when that happens but
to be honest things do fail fast in the
world and when it does fail to ensure it
is both fast and obvious to you so it's
not just a complete surprise every time
you have no idea what happens it's also
about having quantified data and sorry
analysis to make sure that we know that
when we cancel different features we
have the numbers to back it up how is
this actually gonna affect developers
and finally just giving you a more
coherent platform making sure that the
most commonly useful features work
really well together like we want you to
feel dispassion right look in their eyes
they love the web slice is scary but
still love okay and you know we're in
the web might have been hard history you
might still have some issues but you
know moving forward we want you to look
back you know when it was hard and just
you know laughs it off you're just gonna
be happy because working with the web is
gonna be a breeze that's where we're
going and to go more into detail about
that we have the amazing Rick thanks so
hopefully that gives you a rough idea of
what our vision is for predictability
and it's a big dream we've got a lot of
work to get there but I want to get a
bit more concrete for a minute it's
always been part of chromes mission as
you heard Darren say this morning it's
always been part of chromes mission to
make the whole web better not the web
shouldn't be just a collection of
browsers that kind of behaves similarly
but we really realized over the past
year that we've got more to do here in
fact a first and foremost we need to
collaborate better with other browser
vendors in fact part of the reason this
project exists is because we were really
inspired seeing how hard Mozilla and
Microsoft were working to make their
browsers just work for the websites that
you of all have already built rather
than trying to get you to change your
websites to make them work on their
browsers and even when that required
copying like some buggy non-standard
stuff from WebKit in chrome it sucks
that they had to do that but it was
inspiring and it made this morning
invest more in this space
and so there's all sorts of ways that
we've been working better over the past
year as as a community as a browser
vendor community I'm not going to go
into all the details here it's probably
kind of boring for you obviously and
herbs are obviously a huge part of this
we invest a lot in the standards process
we care a lot about standards but it's
even the day-to-day of how we do I've
developed how we do browser development
has really changed we're constantly
filing bugs and each other's bug
trackers we're constantly like
collaborating on shared test Suites it's
it's a it's a very very different than
it was a few years ago but I don't think
that's too relevant to this audience I
think probably the area you care more
about is it's really important that we
do a better job of listening to you and
honestly this is why I'm here I'm hoping
this will be the start of a conversation
hopefully we'll grab me afterwards and
complain what's bothering you about the
web what makes the web hard for you and
this is important because i think the
web is unique in that it's it's the
comments we all own it collectively no
one controls it it's really a
marketplace of shared ideas that compete
against each other and in that kind of
environment it's essential that the
different players in that ecosystem are
talking with each other and understand
each other all right so typically the
best way for you to tell us that we're
doing something bad is to file bugs
against us for those of you who don't
know blink is the engine the web engine
underneath Chrome Opera and Samsung
browser and so I'm going to talk a
little bit about blank bugs bugs in our
in our web engine over the past year
we've really invested a lot in bug
health here we realized we had a bit of
a problem and so now I think we've got a
really good process where if you file a
bug on us it first it goes to a QA team
that tries to reproduce it they'll
engage with you and try to ask some
questions and then once we can verify
there's a bugbear it gets routed
directly to an engineering team pretty
much we have complete coverage now of
all of our bugs so that there's some
team responsible for checking on the
bugs regularly and Franco prioritize the
most important and working with you to
get fixes and as a result of that you
can see for this over this past year for
the first time ever in the history of
our project we've consistently close
more bugs than we've opened which it's
always a good place against okay good
and here's some stats I just picked
September bugs filed in September by you
all these were bugs that were filed by
our wizard so people that aren't
chromium committers there were 300 such
bugs filed in September and already 93%
of those have been reproduced and routed
to an area that's what we mean by triage
they're on some teams plate to deal with
about two-thirds of them have been
resolved in some way sometimes this
means actually it's not uncommon that we
dig in some issue we talked with people
and we agree that actually turns out
it's not a bug in chromium it's a bug in
a website or a framework or something
like that that's fine or sometimes it's
a duplicate of another issue and and
about sixteen percent of the bugs that
were filed in September turned into
actual fixes that have landed in the
code are now shipping in chrome and you
know we I think there's more to be done
here but I think this is pretty good I
think this is a signal that if you file
a bug on us there's a good chance that
the right people will see it pay
attention and something will happen I
think it's worth your time the other
signal that's really valuable to us is
our stars you can see on our bug tracker
system here there's a little star next
to the issue if you're signed in and you
click on that it means that you care
about this bug you want to get email
updates and we use the number of stars
as a really important signal and
prioritization we know it's flawed a QB
game so it's not the only signal we use
obviously but if you look at the stats
for just the top starred bugs the top 1%
in terms of stars we fix two thirds
which i think is fantastic and that's
true for the entire lifetime of the
project it's also true if you just look
at all the bugs filed in the past year
the top 1% two-thirds have been fixed
and that's thick that means a fix is
landed right as some of these weren't
actually bugs or some of them yeah or
other things in fact I'm particularly
proud that if we look at the top 60
starred bugs of all time in chromium for
web platform bugs we've fixed nine of
them in the past year and many of these
are things that you may care about
you'll notice there's two on this list
that have three digit bug numbers that
means these bugs were filed the day the
chromium project opened in 2008 so we're
a little slow getting to them I'm sorry
uh-huh but
of the now I think we're also getting a
lot better at involving all of you and
listen to all of you in terms of new API
design Google now when we work on new
features we will initiate new web
platform features in a process that we
call incubation that is a process that
really emphasizes starting with use
cases not starting with the solution
starting with you cases and involving
web developers trying to vet these use
cases make sense and that the that the
ideas we have for them solve those use
cases and we do all this in the open by
the w3c's wicked group the web incubator
community group all this is on github
github.com / wicked take a look at the
repositories there you know that there's
an explainer document that describes the
problems that we're trying to solve and
there's often draft specs and we we love
you to involve you file issues tell us
what you think and then when it comes
time for us to ship a new API this is a
really important time for us because we
want to balance like it's our mission to
push the web forward but we want to push
the whole web forward so the most
important signal for us here is what's
the interop risk what's the risk that
we're gonna regret shipping this because
it's going to end up being a chrome only
thing we don't want to add chrome only
things we wanted we're happy to be out
ahead we're happy to push things hard
but we really try to get feedback from
the other vendors you can see on our
chrome Status page here the colors under
each of the other browser vendors
represent what signal we've got from
them and you can click on those and get
links you know in this case position
sticky was something that's already
shipped in Firefox the prefix version is
shipped in WebKit and it's on the edge
roadmap as a priority medium I think
meaning that they intend to work on it
so that's like a really strong signal
position sticky sometimes can become
part of the web everywhere and at this
stage we get a ton of feedback from the
other browser vendors to Microsoft and
Mozilla in particular we do all we
discuss this trade-off in public on our
blink dev mailing list and and we get
you know when they don't like what we're
doing we hear about it and we will delay
shipping things to try to resolve
outstanding issues all right and then
once even before an API ships it'll show
up behind this experimental web platform
features flag you can go to Chrome flags
turn on its express
web platform features and play with the
api's that are coming up of course you
know we've got Chrome Canary we now have
Chrome Canary for Android updates
basically daily so you can really try
out the bleeding edge stuff file a bug
and see how things change day by day
alright the third main area where I
think we've got better over the past
year is that we now have better tools
and processes for minimizing breaking
changes so first of all how many of you
have worked on a site where a new stable
version of Chrome has come out and
you've had a big emergency because
something's broken on your site and you
gotta got to do something about it come
on don't be shy all right okay not quite
as depressing as I feared I'm sorry I
apologize we definitely don't want to do
that but I can't promise that we're
never going to do it because it's
fundamentally incompatible with our goal
of pushing the web forward the only way
to never break anything is to not move
and so we're trying to kind of be
thoughtful and strike a good trade-off
here and in particular I think we've
gotten a lot better at minimizing those
cases let me give you some examples this
is a specific example that's pretty
recent that I think highlights how
things should go when they're working
well come on so this was in September a
developer notice that they were they
were just using chrome dev channel and
they noticed that on their site their
input type equals range element wasn't
behaving correctly and they actually
figured out that it had to do with a
particular CSP rule they were using that
if they hadn't figured out it would have
been fine in this case because the most
important thing is when they filed the
issue they told us that it was a
regression that it used to work in
chrome 53 and that was an important
signal for q18 the QA team said okay
great we're gonna go do a bisect that
means we're gonna binary search through
all chromium builds between chrome 53
and then and identify the single commit
that broke this website and you see that
happened within a day the next day QA
team had done that and they had
identified one particular chromium
commit which is great it means that we
can make progress on this issue right
away we know who to assign it to the
developer that landed the change um and
we know one possible fixes to remember
that change so this cuts out a lot of
the uncertainty that we used to have in
our regression process because you
have to try to point fingers and do a
whole bunch of debugging to figure out
why your site's broken so in this
particular case what this meant was the
bug was introduced back in August and no
noticed for for almost a month and then
after chrome 54 beta was released this
developer filed the bug within two days
a fix had landed for it within a few
more days there was a new beta release
of chrome 54 that had the fix and by the
time chrome 54 hits table that the fix
was in there so it didn't affect any
users this is how we want to see
regressions happen and this is fairly
typical these days so if we take a look
those bug stats I posted before and
extend to logistic regressions you'll
see the numbers are even more promising
one hundred percent of the regressions
that were filed in September have been
triaged 85 have been resolved and forty
percent pretty much have had a fix
landed alright but unfortunately
briefing changes aren't just about
accidental regressions we believe that
it's important in order for the web to
be able to move forward we believe it's
important that there's some way to shed
the mistakes of the past but this is
something that we want to do very
carefully and very thoughtfully we take
it very seriously we don't really don't
want to break websites as a result of
this try to balance what's best for the
platform overall let me give you a
concrete example any time we're thinking
about maybe we should take some breaks
on functionality intentionally in the
web the first thing we do is collect a
bunch of data so in this case the
security team made an argument us they
said look a geolocation API returns
precise position when users say yes to
that on HTTP we don't think they really
understand that they're not saying yes I
want the site to know where they are
where I am they're saying yes I want
everybody that's sniffing to the network
traffic to know where I am and we know
that's often a fair number of people so
they argued that we should make
geolocation behave as if the user always
clicked reject if you weren't on an
encrypted connection and so it's okay
well let's look at the stats so if
you've opted in to anonymous data
collection in chrome then we send this
anonymous data back to google that we
can look at and we saw that ninety
percent of geolocation was already being
done over HTTPS and the remaining ten
percent accounted for about point oh
five percent of page views
this is still higher than what we'd
normally like to see if we're really
going to break something but weighing
the trade-offs we weigh the trade-offs
in public again on our blank dev list we
solicit feedback from various parties
and in this case we decided that yes it
was worth the cost to break this
scenario and so we have a console
warning and dev tools to say warning
you're relying on something that's going
to stop working we're working on a new
API so you can get this from the wild
rather than just having to use dev tools
normally these days this will always
include a milestone in a date for when
it's actually scheduled for removal but
then after some period of time that
there's been a warning and we've got a
blog post explaining that there's gonna
be a breaking change will eventually rip
it out and then we go through our normal
launch process right we've got Canary
dev beta stable and if we see that
there's a bunch of complaints but things
not working we can reevaluate reconsider
before it hits table and affects buncha
users all right so it's still really
hard to build a website that provides a
great user experience well also being
built out of components that you don't
necessarily control iframes ad networks
third-party scripts there's a
fundamental tension there and if you
think about this this isn't new browser
vendors have always made a trade off the
browser is a user agent right it's
designed to mediate between developers
and users and sometimes act on the
user's you have most classic example is
popup blockers I all browsers have some
heuristics in them to decide when am I
going to allow a window to open to
succeed and when am I going to say Nana
that you can't do that story that's
going to piss off the user and this is a
really tricky trade-off we've always
struggled with this because on the one
hand we want the platform to be
predictable we want to be you be able
reason about what's going to happen but
finding the right trade-off for these
sorts of things as tough so over the
past year we've gotten a lot more
disciplined about how we approach these
types of difficult trade-offs we
formalize the concept into a term
intervention an intervention is
something that minimally breaks existing
behavior in the browser in order to get
some substantial user benefit and good
interventions should be predictable
meaning that you can know when it's
going to happen it's something that we
could standardize we would hail be on
attract hopefully to eventually be
standardized it's avoidable which means
if you're following best practices like
using HD
p.s for anything that's privacy
sensitive then you won't be impacted at
all it's only really for things that we
consider legacy it's transparent which
means that there's API so you can
measure and understand how often you're
being impacted by an intervention in the
wild and critically it's justified by
data we're constantly collecting data
from the field to evaluate the
cost-benefit trade-off of interventions
and try to strike the right balance for
the overall health of the web let me
give you a concrete example in in chrome
52 we shipped an intervention called a
where we throttled the rendering
pipeline for off-screen cross-origin
iframes basically what we realized is
there was a lot of sites that we're
using a lot of CPU for updating
animations of ads that weren't even
visible like well that's silly but you
know that was holloway was designed
defined to behave like
requestanimationframe is supposed to
fire whether or not your iphone is
visible so we did a bunch of
Investigation and looked at what some
other browsers had done in this space
and we we shipped an intervention in 52
that showed substantial power
improvements on a bunch of sites if you
just leave the page sitting there power
usage went down by fifty percent in some
cases ninety percent and this was kind
of an ideal intervention in that when we
shipped it to this day we haven't had a
single report of any site being broken
by this it was theoretically possible
that some site could have been but this
was a great example we saw a huge user
benefit for very little cost and there's
really a theme here thanks there's a
theme that we're trying to do more to
protect the top document the main
application from iframes that might not
be well behaved for example we're trying
to extend this to also include timers so
set timeout doesn't fire we found a
couple cases of that breaking we're
working with people and trying to
mitigate that before we ship that again
we're designing all of this in public we
think it's important this is about the
web which nobody owns and so we think
it's important to have that have these
trade-offs be public discussions again
we do it via the w3c's wicked community
group there's a repository called
interventions where each of these ideas
we have is filed as an issue and we'd
love your feedback on them in particular
if you've got a concrete example of
where your site is being impacted maybe
it's a scenario we didn't anticipate
maybe there's a way we can change the
design so we can get all the benefits
without actually hurting your site
anyway so we'd love your feedback here
or just file bugs
on Chrome again all right dr. Robert hey
what happened to amazing I called you
Mason sorry we first it okay okay so
back to the high level guy I guess so of
course Parker predictability is also
working with developer feedback and
listening to you and the three main
areas are of course hearing what you
have to say and acknowledge the issues
that you're facing also understand any
different challenges that you have and
finally also getting information from
you getting data getting use cases all
that to make things better and one part
has been improving the bug wizard for
chromium so you know Q another stock
photo of bugs but the general idea has
just been too with the budweiser to make
sure that it has a very clear web
develop focus right now and also that if
you file a bug we can have a direct
route into that team fixing that
specific issue so the way it looks now
you would come in and you would take web
developer and it's a very clear view
from you you would have a few choices
that are just relevant to you and then
you can sort of dig deeper or describe
your case or something like that whereas
before it was a long list where most of
if not all of these were completely
irrelevant to you so we're just trying
to make it slices out the easier for you
to go through that path we also want to
talk about services like browser stack
where you can quickly get screenshots
from money many different browsers and
devices even those that you don't have
but just to see what it's like across
the board so for instance you can test
your stuff and you can see what it looks
like in ie11 and then comparing and
seeing with opera 12 50 units it's the
same experience and then you know what
about iphone 6 does it work there as
well it's just a really easy way to at
least get an impression and a
perspective of what it should be across
the board also interestingly they offer
the way the way you can use your browser
interactively you can pick one enough
list you can go and you can try Safari
or Chrome on iOS for instance and you
can see it was like in there as well so
services like browser
back and sauce labs and other ones we
really recommend checking those out too
to get a good overview and we can't
stress this enough filing a good bug or
starring or contributing to an existing
one it's definitely the fastest way to
get an issue fixed so we can resolve the
challenges that you're facing and also
as part of this in our website we're
launching a new feedback section where
we will surface a number of ways for you
to well give feedback and also getting
involved earlier on and try out new
different things as well because
engineering for well basically any
browser is being handled by bugs it
could be things that aren't working or
feature requests or something like that
and we also want to teach you or help
you in how to file a good bug so there's
also information here how you best
describe your issue to make sure to get
resolved and also how you can create a
minimized test case and then host it
somewhere so you can share it with us so
we also want to foster discussion ah we
want you to be able to talk with each
other because you never wanted to be
like you know the poor Denver coder that
disappeared and was never found again so
the main idea here and we have some
information on the feedback section it's
just about you know share information if
help people or share this user to face
it because you know being silent on your
own and upset won't help anyone so
please take part and contribute and also
as freak who's talking about like many
of the bugs they're being fouled is by
our own own engineers or between
different browser onions and since
everything would in development is still
driven by bugs we wanted to make it way
way easier for you to find bugs and
seeing what it looks like at the same
time we want to present the web is one
joint platform we don't want to just be
able to or having to hunt down every bug
in every tracker everywhere so wouldn't
present it in one joint interface so I
started thinking about this how we could
do that and we're google so you kind of
like the idea of searching for stuff and
also getting it in
interface so I presented my ideas to
Eric bidelman on the team and sort of
describe what I wanted they had a few
questions for me and then he started
hacking so he created something that we
affectionately nicknamed the BBS which
is the browser bug searcher and when I
saw it it was bliss it was fantastic and
it was just the way it should be so as
part of the new feedback site we now
have the browser bug surfer as well we
got good help an input from other
browser vendors as well how to interact
with their browser bug trackers and then
getting information from them as well
and why it's so important to search for
existing bugs is that last month alone
with blink at twenty-five percent of the
bugs being filed were duplicates so
please please search before you file
something but with that said it's always
better to file a bug than to not file a
bug so if it's a duplicate it's not the
end of the world is make sure to share
information so this is a shiny slide do
you want to see a demo so we'll try and
do a shaky demo why don't don't clap yet
I appreciate it but no so
would we get this here is that you uh
yes perfect thank you i also like they
were kind enough to make the cursor
really really big for me here go get it
i have a nice view here at face so the
idea is that you would go in here into
the new feedback section of the website
and you would have this field and then
you can Emil you start searching for
something and when you get presented
with is a list of bugs across all bug
trackers um so both where they are being
reported you know across WebKit chromium
and also masala and edge as well so
basically all the major one web browsers
you can also see the current state of
these bugs are deemed already me
resolved won't fix sorta just being you
and filed or something like that it's
just a really quick way to get an
overview what's happening and you can
also easily page between different
results here or you can choose to see
all the results and also in this
separate page for instance if you want
to fill filter only on a couple of
trackers you can do it as well and just
compare those as well or just fade out
fixed issues so you only find the extra
relevant ones that are still working
right this is pretty cool right now you
can clap
so we had a little backup or video in
case you know and also we're going to
say tomorrow afternoon at 4pm we're
going to have a breakout session about
web predictability and it's the only
session with the welcoming of come there
and complain as much as you like okay
common and wine come and tell us about
your biggest issue because we need to
fix this we need to make this as good as
possible for you so summarizing all this
we are really trying to treat the web as
one single platform the way it should be
it's just one big platform for you and
should work across the board it doesn't
matter fewer things only work in one
place and not the other one and or which
browsers doin right there or less right
and it has to work across the board so
also please keep on testing on beta
releases file bugs star bugs for
features so we know what you're
interested in or need help go and visit
the new feedback section try out the
amazing browser bug searcher as well I'm
finally get involved this is this your
web and we want to end on a note of
saying thank you the web would be
nothing without you we're doing this for
you so you can create all the amazing
experiences for people out there and I
think now in these times more than ever
