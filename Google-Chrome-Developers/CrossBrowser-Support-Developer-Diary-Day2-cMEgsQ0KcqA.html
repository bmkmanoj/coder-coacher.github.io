Welcome back to my
Developer Diary series,
where I'm talking about how
I'm making a camera app.
One of the things that I
want to cover in this series
is places where things
didn't go quite right.
One of the things that trips
up a lot of developers,
and I wanted to experience
that pain along with you,
is cross-browser support.
So in particular,
I really need to be
able to support iOS and Android.
So that's Chrome on
Android and Safari on iOS.
So last time, I talked about
capturing images in a way that
works across lots of browsers.
But now, I need to be able
to store them on the device.
My initial thought was
to use the CacheStorage
API, which is part of
the service worker spec.
This is a very good way
of storing resources
against a URL, which is perfect.
Because eventually
these local resources
will be uploaded to a server--
so be able to just store
them against the URL
they will eventually have.
Sadly CacheStorage is not
actually implemented on Safari.
So instead, we have to fall
back to something that is
available on both platforms--
IndexedDB, otherwise
known as IDB.
IDB isn't my favorite API,
but it is very capable.
So I just wrote a simple
abstraction layer around it
in order to do the things
that I needed to do.
So here is that
abstraction layer.
It's a simple class that
wraps around IndexedDB.
And it's called an ImageDb.
You might notice at this
point that I've actually
written this in TypeScript.
If you're not familiar
with TypeScript,
just take any of
these parts that's
like a colon and then a
type, and just pretend
it's documentation.
TypeScript is really
just JavaScript
with this little
extra layer on top.
That said, let's talk about
what this is actually doing.
So when you create an ImageDB,
it creates the database
and sets up these
event handlers.
Nothing particularly
exciting there.
I've got a method for
storing this thing, which
is called an ImageRecord.
An ImageRecord is just--
it's a plain object that stores
the images and any metadata
that I need about those images.
Then I can retrieve an
ImageRecord from the database.
I've got a method
here called all,
which just gets all
of the image records
that are in the database.
This is used for
the browse page,
where I show all of the
images that are available.
And then there's these sort
of internal helpers here.
And the only real
important one here
is the createObjectStore
method, which actually creates
the database the first time
you go to the app, or grades
it if you've been there
before with an older
version of the application.
So this layer was working
pretty great for me,
but I soon ran into a problem.
So the ImageRecord
objects that I'm using,
I was originally using blobs
to store any image data.
I mean, this made perfect sense.
When I wanted to get an image
through file upload, copy
and paste, getting an
image out of a canvas,
they all gave me a blob.
And when I wanted to display
an image, I'd get a blob
and get its URL and
use that blob URL
as the source of an image.
Unfortunately, you can't store
blobs in Safari on iOS at all.
What you can do is
store an ArrayBuffer.
So instead of using
blobs everywhere,
I just need to do a
little bit of conversion
any time that I
get a blob, turn it
into an ArrayBuffer to
store it, and turn it back
into a blob to use it.
So let's have a look
at that conversion.
So if you have an
ArrayBuffer and you
want to turn it into a
blob, that's pretty easy.
You use the blob constructor.
You pass in the ArrayBuffer in
an array as the first element.
And then you just pass in the
type that you want it to be.
So here, this will be
something like image/jpeg.
To go the other way around
is slightly more complicated.
So I created a
little helper here.
If you want to take a blob and
turn it into an ArrayBuffer,
you can use the FileReader API.
So you create a FileReader.
And then you say that you want
to readAsArrayBuffer some blob.
And then, eventually, you
get this Loadend event.
And here, you can see,
I've wrapped in a Promise.
And I just resolve
with the result.
So there you go.
It was kind of tricky to work
out how to get around this.
But in the end, it was possible.
Sure, you can't store
blobs in IDB on iOS,
but there was a way around it.
And that's the story for a lot
of web development nowadays.
Modern web development is
all about finding out what
works across all the browsers.
Hopefully, this is
getting easier over time.
But you know, these
things will still happen.
So hopefully that was
useful to anyone who's
coming across the same problem.
And join me next time when
we'll learn about something new.
