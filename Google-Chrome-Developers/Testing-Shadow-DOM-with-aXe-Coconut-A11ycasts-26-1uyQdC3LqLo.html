welcome back to the alley cat show today
we're gonna be talking about how you can
inspect shadow Dom for your elements
using the latest version of the axe
chrome dev tools extension so if you are
familiar with axe from some of our
previous episodes it's basically a
really awesome little library created by
the folks at DQ systems I'll let you run
a set of accessibility audits against
your whole page what is really cool
about access they've recently launched a
new version which they're calling ax
coconut and this is kind of like their
version of a Chrome Canary or Firefox
nightly it's a way for developers to try
out the sort of like bleeding edge of
their extension and get your hands on
some of the new features before they've
shipped in the the main line so what
we're gonna be doing today is looking at
a little widget that we created and
employing one of the best new features
of ax coconut which is shadow Dom
inspection as gonna you know when you're
building any sort of like custom element
or web component shadow DOM while it's
very useful for style encapsulation does
create issues for accessibility
particularly for things like Aria the
reason that is is because shadow Dom
creates these little shadow boundaries
scoping bubbles and so all of your ID
references the ability to actually walk
the Dom all those things kind of get
broken by the shadow boundary it makes
it pretty tough for any sort of like
audit tool to see what's going on inside
of there in the latest version of ax
coconut the team has done a really
really good job sort of like tackling
this problem figuring out how to do shut
it on inspection so that's what we're
gonna be covering today so follow me
over here to my laptop I've got this
little sort of music player that I've
been working on and you can see there's
a few things happening here we've got
some some band artwork we've got the
name of our band showing play and mute
button and a little progress bar and so
anybody looking at this would be like
okay cool I think this thing you know
looks like a music player to me seems
like it should work let's drop it into
our site but there's actually under the
hood a few places where I've made some
accessibility mistakes normally those
would be totally missed if I was using
any sort of audit tool it would just see
the element it would stop at the shadow
boundary and be like I can't really see
what's going on inside of there so I
guess that's okay
using ax coconut though we can analyze
the page and as we wait a few seconds
we'll see aha
you've got let's see two four we got
about five issues that we need to cover
in this element so walking through these
one by one the first one we can see here
is that we've got some Aria attributes
which need to conform to valid names
what's really nice about using coconut
and the the access tension in general is
it's got this little highlight button
right here which we can click and I'm
actually show us which elements in the
document are failing that audit so we
can see here our play button is failing
it we could click this next button and
we can see also that our mute button is
failing this audit so if we go and we
look down here it'll tell us the
location of the elements we know it's
inside of this audio player custom
element now I'm actually using shadow
Dom inside of this so it's actually
pierced the shadow boundary and it's
going to this controls div and it's
looking at our how to toggle button and
what tells us right here to is the
source of the element we can see okay
cool it's got a roll a button that seems
fine it's got a tabindex that seems fine
ah but if we look at Aria here it says
aria-pressed but we've got a little
spelling error there so it's detected
that it's a roll of button it's detected
that aria-pressed is sort of like an
optional state that we can give to a
element with a button role but it's also
found that we've misspelled that state
so we can fix this pretty easily we can
go over to our editor find our toggle
button and just look for all the places
where we said are you pressed with one s
I'll select all those highlight them all
and then tack on an extra s so we
spelled that correctly refresh the page
analyze again and we should see that yes
we have fixed that error okay so there's
a few other things do we've got buttons
here which need discernible text again
we can highlight those I can see ah yes
again it's our play button so what's
going on here is we've created a button
element and we've given it the right you
know ru role and everything so it's
announced properly to the system that
it's a button but if we click on inspect
a node let me go and look at the
accessibility inspector we can see that
it's computed name
is an empty quote and that's because a
button element it's going to compute its
name in a few different ways you know
you could associate it with a label
element you could give it some text
content it could compute a name that way
but in this case since we've just used
an icon as the content of this button
the system really has no idea what to
call it so we can say it's a button but
I can't tell the user if it's play or
pause or mute or what so to fix this one
since we don't really have room on
screen for text or anything like that
we know that we can find the button and
we can just maybe give it Aria labels so
this is our play button so we can say
are you label equals plate and we'll do
the same thing for the mute button say
are you label equals mute okay go
refresh the page fire up X coconut once
more and we should see now that we only
have one error left and this one is
actually pretty cool so we've got an
image here which needs alt text now
again most of your familiar putting alt
text on your images the reason why we
want to do this is because someone lands
on that image with a screen reader and
we can describe the content of the image
to that user in this case why this is
sort of a cool audit is the way that
I've actually structured this audio
player is this area up top where we're
loading our image it's inside of the
shadow Dom so we've got it inside of a
shadow root but we've also got it inside
of an iframe so X coconut is piercing
the shadow boundary it's then piercing
the iframe and it's like okay all the
way down here at this level you've got
an image that needs proper labeling that
to me is like super cool that it's able
to go down to that level of depth and so
to fix this we can just pop over to the
iframe where we're loading our image and
we can see we've just got our band photo
here I'm gonna give it some alt text and
we'll say let's see what is the name of
this band again the band is called the
coconuts okay so let's say the coconuts
go nuts
playing in a cafe something like that
I'm terrible at writing alt text but I
hope I hope that suffice is is a good
summary refresh the page hit it with ax
coconut one more time and boom okay so
everything that we could do an automated
test for we're currently passing now
it's important to understand that
anytime you're doing
automated testing with a tool like axe
or light house or anything like that
there's plenty of things that an
automated tool can't catch so it's not a
full-on substitute for actually putting
the control in front of a user actually
having someone interact with the thing
and make sure it's it's usable you know
for someone using a screen reader
Braille reader someone who you know
prefers to use the keyboard to interact
the page right you want to do usability
testing as well as automated testing but
I think ax coconut is super awesome if
you want to check it out you can check
out the the blog post by the folks at DQ
announcing how to download the Chrome
extension and also how to use axe core
3.0 alpha a lot of really cool stuff
there so definitely go check that out
that about covers it for today so if you
have any questions leave them for me
down below in the comments or hit me up
on a social network of your choosing
as always thank you so much watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
