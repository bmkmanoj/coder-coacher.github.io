polymer 10 it was the biggest update in
the history of the polymer library it
comes with a number of massive
performance improvements but that's at
the cost of we had to rewrite a couple
of the fundamental components of polymer
the shadow Dom polyfill and the data
binding system so that means if you've
got a 0.5 app there are some changes you
need to make to make it compatible with
10 fortunately we've got resources for
you to I want to highlight today the
first the polymer migration guide it's
available in the polymer doc site it's
incredibly comprehensive super detailed
it will tell you everything you need to
know to migrate your app from point 5 to
10 the second is a tool called poly up
Polly up is an odious binary that will
read your code parts it and transform it
from 0.5 to 10 idioms we've got an
interactive as you type a web version so
you can go paste your code in type it in
see what poly up will do and of course
in NPM version you can install it
upgrade your coat on disk I want to
emphasize poly up doesn't do everything
um specifically its best with
declarative code and with your
JavaScript if you're interacting with
your custom elements in a few ways there
are times when Polly up can't reason
about what you're doing and you'll need
to make manual changes there's a guide
in the poly up github repo that sort of
walks you through the common things
you'll need to look for so what will it
do poly up we'll upgrade your imports
your styling your template if template
repeat auto binding templates filters
simple expressions complex expressions
expressions of every kind your
attributes host attributes listeners
property declarations computed
properties most uses of official
elements and much more and if it doesn't
do it today file a bug send a PR so
probably at least a couple people in the
audience or thinking what's going on
this is
this is weird right javascript libraries
do not often release tools that will
update you to the latest version maybe
it's that poly up has a bunch of black
magic in it was very hard to write and
took a incredibly long time but the
answer is actually more interesting it's
actually because polymer like the web is
declarative and declarative code is very
direct about what it's doing HTML looks
like the Dom that it gets produced CSS
is just a very direct mapping of match
this do that and polymer with templates
expresses your data dependencies and
your imports very directly and that
means that it's easy to read for you for
your offer humans for your fellow
engineers and also for machines and when
it's easy for machines to read about and
reason your code that makes it easier to
transform imperative code is harder it's
a sequence of instructions that
interacts with state and and you have to
carry a lot of of information about
what's going on to successfully and
confidently transform imperative code
and that means a poly up is actually
really simple to read the code it's very
directly doing the transformations that
are documented but even bigger than that
is that all of this means that we the
polymer team have got your back because
polymer is built on the idea that the
future of the web platform is really
awesome you've been hearing about all
sorts of emerging standards you just
heard about CSS animations web
animations sorry and CSS custom
properties but so we these are future
standards and polymer is predicated on
the idea of taking that future and
bringing it to the present so you can
use it today but as time travel movies
teach us when you take something from
the future and bring it to the present
you then change the future you learn
from those thing
that you brought back and then so in the
same way we might from your feedback
from our experience implementing these
things some of these specs might change
along the way to being implemented in
every browser but that's fine especially
for declarative aspects like CSS custom
properties we can provide tools that
will migrate your code to this new and
better future not just us there are
wonderful tools for reading parsing a
source code and transforming it
especially declarative source code and
so if you have a super popular set of
elements that you find that you need to
make a breaking change to that's fine
very short amount of code later and
you've got a tool that will upgrade your
users to your latest versions as well
and that means that we can all build the
future without leaving each other behind
that's me I'm Rick tick you can find me
on slack github occasionally Twitter and
also be around the code labs just after
this thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
