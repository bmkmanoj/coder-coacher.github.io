about the serviceworker and some of the
offline stuff and I actually heard from
a lot of you in the feedback that that
was like it was complicated stuff and I
agree it is complicated stuff and
complex and it's not that much fun to
write quite fiddly work but there is
hope because things like the cache API
hopefully they can be updated these
api's that I'm having to sort of work
around and kind of work with to make my
stuff work hopefully in the long term
we'll get solutions for those at the
platform level and in the interim you
know isn't it I think it's a good thing
that you can actually work with these
lower level primitives and make the
thing that you want to make that's the
genius of the extensible web give you
the low level primitives
yeah there's complexity there perhaps
perhaps not but if there is you can
still write that code and it's much
better than saying oh we've got this
high level thing and if it doesn't fit
for your particular needs sorry about
that
that's the old web that's the way we
used to have so anyway I just kind of
wanted to say that just to say partly I
am reading the comments I do love
reading those comments and we say this
at the end of the video but today I'm
starting with that I do read them I love
them they're really insightful and often
as you'll also be seeing sometimes
people are like why did you do that why
didn't you do that and now the next
thing will be a comment for me with a
link to the github commit where I'm like
I changed the code because that was a
better idea so you know teamwork that's
what this is anyway so I don't want to
say that I've solved all the major
problems with the app because I haven't
but I did want to spend a little bit of
time today looking at some of the
smaller details the little touches that
I've been putting into the app and I
just thought I'd pick out two of those
for you today and the first one is what
sounds great I'm show you okay so here
we have the video and I'm just going to
I'm going to pause it what is that green
oh that's peculiar we'll ignore that for
now but what I wanted to show you is
this down here at the bottom you see as
I'm dragging along we get this little
thumbnail
like that let's release that Wow I don't
do not know what's happened to Pete
there sorry Pete you look like the
incredible Pete that's bizarre goodness
knows what's going on there anyway but
the this little thumbnail how am I doing
this I thought this is really a really
nice way to visually sort of orientate
yourself we've all seen this on apps and
so on we can't leave it on that that
thumbnails there well that's me
right well the way I do it is I have
created an image one big image for the
video so this is part of the image
processing that I do when I take the
video in and I'm making the web M's and
everything else I also ask ffmpeg and
you can find the command for it just by
searching around to say every I think
it's like every three seconds I think
I'd time it to the segment length
actually cuz I break my video into three
seconds segments and if that's sort of
news to you then definitely watch the
ones earlier on in the the dev diary
where I'm talking about - and how you
split your video down into these
segments all the time I ask at a time
peg every few seconds please can you
output an image for me a small thumbnail
nearly as small it's only like 144
pixels by was it 256 whatever it is tiny
anyway so I get a bunch of these and
then I use image magic actually to stack
them all up into one big image and again
that's just is one line in the command
line and you see that it outputs this
video like this as like a strip film
strip in the source code I load this
image as I use it I think I use it as a
div a background image on a div okay so
I have a div haha imagine this let me
show you this here the the white box
around it with a little down tech on it
that's a div and inside is another div
that's slightly smaller which is the
same size as one of those frames of the
video and in there I position another
div a third
which sounds bizarre you might be like
well why is he doing this why has he got
so many gives all the way down surely he
could just set back ground position he
could just drop this into the background
image and then say background position
and all would be fine yes I could but
actually we don't typically want to do
that what we would rather do is we'd
rather use a transformer I always say
this about performance transforms and
opacity Ivers friends I'm almost tired
of hearing me say it but there I go
again doing it once more what I do is I
drop in that that image is a full-size
div and I then just transform it up and
down so it's like a sliding window so
you got this kind of the container
element and inside is this div that we
just sort of slide up and down with the
transform and how do we know how much to
transform it by huh now that's what this
code is here so the available height is
is basically how tall is that that
filmstrip of our images take away the
height of one of the stills which is it
is 81 pixels there you go now that's
down something's yeah it's probably 144
by 81 I think is what it is for each one
of those bills anyway so you take away
so you've got the height of the whole
thing - one of the one of the frames
because you don't want to be able to go
past the end and then we figure out the
index and the index is basically take a
normalized position so if we I normalize
the time so if you're it's been a value
between zero and one zero being the
start of the video one being the end and
I say well you are say nought point five
way of the way through the video where
you're scrubbing is naught point five on
that line and what I do is I then say
well times that by the available height
that should give you where you would
need to be in that film strip and then I
round it to the nearest frame so that we
don't sort of see half of a frame or 3/4
of a frame or some fraction of the frame
we want it to be snapped two whole
frames and that's what we do is just
basically find the that's why there's
the floor there we found this what I
call the index which
is which one of the frames should we be
looking at based off that normalized
position between zero and one and then
we do a transform on that the filmstrip
to move it by the correct amount and
that's it so we've pre-baked
this film strip and then we drop it into
the page and then we just slide it up
and down depending on how far you slid
across the timeline so that's one that's
one of the things let me show you the
other one which I'm quite fond of as
well it is just a little thing
imagine I'm just going I'm going to get
rid of the incredible Pete there and
just go back to normal image I'm going
to find out why that happened after this
it's classic innit it's been working
fine but I effectively do a demo and it
all breaks brilliant anyway here we go
so what is the other yes it's this
remember now imagine during the
situation you think you know look all
this content in that amazing but imagine
you go offline and that didn't work why
does that not work there it is work it
just took a while for it to propagate
through you see now it's faded out and
disabled all the the things that it
thinks we can't click so bring that back
online did it there we go anything it
picks that up as well imagine then we go
and let's go into one of these
let's pick let's pick this one and we
will make that available offline Ram it
goes there we are and we could do the
same again but I've also added this
little settings area where we can
prefetch popular content which was the
whole talked about that in previous
episode how one of these cases is let's
preface the first like 30 seconds or the
first minute of some footage so that we
get a flying start with the other
setting I make that easier setting by
the way because it will use ballads and
I want to be respectful of people's
bandwidth so I don't just switch it on
for everybody let them decide they want
to do it they don't want to show off
line comes that only which is the I know
I'm going to be on a flight or
on you know some kind of underground
train which seems to be the nature of my
life sometimes if I click that on you
can see it goes into this downloads only
and I do it again this is a little
little thing I'm showing that little
marker in the top right hand corner just
to remind you you're in downloads only
mode so that you don't kind of go why is
nothing working and you'll see when I
scroll down this one is still lit up and
there you go and click into it and I
could in theory watch the video there we
are
so let me just talk about some of that
stuff I won't get into probably all of
it but it is interesting stuff so the
head of it is the offline eNOS of it and
then part of it is kind of detecting the
offline e
state which is relatively easy to do if
you've got navigated offline or online
or whatever it is never gated to online
that's what it is with a capital L never
really fully understood that one
navigate that online
it's like you're shouting the line I
think Jake made that point actually in
one of his talks oh well we're obviously
on the same page anyway like let's have
a look at a little bit of code so the
the vast majority of this is actually
hidden in app and we find where it is
long number it is this is the thing
where I want to find area right disable
unavailable links what we do is we look
for all the things that can be
effectively disabled by going offline so
that's going to be like the thumbnails
in particular for the videos and we look
and we just say given all those links I
basically pull out the href from those
links and sometimes for specific things
is a nature F on the data set but what I
do is I ask the offline cache do you
have this item the thing for this path
and if you do then that's great
if you don't then we're going to add on
this disabled class which will trade it
out and it desaturates the image and it
does all the stuff that I just showed
you where it kind of goes yeah you're
not going to click on this a so the
offline cache has let me show you that
there it is so this is an interesting
one from my point of view because it's
the simple version of this would be to
look inside under the first version of
it this is exactly what it did if you
imagine that each video has a URL like
you know show name slash episode name
then I can just look inside the the
caches and just say do you have that yes
or no and if the answer is yes then I
have it and I can just show that link
great and in the net inside of one of
those caches would be them effect let me
show you what it looks like I mean it
didn't really pity inside here inside
cache storage there are Celia show real
it's the it's the video of course yes
but it's also to make it a bit bigger I
think what I'll just zoom out a little
bit there it's the poster frames it's
the it's the URL itself the video that
the page itself so we've got the HTML
the artwork we know that the main cache
will have all the CSS and icons and
everything else so between those two
caches we should be able to show this
particular page so if we got a cache
with the name CVS slash showreel we're
going to enable that link but what
happens if you were partway through
downloading that that cache was partly
filled maybe you got the artwork but you
didn't get the video or you didn't get
the or the video you got just some of
the stuff but not all of the stuff I
have this purged partial downloads
folder
both can't even say it take a breather
you know purge partial downloads there
you go nailed it
poets partial downloads keep saying it's
a function which we use to kind of go in
and go does this this look full does
this look like it's got everything that
we'd expect it to have and I am using
the video as a proxy for that so again
this is something that I might come back
to and might refine a little bit further
because this is the nature of this it's
a process I'm sharing with you the
process I'm not saying I have all the
right answers and this is just how it's
going to be very often as I said at the
start you know read the comments or
whatever and people like you should
really have you thought about that and
that gives me other thoughts anyway this
is how it currently is what I do is I go
through and I get all the items in that
particular cache and I locate the video
chunks in particular on the assumption
that the video is the likeliest
candidate for being the last thing into
the cache so you know the artwork and
all these things they're probably going
to arrive much more quickly than say a
40 megabyte or 100 megabyte or Eternity
megabyte video so I look at the video in
particular and then I go through and I
look for all the chunks so I look
through every item in the cache but I
look in particular for their
video tones and I look for the highest
numbered video chunk so maybe I say get
video tunc 30 and then the thing I do is
I look at a video chunk and I say based
off your content length I would have
expected to see 50 chunks so I know that
I'm expecting 50 but I've only got 30
therefore I'm pretty confident I have a
partial download and so at that point if
I find them compare the largest chunk
index to what we would expect to have if
it's not there if the expected in the
max index don't match then I basically
delete that cache and then and only then
do I actually check whether the cache
exists so before I before I respond with
yet we've got a cash-flow CDF slash
showreel I'm going to go in and say just
get rid of anything that was pending or
partial first and foremost now where
this might get changed is in the future
with something like background fetch
when the background fetch
stuff lands it's possible that the cash
would be partially filled because of
background fetch and I don't want to
purge it if it's partially filled by
background facts so I might have to
rethink this you know yet we're going to
find out aren't we that's the exciting
part of this so there you go
just a couple of things like fading out
the unavailable links when somebody goes
offline and which they can either
control themselves or they can you know
they can market only offline content or
they can that's it you know if they're
in airplane mode or something like that
it works in that case too because you
can get events on the window object for
those kinds of things and having the
thumbnail image just little touches that
I hope make it a little bit more fun for
people to use the app definitely have a
look at the source code it's on github
I'll always drop your comments in and
you can subscribe as well and I'll catch
you yep always the same Ready Steady
next time Allen thanks for watching if
you enjoyed this video well you may
enjoy other videos that we make too so
don't forget you can subscribe and
you'll get notified when we push out a
new video and there's more videos over
there or down there depending on how
you're watching the youtubes right now
definitely click on those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
