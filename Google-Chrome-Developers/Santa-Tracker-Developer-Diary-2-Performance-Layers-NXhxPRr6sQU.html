episode of the Santa tracker series I'm
going to talk a little bit about
performance and performance in terms of
the divs and the layers that we see on
the page when we look at it so let's
have a quick look at the site itself so
what we see here is a bunch of divs and
layers if you bring up the rendering tab
in the bottom of your dev tools you'll
see we have paint mop flashing and layer
borders turned on so that's the effects
you see the brown outlines are the
layers that the GPU knows about and the
green is where the GPU is currently
drawing and so there's a lot of stuff
going on you know Santa is a complicated
site and we do render things as we go
along this game for instance is causing
a few redraws and you can kind of see
some of our effects don't have drawing
cost at all for instance this little
cute scene of reindeers down here they
don't actually need to be redrawn every
frame we've done some work to make sure
that they're only happening in the GPU
which is pretty cool but of course for
our countdown timer we quite literally
draw a new number every second which
makes sense so what we're trying to do
is reduce the number of layers that were
drawing so if you see in the example
you'll see that the second counter is
actually highlighting every frame and we
don't really know why so let's have a
look at that so this little counter here
is our problem we also got this div at
the top of this little green effect up
here which is actually related and I'll
explain why in just a second
Sofer go to our source code and we can
actually see that I've kind of commented
things out rather than typing it in on
the spot we want to change a couple of
things so firstly this element only
takes up about 70 pixels high and that's
fine right that's how you want to use
the element but note that it actually
gets bigger around the top and bottom
because we have this effect of this
number appearing and disappearing as we
as the number changes so what we're
going to do and this is in SAS so you
can see some some dollar sign variables
here we're going to set the overflow so
that overflow is going to be the size of
the element in half so we want to make
this element bigger by half on both
sides so what we can do is set a
negative margin to make the element
bigger and sort of padding to make the
elements smaller again what that means
is we can force the GPU to make a bigger
layer which is really good because it'll
then contain our elements that move up
and down as we count
we've also said as the index and set the
overflow:hidden because we can now tell
the browser hey this layer which is now
bigger really doesn't have anything
outside it whereas previously our core
layer actually couldn't be restricted
right it would overflowed those things
did expand out of its space so now if we
hit save and hopefully refresh it should
happen automatically we'll see that
actually I've got this bigger element
here but we've still got some problems
here this is still flashing for some
reason we don't quite understand what's
actually happening here is this minutes
and seconds an hour's thing that layer
is on top of the numbers not below the
numbers and that sounds a bit
counterintuitive right because surely
the numbers are kind of below the the
text there but because they're in the
wrong way the browser thinks that it
needs to redraw that text every frame
which isn't quite true so what we're
gonna do is go down here and say this
hold R which contains our number let's
put it on top let's make it Z index much
higher so this is a hundred here which
is just a random value because we're in
a stacking context it doesn't really
matter what we choose so if we refresh
the page and that happens automatically
you'll see that now that number is just
ticking up on its own so that's pretty
much all I wanted to cover today
hopefully what you've learned is a
little bit about how to trick the
browser into making bigger divs that are
GPU layers and basically using things
like Z index to basically convince the
browser to only draw the bits you care
about so thanks for watching and I'll
see you next time thanks for watching

developer channel down here we'll check
out some other great videos over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
