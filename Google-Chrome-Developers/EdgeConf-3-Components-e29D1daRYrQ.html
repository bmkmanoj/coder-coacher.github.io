okay good hi there we are the warm-up
act for Jake Archibald and we're going
to be talking about components here it's
which is okay by the way that's fine I'm
good with that so my name is Dan I'm
just going to briefly introduce people
and then we're gonna we're going to have
a talk a brief talk and then we're going
to get into it so mine Stan Apple Quist
work for telefonica and I do firefox
stuff firefox OS and i and i co-chair
something called the tag in w3c which is
kind of a technical architecture
steering board for for w3c on our panel
today we have a panoply of stars here we
have Nicole Sullivan from pivotal labs
who is a proponent of component based
systems and she's the creator of
object-oriented CSS Type O Matic and CSS
lint we have Alex Komarovsky from Google
whose product manager on blink and
polymer we Pete hunt from Instagram /
facebook a member of the react core team
we have Soledad pinay death from Mozilla
who's working on things like mortar
brick and X tag we have Peter Gaston who
is a creative technologists and an
author and speaks about web components
and we're going to hear him speak right
now so without further ado I'm going to
ask him to come give a kind of intro
talk tell us about components thank you
very much ok I don't know again for a
ski to me
how my screen is locked embarrassing but
I can get over it that way I'm a
professional I've done this thousands of
times before stood up here and embarrass
myself to thousands of times before
thanks so you good morning I'm here to
do a quick talk about introducing web
components I know some of you know them
already but I want to kind of give a
little overview for everybody about
basically the why the how and the when
of web components don't use that hashtag
that's the owner is the right time I
corrected it good on do you use the
hashtag I corrected it it's okay my name
is Peter gasps tonight we it stops at
green I'm broke it right for broken
links com I'm gonna technologist and
front-end lead which is a very
cumbersome job title for an agency here
in London so it's kind of my job to
think to look at new and future web
technologies and evaluate them and see
when we can use them and one of the
things I'm most excited about the moment
is is web component so i'll be very much
playing the role of the excited every
munda Vella / in this panel of stars
we've got here ever since we've been
developing for the web we've been
copying other people's stuff that's
there's no shame in that that's how the
web kind of grew that's how everybody
got their knowledge I learned by copying
other people's stuff i'm sure most of
you did here as well the view saw view
page source is one of the finest
inventions of the web well done to the
original early browser makers for kind
of making that possible for us but as we
as we've done that it's kind of become
quite cumbersome to copy other people's
stuff it used to be you know we'd nick a
little line of code here in a line of
code there but then it just gets bigger
and bigger and more and more involved to
actually do that but we still want to
reuse other people's stuff and we don't
want to reuse our own stuff across our
own websites as well some of the early
efforts at kind of making this copying
and sharing easy were java applets if
anybody's about for the web over 10
years ago there's a very very good
chance you had a photograph of a house
on a lake with a rippling lake
underneath it that would have been made
with a java applet and then we had
dynamic drive which was the best place
to go to if you wanted animated stars to
follow your mouse around the around the
window but we started becoming kind of
more professional with the way that we
wrote our code afterwards to make it
more shareable to make it more reusable
we had fantastic efforts like Nicole's
object-oriented CSS which become like
you know
very very popular loads of people use it
and have been even more formulize din to
things like them languages like or
protocols like bem and in terms of other
sharing with a we've even had kind of
hole elements whole UI elements
libraries grow up to enable us to start
using to stop having to code our own
carousel five thousand times and instead
copy the carousels of other people
efforts like jQuery UI and more recently
bootstrap have enabled us to do that we
write our code in a certain way and
things just happen I'm even bigger much
more powerful ways of doing this in
power some of the biggest sites on the
web today we're looking at things like
react which is written by Facebook and
Instagram who Pete here is going to talk
about later today and a fantastic hosts
the Financial Times have their own
version in fruit machine these are kind
of template constructors you put in
JavaScript and outputs all the code for
you and you can power that through node
and you can build hold very very
powerful scalable systems but just based
on this idea of copying and reusing
other bits of code other elements so
this is not an idea that web components
is kind of a formalization of all these
ideas it's look to all the things we've
done in the past and it's kind of said
well people want to do this let's make a
standard way of doing it let's make an
easier way of doing it hooks into a kind
of the low level of the api's and brett
of the browsers and makes is much much
easier to do so where the goal is
reusability the answer is web components
there are three there are three kind of
core parts to web components so baby
Budd the first parts let me gather my
thoughts there are three parts to web
components the first is what are known
as custom elements custom elements when
I first read about web components I
thought they were kind of more of a
background thing and shadow Dom was the
big thing that everybody was really
talking about but in fact as I see it as
I look at it custom elements are web
components they're the cool thing
without anything else custom elements of
the bit we really really want to use the
idea behind custom elements is that
basically everything is an element
everything we do and everything we have
on the web is an element that's kind of
a cool thing that drives the polymer
project which I'm going to talk about in
a little bit but it but custom elements
themselves
for a long time we've had elements like
image and if you provide a source to
that image element it puts an image in
the page at that point and we've had
things like inputs if you say input the
typing it was a range it outputs for you
a UI element in a consistent way across
all the different browsers so we want to
do that we do we like having those
consistent UI elements but why stop
there why not have everything be an
element everything we do all the time
could be an element so why not have for
example or Google Maps element you give
it a latitude in a long to cheap
longitude it outputs a Google map into
your page at that point why not extend
existing elements so we can say the
video element which we generally have in
the page anyway also accepts video
camera input we extend it with WebRTC
why not have Ajax calls be elements why
not put them in the page we do that all
the time we want those results we want
to put those results in the page at this
consistent place so why not make this
into an element as well creating a
custom element is very very simple you
create a new prototype object you can
add methods to it you then register
those elements into the dom by giving a
unique name which has to be hyphenated
like this to make it compatible with
current and future standardized HTML ml
elements and then you just tell it which
prototype to use and that's basically it
you registered the element with the Dom
you giving it some methods you give it
up some properties and then you can just
include it in your page so you can do
anything without that's exceptionally
exceptionally powerful all of those
things I just showed you before Google
Maps to Ajax calls the videos they all
start by basically doing this but once
you've written this that's not rip I
mean that's kind of nice that you've
contained all this you've attached all
these properties to this element but
then you want to share that element you
want to make it shareable everywhere so
that's where the second part of web
components comes in these are called
HTML imports and they are simplicity
itself there just like including a
javascript file or referring to an
external CSS file but it's using
snippets of HTML markup hopefully with
all your attached behaviors so you put a
new link element in the head you say
it's a link out is an import link and
you give it an href and then that allows
you to take your
custom element and apply it to all of
the pages on your site but more than
that it also allows people to take that
same code that you've written that same
an import that same snippet file and
apply it across all their sites too so
it's immensely reusable which is really
really cool the final part the final
core part of web components is the
shadow Dom shadow DOM is a nice study
it's not vital to web components but it
makes them really really nice and useful
and it actually exists right now many of
you might have seen this already if you
open up Chrome and even in I think it's
even in Safari still and you choose the
show shadow Dom option you can see the
mark-up inside these UI elements that we
use for example if you have an input
type equals range if you view the shadow
Dom of that you can see it's actually
built of other elements they're just not
exposed to the user they're hidden
inside that and that's what I shadow DOM
is it's the Dom inside the Dom that's
hidden from the from the from the user
in most senses that kind of powers the
element the simplicity of the element
there are also a few things which aren't
part of the web components spec or but
are related to and make it way way more
extensible useful one of them being the
template element which allows you to
drop markup into your into your document
and not have it passed or not have it
rendered until you explicitly tell the
browser to render it we have mutation
observers which look for changes in the
DOM and fire an event when they happen
and we have scoped styles which allow
you to apply CSS only to specific
elements as opposed to being globally
scoped as they are at the moment so
who's on board at the moment most of the
work is being done in chrome if you look
in Chrome nightly or the dev channel
there's a lot of this stuff that maybe
you have to enable it through flags but
it's all in there because of that a lot
of it comes in to blink sorry into opera
naturally as well as they're based on
the same blink engine fire fox are doing
an awful lot of work in this as well
custom elements are in there I know
they're working heavily on the shadow
Dom on the rest of the suite Microsoft
we're not sure about at the moment but i
think the signs are good because they're
involved in some of the extra stuff like
mutation observers and also they've got
history in this Internet Explorer 5
actually had this thing called HTML
components which is really similar
to what web components do nowadays so in
this case kind of Microsoft sort of the
the proto hipsters of the web component
see finally there's a safari and really
who knows if you want to use them today
you've got two choices or you've got two
main choices there's two libraries
called polymer and ex tags one's kind of
they're both public but one's kind of
driven by Google one kind of driven by
Mozilla polymer has its polymer core
which is where you do the registration
xTag has its extech or polymer has a UI
a set of UI elements on top and x tags
have brick which do the same job and
they both share this platform underneath
they both use the same platform to
polyfill where these things are not
present natively which is really really
good and makes it the fact that whether
you choose one or the other you're still
working into the same code base
underneath which is really helpful for
kind of moving forward the outcome that
we get from this is meaningful markup we
get reusable elements and hopefully in
the future who knows even a consistent
you I maybe the web could have a
consistent you I like native apps have
that might be something that we want to
move towards to make it easier for
people so we can stop reinventing the
wheel and every site we build the
challenges are to put it politely a
prolific proliferation of crap if we let
people create their own stuff they're
going to create some crappy stuff but
that's not a reason to move on that's
not a reason to stop Ewing them and
performance people flow performance
accessibility and internationalization
and those are all the things we're going
to talk about today so web components
are the future for better or worse thank
okay well so uh given our thank you
first of all for that for that intro I
think that gives us a lot to think about
and I think it it nicely intros us to
our first questioner i'm going to ask yo
have Weiss to stand up hopefully and to
yes thank you and to ask the first
question of the day hi we're all aiming
towards better page load times HTML
imports can include other imports yes
six modules can other modules to what
extent does using components breaks web
performance by breaking parallelism so
performance immediately so that's a
first of all I'd like to I'd like to ask
Pete 22 maybe you know as you're a
company that that has a strong emphasis
on page performance and on performance
you know what's what's your view on that
I just get the trolling out early yeah
basically yes well at Facebook we found
that flexibility is the most important
thing that there's not a silver bullet
to initial page load performance you can
actually improve page load performance
by deferring certain things so for
example we found that actually adding
JavaScript to the page can improve page
load performance if the JavaScript isn't
driving an important part of the UI at
the same time that we found we found
that the raw kind of if you want to just
say what is the fastest way to get the
UI into the browser its server rendered
HTML every time so for us we're not
going to adopt a system that requires
you to either serve a render or to
client render I think that the the
trendy term for this is called like
isomorphic JavaScript but every system
that we have we need to make sure that
we can choose where on that spectrum do
we want to serve a render or client
render and at which point do we want to
push that data down the wire which is
one of my big concerns about web
components because it's blocked on the
JavaScript execution and it's tied
tightly to the Dom api's so I want to
so HTML imports the top-level import
from the main document and does block
rendering just like a stylesheet does
there is an async attribute that you can
use to say do not block anything and
then within imports themselves which are
not blocking the main page from
executing script or parsing and that
kind of thing you might have a complex
interdependence e of different things we
found it's much better in that case too
it's much easier to reason about if you
don't have if you do block those active
context as you're loading the other
resources however one thing they
remember too is that web components
provides a set of new tools they don't
take away any tools so there's certain
best practices that we've discovered
that will remain so for example when
you're doing development sure you might
want a bunch of different HTML
components and separate files but when
you deploy to production you might you
might want to compress those and minna
files into one resource we've also found
that you can do a lot of interesting
things like using these tools and using
a sink in them some judicious use of it
some of this stuff you could for example
to find a very simple component that's
just markup that's actually in the head
of your document so that loads very very
quickly for the user and then load the
more complex component and use that when
it after it loads yeah I'm actually I
think I like HTML imports they seem
pretty good they seem like one of these
tools that you can use to shoot yourself
in the foot or not as with many tools on
the bus and yeah I mean like like that's
a sign that it's a good tool can I have
a dangerous nature photographer minute
you would have multiple versions of the
same component and load the simpler
version first so and layer on a more
code again it's extra tools and one
thing is it is interesting in this is
with these extra tools we found today on
the web platform we've got a set of
tools in the web platform some of our
kind of janky and busted but they're
what we've got we've added a few more
tools on the end what I found is that we
found a lot of best practices today
we've all sort of discovered using this
set of tools that we've got and actually
adding a few new ones britains question
you know opens a possibility for
different best practices that are
actually even better and one of the cool
things about this is I feel like on the
polymer team and people who are using
polymer and x tags we're kind of the
pioneers we're discovering this stuff
and saying oh my gosh that's an
interesting pattern that looks really
crazy before
actually now makes a lot of sense so a
number of folks have been experiencing
with that kind of stuff we don't know
what the best practices are for every
case obviously to come over to this side
of the room I first of all I one desks
so that did you did you have a
performance related comment i have this
thing I mean when do you need require
kind of like complicated you I maybe
it's not the mother of a page you're
going to be talking about a nap you're
in the different space so I don't think
you can really consider the same case I
think its equivalent it's like you I
mean Instagram is a different case I
guess it's like a hybrid between a nap
and showing content but the case we are
we're having with component sees many
times you're building a complex have
like with you ice and stuff you really
need to wait for the whole thing to wait
like to load like before you can start
like it has to look well yes you can
optimize on everything but has to look
at some point you need to wait it's like
it's all about option value though right
like we don't want to commit to a
technology where you have to say these
are my performance characteristics and
the way that I that we're starting to
think about initial page load
performance now is that when you open
your mac laptop or you open an app on on
an iOS device you see a static
screenshot of the previous version of
the UI before the real you I actually
initializes now wouldn't it be great if
we could build all of our web apps like
that we can render it on the server send
down a static HTML page that can be
cached and reanimate it with JavaScript
so i'm just i hate that i would i would
kill but yet we can have the choice
though okay would you want that choice i
guess the point is it's still up to the
developers to figure out how best to use
these tools for their particular uses so
can i say as it like a someone who's not
involved in a high level of creation and
kind of an end user of them for us the
choice often comes down to is it better
than what we got now so if we want to
use something like jQuery UI or
something or an existing UI library do
web components make that faster or
better I can't really tell that until we
have them natively they're implemented I
think personally I think there will be
better but I don't I can't really test
that until World finished implemented I
want to come back to the server side
rendering point you
made and I react has a mode where you
sort of chips down the rendered
components directly in the main body and
we actually have found this is an
example where some people have explored
using going all web components teams at
Google who were prototyping on this
actually found there were people who
were big opponents of server-side
rendering they actually found in some
limit in some cases that it was actually
faster to just heavily catch the
components client side and then just
ship down the sort of component-based
markup and have it inflate locally
that's pretty similar what we found as
well but we found that the best thing is
that you want some of your components
rendered server side some of them
rendered client-side and choosing that
mix yes that depend on mobile as well
because they think the rendering is
going to take a lot longer clients I
don't know yeah the performance
characteristics but how much CPU have a
move machine network speeds latency that
kind of subtle definitely I think so
also I want to open things up to the to
the audience here and I'm looking over
to Andrew is there I mean we're out okay
so want to make sure so yeah another
thing too is that we found again the
polymer team in particular is on is
actually part of the larger blink team
it's a polymer guys the way I think of
it as kind of a moment some means to an
end making sure there's good feedback
going to the specification process
because it's very hard to design complex
specs in a room just for discussion it's
also we're identifying use cases that
make a lot more sense in the web
components world and the little yellow /
bag you know hey Adam this is something
we run into a lot this is a very common
pattern and say oh yeah we can actually
you know if that power is gonna be
common we can do other positions in the
engine so imagine this new world you'll
see that different patterns become more
common or think
we optimized sorry interesting though
because if you look at the UI libraries
that are out there you know bootstrap or
jQuery UI or object oriented CSS any of
them they're solving the same 50
problems over and over again so while I
really like web components and that you
can do anything with them I think maybe
the browser should have solved those 50
things like tabs and carousel and some
basic stuff that's on like every site in
the universe that we need 0 JavaScript
for those things is really good for so
we actually should should move on to the
next to the next half maybe we can break
you can protocol sir bookmark that save
it and let's let's bring it to the to
the rest of the session so next I'm
going to ask Jonathan fielding to to ask
his question and so how do components
help or hinder responsive design given
that many queries an alternative
components how do components play well
with responsive design approaches okay
so I'm going to hand that one over to
Soledad first okay um I've got mixed
feelings about that I think that you
shouldn't be building components that
not too much about the look and feel of
the app that thing should be something
from the outside I think like if you're
like improving your component with
aesthetics maybe you're doing it wrong I
think like it should be about
functionality at least in my view and I
think it's a view of everyone else like
and I mean even you have shadow DOM and
you have a scope CSS and things you
can't really put too much look and fit
inside a thing because you want to be
able to same from outer and how break
bones and everything so if you put
everything into a component it's not
going to be reducible which is what you
again I think I think actually there's
cases where you don't want styling you
don't love you too opinion it there are
other cases I think we're developers
would love I think bootstrap is a great
example where it's a well-designed set
of things that you can use that play
together nicely and I think there's a
lot of room here for like a opinionated
UI components but again because people
can choose to use them or they can
choose to lose different libraries but
it's a tool and there's going to be a
special uses I think yeah but you can
really put the whole set of breakpoints
inside the component it's just going to
be a component works only for this page
going to work for another set of designs
that's why such as make it could be nice
good enough I mean that's what we're
doing brick make it look good enough so
that it's not that ugly but don't try to
assume things that people are going to
want make it decent I think web
components kind of put a much stronger
onus on to the developer now than it has
to what's been kind of from the browser
makers in the past two people are going
to start seeing how hard it is to create
for example a select element and make it
accessible and make it responsive and
make it work across platform and we
don't have kind of these dedicated teams
to do that we have to work their stuff
out for ourselves we're going to see
this a few more times than some of the
other topics we talked about i think is
how much more of a building that becomes
on us as developers but it's also like a
good responsibility the fact that we are
shaping these things in the way that we
want to use them we want to be in the
future so you say burden sa is
empowering developers so to your point
earlier nicole you're talking about why
don't we just ship carousel specs your
carousel and ship it before web
developers weren't on the same playing
field as browser vendors so like we
could implement some of these built-in
controls using things like shouted on
that you guys couldn't use and so one
thing that we're excited about on the
polymer team in particular is this idea
that people can play around like there's
a x x desc gift at someone sharing
yesterday it's really cool like I do now
know that to be sterilized and ships and
browsers but the cool thing is that
people can use it and it feels just like
a built-in element and if everyone has
agrees that those are the semantics that
we should use and everyone loves it
maybe that is a target for
Standardization because now we have
developers are empowered to experiment
and to play around and explore using the
same tools that but how frequently has
someone made a built-in element for
picking something and in fact on my
mobile phone it doesn't work or in you
know some other context they haven't
tested for or they're really used to an
Android browser and so they made it
exactly mimic that and so then in
whatever I'm using it feels weird and
has this uncanny valley like it's sort
of that thing but it's not really quite
that thing yeah I think that this is
kind of what we were touching on earlier
and what I really want to jump in for is
there's kind of like two things where
native apps are kicking webs ass the
first is is performance and like
we can go into that forever but the
other thing is that the widgets that you
implement on the web don't behave
exactly like they do on native devices
or you don't have them rather so you
have to basically polyfill them and they
don't pay him exactly the same so you
know well I kind of believe in the
extends of the extensible web manifesto
where we want these primitives to build
whatever we want it's also important to
get kind of the integration with the
system level components so you're the UI
tableview actually feels like a
uitableview on an iOS device in it the
equivalent feels like the equivalent
legit on Android so I'm gonna do on that
I'm gonna go to the to the audience a
little bit we have Remy sharp some work
my question was alright alright so
that's let's go to Jake yeah so this is
on guards to do responsive design thing
and yeah like having everything as
components makes total same thing but
don't we have a fundamental problem that
we don't have a component model for
responsive design when we use media
queries they are to the viewport not to
the component so the question is about
you know what they're mean I own every
state it without restating it I red tab
Atkins wrote a very thoughtful article
on this thing because having responsive
components that are just responsive to
kind of in themselves and not to the
viewport is a great idea it been floated
many times but there are very very hard
technical problems to overcome before
that I can't actually remember exactly
why so basically any time you're going
to have rendering that where the child
can influence the parent and the parent
can influence the child you can have
loose in your rendering and that can't
work like we die that can't be a thing
that can be implemented and so yeah it
comes up perennial II that people want
to be able to have like a media query on
a particular elements with but like we
need to let that go it cannot work hey
step is a very thoughtful post honest I
can't memorize computed never once you
know but and one thing that we found is
a polymer where we really embrace it
everything as an element almost to an
extreme is that you build your app kind
of and you're like oh I'm always going
to top the whole thing and then next
week you write another app that has like
tabs with you know different
applications inside of it kind of and so
it's important as a component author to
think not just how am i using this but
what other contexts could I be used in
some of the tools egg media queries
might make more sense for elements as
well but again there are some challenges
to deal with there okay before we move
on to the next topic we have jetan are
sorry Ivan if I'm mispronouncing your
name we highly design applications it's
really important to preserve the
behavior
any thoughts quick thoughts you can it's
up to the component authors do what they
want I thing could be a spectrum of
opinionated UI components that are
feeble ones they have no opinion on you
why but there's scope style which which
helps with this yeah but also I think
that you know that only gets you to a
certain point right like at some point
you know the appearance of your element
has to be coupled with changes in
behavior as well so i think really
focusing on the composition of elements
and how you know I've got a component
like do I want that full drop-down
functionality like what if I want to add
separators inside the drop-down element
and that part that developer didn't
think of it so we need to think it
really in terms of composition not only
of styling but also of behavior and the
way that data flows between components
as well so before we move on to the next
thing I just want to get Jonathan you're
on the cue quick comment so you've got
some cows you want to the mobile on you
look as we look to the video mobile such
an obvious responsive site would you
show and hide different components or
it's going to be up to the developers in
different cases and we play around with
on the polymer side most of the UI
elements we have now are just
explorations well in just like just like
building the UI libraries of you know
that have come up until now I think
their UI libraries that are very
opinionated like this thing is going to
be exactly this whip and it means you
can only use it when magically that's
the width you need in the better UI
libraries and the ones that have sort of
emerged are the ones that build tabs
that fill in whatever space is available
that's there was there was also a
earlier part as part of the earlier
website sweet there was an idea of these
things called decorators which are HTML
markup applied with CSS so you can apply
you can apply different markup to use
your media queries in that way again
there were like insurmountable technical
problems we've been doing that and
that's had to be dropped so I don't
think this is something that's going to
be easily easily achieved so I'm gonna
have to cut it up there because we need
to move on to the next thing which is
Joshua peek can you please speak your
mind
we get it went like I've done a lot of
work on github implementation of content
security policy wondering how web
components fit into CSP polymer and
other poly pills make use of evil in
HTML imports the way to declare the
scripts in line in general how are how
what web components become another
attack vector and what's the general
story for security so we're adding we're
adding some new tools about taking
others away it is possible to use web
components within a very restrictive CSP
environment for example Chrome apps you
have a very strict at CSP environment
and although by default polymer we
recommend people will define their
script right in line with the templates
there's a version of our vulcanized tool
that will allow you to actually have
those as external scripts that will obey
that ocsp policy not be about and I mean
connects to the page other thoughts on
security in general as well like it
really occurred to me when when I was
reading this question about you know
that I think I added the thing about ken
Ken Ken that can web components be a
vector for attack in some way and I
guess I thoughts on that from any of the
any of the panel I say we should define
a me you still have the exam content or
a chain restrictions it's just in
JavaScript it's not different JavaScript
this is still think that it's mine in
the same way that all their jobs get it
running so you should still get your
browser angry if you do something
inappropriate so I think we should be
fine haven't tried to break it yet and
they're 0 number of attackers have used
third-party content for example if you
don't have if you don't use CSP and
coors effectively there's attack vectors
on the web today this isn't changing of
that if you're using someone else's
hosting at the components sector to be
clear by the way that Xiao Tong does not
provide a security boundary that's a
sometimes we see from people and we have
I frames for the security boundary but I
shadowed on it just provides a much
stronger like style encapsulation but
ultimately it's a boundary that can be
crossed any thoughts on the security or
CSP dad that's really not my area to
know ok maybe we move we've we move on
then actually in so now i'm going to i'm
going to ask Stuart and gets drawn
map yeah so do you think web components
open the door for developers to abandon
semantics are we going to end up with a
million different home runs select
widgets and what is the meaning of a tag
name if that happens so I'm gonna ask a
call to to feel that one um so I'm
probably going to give a little bit of
an unpopular point of view here I like
semantics on a gut level but when I'm
making a decision about what to do for a
project I try to keep in mind what I'm
actually trying to get out of it and
what semantics actually give me because
in a lot of cases we give way too much
weight to semantics and we aren't
getting enough out of it for basically
the value that we're trying for so
basically i think that there's semantic
value and accessibility and we get that
from Aria roles and now our roles what I
think is great about Aria roles is that
they're divorced from whatever markup
you happen to have used and so we're no
longer relying on some implicit
connection but instead we're basically
getting the semantic value from
something we can tag on to anything so I
think that that's important and then the
other value that we get is sort of
developer maintenance and how developers
will understand our code later because
those are basically the only two things
that use semantics and I think that
actually being able to write custom tags
has a chance to make it and being able
to hide a bunch of junky markup gives us
a fairly good not junkie but
presentational
basically gives us a chance to to be
able to have a cleaner HTML that
contains just the things that are
relevant to understanding what's going
on would you say abandon semantics I
mean we've abandoned semantics if you
open up the devtools inspector on any
page you see a whole bunch of stuff
that's meaningless the cool thing about
shadow DOM is you can take that
presentational gunk that's required is
sort of store it off to the side and so
if you look at pages that are written in
a web component Z style you look at it
you can understand it like it actually
makes sense reading it I also think that
we abandon semantics because the the
components that we're shipping in the
browser things like input and select
they're great but there weren't that
many of them as you were saying I mean
there's no carousel built into the
browser and so it's allows us to create
that maybe for the carousel there
shouldn't be just right yeah i pad but
about saying I think this allows us to
create those things and actually
represent the more semantic semantically
in ways in yeah we're talking about so I
got Remy on the cue I just wanted to
pull him in sorry yeah can we get run me
and Mikey up here so when we we're
rushing to make all these these
libraries koala bear and so on with
Russian Crete web components and this
kind of hangs a little bit of a blocking
thing but we're making old mistakes we
rethink repeating old mistakes like
local storage is good example of new
technology came out a few years ago that
was their kind of you know throw bombs
and it's not a synchronous and
warned against using it but we're
repeating the same mistakes were made
but the opportunity with new
technologies and not make these mistakes
and make sure that everything is is good
for going forward since it's a effects
of that clean slate right so but there's
no such thing is they're like we are
always going to make mistakes like we're
gonna I'm not sure sure no I agree
unknown mistakes that we're going to
create the first place but knowingly
develop against mistakes well I think
that a lot of those mistakes come from
this we're not sure the browser is an
SDK or a runtime right so like it
wouldn't make any sense for you to have
your opengl calls be semantic right but
opengl is a very performant api so why
do the data structures that we've
rendered to the rendering engine we have
available to us which is the dom why do
those have to be semantically i don't
even think about that why do we think
about like we talked about you know we
need to make this performance and
expressive and like sometimes those are
at odds with each other so i think that
the reason why you get things like
synchronous local storage is because the
fast api the fast primitive is an
asynchronous call right but the easy api
is a blocking call and so we need to
basically make a decision like are we
going to make the browser an SDK we're
gonna make it like visual basic or are
we going to make it like lipsy right and
it's it's still this kind of
Frankenstein is the we can meet the web
community prefer the easiest solution
and will always take this short route to
actually getting the thing live so it
means weak weak like killed forms in the
browser or take a look as a community
because we're great copying paste very
great just ripping a positive code so if
you have the opportunity to like the
baseline doesn't have those kind of
blocks built into it or mistake to go
into it then that seems like the right
so for me this is this is a very complex
topic I'm not going to pretend to know
all the details I watched this be argued
many many times by very what people
watch more than me in this issue and and
it inevitably after hours of discussion
I'm gonna go oh I get it now but it's
one of those things that's very hard to
explain like I can't do it effectively
maybe we have some of those more people
in
so so first of all floor &amp;amp; Eggar and we
get him a mark I'm like if we are not I
wonder if you're not hiding a lot of
stuff in abstraction when we are using
web components doesn't it affect
maintainability and and actually you
hurt reuse because we're building again
the 100 different select boxes because
we all have just a little bit different
use cases I think using web components
it's very clear it's it makes your code
much more maintainable because you can
think more in your local context you
don't have to worry about what other
someone else elsewhere in the page has
done what kind of styles I'd put in the
global style sheet because you have
stoped scope Styles because you have
this nice encapsulation mechanism you
can think much more locally it's really
freeing as a developer to be able to
think like that because today if you
have more than three people working on a
site together they have to coordinate
they have to say well don't do this
thing and please make sure your
selectors don't accidentally select over
into my area and actually we've my
personal experience on a lot of people
have used web component so far I spend
it's actually far far from one other
thing wheels yeah it's like the as I
mentioned before it's like is it better
than what we have now what we do now is
we just get a load of dibs with classes
attached to them and attach the things
to that and it's all put directly into
the mark-up of the page it's all in the
Dom tree now I think that what web
components bring through encapsulation
through scope styles I think that makes
that better and more maintainable it's
not going to stop people from writing as
I said a proliferation of crap that's
never going to end that's what we do
until we find that maybe we settle
that's the web proliferation of crap
until maybe we settle on you know
something like brick or polymer or the
two of them together come up with
something that we're all so enamored
with and we decide to let's be mature
about this and stop reinventing anything
when has not ever settled on anything
but one thing is i think is very
important about this is that web
components to the extent they pretend
that
other elements to extend that there
could take in configuration two
attributes or methods and properties on
the prototype and that they admit events
more interesting things happen it
doesn't matter how they're implemented
on the inside so you can use an ex tied
component right next to a polymer
component or within one another and it
just works so so I agree with the spirit
of abstraction encapsulation but web
components deals primarily with scope
style and honestly the coal saw that a
couple years ago and with
object-oriented that's all things but in
order to make object-oriented CSS work
you have to have a lot of developer
rigor and everybody else to be on the
same page about making sure it isn't
even on the same page you know when
someone's just learning CSS they're
gonna make a thousand mistakes before
they're ready to write something that's
really encapsulated and then there are
other problems where you can't
encapsulate it right everything styles
are going to flow through two children
yeah I'm speaking from like a very
Facebook specific perspective where we
can control our engineering organization
yeah but the problem is is that like
that's that's the easy part counselor
that's hard for different even the large
organization everyone being paid by the
same person we're under this a google
all the time well we ever get white
singlet um okay before we move on yes
okay I have experience of building
things with compliance to usable things
and they were great if you don't I can
show you like if you've entrusted all
this guy's our way to the break what one
more comment maybe from the audience
before we get guy from a can i we get it
yeah just a brief I mostly wanted to
kind of highlight some of the comment
that Remy was getting too so I mean when
you look at the existing successes we
have like node is you know one of these
kinds of Fame's that it forces you to be
asynchronous right the a lot of the
problems that we have on the flip side
of that if you look at the async widgets
that you know anything that didn't ship
as a sink widget before Facebook for
Twitter we're stuck with those things
now so I do think that there is strong
merit in taking taking away some
flexibility for favorite performance or
in favor of she's been helping it make
a little bit harder to shoot yourself in
the foot so to be clear HTML imports
don't block scripting script and parsing
of the main document they don't they do
block rendering just like style sheets
do today but again if you want to render
something fast you can put things
directly in your document you don't have
to use HTML imports for everything the
the recurring theme within Facebook
engineering is one word and it's
predictability it's like you want to
know what's going to happen when you do
something with node you know everything
is going to be a sink out of the box
unless you're using a weird likessee
extension right with the Dom like yes
there is a fast fat but it's so easy to
fall off the fast path like you don't
know what's gonna happen you have no no
idea to predict no way to predict what's
going to happen because you have to
reason about the entire system as a
whole which i think is an argument for
building abstractions on top of you know
fast underlying primitives like you
talked about and I think that's the way
forward I don't think baking more
functionality into this unpredictable
tom is the way forward we're going to
move on I'm sorry Christian but you'll
have a chance to talk later so the next
topic is going to be introduced by core
Mel lesinski what's the story of
internationalization of components does
the user of the component can inject
strengths in the component or does the
component have to have hooks for
internationalization again this is the
area where the best practices of people
are still being pioneers in the space to
see what these new tools do in different
cases it will depend I think but we were
in experiment number approaches on
polymer I think that it will depend for
different code bases potentially I can't
speak to the spec but we've been
building component architectures at
Facebook for a long time and it's made
internationalisation a lot easier
because your components you basically
say hey this this is my
internationalized text label component
and you drop that in wherever you need
to internationalize text or you know and
within that you can have tokens like oh
this is my this is my users gender
component and they don't know you know
look at the user object and it'll say oh
is male or female and you know put the
right string in there and so when you
build with a component architecture the
composition possibilities make
internationalization a lot easier and we
built tooling around that for our own
systems including react in xhp that
people don't even really think about it
so much these wrap their strings and
iPads this will be one where I think
sorry to bang on the same drum again but
it puts more of at the emphasis on you
doing the right thing if you make UI
elements and I think in most get like
mostly if i'm not mistaken all of the UI
elements we have at the moment don't
include any text by default so you just
drop your own values into that but if
you create a UI element that does have
text in there by default the onus is on
you to put something in there to make
that internationalized or you know make
your work open source and let other
people do that for you so what if one
matter point I want to make is that and
because web components are get this era
of ability for very cheaply like they I
think x tags and brick interrupting with
palmer is a great proof point for that
it means that today it's different than
what happens today so today as a
developer you pick up framework you
write you at the beginning you say okay
well this framework has 20 widgets that
look pretty good I guess but then you
get to them and there's you know maybe
their calendar widget isn't accessible
or international I zabal and because the
competition is on the framework level
you don't necessarily get the framework
at the component level whereas with web
components it's well sort of better like
that you know thinking of the frameworks
that we have today the amount of stuff
you have to pull in in order to make
anyone I mean you could choose pick and
choose and take you know one piece from
one framework and one bit from another
but the amount you have to pull in in
order to do that my worry is that each
component is going to depend on a whole
bunch of dependencies and they're going
to end up actually putting it or not are
the reason that's the case today is
because we have to create our own
parallel universes and use the Dom just
as sort of the rendering layer and
that's it actually one of the cool
things about polymer is most of the code
size is that layer of polyfills which is
completely unnecessary if that if the
browser you're using ships shadow Dom
custom element HTML imports etc so it
goes oh it goes way way way down in size
as browser to ship those natively so
talk to the topic no I think custom
elements are just dumb elements so you
can just use your current
for internet internationalization say
i18n yeah or Elton and yes I've been
I've been crying some tests and it works
great with mobile and everything you
just do is like add your custom data to
this to translate things and it
translates think I'm it's just another
element so it's it's just that one to
create it but it works like any other
thing works yep any other comments to
call did you want to know ok ok so I
think given that will move on to our
next possibly related topic which is
what's going to be asked by George
Thomas hi how could web components be
used to enhance accessibility can shed
standards for interaction be developed
to the agreed upon the common components
so we accessibility is incredibly
important actually Alice vauxhall who's
going to be speaking on what a leader
panels is on the chrome accessibility
team has been working very closely with
some folks on the polymer team and the
web components tanners folks and I
shouldn't we shouldn't rattled too much
into general accessibility issues
because we're gonna have a whole panel
on that later so I was almost reluctant
to feel this question in the panel that
I do but you know what are the web
components specific issues that have
cropped up around accessible so our
understanding or believe in Alice can
correct me if I'm wrong here is that
actually we think that it should be
possible to make things just as
accessible as before but in addition
because people can be because we're can
be competition or level components
they'll be much more pressure on
component authors to create accessible
and nationalize able components and so
actually accessibilities one of those
hard things for developers to wrap their
heads around sometimes it's one of those
things they put off til the end but if
you use a component that's already made
accessible that's actually great for
users because it's more likely that you
don't have to do all that thinking
yourself every single time you use it so
I'm actually more I'm hopeful that
excessively so we will get better
components well it's funny to see it
getting better than Nate
UI control stone and you can yeah so the
best practices of using native UI
controls were necessary or where
relevant makes sense in the barrio as a
fallback if you don't somebody so I'm
like I'm like the world's biggest
Dominator here and I'm excited about
shadow Dom because being able to style a
select component is like the prime
example of how awesome shadow DOM is I
think because like we have our custom
select element component at Facebook
that matches our interface guidelines
and it's like a zillion lines of code
and then a zillion extra lines of code
on top of that to get like the tad
behavior right for accessibility now the
browser and the operating system are
already have already done all that work
for each platform so we can leverage
that with shadow Dom so I'm really
excited about that additionally the way
that we use a component architecture at
Facebook we don't use the web component
standard but we use the same kind of
ideas of encapsulated UI elements rather
than templates or traditional MVC is we
have a library that has been developed
that is already accessible and ready to
go and you just you know people who
don't know much about accessibility just
going pull the point off the shelf drop
it in yeah I mean that we've been
talking a lot about kind of creating
your own totally bespoke custom elements
but we shouldn't forget that's a big
part of it as well as extending existing
elements becomes very very easy through
web components as well you can take your
select box which we seem to be using as
the default go to for whenever we talk
about it and just add your own things to
it but the underlying you know the mark
up inside that inside the shadow Dom
still remains as accessible as it was
before when we are creating our own
elements again we have to build we have
to make accessibility into it but you
can put Aria roles on to these things
you can do all that if you view the
shadow Dom of any element that exists
out there you'll see that they've got
Aria roles in there already we should be
using that as a model of best practice
but it is a concern because I don't like
the question I know there's a lot of
accessibility thrown around here by not
experts I'm scared of what's going
okay if you have a whole session on
later and we're going to talk about Aria
later actually I think yeah I do notice
that there we have 0 people connected to
the hood to the system so okay that's
what I thought so if there's somebody
wants to ask you a question related to
this okay yes Jeremy yes this is related
to accessibility and semantics as well
as you pointed out Nicole it's one of
the reasons for semantics to exists is
this exposing hooks for example to
assistive technology but to say then
we're all sort of because we've got area
so no problem first of all aria is
intended as a stopgap solution working
towards Native semantics that's the end
goal aria is to get us there also if the
whole point of web components that we
can invent these new you know browser
elements effectively but then in order
to make them accessible we are
restricted to what area can do then
we're just passing the buck to area on
unless there is a concept of Aria
components then web components will all
be using a small pool of accessibility
hoods which limits their scope which
kind of goes against whole point the web
components we agree with the person that
be not neces I'm my experiment
accessibility I guess maybe this is the
best of her to the accessibility panel
well well you just need to make the
primitives you have for composition as
expressive as possible right like like
the only way to solve this problem is to
be able to compose more complex things
out of simpler things that are
accessible and somehow make the system
as a whole accessible right so web
components need to be or whatever
component architecture you use need to
be as expensive as possible and it's not
just Aria attributes that's not just
styling its behavior and I think you
have to be able to compose with a full
like the full power of a real
programming language to do that and you
need to be able to override Pacific bits
of functionality so part of it is kind
of the architecture of the system you're
using and part of it is the power of the
primitives that you have which is why I
think composing with Dom elements isn't
powerful enough and let me get composed
with like Turing complete programming
languages to do this I think you're also
bringing up something important which is
that the whole web community is
suffering with the fact that the
accessibility side of web standards and
the web and and other side of except of
web standards don't talk to each other
nearly enough and haven't figured out
how it's supposed to work together very
easy and so I think a lot of this we
don't we don't actually have answers for
it isn't I mean yes we're not
accessibility experts but also we don't
know how it's supposed to work together
and the standards teams themselves
aren't really working together other
gentleman in the front row can you
introduce yourself as well hey matt
baume the question was kind of raised of
like you have accessibility on the web
today how does that apply to polymer
components is there anything polymer and
just web components in general can do
that would be basically make excessively
accessibility better in other words
ignore what today is if you could change
it and make web components accessible
ignoring everything now what would you
do like for me you could add lifecycle
event saying you're going to get focused
deal with it like that should be part of
web component that they have to deal
with at that point yeah and
accessibility experts on your sense I
mean this is a big loop with the shadow
times trying to solve right like like
select boxes seem to be pretty
accessible at least they do the same
semantics that the operating system does
one of the things on Nicole mentioned
this before is the more native UI you
expose in the browser the more you can
reuse from from the experts that have
actually implemented it right Remy I see
your hand up but I we are going to move
on and pick and we are going to pick up
this topic hopefully in in christian's
accessibility panel as well so I hope
that we revisit this as well our last
question of this topic some guy named
Andrew bets
possibly needs to ask this so it's a
long e it's a web components are more
widely supported in what use cases would
you consider polyfills like polymer or x
tags actually got already in what use
cases would you consider polyfills like
polymer or x tags / alternative
component frameworks so what extent to
the existence of polyfills hinder or
slow down the implementation of web
components so I think I couldn't hear
that polyfills so the question is about
is really related to polyfills and I i
think the crux of it is you know are the
existence of polyfills going to hinder
or help the adoption or the
implementation of web components you
know within browsers within in general
in the developer community and any
thoughts on that I think it will help
that will help the adoption with other
than other browser vendors because it
allows developers to use the
technologies today in a way that
actually works quite well it's just when
the native implementation is there it's
much faster and so like shout on for
example is a very complicated thing to
polyfill it's not possible to do it 100%
perfectly CSS in particular is very hard
to call it though correctly there and
then when it's in support natively it's
just much much faster it just let you
down the script I see somebody who might
know something about polyfills asking a
question it's not specifically polyfill
spurt and when we get to the day when
we're including polymer and we're
including this other web component
becomes from another website and another
web promoter from another website and
all the magic is kind of tucked away
between my ex gift tag
those web components that can be
carrying all their own JavaScript for
instance and what if they all pull into
our own jquery library or polyfill
supplied refer all that you know they
want to put a different versions of
jquery yet different versions of the
persian is not problem because it going
to be sandbox off right I assume sure
but the overhead for having four or five
web components where they're all pulling
in jobs by the light shape that is
jQuery but from different locations how
do we how do we deal with that how do we
not end up returning to the days of
dynamic drive we're just slapping in big
blocks of code going ok it works so one
of the cool things about HTML imports to
as they can do d duping those resources
so if you different components can rely
on the same thing and it won't be
redownloaded twice of course if you use
some kind of a unification step before
you push production you can make sure
that you take care of that but of course
if you have different versions of jQuery
you're going to want to avoid that as a
developer just like you do today you
don't want you what I'm what I'm talking
about it's like i'm using brick and
polymer together because you've got
different web components i want to use
both them how do i how do i get how does
that people get surface to me i think a
sister respective owners I think it's
pretty much the same I mean you have to
be responsible you had to be many
fighting just using the company's you
want is just like if you just load the
whole jquery UI a huge and it's the same
with breakage you don't know the whole
thing is not a huge but if you see a lot
of things you might not want but you can
choose build your own distribution I
mean you've got script for packing
things like as they do think we call it
as much I don't know what it looks like
a fundamental problem of software though
like it's a big benefit if you coded in
the 90s you know like DLL hell that kind
of thing so i think that the pipe dream
of like going components off the shelf
and dropping them in is way more nuanced
and people normally
say it is like for us we just run it
through a build system and weedy dupe
and alert when there's different
versions you're using your own web part
so you're not using anyone elses would
well we have a component based
architecture that like we own the whole
stack so I wasn't over the back end but
its component based and matches up
exactly with the front end part events
that I changes it so possible
practically today polymer and eggs I use
the same layer of polyfills below that's
a layer that that's where the bulk of
the code is in polymer in particular
remember that goes to 0 over time is the
idea I don't see how that's true though
like yeah that's true in a really simple
component but as the components want to
do all these widgets things it's going
to have the same amount of code that any
library that would have done the same
thing that has necessarily because to
the extent that today a number of
frameworks have no other choice but to
retreat to script and to create their
own world that uses again tom is just a
sort of dumb rendering service in a
world where you're you're working more
closely with Tom you don't have that
overhead we get to create your own world
and create your own concepts this
parallel hierarchy is you know in a
world all right so I'm being told from
the front row that we need to wrap up I
think the my personal may be closing
statement might be a web component some
assembly required right but what is it
big but big but interesting maybe ok so
we'll well we'll leave it at that and
thanks very much and thanks for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
