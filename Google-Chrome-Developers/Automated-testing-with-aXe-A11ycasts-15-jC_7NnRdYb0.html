welcome back to the alley cashew today I
want to talk about how to do automated
accessibility testing using the axe
library so if you haven't heard of it
before axe is a really useful utility
and one of the reasons why I like axe is
because they kind of have this whole
mantra mission statement thing of making
sure that their accessibility tests have
zero false positives meaning they only
test stuff that they're really really
confident that they can say is you know
either passing or failing and the reason
why I like that is because if you've got
a really really big team and you've
you're you know you don't have everyone
maybe bought into accessibility testing
and you've got a tool that's maybe
throwing like flaky errors or something
like that it might be easy for the team
- just like disable that thing or just
start ignoring it
so I love axe because I like the idea of
zero false positive so making sure that
if something's failing everyone on your
team can kind of agree like hey yeah
that's an actual issue so to get started
with axe follow me over here to my
laptop over here I'm just sort of
showing the the github page for axe it's
made by DQ so this is DQ labs
organization this is axe core which is
kind of like the library that powers
everything and you can scroll down to
the readme and see they kind of talk
about their philosophy their their
manifesto and things like that
there's a few different ways to use axe
so for instance you can just as it shows
here you can just drop it as like a
script tag onto a page and it'll start
logging errors that way that's one way
to go about it but what we're gonna do
today is I'm going to show you how to
use it as a Chrome extension how to use
it with selenium and how to use it using
the newly released axe CLI so let's get
started with a chrome extension I'm
gonna go over to the chrome webstore and
just look for acts like a chopping axe
and you'll know it if you've seen this
one of this like a blue triangle thing
here so I'm gonna go ahead and add that
to Chrome yeah so the extension is
really useful if you just want to like
maybe quickly look at a page or a few
pages of your site you don't have a
whole automated testing workflow set up
or anything like that you just want to
sort of look at a page and be like you
know what's what's broken here so I'm
gonna go over to my blog so this is a
Rob Dodson dot me now I know that there
are some issues on this site I found
them during the making of this episode
and I I'm gonna leave them in so you can
see the process in action so what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to open up
dev tools and now that I have that
Chrome extension installed I've got this
little axe tab here so I'm click on that
and there's big analyze button I run
that and it'll now show me over here on
the left some of the issues that I have
for instance I have elements that need
to have better color contrast my HTML
element needs to have a laying attribute
to indicate the language that the page
uses and I have some links that need to
have better discernible text so right
now I have links that probably just say
like more whereas it could be more
fleshed out phrase you know it could be
like click here to read about you know
custom elements or something like that
so let's check out this color contrast
thing so I've got 16 violations that are
showing me here it tells me which of the
sort of standards that we're failing
here so a KAG to double a and also show
me the sort like the selector path to
get at the elements that are failing
right so here I can see it's basically
these anchor tags that are inside of my
my post metadata headers and what's
really cool is I can click this more
info button and I'll take me to a page
called a DQ University which is a sort
of a resource that the folks at DQ run
along with ax and it'll just explaining
more detail what what exactly is failing
here how to fix it and also sort of the
severity of the error so for instance
you can see here this is kind of like a
critical failing when we have bad color
contrast but it's useful so that we've
got like a ton of errors in trying to
prioritize like which to work on first
you can say okay let's do with the
critical ones first and then we can deal
with the minor ones a little bit later
right so I love that they provide this
resource all right so that's one way to
go about things you can use the
extension to quickly look at a page
another way to go about things is to use
a tool like selenium to do automated
testing of your application
selenium if you haven't heard of it
before it's basically a tool that can
drive your browser in an automated
fashion it can you know click on things
on the page open URL send keyboard
events so to do that using ax there's
another variation that we can use called
axe webdriver
this is also available on the github x'
if you scroll down to the readme it'll
have getting started steps so a few
resources that we need to install and
then there's this really helpful snippet
right here that we can actually just
copy and paste and we'll walk through
what's happening in the snippet in just
a sec but let's start by installing
these dependencies so we need X core
right that that library I was going to
show
before we're gonna need ax webdriver j/s
so we'll go over to my terminal and I'm
actually already got my little command
ready to go here so I'm going to MPM
install save and I'm saving to my dev
dependencies because this is probably
not something I want to ship in
production this is probably something I
just want during development time so I'm
gonna stalling axe core I'm also
installing selenium webdriver at the
time of you know this recording this is
also a dependency of the the axe
webdriver project so you wanna make sure
to install selenium-webdriver and then
finally axe webdriver Jas so we'll
install all of those save them to our
package.json file right so we're good to
go there and I'm going to just create an
index J's file open that up in Visual
Studio code and I'm going to paste in
that little snippet that we copied off
of their page right so let's let's talk
about what's happening in this snippet
so the first thing we're doing is we're
grabbing axe builder or axe webdriver GS
this is basically going to be a tool
that will tell selenium how to do
automated testing of the page we're
grabbing webdriver
so that's selenium webdriver is
basically the tool that's going to
automate you know opening up a browser
and sending commands to it we start
things off by creating a new instance of
webdriver and we tell it which browser
we want it to use so it could use
Firefox Chrome Safari what-have-you
in this case I'm going to change it from
Firefox over to Chrome just because I
did this demo earlier with chrome and
I've got that all set up and then once
that's ready we're gonna take our slim
instance we will tell it which URL to
open so here I'm gonna tell it to open
my blog so I'll change that to Rob
Dodson Don me and again if you were
doing automated testing or something
like that you could spin up a local
server and point to that local host like
8080 or something like that that works
this returns will promise for when it's
finally ready to go and then we say
alright take ax builder make sure it has
been passed the instance of selenium
webdriver and then tell it to analyze
the current page and when it does that
it's going to return a JavaScript object
full of results so things that fail
things that passed and what I want to do
here is just log those results I'm
actually going to filter this down to
just log violations
I don't want to see like things that
pass just yet I just care about the
violations right and we're gonna see if
this matches what the Chrome extension
was outputting earlier now there's one
more thing that we need to do before
this is ready to run we're also going to
need to install Chrome driver for
selenium so every browser has a sort of
specific binary that it needs to work
with selenium so Firefox Safari Chrome
they all got a binary that you've got to
go install if you run ax right now and
you don't have one of those binaries
installed will actually log a little
error and it'll give you the URL to
download the correct binary that you
need so I think I've got that URL saved
here so it's at chrome driver dot
storage Google API acecomm slash
index.html I will drop that down in the
show notes we go to this page and you'll
just see a bunch of numbered directories
it's not super helpful I wish there was
just a button that was like get the
latest but basically you can follow the
the the number ordering here even though
this thing says latest release what
it'll do is a little download a text
file and will tell you the number of the
latest release to download so you can
click this if you want and get the txt
file it'll eventually tell you that 2.27
is the current latest release the
numbers just go in order right so two
three four five six seven eight nine and
then it jumps up to two dot ten eleven
twelve right so the ordering is a little
funky there but you just want whatever
is sort of the highest point release at
this point so 2.27 so you click that
pick your platform - Mac 64 zip and that
is going to download a little binary and
what I've done is I've taken that binary
and I've just dropped it into my user
directory
I created a bin directory and I've
dropped chromedriver right in there with
you know another binary that I had from
a previous project right so I'm just
dumping binaries in here the last thing
that I want to do is I want to set that
directory up on my path
so when UNIX is trying to look up that
program it knows which directory to look
into the way that we do that is I'll
show you how to do it on a Mac for PC
windows I'm sure there's some good
instructions out there but I don't know
them off the top my head not a Windows
user but maybe I can add some to the
show notes for a Mac what you want to do
is you want to check out your dot bash
underscore profile or your z shell
config file if you use Z shell which I
do but I'll show you how to do is
profiling so most people use Bosch and
what we want to do is we just want you
drop in a line that looks kind of like
this
so we're saying alright take our curt
path right so export this path variable
we'll say take the current path so let
me say dollar sign path that's basically
what we mean means sort of use the path
variable expand it and then use a colon
to stick one addition to the end of it
so we'll say use our users home
directory right so users Rob Dodson
slash bin okay so now we're saying hey
when you're looking at programs when I
go in the terminal i type chromedriver
look through all the directories on the
path until you get to my user directory
look in the bin folder and you should
see something there right you can verify
that this is worked after you save all
that restart your terminal it's very
important to do that so it loads the new
profile and you can type which
chromedriver
and ensure you give you a path to where
you've got your chrome a driver binary
so now we're actually ready to go we can
run that javascript file that we just
created so I'll do node index right for
my index.js file and this will go out
it'll hit the web and now it is logging
all of the violations from my site and
you can see it's basically the same ones
that we had from that Chrome extension
so it's telling me we've got color
contrast issues and it's logging all the
notes with the color contrast issues
HTML elements a language attribute and
we've got some links that need better
text right so this is what you can do to
start adding acts to your automated test
process and if you go back to the repo
for ax webdriver you scroll all the way
down to the bottom there there's some
examples like this one running a single
rule this example actually shows you how
to use it with with mocha and chai so if
you want to you know integrate it with
some existing test framework you can
absolutely do that and there's some good
docs here that show you how to go about
that the last thing that I want to show
off is very similar to the Chrome
extension and that's ax CLI so it's
basically the same thing but we're
running it just from the terminal we
don't have to write any JavaScript or
anything like that we can just install
it and run it from the command line
whenever we want so if you go over to DQ
Labs slash ax - CLI so this is a
recently released project it bundles up
ax core it actually bundles up the
selenium webdriver stuff as well and it
just lets us run the whole thing from
the command line just as one single
command so we do npm install - g x CLI
so pull that down do-do-do-do MPM does
its thing boom alright and now we're
gonna do basically the same thing but
this time I you know I'll here I'll just
go to my desktop right so I haven't
written any JavaScript I'm just on my
desktop in my terminal and I'm just
gonna run ax and I'll put in my sight
again right and now this is gonna
actually use phantom Jas though I can
tell it to use chrome driver if I want
but it's using phantom Jas to go and
check out my site it's got very pretty
colors now and it's logging all the
issues that it found so very similar to
the Chrome extension but I just run it
from my terminal so I've shown a number
of different ways to get up and running
with ax so hopefully you've got the
tools that you need now to start adding
it to your own process I think it's a
really really awesome project I think
the folks working on it are doing really
killer work so definitely if you like it
go you know star it and support them on
Twitter and tell them that you you think
their work is awesome
and that about covers it for today if
