few tasks running servers optimizing
images and processing source code these
are the kinds of manual tasks that you
can automate with gulp grunt make or
other build tools we're going to use
gulp for some of the more complex labs
in this class so here's a quick
introduction to how it works
gulp reads a file called the gulp file
to tell it what to do this is a sample
gulp file j/s file it's written in
JavaScript with a couple of nodejs
extensions for loading other files the
require statements at the top load the
core gulp commands and the gulp
interface to uglify these are known as
gulp plugins uglify is a program to
compress a minify javascript gulp files
are divided into a series of tasks a
task might run on the server minify some
code or even delete files each task
should be one self-contained action we
define a task named uglify - J s and
write some JavaScript to implement it
the gulp dot source task reads all the
J's files from source /j s we then pass
all of these files into the uglify tool
using the pipe command the output of
each command is ready to pipe into the
next so use the gulp desk command to
write the result into new files under
dist slash j s formally gulp is a
cross-platform streaming task runner
that lets developers automate many
development tasks at a high level
gulp reads files and streams and pipes
then streams to different tasks these
tasks are code based and use plugins the
tasks modify the files building source
files into production files to get an
idea of what gulp can do check the list
of gulp recipes on github gulp is a node
package and the plugins that it uses are
also noted packages so you need to
install node.js first this also installs
a node package manager
you should also enable gulp from the
command line to do this install the gulp
CLI package you can then go into your
project or create a new one and have NPM
install the gulp plugins you need into
your project right your gulp file KS and
you can begin using gulp from the
command line here's an example of
creating a project and it's
Wingull plugins the first line creates a
new NPM project this generates a
package.json file that lists your
project plugins the following commands
install various example plugins
including gulp itself the save dev flag
updates the package.json file with the
corresponding plugin the plugins are
installed in a node underscore modules
directory with this method you can
easily reinstall all plugins in their
dependencies later by using the
package.json file rather than
reinstalling each plug-in individually
note that plugins a b and c are
imaginary we're just using those names
to show how plugins work once the
plugins are installed they need to be
loaded into the gulp file using require
now you're ready to define tasks this
task is named task ABC it takes files
from the some source files path and
pipes them through functions from each
of the plugins which modify the files
the processed files are passed a gulp
test which writes the files to the some
destination path the task we just
defined can be run from the command line
by typing gulp space and the task name
in this case it's gulp space tasks - ABC
here are some more resources for
learning gulp as usual use the links in
the slides or your textbook to learn
more there's no special gulp lab at this
time you'll get plenty of practice in
the lessons after this one once you are
comfortable with gulp there are two more
things you may want to try the first is
to create a default task default tasks
run when the gulp command-line command
is run by itself this code assigns task
1 task two and task 3 as prerequisites
when you run the default task the
prerequisites will run first you can do
this for any task not just the default
you can run this task by typing gulp
space default or just plain gulp on the
command line default is the one special
task that doesn't need to be called by
name the other trick is to make gulp run
tasks whenever your files change in
other words when you hit save gulp dot
watch monitors files for changes when
the files change watch will run the
Associated tasks this code watches CSS
files in the styles directory and all
J's files in the jas directory if any
CSS files changed the process CSS task
runs if any JavaScript file
change the process J s task runs this
watch task is started by running gulp
watch from the command line though this
task can be named anything
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
