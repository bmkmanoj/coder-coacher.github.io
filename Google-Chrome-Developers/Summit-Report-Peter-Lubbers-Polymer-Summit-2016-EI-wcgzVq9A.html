polymer summit and always beautiful
sunny London I am joined with Peter
lubbers peter is helping organize this
event Peter King tell me a little bit
about the the venue that we're at today
of course of course last year we did the
polymer summit as you may remember in
Amsterdam we decided to change it up a
little bit this year so this time we're
in the tobacco dock in London this is a
tobacco dock from the early 1800s of
course tobacco is not very healthy for
you so today we're bringing you polymer
all right Peter can you tell us a little
bit about what folks are going to be
doing here today of course so three
things we have two days of talks and
keynotes then we have the code lamps
which is kind of an instructor-led
workshop format and finally we have the
ask polymer lounge which is where you
can just meet with the engineering team
from polymer everyone's here you can ask
them any question about polymer that
you're working on right on right on
alright so how many folks are we
expecting here today I see registrations
already getting a little filled up how
many we expect in a show up it's
definitely really filling up and we're
expecting about seven hundred to a
thousand people here live in person and
then we have the live stream so this is
something we do for all of our big
developer summits we have it streamed
live and then as soon as the talks are
over we take the recordings of those
talks and we put them on a channel so
for anyone to watch post-event so
excited about that right awesome awesome
alright so Peter thank you so much for
