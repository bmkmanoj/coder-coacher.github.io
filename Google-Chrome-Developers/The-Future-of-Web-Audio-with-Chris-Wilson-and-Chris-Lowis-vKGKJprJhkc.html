advocate at Google and one of my
passions is Web Audio and audio and
music in general so I'm here to chat
with Chris Louis who among other things
is the editor of the Web Audio weekly
newsletter so welcome Chris nice to have
you here or an expert it to be in the
get to be in the same place at the same
time for once just is rather nice so you
know I have to say like first of all
thanks for doing web body or weekly I
think it's a tremendous resource for
anyone who's interested in audio on the
web and and music in general for that
matter I i think the what I'd start off
by asking you is just from what you see
coming through Web Audio what's most
exciting today like what do you find
most compelling so I think the
technology has been around so in it's
big it's in its infancy at the moment we
can say but it's starting to become
something that people are relying on and
can use across lots of different devices
and platforms so I think there's been a
huge early adopter crowd people want to
build digital audio workstations and
modular synthesizers and that kind of
thing really pushing the boundaries
early on which has been great in the
sort of development of the specification
and the capabilities I think we're
starting to see people using the
technology to do really interesting
things that are not specifically for
audio enthusiasts so I'm enjoying the
the work that that people are doing on
cook like collaborative editing of sheet
music and being able to share the pieces
with your with your band mates and sort
of things that when it's on the web and
everyone can just use it and listen to a
part and print out their piece for the
you know for their orchestra for their
band it's kind of putting all of that
technology and software that previously
would have been very difficult to use
and install and very expensive kind of
immediately on the web making it
collaborative and those kind of things
yeah i think the exciting part for me to
is just as you said seeing all these
things that used to be sort of science
experiments now be deliverable on on the
web and on web audio
you know several years ago I wrote a
pitch detect demo like I was like I
wonder how hard it is to use web audio
to tune my guitar it turns out it's a
bit hard but you know I figured out
eventually and I put this demo together
it wasn't a huge deal didn't make a huge
deal about it because it wasn't
particularly well built but I learned a
lot about how tuning works and then last
week one of my my co-workers Paul Paul
Lewis when and built a guitar tuner
which I now have installed on my iPhone
in fact I last week deleted every other
guitar tuner off my phone and this is
what I use to do my guitar tuning with
because it just works I mean it works
like a nap feels like a nap it works
offline etc you followed all the best
practices beautiful interface and you
know uses uses auto correlation to
figure out the tuning and I think that
the same thing is going to become true
as you said sheet music of you know all
these other little pieces of music that
really collaboration is a key feature
and I think the web makes that so much
easier so they yeah I've seen some
interesting things that the BBC and al
Jazeera have done with tools for
journalists in the field where you know
you don't have the time or the space or
already can't carry all the equipment
you need to set up something but being
able to just open it record it do a
simple edit and upload it back 22 home
is straight on your you know story on
your tablet or laptop is you don't need
all of the capabilities perhaps of a
full-blown piece of you know pro tools
like tumblr I think for both of us you
know when we started in in audio the
equipment was a huge amount of stuff you
know that you had to carry around with
you if you wanted to record in a
portable system you had to carry a
backpack full of gear yeah and today you
know most of what you need is in your in
your phone or your tablet or whatever
device you happen to have in front of
you is is probably reasonable to do
recording and editing and everything
with yeah and I mean exciting as well is
just the you know when I was learning
how to program for the web you would
open a page view source you know see the
HTML in a probably no CS
at that time see all the table I help
those kind of things but as it went
along by kind of read a good all this
reading other people's code and that
idea that you know you're kind of just a
JavaScript console away from like a
fully programmable kind of audio
environment just as an educational tool
i think is really powerful i think a way
of getting you know children into
programming or you know maybe people who
have a interest in audio but would like
to do about programming or vice versa
you know this kind of immediately
accessible it's there and and you know
it's it's it's a full-featured
programming language and audio
environment there's not a lot you
couldn't do given enough time and there
are the advances with as usual although
that is I mean we were talking earlier I
think that is one of the challenges
today is building user experiences is is
hard whether it's in native or web for
that matter but building the user
experience is still sometimes a
significant piece I mean like Paul's
guitar tuner is he has a much more
intuitive feel for user experience than
I do so looks beautiful you know it
actually works and it's something that i
can replace my guitar tuner with because
it works just as well as a user and
whether you know technically or not is
is not really the issue but then you
have fina by by putting it there in the
web environment you're opening the field
to such a huge number of people who are
coming from lots of different
backgrounds to do interface exactly I
think there's quite an interesting
movement at the moment of using web
audio and people's smartphones to do
distributed performances of having
audience participation or using the
phone just like diffuse sauce array of
loudspeakers all around the audience and
distributing the sound you know it's you
know one needs any special equipment to
do that but it's also making its opening
up the possibility of like interfaces
for making music and sound to a huge
number of people absolutely yeah we're
pushing the boundaries in that I think
it'll be interesting to see the first
concert where that becomes a thing
instead of holding your phone up you
know just to show the screen like the
old lighter thing you know you'll
actually be participating in creating
the music that's pretty actually totally
possible today yeah given all of the the
features that we have
I think you know the fact that we we've
pushed to get all of web audio onto
mobile and have it work well and mobile
is is a huge piece of this I mean it the
fact that not only does my phone work
well for mobile but my tablet my laptop
my desktop computer by TV for that
matter you know whatever I need as a
surface to interact with it can be there
yeah I think that's going to be a huge
advantage for web audio and and the web
as a music production environment to me
is getting a big screen up with a big
display is actually quite easy but
connecting five of those together
without the web as a collaborative
environment can be quite hard but i can
easily stack you know a couple of ipads
next to each other and my android phone
and a TV and everything and have every
member of the band have their own you
know set list and music chart and we're
surrounded by so it's a prop saying a
few keyboarding things i mean that's
that's another really interesting hey
this is this is a hard-working keyboard
here is my workhorse one on me now when
i will connect connect these i mean you
saying absolutely yeah that was one of
the things that you've seen as really
interesting with with how kind of her
traditional kind of in gentlemen
manufacturers are embracing the web
using web media and web audio too soft i
think between you know having devices
like this there are an easy and obvious
much more intuitive controller you know
the first thing that this actually was
where web MIDI came from is when I first
saw Web Audio and looked at you know
that the first question I asked myself
as a synth geek from the 80s was can I
build a synthesizer with this and it
turns out the answer is yeah actually
fairly simply and so I built this and
then immediately I was like wow I can't
stand using my computer keyboard to play
music with like that's not it's not a
musical instrument to me and the latency
untouch input was problematic at the
time and using a mouse to tap on screen
keyboard don't even want to go there so
I want to be able to plug a device like
this and you know i have i have piles of
synthesizer keyboards at home and
controllers
want to be able to plug those in as well
so you know why can't we do that from
the web so I went and you know made a
proposal about web MIDI I got some
people excited about building it
internally in chrome and now it's now
it's a thing they're building it on in
Firefox today and we'll hopefully we'll
see it in the other browsers as well but
I think that that idea of I can use
whatever devices is attached to my local
my local keyboard like I don't see this
isn't going to be something that every
web browser in the world has a MIDI
device plugged into but if I want to be
working on music likely the device i'm
using has midi supporting acts or or
audio if not midi in which case we need
audio i/o at the worst lately well the
interesting thing about midi as well as
it's not just we're not just taking a
web platform back to the 80s it's it's a
simple kind of a simple protocol on that
yes you know you can you can get a
library for an Arduino that will do MIDI
and suddenly you can connect excitement
into your web applications right it's it
doesn't necessarily even need to be an
audio application to have that bringing
kind of hardware devices and connecting
them yes I mean midi has a very simple a
sort of protocol for the basics you know
the controllers and and note on node off
messages but then it has this massive
like open-ended expansion that it
details what you can do or what the
parameters of how to build your own
custom things and manufacturers are then
going nuts with that for 30 years now so
like there's there's plenty of extended
uses of MIDI beyond that but but the
basics are still there and the basics of
I want to be able to plug a controller
in and play notes on a piano keyboard
that's quite a powerful thing or you
know I want to be able to plug in my
drum pads and play in a beat very easily
or use the pads on that keyboard over
there to play in a beat that's that's
quite a powerful thing to be able to
easily do and for educational purposes
as well I think this is immense I've
seen a number of companies like piano
Marvel I think and and other ones and
notation software like note flight and
you get
these these experiences where you can do
training so much better when you have a
computer connection and any time you do
that but you require a certain you know
operating system and configuration and
you have to put your laptop right next
to your piano and and hopefully it
recognizes the notes or whatever that's
not a great experience for for students
and having been a piano student myself
you know I know the hardest thing is you
go off you know you have a lesson maybe
once a week and in the meantime you just
practice by yourself and hopefully
you're getting it right but now you know
software can actually watch that and it
can guide you even when you're not there
with your instructor at the time and it
can say hey your timing is a little
rough on this part and here's how you
need to correct it things that you know
otherwise it would have you would have
been practicing it wrong for a week and
then listening to your instructor say
nope go back and do it again yeah and
that I think that kind of education is
is massively helpful and at the same
time you know screens and web browsing
capabilities are are essentially widely
available at this point you know I have
multiple iPads and tablets and and
phones in my house I can put any one of
them up on my piano and use it as sheet
music notation or or a backing score
even yeah and had that play that that
for me so I think that's pretty
compelling yeah I mean one of the things
that I'm not so familiar with but you
talk to a lot of people about his games
like games isn't Webster I'm wearing out
with audio and yeah games is a really
interesting one because i think that you
know i remember back in like that late
late 80s Early I guess the early 90s
more there was a push to start using
MIDI in games this idea that you could
provide really good quality music at a
low bandwidth by using MIDI and it turns
out that wasn't a great idea because
people don't have the same MIDI
synthesizer even general MIDI it's not
identical and musicians you really want
to make sure that the bass drum does
sound exactly like the bass drum you
programmed not some other rough
approximation but the audio capabilities
are the audio needs for gaming is
something that Web Audio was originally
it was very closely designed for that as
well as for pro audio specifically when
you have a game and you know you you
fire a laser in the game you want to
hear that pewpewpew sound you know right
when the user hits the button right when
when the gamer is expects it to happen
and this is something that HTML did not
do well like the web platform did not do
well prior to this because it the audio
element and previous ways of playing
audio they wrapped up the stages of
loading decoding and playing all
together and they weren't very precise
they didn't you know it didn't have this
sort of sample accurate ok start playing
the sound right now and oh by the way I
may have five copies of this sound or
five sounds that are overlapping each
other playing at the same time and Web
Audio gives you that really low level
schedulable control which is pretty
powerful I think there's a lot of
there's a lot of capabilities there that
are are not yet fully utilized but even
the basics are so much easier with Web
Audio I think we're already seeing we're
already starting to reap the benefits of
that in some places and now that the now
that Microsoft is shipping Web Audio
support in their edge browser release
coming soon i think it's it's even
better because now we have it across all
of the the major browsers so I and you
know the that compatibility is a
tremendous benefit yeah so what else
what else is is exciting I mean what
else do you think is is upcoming that's
going to be an interesting direction I
think what's perhaps slowing down the
adoption from people who are currently
working in kind of computer music or
audio is maybe the fact that the Web
Audio API
isn't the same as what they're currently
using so so we've had we've had for
quite a while an idea of running
arbitrary audio processing code in
what's called the script processor but
we're trying to move away from that
because the model is correct is not
suitable for purpose but but you editors
of the spec and those working around it
we're kind of looking for a way of doing
that and I think that's I think that's
very interesting I think it's you know
speaking to to a few developers who are
looking to see if they can you know
effectively compile pure data or see
sound kind of patches that perhaps
they're using to write audio engines for
you know iOS or Android applications and
be able to reuse the code within the
platform for me personally it's a little
bit sad because it breaks that view
source thing if I got a few source and I
see just a load of you know hello to
webos MJ of generating a raise of right
of audio dryer it's a bit harder but in
terms of in terms of providing a
platform where people will be able to
start moving this is something I've been
I've been pushing the Web Audio working
group on quite a bit recently has been
that Web Audio is actually a specific
way of doing audio processing and we do
have the this way of inserting your own
I want really customized JavaScript
processing in it the script processor
that's getting replaced by something
currently called audio worker I'm not
sure if it's going to keep that name or
not but that will be much more efficient
at enabling you to do that but there's
this whole spectrum of applications and
experiences like I some people get
surprised particularly when I I was
editing the the Web Audio spent for
quite a while that I'm not a DSP guy
like I don't intuitively understand how
the fft algorithm works or you know like
I haven't spent years and educating
myself about all of digital signal
processing and at the same time like Web
Audio hits about the right level for me
like i do intuitively understand how to
plug these pieces together to get a
synthesizer or a vocoder or
whatever but there are people who want
something completely different and like
one of the scenarios for example is
arcade game emulations where if you want
to emulate a system that used to do
eight kill a bit 8 8 kilohertz 8-bit
audio you know grafting that into Web
Audio is actually quite hard yeah it's
not something that's easy to do today at
all and I think that we need to start
looking at those sorts of scenarios of
how you have lower level hooks into the
audio system if that's what you really
want yeah and certainly script processor
was a first kind of escape valve for
that but I think we need to do more in
that direction too so it'll be
interesting to see where we can go yeah
I mean I think for me and the people I
talked to and the project's actually
working you know the Venn diagram of
people who can do javascript people here
and do a few to music you know people
can do that kind of Web Audio API indeed
that's what intersection is really small
at the moment and kind of pushing the
various I think it is yeah i think the
exciting part to me too is just seeing
those people who can do javascript or
people who are interested in learning to
do javascript grow into the music and
audio space and i still i get a
tremendous number of people who contact
me personally because of the demos that
I've written or the the you know the
spec connection or whatever who are like
hey I saw your you know audio recorder
demo I was just wondering is it even
possible to do X and you know I can
reply back to them and say yeah that's
totally possible you probably want to
look at this bit here go go play around
with it for a while because yeah I can't
do everything of course and I think
seeing people get excited and start
doing start exploring those bits even
when they don't deeply understand them
to start with is is pretty exciting too
and I think that's going to grow the
overall market and and what we see come
out so I think that's going to be going
to be exciting yeah so what else
anything anything particularly on your
mind is areas too
to watch in the future I think an
interesting area that hasn't hasn't
fully developed yet it's just
collaborative tools for few musicians
absolutely yes now use the analogy of
you know when when Google Docs first
appeared and been able to write a word
processor in the browser and people say
well it'll never replace Microsoft Word
right doesn't have all the things that I
need it does right but the fact that you
could collaborate and chat alongside
things and do those sort of meant that
for a huge number of use cases kind of
moved there and I think that's possibly
what we'll start to see happening with
web or do that maybe it's going to be a
long time until I can do all of my kind
of music production in a single
application in a browser but if I just
want to collaborate on a you know on a
drum loop with with some friends and try
out a few patterns maybe say what do you
think about this and I think you should
swap the kick drum out for a different
sound or valium and iming here is exact
and maybe we're taking that out and load
it back into our environment yeah I get
so many people who you know though
they'll ask the question of so you know
I want to build this like real time
collaboration system where I just you
know I pop up on the screen and my buddy
across the country and I can jam
together right it's like well that's
actually quite hard I mean like that
there the network is simply not
supportive of that like the latency
that's inherent in tcp/ip networking
from one end of the country to the other
particularly if you've got a Wi-Fi link
hit each end is is probably going to
make that untenable for many types of
music most types of music but there are
so many other types of collaboration
that you can do that go back and forth
and hook together and if you look at
like the real time differences between
that sort of playing and you know doing
music production or doing even like
playing able to live you know like that
that level of I'm going to hook things
in I'm going to play just a bit before
they need to be played but the system
keeps me on beat and ever
thing that actually is is possible today
with the tools that we have and the
collaboration system there is just
immensely immensely compelling I think
particularly when you add some elements
of offline to that where I can work on
something and maybe my buddy comes and
picks it up you know my musical
collaborator picks it up in half an hour
or something like that that's perfect i
think that's a really exciting place to
go so i think with that we're gonna
we're going to close up it's really
exciting to talk to you i'm glad we
could sit down and have this chat you to
crisis could see in london thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
