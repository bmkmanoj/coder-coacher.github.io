this short series of videos we're going
to set up our polymer environment for
polymer projects and then we're going to
create a polymer 2 element let's get
started with installing the proper tools
so first we're going to install nodejs
my favorite way to install nodejs is
using the node version manager or nvm
you can easily find this by just
googling it for nvm and you'll see this
github thing for creation X at the top
you'll have a quick install script where
you can just copy paste if you have a
bash prompt so here's my terminal gonna
paste it right in and it'll install
alright and once you have that installed
nvm you can install node using NPM
install node and you want to install the
stable version and there you go it
should be set up you'll also see this
last command out of nvm that you want to
either run every time you start a new
terminal or put it into your bash
profile or your bash RC if you're on a
bun to you so I'm on a Mac so I'm going
to put this in my bash profile so I'm
gonna open up vim and put into my bash
profile and you can see I already have
it here but let's pretend I don't have
it and you would just paste it in save
it and you can restart your terminal but
I already have that so I'm not gonna
restart for now I just clear this up now
that we have node installed you won't
install the polymer CLI the polymer CLI
is a tool created by the polymer team
and it allows you to initialize projects
and it has a lot of really nice features
to it we'll go through them one at a
time later so NPM install everyone
install it globally so we're gonna use
the - G flag and we're going to install
the polymer - CL I have that run this
might take a few minutes depending on
how fast your internet connection is and
how fast your machine is alright now
that we have the polymer seal I
installed you can test it running the
polymer command and you should see a
really nice logo right there next we
want to install Bower which is a package
manager that we typically use
Palmer projects so we're going to npm
install we're gonna install it globally
using the - G flag and it's just simply
Bower we're gonna speed everything up
but this should actually take a few
minutes so now we have all the command
line interfaces installed now let's get
started with our IDE and text editors so
you can use typically almost any IDE to
develop with polymer I personally like
vs code and in vs code they have a nice
part where they have extensions and here
you can search for polymer IDE and it's
typically the first one by the polymer
team hit install and then reload your
project alright now we're all set up
let's initialize a project so here I'm
gonna go to my desktop CD to the desktop
I'm gonna make a directory and we're
gonna call it polycast checklist now
let's CD into that and now just double
check we're in there and now let's
initialize our project so polymer in it
is the command to initialize project
just hit enter there you'll get a bunch
of options to create a polymer two
elements an application starter kit etc
we'll go with an element for now the
element name is gonna be polycast
checklist so you can just skip through
this and hit enter for now let's get the
description and it's gonna bear install
all the dependencies cool looks like
we're set up now one last thing
polymer serve will start up a server and
actually show what you have running so
far so here we want to cup the second
one because we're creating an element or
reasonable component so copy that go
over to my browser paste it in and to
that we're running so that's it we've
got our tools installed in our live
environment running the next video will
familiarize yourselves with our projects
layout I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
