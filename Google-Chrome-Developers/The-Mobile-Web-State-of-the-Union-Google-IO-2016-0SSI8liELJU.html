chrome team and I'm very glad to be here
welcome to the mobile web State of the
Union this session is all about the
mobile web what's been happening what's
coming up demos launches case study
stats and a lot more there's a lot
happening here but before we get into
all that let me take a moment to reflect
on why I'm here why I care about the
mobile web and why I think you all
should as well the web is amazing and
it's so familiar to us that sometimes we
take it for granted but just think about
it it's easy to discover web content
through a search engine or just by
sharing a link with a friend and because
everything is a link click away it's
very low friction to interact with the
web just click a link and the web works
everywhere from the earliest pcs and
feature phones to the latest and
greatest smartphones and tablets there's
one thing that all of these devices have
in common they have a web browser the
web has the broadest reach by far of any
platform out there but perhaps the best
thing about the web is how it operates
it's completely open new features new
functionality are added debated and
discussed right there in the open and
the web is decentralized no one owns it
or although we all own it collectively
and it's our responsibility to be good
stewards of the web platform and we work
collaboratively across all the different
browser vendors to make sure we can
uphold that responsibility the web is
one of the most amazing things ever
invented and google loves the web
the web is great for users the web is
great for developers and it's our
mission on the chrome team to move the
web platform forward and to make you all
web developers successful that's what
gets us motivated that's what gets me
out of bed bed every morning that's why
I'm up on stage now the web is more
important to users than ever before four
years ago chrome had no presence on
mobile at all and just last month chrome
crossed and grew to over 1 billion
monthly active users on mobile alone
it's really amazing to see this kind of
growth now while the mobile web is has
the growth of the mobile web has been
phenomenal we do have to remember that
the mobile the web came of age when
computing looked a little bit more like
this and some of you may be too young to
remember the old school Google homepage
but most computing was done on these big
beefy desktop machines connected to an
Ethernet cable or if you want to get
really old school to a to a modem and
then mobile came along and changed the
rules of the game these devices were
small they had less power they had less
memory that flaky networks they had
touchscreens everything was different
and to figure out what would make a
great mobile web experience the web
platform and mobile web browsers had to
do a complete ground-up rethink and I'm
not talking about a few tweaks hear them
talking about going back to first
principles and figuring out what would
make the mobile web awesome and we
believe the keys to a great mobile who
have experienced rests on four pillars
first accelerate the experience make
everything fast make the page load fast
make it scroll fast that's what gets
people in
and once people are in provide an
engaging experience an immersive
experience a polished app experience
that's what gets people to stay and once
you have a fast engaging experience
you're going to get a lot of visitors
the web does have broad reach after all
and so the third pillar is to take all
of those visitors and convert them into
loyal users this could be by having
users sign up so you can personalize the
experience it could be by completing a
transaction or it could be some other
flow and then the final pillar for
mobile web success is that once you have
all of those users you want to retain
them you want to re-engage with them and
bring them back into the experience at
the right time these are all hard
problems to solve and solving them
required many changes to the web
platform and to mobile browsers but this
transformation is now largely complete
it is possible to build a mobile web
experience that is fast engaging good at
converting visitors into users and good
at retaining and re-engaging those users
at the right times we call such
experiences progressive web apps
remember back when Ajax completely
changed what was possible on the desktop
web progressive web apps are that same
fundamental shift for the mobile web and
as you'll see many people are already
deploying progressive web apps and
seeing success with them and I hope that
when you all leave google i/o all of you
will go out and do the same in other
words the mobile web is open for
business
so let's dig into what that means speed
is the killer feature if you have your
finger on a screen and you're trying to
scroll and the page doesn't respond to
your finger right away it's a physically
unpleasant sensation we all know this
intuitively responsive scrolling is not
a nice to have feature it's an absolute
necessity and that there's data that
backs this up for example Facebook did
an experiment where they reduced frame
rates from 60 frames a second which is
smooth scrolling to 30 frames a second
which is slow scrolling and what they
found was user engagement collapses
speed matters we do a lot of work in
chrome to make it easy for you to build
smooth and fast experiences for your
users but sometimes we need your help we
need to work together to provide the
best possible experience for example we
recently launched passive event
listeners this is an API that lets you
the web developer provide hints to the
browser about why you're listening for
touch events and using this API the
browser can do a better job of
responding to scroll and this can make a
huge difference I'm going to show you a
video in a second but just to tee it up
you'll see two phones side-by-side both
running CNN com the phone on the left
your left does not have this API
implement it and the phone on the right
does have this API implemented and if
you can roll the video as you will see
as we start loading up both pages and
scrolling the phone on the left has
noticeable lag between when I move my
finger and the when the page responds
whereas the phone on the right response
right away as i scroll my finger up the
page there's a huge difference in
responsiveness now I'm glad to say that
CNN is rolling out this change to all of
their users as we speak so that's great
news you can go back to slides
it's not only about school
responsiveness studies have shown that
forty percent of users will abandon a
webpage if it takes longer than three
seconds to load and we want to make it
easy for developers to build websites
that are extremely fast and that led us
to create an open source project called
accelerated mobile pages or amp and if
you are here in the session before this
you've heard all about amp but the
summary high-level view is this amp lets
developers take performance to the next
level and make content browsing
experiences lightning-fast amp pages
load four times faster and use ten times
less data and the we launch app a few
months ago and the response has been
tremendous they are currently a hundred
and twenty-five million amp documents
out there from over six hundred and
forty thousand unique domains an amp is
all about the web am content is nothing
but HTML and JavaScript and it's really
amazing that amp shows what is possible
with performance on the web platform so
we've talked about how to make
experiences fast the second pillar of
mobile web success is to deepen the
engagement and this is all about
creating polished app experiences
experiences that are resilient to
network conditions whether you're
offline I'll just have a flaky Network
progressive web apps enable these
engaging experiences through a key piece
of underlying technology called service
workers and service workers provide full
client side control over fetching and
caching and using progressive workers
and progressive using service workers
and progressive web apps you can build
really polished app experiences take the
case of jalan tickets a tech review site
in Indonesia I've got a link to jalan
Turkish and an icon on my homepage to
giantesses progressive web app and when
I tap that icon what I see is jalan
Turkish she
with me a splash screen which is really
smooth and polished and then it loads up
in full screen mode and as I used
navigate around you can see that the
transitions and animations are rock
solid it's a really polished experience
and if you notice there's no chrome you
I hear this is all jolanta kisses
progressive web app progressive web apps
and service workers also enable you to
make your app work really well off line
let's take the example of flipkart a
leading e-commerce retailer in india and
they've built an awesome progressive web
app and it works really well off line so
if i go to flipkart calm and i go
offline i go offline there you'll see
that flipkart cleverly changes the UI to
grayscale to indicate to the user that
i'm offline but the user can continue to
navigate around in the app and even view
cached content it's a very seamless
experience now progressive web apps and
amp work really well together and the
Washington Post has put together a
really cool in integration as well so to
show you this in action let me invite up
on stage David Merrill senior product
manager from the Washington Post
alright thanks for who'll we are really
excited at the post to be able to show
you guys today some new investments
we've been making in the mobile web
space as pretty much everywhere probably
knows we join dozens of other publishers
and Google earlier this year with the
launch of amp and we've been thrilled
with the results so far and lived up to
its name our amp files we see those
articles load an average of 400
milliseconds and that is a huge gain
over the traditional mobile web one of
the great benefits of being with amp
right at launches we can see the metrics
on our end about the load times and we
can also see exactly how users are
reacting to them and not surprisingly
users love it they love the speed before
amp 51% of mobile users who visited the
washington post from google search
returned within 7 days now with amp that
numbers up to 63 percent and we give a
huge amount of credit to the speed of
app for that that data there so we know
that users love speed we know that we
love speed because it's easier for us
and because it makes our users happy but
the question that faces publishers today
is how can we build engaging and fast
experiences that will build
relationships with users beyond the
search carousel as we get people once or
twice a week from search we'd love to
convert those people three or four times
a week every day using new experiences
so we took what we learned with amp we
started working on a progressive web app
and I am thrilled today to be able to
show you guys what that looks like could
we get the phone up on the screens
all right we good all right great so I'm
going to find us a Washington Post amp
article now and live demos of search can
always be a little bit dicey because you
don't know what the algorithm is gonna
turn up off but here we go we've got a
Washington Post amp story right here I'm
going to tap into it everyone here can
see it loads really fast now what you
can't see happening on this amp article
right now is we're using a service
worker to install a very small piece of
progressive web app code into the Chrome
browser so that we can very quickly and
seamlessly upgrade this user to a more
rich engaging experience so for the
purposes of the demo we put a link
straight to the progressive web app at
the top of the menu in the future we're
looking at testing having all links
within amp open to this progressive
experience because users will have that
app already installed so we'll go into
the app now here it is you can see that
loaded really fast we've got load times
here under a second when coming from the
amp page
so once I'm in the app we focused on
making a really smooth scrolling
experience so it feels very native even
though this is obviously the web can
even see at the top Ron Washington Post
calm domain and as we scroll through
articles here we used the ideas and the
principles of amp to make these pages
very light and then we added on the
caching ability of service workers on
the progressive web app to precash
pieces of the article before you even
get there and thanks to that we have
brought load times within this pwa down
to 80 milliseconds for each article and
we were a little surprised we got it
down that low we're certainly happy
about it we think the users are going to
love it so that pre caching that the PWA
gives us also lets us solve another
really important user experience issue
that everyone of the smartphone faces
and that is what happens when you go
offline now in DC lots of people take
the metro to work metro goes above
ground goes underground you're in and
out of cell service so to show you what
we do there let's go to airplane mode so
now just like regular website the
article i'm on still works but because
i've used the progressive web to cache
the content around it I can keep reading
new articles even though I'm offline
alright so that is our new progressive
web experience that we're testing now I
think it really brings together the
power of the web in a great way we've
got that lightning fast first load from
amp followed up by using the service
worker in the progressive web app to do
a seamless really fast upgrade to user
experience that we hope will get people
coming back again and again to the
Washington Post so I'm I really think
this is going to help bring our
journalism to people all over the world
and make it more accessible and we're
really happy about that so I would
invite all of you to check it out you
can get it today on your phones if you
go to any amp article either through
google search or Google News like I just
didn't go to the menu you can go to the
PWA or you can also go to Washington
Post com / pw a on your phones Thanks
awesome thank you thank you David that
was awesome so I hope by now you're
convinced that it's possible to build an
experience on the mobile web that is
fast and engaging and this should get
you lots and lots of visitors because
the web does have broad reach so let's
turn our attention to the third pillar
for mobile web success which is how we
take all those visitors and convert them
into loyal users now there's something
you may have noticed about mobile typing
on mobile is hard this happens to me
more times a day than I can I feel
comfortable admitting in public but
because typing on mobile is hard asking
users to sign in as hard and in fact
we've seen that if a user doesn't sign
in correctly the first time maybe
because they mistype their credentials
ninety-two percent of them will give up
rather than have to retype their
credentials again and we do our bidding
chrome to try and help these users we
have a password manager feature and
through the password manager feature we
try and help users by auto filling sign
in fields
and in fact using our password manager
feature we help users sign in over 8
billion times every single month so
that's great we're helping our users but
we asked ourselves what if you could do
it better and we realized that yes we
can do it better we can do it better if
we turn the reins over to you the
developer and give you control over the
experience so in that spirit I'm very
pleased to announce the launch of the
credential manager API which does just
that this API lets you interact with
safe credentials inside the browser and
it even works with federated sign ins
now one company that's using this API is
kayak and kayak is a travel company and
it's important to them that their users
be signed in so they can keep track of
travel information across devices and
platforms and using this API kayak users
who have saved their credentials and
Chrome will never need to retype them
again and so a user who goes to kayak
and taps the Sign In button will see a
prompt to select the credential they
want to sign in with and that's it
they're signed in one tap and you're in
it's a really smooth experience what's
even cooler yeah what's even cooler is
that guy can remember that the user used
those credentials to sign in so the next
time the user goes back to kayak kayak
can just sign that user in automatically
and so I'm launching up the kayak
website and you'll see a little blue bar
at the bottom that is just saying hey
we're signing you in so the user knows
what's going on but then the user is
signed in the user had to do nothing
zero taps so it's a really smooth
experience
so now in addition to helping users sign
in we also want to help users complete
transactions on the web to pay for
things on the web and we set this
problem up there's just one number you
need to know which is sixty-six percent
there's a good sixty-six percent and a
bad sixty-six percent so the good news
is that sixty-six percent of mobile
commerce happens on the mobile web so
the mobile web is critically important
for commerce on the other hand
conversions on the mobile web happen at
a rate that's sixty-six percent lower
than the desktop web so the mobile web
is critically important for commerce but
it's also very inefficient and we all
know why that is completing if
transaction on the mobile web is hard
there are many forms to fill out the
many screens to go through and many
opportunities for the user to drop off
and again in Chrome we try out bit to do
our bit to help users for example we
have our autofill feature and we try and
fill in form fields to help the user
through the flow and in fact our studies
have shown that users on Android who use
autofill complete transactions and form
submissions on the web twenty-five
percent higher rates than other users so
that's great we're helping our users but
again in the spirit of the credential
manager API we asked ourselves what if
we could do it better and again we
realize yes we can do it better we can
do it better if we turn the reins over
to you the developer and we gave you
complete control over the experience and
so I'm really excited to announce the
launch of the web payments API a new API
that brings one tap check out to the web
for the first time ever
this is awesome so one company that is
look making use of this API to
streamline their checkout flow is
Shopify so this let's take a look at
what that flow looks like so here a user
is using Shopify and they've got some
items in their shopping cart and they're
ready to checkout and when the user hits
check out Shopify issues a payment
request API call to the browser to
pre-fill all of the information needed
to complete the transaction so rather
than the user having to go through a
bunch of form fields and a bunch of
screens the user sees this which is
everything they need to complete this
transaction and when the user hits pay
the transaction is done that's it one
tap and the transaction is done
and this example I showed you this
working with a credit card but this API
also works with Android base we're
bringing Android pay right into the
browser through this API as well and the
flow is exactly the same and in the
future this will work on all other types
of payment applications also and with
all of these api's we're working right
out in the open and we're collaborating
closely across all our different browser
vendors as well so we talked about
making experiences fast making them
engaging converting visitors into users
so let's look at the fourth pillar for
mobile web success which is how do we
then retain those users and re-engage
with them at the right times now one big
thing that change in the shift to mobile
was the importance of push-based
interactions we have these devices with
us all the time and we rely on push
notifications to stay up to date on the
things that we care about and this is
why we are excited about push
notifications for the web these work
exactly i do is expect once a user apps
in to receiving notifications from your
site they will get those notifications
and this they'll get them whether or not
the site is open or whether or not the
browser is open and they show up exactly
where users expect them to see we expect
to see them on the notifications tray or
on the lock screen now one company that
is making use of push notifications is a
company called jumia a large ecommerce
provider and africa and jumia was trying
to figure out how to solve a problem
they had with abandoned shopping carts
and so they turned to progressive web
apps and they implemented push
notifications for the web as a way to
reengage those users who had abandoned
shopping carts and this is early days
but their results have been spectacular
in fact jumia reports that they see a
nine-fold increase in conversions of
abandoned shopping carts for users who
come in through push notifications so
well done jumia
a success that we love to see and it's
not just jumia many companies are
implementing and rolling out push
notifications and seeing success last
November at chrome dev summit we
announced that we were sending out 350
million push notifications every day
across mobile and desktop and today I am
pleased to report less than six months
later that number has grown to 10
billion Bush notifications every single
day and it continues to grow amazing so
there you have it the four pillars for
mobile web success accelerate the
experience make it engaging immersive
and polished convert visitors into users
and then retain and reengage those users
at the right times and to show you an
example of a great progressive web app
one that has made very effective use of
these four pillars let me invite up on
stage hana schwager head of mobile at
air berlin
thanks for having me hi everyone for
those not familiar with air berlin we
are Germany's second largest airline we
fly to 147 destinations worldwide
including San Francisco since May and we
served over 30 million passengers in
2015 as an airline we are constantly
working on new ways to improve the
travel journey right even offline and
it's very exciting to be here today to
tell you or to show you how we have been
building a progressive web app to
improve the customer check-in experience
like any business we know that not all
of our customers will download the app
especially those who are traveling just
once or twice a year and so I've been
looking quite a long time to find a
solution how we can improve or how we
can make can easy check-in experience
why are the mobile web because quite a
lot of people are checking while mobile
web so that's why I'm here today to show
you what we have built within the last
month and therefore I booked the flight
going to Rome I love going to Rome and I
booked it a couple of weeks ago and
everyone was asking me if I want to
accept push notifications why the mobile
web and say well yes why not just give
me a reminder when checking is open so
let's see if it worked
so you can see oh you're checking is
ready it worked out there it is tapping
on the push notification takes me
directly to a page where I have access
to all my flight details where I can
just check in by one click and that's
what we're going to do it really opens
up the page very quickly and just by
tapping get the boarding pass checking
was successful so now i have my boarding
pass right away there thanks to the
progressive web app and i can see ok
there are some journey details ok check
in done boarding 30 minutes just check
to be ready for security and snacks and
drinks will be served right good to know
and everyone is asking me add to
homescreen I think it's it was just a
great experience what I had and I'm
trolling tomorrow to Rome so it's fine
to edit to home screen because then I
have much faster access to all my air
berlin informations right but it's not
only having a cool and convenient
experience with the push notification
for the check-in it's it's more it's
being there for the customer throughout
the whole journey so as all of you know
that often on int on airport the
internet is very bad or you don't have
any connectivity you are in a rush
you're in a hurry and not sure if you
can have access to the internet so
therefore i go for airplane mode to say
ok I'm offline and I have the
possibility to get back via the home
screen icon in full screen mode right so
you've seen it loaded very very quickly
and I have all my details there all
critical content I can explore
destination even in offline mode can
read what I can do in rome
get some information about Rome and most
important thing is I have access to my
porting pass and I think we don't need
to do screenshots any more of our
boarding pass being sure that I have it
with me right I do it as well so and I
think with with that we really can
cancel that and be sure having it right
right away with you thanks to this so
thanks to the progressive web weapon
service worker we've been able to
improve the journey for all our
customers and not only those who
installed our app and the chicken is
just a first step I would say it's we're
already thinking of rolling out the
technology to other critical parts of
the travel journey and I'm very happy to
say that we're going to roll out this
version within the next week's to our
users and a big thanks to the team with
it a very good shop within the last
couple of weeks thank you thanks
Thank You Hanus that was great more and
more companies are deploying progressive
web apps and seeing success take sumo
this is Japan's largest real estate site
and they recently deployed a progressive
web app and saw huge improvements in
speed and reengagement in fact sumo
reports that they were able to reduce
their page load times by seventy-five
percent and then when they added push
notifications as a way to reengage users
by sending them information about new
real estate listings that they might
care about they saw a thirty-one percent
open rate on those notifications it's
truly astounding this is great success
so well done sumo this is the kind of
success we love to see I'll take
Aliexpress a leading global online
marketplace and they recently deployed a
progressive web app as well and they
report increased engagement across all
browsers across all platforms in fact
Aliexpress says that the time spent in
their app went up by seventy-four
percent and they saw an eighty-two
percent increase in conversions on iOS
so these investments make sense across
all browsers across all platforms not
just chrome and the momentum continues
to grow more and more companies are
deploying progressive web apps and
seeing success and I hope that all of
you when you leave google i/o will go
out and do the same now we're not done
yet the web will continue to evolve as
the world of computing evolves and here
on the chrome team we're working on a
long list of exciting new projects so
let me take the next six hours and walk
through each of these in a lot of detail
I see people heading for the exits no no
I'm not going to do that I'm not going
to do that but let me give you two
examples just to give you a flavor for
the kinds of things you're working on
we're working on the physical web the
physical web is a way to bring the web
thinks it to extend the web to objects
around us would it be cool if you got on
a bus and you could get the bus schedule
available on your phone instantly right
when you needed it this is possible
today in public buses across London
using the physical web and more
generally the physical web is a way for
objects to broadcast URLs to us and for
us to use those URLs to interact with
those objects right on demand when we
need it we're also working on web
assembly web assembly is an ambitious
effort across many different browser
vendors to define a new low level
language one that runs it native speeds
but securely and on the web it still
early days but we're really excited
about the potential here for unlocking
new high-performance cases use cases
things from gaming to media to
scientific computing and who knows what
else so as we work on improving the
mobile web today and as we look to the
future there's one key thing to remember
which is that we're all in this together
my session is almost over but this
conversation is not over this
conversation is just getting started
we're going to have a series of events
throughout the remainder of this year
all across the world as part of the
progressive web apps Roadshow and
there's a dev summit in Amsterdam next
month and there's a registration link
you can use to sign up and if you can't
make one of these events we are active
and engaged on Twitter on Stack Overflow
on github and we have a developer portal
with a lot more information we'd love to
hear from you we'd love to work with you
we'd love to help you be successful and
of course we work collaboratively across
all the different browser vendors
ultimately it's up to all of us browser
vendors and web developers to write the
future of the web so go out there and
