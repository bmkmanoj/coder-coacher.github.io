chrome dev summit it's great to be back
in San Francisco this is my second
chrome dev summit and there's so much
energy there's so much talent is getting
better than the last year and more talks
focus on progressive web app which I'm
really excited
I was really excited to see us announce
more work that was launched around
puppets here light house work box all of
these tools help developers build better
experiences and take advantage of things
like headless chrome a little bit more
easily and I look forward to hearing
what the golfers think about the chrome
dev summit is like the perfect
opportunity to talk to the people that
you normally only meet online really
cool to have all the conversations with
you on the chrome team from the dev rel
team from the community from the Judy's
you know if you want to exchange
information this is the place to be
really and get to learn new things what
I love most about chrome dev summit is
coming together with this community of
people that are so concerned about
building a global web that everybody can
reach that it doesn't matter how much
money you have and what type of devices
you have but you can be connected to
this experience
the after party was really nice lots of
great people and lots of lovely music
there was arcade games that was really
really cool we had a great couple days
at chrome dev summit it was really
fantastic getting to meet all of the
developers and hear what everyone's
working on we want to keep the
conversation going so we've got the code
labs online we have all of the videos of
all the talks ready to go and if you
want to chat about any of this feel free
to use hashtag chrome dev summit I'm
super excited to see everyone again next
year
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
