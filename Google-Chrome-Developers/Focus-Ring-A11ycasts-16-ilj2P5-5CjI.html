welcome back to the allagash show today
we're going to be talking about focus
rings so the focus ring is the indicator
the browser uses on an element to
indicate if it has focus and to indicate
if that element is about to receive
keyboard events now the focus ring is
really really really important for
keyboard users because you can think of
it kind of like their mouse pointer it's
their way of knowing which element
they're about to click on or interact
with using something like the spacebar
now the problem with the focus ring and
where I see some developers kind of
running afoul here is the focus ring is
kind of displayed inconsistently in the
browser I'm probably over here in my
laptop and I'll show you what I mean by
that so I've got a few elements on
screen here I've got an input text field
I've got a button I read another button
that I've actually styled to look kind
of fancy and I'll zoom in and you'll see
that when I click on this input text
field
I see a focus outline I see a focus ring
right there but when I click on this
native button I see the active State but
I don't see a focus ring drawn on top of
it and so already you're seeing that the
browser is kind of trying to be smart
here and it's trying to sort of
differentiate based on sort of a
heuristic between different elements so
when the user clicks on a button or they
tap on a button the browser is going to
say well this user is they kind of know
what they just went over and clicked on
and they know what they just interacted
with so I don't need to draw focus ring
in that case but for something like a
like a text field it can be really
really helpful to have that focus
indicator especially if you're working
on like a long form and maybe you look
away for a bit and come back and you
want to kind of see where your places in
the form right so there's an underlying
heuristic that the browser uses to
differentiate between mouse and keyboard
focus on different elements the problem
though starts to happen again follow me
over eat of my laptop when we have
custom controls and custom elements so
this button that I've styled this is
still a native button element when I
click on it now I see a focus indicator
and that's based entirely on the fact
that I sort of changed the the default
browser styling it at this point now the
browser says I guess I'm just going to
draw a focus ring you'll also see this
if you create a custom control you know
you create your own drop-down or
something like that and you give it a
tab index so opting something into the
tab order now when you click on it it's
going to display a focus ring
and this throws a lot of developers for
a loop they'll be building a UI widget
suddenly this ring starts appearing
they're not quite sure what to do
because for the mouse users out there
it's a aesthetically unpleasing right
it's not something they're used to
seeing they might not like the way that
it looks and so you might have your art
director or somebody coming down and
saying hey that thing looks weird just
remove it okay
and if you go over to stack overflow or
something like that you just Google
stack overflow remove blue-ringed and
there's an endless amount of answers
here where people say oh yeah when you
see that thing just use the CSS style
outline:none and that will get rid of
the focus ring the problem is it gets
rid of the focus ring for everybody
including your keyboard users and this
is the real issue really what we need is
the ability to differentiate between
mouse and keyboard focus for different
elements and so we can have kind of two
different experiences ensure focus ring
so focus ring is a brand new CSS
selector just part of the CSS level for
selectors spec and show that to you here
on my laptop and what focus ring does is
it says the focus ring pseudo-class
applies while an element matches the
focus pseudo-class and the UA or the
user-agent basically the browser
determines via heuristics that the focus
should be specifically indicated on that
element typically by a focus ring so
basically what this means is focus ring
gives you the ability to opt into the
same heuristics that the browser uses
when they differentiate between mouse
and keyboard users for things like
inputs and buttons now as of today there
are no browsers that ship the focus ring
pseudo-class it
jiya slanted in aspect very recently but
there is a polyfill which you can take
advantage of in your application so you
get hub comm /wi cg / focus - ring
here's a polyfill created by my teammate
Alice Boxhall and our friend Brian
Cardell focus ring polyfill is going to
apply a focus ring class to elements
that sort of match the heuristics and so
that way you can say ah this element
should definitely always draw a focus
ring it has this class so you know I can
put my own style on it or I can I can
opt out of that I'm going to show you an
example here I've already downloaded the
polyfill I've got some HTML this is that
same
page that I showed you so can input I've
got a button just as a little world and
I've got another button with a clasp on
it so it looks like kind of a nice big
material design button and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to start by
including the script for focus ring J s
and what that's going to do is it's
going to here'll actually walk you
through focus ring jst so you can kind
of see how it works so inside the
JavaScript for this class the first
thing it does is it tries to set a flag
to indicate if a keyboard action has
just taken place then it sort of defines
a white list of elements and these are
elements which should always display the
focus ring so for instance something
like input type equals text regardless
of if that was clicked on with a mouse
or keyboard we're saying it should
always draw a focus ring just like what
the native browser does today but you'll
notice that button is not in this white
list so if someone clicks on a button
it's not going to display the focus ring
class and therefore we can turn off the
outline for our mouse users but still
display it for our keyboard users if we
go down to the bottom we can see that
this element is actually or this class
is going through and adding some event
listener so it adds a key down listener
and when someone presses a key it sets
that keyboard flag and this way it
starts kind of a little keyboard
throttle timer of about 100 milliseconds
so at that point if anything else
receives focus within that window we're
going to assume the user is a keyboard
user and we're going to apply the focus
ring class to that element so over here
on my index file I've included focus
range a s and what we should expect to
see is this input should have the focus
training class this button should not
because it's not in the white list and
the other buttons should not because it
is also not in the white list over in my
CSS file because I can't just outright
use you know the colons focus ring
pseudo class just yet
what apply still is going to make
available to me is just a regular focus
ring CSS class I can use a selector that
looks like this
so what I'm saying here is for any male
element that it's focused that does not
have a focus ring class on it go ahead
and remove the outline so what that's
saying is anything that a mouse user
clicks on essentially we're going to not
display the outline or anything that is
not part of our white list we're going
to not display the outline anything but
isn't the white list or anything that
has been interacted with the keyboard
has a surface ring class we will display
the outline
okay so let's see how that works we will
go back over to the application that we
were working with before I will open up
this div so you can kind of see our
elements here and as I click on the
input you'll note that it gets a focus
ring class added to it and so it also
gets the native focus ring indicator
when I click on these buttons though no
focus ring class and so now this fancy R
button that I defined before is no
longer displaying a focus ring however
when I use my keyboard to navigate the
page I hit tab I see a focus ring class
on the input at tab I see it on the
first button hit tab and I see it on
that last button as well so now we've
been able to differentiate between our
mouse and keyboard users we can have the
right experience for each modality I
also want to point out that there is
another library out there called what
input this does a very similar thing to
the the focus ring polyfill what input
has been around for a little bit longer
you can find that at 10 1 7 / what -
input on github again there's a very
similar thing to the - the focus ring
polyfill it's been out there for a bit
longer so maybe you know tried both see
which one you prefer they have slightly
different api's but definitely try and
give you know one or both of these a
shot in your application figure out
which one you prefer and and make sure
you're not just you know removing focus
outlines throughout your app if that's
going to create a really gnarly
experience for your keyboard users that
about covers it for today if you have
any questions for me as always can leave
them in the comments below or you can
hit me up on a social network of your
choosing
as always thanks so much for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
