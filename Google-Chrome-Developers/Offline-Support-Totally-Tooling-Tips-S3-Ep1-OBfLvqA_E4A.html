keeps you coming back to native apps
probably offline support it's this that
whole thing of you know you're gonna be
somewhere with flakey Network and you
just want it to work yeah that's
probably it
so offline is probably the one thing
that keeps me going back to native apps
as well like there's a bunch of wraps
that I need offline supporting like news
readers and things like that but there's
probably I don't know kids today use a
ton of apps that I don't like dating
apps back in my day you had to run
through the city with like a megaphone
screaming why does no one want me
probably doing it wrong I'm just gonna
say probably um so offline user goes to
your web page they probably are going to
run into a situation where they have a
flaky Network maybe they're on the train
maybe they're you know at a conference
or in a hotel right now in the past
we've had capabilities like app cache
which weren't really that reliable and
sort of a nightmare yeah no one's even
really used it and there's that classic
Jake bugg post cache is a douchebag yeah
yes these days were in a slightly better
position we've got new api's like
service worker or no service worker is
like a script that's run by your browser
in the backgrounds and it opens up with
like the door to lots of new
capabilities yes
there's push there's offline support
there's background sync there's like a
whole host of other features coming down
the pipeline yeah
but it's like this really nice low-level
API lets you intercept network requests
and just take control of what's going on
with caching yes so you've got your web
page serviceworker in the middle before
it gets in the network so we can kind of
manipulate and basically outgoing
traffic or just keep stuff from going to
network and just return there like a
cache so the first step to getting your
app working with serviceworker is to
register a serviceworker script that
allows sort of background functionality
without the web page necessarily having
to be open yep you're just making the
browser aware that this is my special
serviceworker javascript file how about
we take a look at some code so the first
thing you're always gonna want to do is
just check where the service work is
actually supported so if serviceworker
navigator
Schumi it is you then just call
navigated up serviceworker don't
register and you pass
the path of your service worker file and
here we're just using promises so then
in cash to just see whether it worked or
not and that's literally it and the kind
of the important thing to point out here
is it's a progressive enhancement right
so if you're in a browser doesn't
support Service Worker that never gets
called you're just things actly the same
land as you would have been without so
you get your same non offline experience
without serviceworker what about what's
inside the Service Worker script so the
minute that kicks off what the browser
would do is it would just go and grab
your serviceworker file and then just
start running it in the background of
the page so in this case the first thing
you're gonna want to do is manage the
install event so in this case self dot
add event listener so you're just saying
in the serviceworker had this event and
you want to open up a cash so cash is
not open you give it some name that's
kind of important because over time
you're gonna add a different version
rights in a namespace right yep and once
you've got your cash object you just
call cash not at all this is a super
helpful little method because you
literally pass in an array of paths and
everything inside that array it will
just go and fetch in the network and
cash so here you're interacting with the
cache API yes so that's different from
the HTTP cache this is a cache that you
control so nothing will get deleted or
replaced or added to it unless you
explicitly do it but yeah so the only
real caveat to all of this is in the
cash flow at all if you add in like some
random file that your server like errors
out on and returns an error code that
will make the install event fail the
install event fails that means the
serviceworker won't install which means
the web page will never use it it's kind
of just a safety mechanism if something
bad happens in the install event
serviceworker just won't affect your
page whatsoever it will retry but it
won't actually affect the page so that's
the install event that won't actually
give you offline support because it's
not actually getting used nothing saying
use this use the cache to respond to a
network that's why you've got the fetch
event tada
now fetch is using the new fetch API
right
and this is not we are but it's slightly
unfortunate the fact there's the fetch
event and then there's the fetch API
because of obviously the name is exactly
the same they are slightly different so
the fetch of amplifier and basically
this will happen whenever
that's controlled by a service worker
makes a request so for the page itself
images stars anything it will run
through this event and here what we're
saying is caches don't match this is a
super helpful little method that just
says for this request is there anything
in the cache that can actually deal like
respond with it so here in the following
thing we say if there is a response then
just return it otherwise return the
fetch so here that's where the actual
fetch API comes in and this is basic
same as an xhr so it'll go off to the
network find it and return it and then
that'll pump it up to the browser those
two steps alone will then just give you
offline support if you cache everything
okay so once you've got all this set up
you want to test that your serviceworker
is set up it's working correctly got to
dive into dev tools yep so serve up your
app check that it works go to network
throttling just toggle offline doink and
if you refresh your page and yes we can
do the annoying out on a noise that
doesn't just work like on desktop right
that should still work those as well so
it's the best thing ever but yet so now
you know it works offline which is super
awesome and this is kind of super high
level there is a much better place to
get all of this information in terms of
like step of view serviceworker also
covers some of the caveats as well as
the activate step which we haven't
covered yeah if you want to learn more
