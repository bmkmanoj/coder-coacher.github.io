the developer diary for my camera one of
the things that got me excited about
this project in the first place was the
image filters the filters that I've made
a fairly standard things that you might
see in other camera apps or image
editing software like changing the
brightness contrast and that sort of
thing the filters in this app a written
using WebGL I'm not going to dive into
the details of WebGL in this episode but
I recently record an episode of
supercharged Reaser mer where I wrote
some code that sets up WebGL so you can
use it to manipulate an image it's about
an hour long so I'm not going to assume
that you've watched it but there is a
link in the description if you want to
go do that now the very brief summary of
the WebGL setup is that you create a
canvas element and attach some code to
it that runs for each pixel this has to
output what color that pixel should be
should be this code is called a shader
the code for the shader is written in a
special language that is kind of like C
I'm not going to go into the details of
the language but instead I want to talk
about what my code is actually doing the
shader can look at data from the
original image only when you're talking
about images in WebGL you tend to refer
to it as a texture so here we have the
code for my shader we have a thin cord
of varying up here which is called tex
cords this is the coordinates of the
pixel within the canvas that can be used
to look into the original image the
texture hence tex cords and this is a
different value for each pixel which is
why it's a varying you can also pass in
some values from your JavaScript that
was shared for every pixel these
variables are called uniforms because
they are the same for every pixel this
is how it can pass through things like
what the contrast or brightness levels
actually are so here we have uniforms
for all of the filter settings
saturation warmth etc this texture
sampler is how we're going to refer to
our original image and this woman she is
source size this gives us the width and
height in pixels of the original image
so how do these filters actually work
what are we doing well one of the first
things that I I do in my code is
something called a convolution filter so
a convolution filter it's kind of a
complicated name something that's
actually relatively simple what we're
going to do is we're going to calculate
the color of an out
pixel based on more than one input pixel
so here I want to work out what color a
particular pixel should be when I
produce my image and the way I do that
is I look at the values of the colors
for that pixel and some pixels around it
so here we have a 3x3 convolution
because we're going to look at nine
pixels and a 3x3 grid each pixel is
given a weight this is how important it
is to the output this particular set of
weights is going to give us what's known
as a blur so what we do is we gather up
the colors of all the pixels around it
and we multiply all of the color values
for each of these pixels by the weight
because all these color values are going
to be numbers from 0 to 1 and then we
add them all together we can earn it
with a number between 0 and in this case
16 once we've added them together you
know adding with the weights will then
divide by 16 to get back to values
between 0 &amp;amp; 1
the way that you might think that you're
going to do this is you have an array
with your weights in and you loop
through you know from minus 1 minus 1 to
1 1 and you go through and look up all 9
pixels in a loop and you get each color
and you multiply it by its weight and
you add them to a total and at the end
you divide by the sum of all those
weights and that's more or less what you
do except that in WebGL shader I'm gonna
optimize this slightly by unrolling this
loop so there is instead of doing the
loop as a loop I'm going to write out
each individual statement that's going
to get run on its own line so there
instead of running a loop nine times I'm
going to write nine instructions so you
might be wondering why would I do this
while we don't all this loop and do have
each instruction separate rather than
looping over them and it's to do with
how graphics cards work so a graphics
card contains hundreds of GPU cores
which are great at doing mathematical
calculations but I think they're not so
good at that a ordinary CPU is is
branching so that is when things are
different
when you run the code again so in a GPU
it's used to doing the same calculations
over and over and over again
it sets up a pipeline to just read in
data and output the output without doing
any like decision-making so when we have
our loop many graphics card drivers will
actually optimize that out automatically
you will say okay so it's a constant
number of runs for this code and we can
work out at compile time that this is
going to run nine times and it's going
to use these values and it can produce
that unrolled version for you but not
every driver does it and particularly
things like texture reads we're looking
at the color information of the original
image that can be very highly optimized
and you know pipelining in those those
colors and you know based on the fact
that we're going left to right and we're
always pulling things out in the same
order so the graphics card can make that
really fast if it knows ahead of time
what the pixels are going to be that are
going to be looked up and when you
introduce that loop some graphics card
drivers have that as a branch and they
don't optimize for anyone so this could
be extremely slow on some graphics cards
now most of the time this will be fast
most modern devices this will work just
fine but not all of them I test it on
some devices where this was extremely
slow and so that's why I'm doing it so
let's have a look at the actual code in
my shader for this so I did a 3x3 matrix
in the example I've actually used a 5x5
matrix in my code because sampling well
values you get a smoother blur effect
but it's otherwise exactly the same so
here I'm using the texture 2d call of
the shader language to look up in my
texture sampler some coordinates
including the offset that I'm looking at
to get the color value for a pixel then
down here I'm adding up all of those
color values along with their weights
and then dividing by the sum of those
weights now you may notice the in the
app here I don't actually have blur as
an option what I actually have is
sharpen now here I've got the sharpness
turned way up but I can turn it down to
nothing and you can see that the
sharpness of the image changes when I
move the slider so how am I using a blur
to make an image sharper well the way
that that works is using something
called an unsharp mask this is a
technique that was actually invented for
film back when it really was film this
is a pre-digital technique to make
things sharper what you do is you take
the original image and you take the
blurred version and you find out the
difference between them so you you're
basically saying how does this image
change when it gets blurry and then what
you can do is you can undo that so if
the pixel gets more red and less blue
when it's blurry then you can make that
pixel less red and more blue to make it
sharper which is actually extremely
clever way of doing this you do a
negative blur almost so whether it's
implemented here is that I work out this
distance between the texture and the
blurred version and I add it to the
original texture color and then I
actually scale this effect with the
sharpness value from the slider
so if sharpen here which is just a
number if let's say this was zero then
this whole thing would be zero as well
and though we would be adding nothing
this would have no effect but also if
sharpen is negative then we actually
just add on the blurred version we make
the image more blurry and you can see
that in the app so here we take the
sharpness and we move it down to the
negative and the image becomes blurrier
than it was so that's applying a
convolution filter in this case using a
blur to sharpen the image there are
convolution filters that do all such
things that give you an embossed image
or confined edges there are all sorts
things you can do with a convolution
filter I'm just using it to increase
sharpness now there are some simpler
operations you can do as well so for
brightness what I actually do here is I
take each color in the
original and I just multiply it by
whatever the brightness value is so if
you have a brightness of 1 nothing
happens
whereas if you have a brightness of 2
every pixel gets twice as bright that is
the red green and blue values are
doubled and similarly a brightness of
1/2 will mean that everything gets
darker all the pixel values get to be
half what they were want is another
interesting one I kind of thought this
would be much more complicated but I
found a very simple formula that works
pretty well so you take your warm with
value and you just increase the read of
the pixel by that warmth value you add
the want value on and you get the blue
value and you subtract the warmth from
it it's an extremely simple formula but
it actually gives a pretty good effect
so you can see that what happens is that
when you increase the warmth slider the
image gets less blue and more red and it
gives it a warmer tone and similarly
when you decrease the slider the image
gets more blue and less red so this is
obviously an extremely simple way of
achieving this effect which I found
pretty surprising and I found that for
most of the effects that are used in
filters there were kind of two schools
of thought for each of them one of them
would be an extremely simple mechanical
method of achieving the effect so for
warmth just change the red and blue
values and it's just by a fixed value
and that gives a pretty good effect
other people are taking detailed models
of you know how the brain perceives
images and how your eye works to produce
models that are a bit more natural but
more complicated so I've opted for this
simple way in all of these but you may
find that if you search around for how
to actually implement these that you get
some of those complicated versions
coming through as well so the next
filter I want to talk about is contrast
this was another one that was
interesting I didn't know how this
worked before I start this project and
what we're doing is the idea is to make
the pixels seem more distinct to make
every part of the image a little
different from the other parts of the
image so
the way that we can do this is we can
say let's make every pixel make every
color get a little bit further away from
gray so gray is where the bread is at
half green is at half blues at half like
it's halfway between white and black and
the way that we increase the contrast in
this situation is if the red value of
our pixel is more than half then we make
it bigger and if it's less than half we
make it smaller we make all the pixels
get further away from gray this
increases the contrast now this doesn't
work perfectly if your image is let's
say it's very dark so most of the pixels
will be less than gray this actually
will decrease the contrast everything
gets closer to black when they're all
very dark and same will happen if
everything's very light so the other
thing that I've got here is the ability
to change the gray point so that's what
value are using as gray so we can set
the the gray point from almost black to
almost white and when the gray point is
almost white then that means that many
of the lighter pixels will still get
darker and similarly when we move the
gray point down to towards black darker
pixels some of them will get lighter so
you can choose the gray point suit your
image generally speaking you want to set
the gray point to be the average of all
of the pixels in your image so that more
pixels are moving away from each other
on average I haven't implemented that
automatically though that is a thing
that some image applications do instead
I've just given a slider and you can
choose whatever looks nice so that's how
I implemented some of these filters you
know things like the vignette it's
making the image darker the further away
is from the center and things like that
there are many other kinds of filters
that I could have implemented that you
might find in other applications I could
have done them in the more complicated
way but I hope this is a reasonable
example of how these things work so I
hope you enjoyed the show and that
you'll join me next time when we'll talk
about something else
