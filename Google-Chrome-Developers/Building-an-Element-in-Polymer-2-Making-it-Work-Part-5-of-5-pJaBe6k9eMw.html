back to our series on how to build an
element in pole bar - last time we use
pre-made elements and styling to make
our element look great but the checklist
doesn't really work yet if we take a
look
pressing the add tasks button doesn't
really add tasks so let's make that work
so when you click the paper button we
want something to happen and what you
want to do is add a click listener so
polymer has a nice way to do this if you
look again in your dependencies go into
the polymer directory back into Lib well
in the utilities section you'll see
something called Chester's done HTML
gesture saw HTML allows you to add a
bunch of listeners to user actions like
tapping clicking or dragging and in this
case we want to add a click listener so
let's import that so polymer polymer
directory in the Lib but it's in utils
and scold gestures done HTML cool
gestures on HTML it allows his head
listeners to the events like this you'd
type in on - and then the type of event
that is happening so on click and on
each place we're gonna call the method
add task alright but now we have to
create add task so here we'll go into
our polymer checklist class and create a
add task method alright so in the add
task method but we're gonna do is add to
our task list our tesla's currently is 1
2 3 or 4 5 well make that empty for now
and let's define a new task so const new
task and for now we'll make it an empty
object and then we will add that to the
task list so in Irbil JavaScript you
would simply just push onto a variable
you would do that by doing this you'd
select the tasks list which in
or you can select a property by doing
this dot then the name of the property
so this dot tasks and then in JavaScript
you would just do not push and then the
new value a new task the problem with
this is the polar data binding system
doesn't necessarily know when you want
to update the template so here we're
going to do something a bit different
we're going to call the vista push
method which is defined by polymer then
give it the name of the property that
you want to push to which is tasks and
then push the new task value now let's
define what goes inside of our task so
each task has about two things in it it
has a check box and an input and we're
gonna need two properties to define this
so let's say the name of the task for
now we'll leave that as an empty string
and then whether it's completed or not
and we can do that with a completed
value and for now we'll say it's false
because you're creating a new task so I
don't think it's gonna be finished
let's go refresh and let's add a few
tasks oh all right
we're creating tasks now we just have
something wrong with our data binding
let's go change that right now so now
let's go back to our dom repeat and they
don't repeat you'll see that we're
actually just passing in the task to the
paper input which is now an object so
actually we want to pass them the name
into your task dot name and in the paper
check box we want to see if it's checked
and to that we want to data bind whether
it's completed task dot completed I
can't type completed let's go refresh
all right that's starting to look a bit
better let's see if our data binding is
actually working so we'll go down here
and we'll change completed to true and
we'll add a test cast test named refresh
and tasks and there you go it's checked
and the values in there alright so now
let's go reset this back to an empty
string set this to false that's good
so now that we have this going when you
check things it doesn't seem to go into
the completed section so let's go change
that right now so what we want to do is
we want to first get rid of the things
that are in the to do section when
they're checked so if you mouse over dom
repeat you'll see a bit more
documentation and at the bottom you'll
see something about filters and
observing so let's type in the filter
property and you'll see that the polymer
ide tells you that it takes a function
and this function is used to filter an
array that is passed in the array being
the tasks array so we'll filter with a
function called is not completed and
then we'll define the is not completed
function is not completed and it will
pass in a task the way the Dom repeat
filter function works is the same way as
an array dot filter works you pass in a
function that returns a boolean true or
false that if true will include the
current task in the array and if false
will exclude it so and E is not
completed function we will return not
task dot completed so it'll be the
opposite of completed and then one more
thing is that we have to add the
observed property the observed property
is a string that tells the data binding
system when to recalculate this filter
and we want to reconnect this filter
whenever task dot completed is changed
so we'll save that go over refresh well
I had a few tasks we'll call this hello
polycast and we'll leave that one empty
and if you check one it disappears it's
getting filtered out cool only one step
left add them to the completed section
so here we have our to do the ad
completed stuff which as you saw earlier
looks very much the same as it did to
the 2d section so we'll just copy this
paste it right over and fix the tabbing
alright so the completed section is
basically the exact opposite of the 2d
section so what we have to do is remove
this filter and make it is completed
rather is not completed so here we'll
define it is completed takes in a task
and then it just returns the opposite of
is not completed so task returned task
not completed save that give that a
refresh add a few things hello world
click that and there you go we have a
functioning checklist all right now how
do you actually use this checklist
element so if you look back in our demo
directory you'll see that we have a
polycast checklist an element that we
just defined so you can actually just
copy this multiple times you can make as
many as you want let's make a bunch of
checklist cuz we're such busy people and
here you go
it's a lot of different stuff on the
page let's scale it back a bit let's add
a quick title to this so well I had an
h2 title and we'll call this name and
this will be the name of the checklist
so creating your property should be
pretty quick name type is a string and
the value this will be the default value
we'll call this to-do list
cool let's refresh we have a to-do list
up here it's data bound in there and
then we can change the demo didn't mean
to close that can change the demo and
change the name name we'll call this
shopping list all right so now let's
test out that this actually works here
you can add a few tasks we can add tasks
to like create a shopping list
finish the polycast and add a few tasks
over here and some Tomatoes
add some lettuce check check and it
looks like it works and the nice thing
about having a polymer element is that
you could just import the element and
put it on your page and then you're done
great that completes this tutorial on
how to build an element in polymer 2 for
more tutorials you can go to the Start
section of the polymer project site
which I'll link down below if you have
any questions or ideas for future poly
casts leave us a comment on this video
or tweet us at hashtag ask polymer see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
