engineer on the web platform team and
today I'm here to tell you a little bit
more about the progressive web apps that
Darren mentioned earlier in the keynote
if you were here last year you might
have seen me talk about a nebulous
future in which we might someday be able
to install web applications I attempted
some demo gods with early serviceworker
and push notification demos which kind
of sort of almost worked and you'll be
glad to know that I have no live demos
for you today so rest easy so we made
all these promises and what happened
right that was all pre-release software
nothing kind of really worked and in the
last year we have shipped everything I
talked about service workers push
notifications Add to Home screen it's
all real today and I think if you were a
web developer this is amazing because in
Chrome and an opera and student other
browsers you'll be able to use all this
stuff you'll be able to take advantage
of it and we ship the tech that's really
what matters isn't it is it I think it's
an interesting question because if you
look at other attempts to take web
content web applications take them
offline make them usable on mobile
devices you'll see that they kind of
sort of worked out I mean from winjs
applications to Palm OS applications
webOS sorry react native Firefox OS
packaged apps chrome packaged apps
Cordova apps from Android and iOS
we've had a lot of attempts of taking
web content putting it in a different
container and making it run offline
giving it the same capabilities that I
was up here talking to you about last
year so why is this different is there
any reason why we should think that this
is going to work when those didn't and I
think that the difference at least to me
is something that Darin highlighted
earlier it's the power of friction the
other systems that you may have used to
take your web application offline embody
an essential trade-off they give you
these capabilities but they force you to
change your deployment and usage model
you can't just click on a link in
or you have to go wrap up your
application put it in the store and as a
user you have to go to that sort of
downloaded well the technology inside
those runtimes is web-based the end
products aren't and fundamentally if you
can't link to something it isn't part of
the web service workers and the features
that build on them I think are important
because they keep URLs and they keep
that low friction usage experience at
the center of everything we saw earlier
that users spend a lot of time in very
few native applications but they visit
many sites every month URLs are the
web's superpower combined with the
security model that puts users in
control at every moment the web produces
friction to use like no other platform
in the world ever has and a surprisingly
consistent theme that we hear from user
studies about mobile is that users don't
really feel comfortable installing a lot
of applications some of them worry about
the kind of over broad permission
demands that some apps request up front
some users are very worried about space
like Todd was highlighting earlier some
users are concerned about privacy
you don't really know what the
application is doing all the time the
web has earned a significantly better
reputation in all of these areas and
when combined with a low friction to
build and use a website it means that
the web is how users most frequently
discover and interact with new services
as we talk with developers who are
trying to get users to use their native
applications we find that over and over
again they tell us that it's both hard
and expensive to take a user of their
service on the web and get them to use
their native app 6 ooh is a company that
tracks native application ecosystems and
this index shows that the cost to
getting a user to try out a native
application using application ad ranges
from one to two dollars it goes up it
goes down but it's still in that range
and has been for the last year it goes
up from there though they track a
separate metric that they call cost per
loyal user and that number has gone from
$2 a year ago to over $4 today ok so
let's say we had an airhorn application
I don't know what you want in there for
an application to an
your friends but let's just say you
wanted to get somebody to use one and
what we see repeatedly is that it costs
about 20% of the users who enter your
funnel for every single action that they
have to take so let's say I got a
thousand of you intrigued and annoying
your friends relatives and co-workers ok
first if I told you about this
application you want to go try it out
you'd have to go load the store and
you'd have to go find it and you have to
click install and they'd have to accept
the permissions of course because you
know you can't just install it you have
to download and wait and then at the end
you get to use it that leaves about 262
of us who are now freshly able to annoy
our co-workers friends and families so
if you lose only 20% at each step it's
pretty much a disaster and this is when
we talk to developers sometimes an
optimistic estimate ok you say sure sure
sure
but what if I was able to reduce that
number of steps say by prompting users
when they land on my web site or getting
them to go directly to the App Store as
opposed to finding it someplace else ok
sure sure sure
let's look at it you get users to click
install from wherever they land they
have to accept the permissions download
wait and then find and use it we're
still below 50% for total conversion
rates the web reduces the number of
actions to experience in your
application to a single click low
friction is the web's secret weapon and
this dynamic is playing out in real time
over the past year we've seen a drumbeat
of companies starting to do the math and
coming to the conclusion that building
only native applications isn't working
you heard or you heard earlier today
about flip words growth since they
dropped the Apple in a strategy and in
some areas like publishing
forward-thinking companies like Vox and
the Atavist are even shutting down their
native apps entirely and just betting on
the web ok so how many of you have
landed on a site for the first time that
puts up a modal dialog box asking me to
take a survey about how your experience
is going
right okay yeah it's not just me this is
exactly the experience that many sites
are giving users when they first land on
their mobile sites the message you get
is roughly you're not welcome here even
though the content is here please go use
this other version of our service in
fact it's gotten so bad that earlier
this year the search team announced that
sites that put up these sorts of
full-page interstitials to encourage
users to download their applications
would no longer qualify as badged mobile
friendly in mobile search results and
that policy went into effect recently
while it's easy to be upset about this
sort of frustrating frustrating user
experience it's perhaps more
constructive to get to the root of the
issue and ask if it's so annoying
expensive and ineffective why are so
many sites still doing it as we talk to
developers and businesses we find that
the root of the issue is the Mason
capabilities that I was talking about
earlier the items that have come up over
and over and over again among a long
list though are the ability for an app
to work offline to appear on the home
screen and to send push notifications
even when the app is closed taken
together these capabilities are so
powerful that it's rational as a
business decision to spend the time
money effort and even annoyance to get
users to use native applications
developers who are trying to provide a
compelling user experience on mobile
have told us the same things that users
have which are that they expect access
to a certain set of capabilities before
they'll consider something Appy and
being a P is now what it means to be
competitive so what if the web could
compete what if we could combine low
friction the incredible reach that we've
just seen and AD reengagement
the features we've been developing as
open standards over the past few years
manifests service workers and push
notifications address these concerns
head-on they finally let us deliver an
EIR for an app in the way that starts in
a tab and if I want to keep it then
becomes more integrated with my user
experience in the OS earlier this year
Francis Berman and I were talking about
the process of taking something that's
just a web page and upgrading it to feel
more like a native application over time
these things are on the web there
part of the web they run at URLs you can
link to them you can navigate to them
you can find them in search but they can
become more than that and if they aren't
just web pages and they aren't apps in
the sense that they don't require you to
build your site a totally different way
or go to a store to get this thing what
are they
I mean web animal vegetable mineral
which which are they our answer was to
call these things progressive web apps
they start up as tabs but then they
staged a jailbreak with users help that
breaks them out of the tab experience
and gets them onto your home screen they
get them into the launcher they give you
a splash screen they become more than
just a tab but they do it based on our
user consent so going back to the
airhorn or calm upgrade process which by
the way you can try out right now Paul
Kinlan built this thing it's great you
can annoy your friends relatives and
co-workers the prompt that comes up at
the bottom of the screen is browser UI
it's something that chrome is showing on
your behalf and it shows up if and only
if the user has come to the app enough
to let us think that it's probably
valuable to you we want to have
reasonable confidence that it's both
going to be a P that it's going to
actually do the things that an app
should and that the user might get value
from it so when it's launched from the
home screen you'll note that it's
relatively indistinguishable from a
native application it shows up in the
task list without it
extra UI it doesn't have a URL bar
necessarily and they even have splash
screens so you might wonder why we would
build special UI to prompt users after
all it's sort of impossible for a long
time to manually add sites to your home
screen you could for instance start by
tapping on the 3d icon menu open that up
click Add to Home screen manually click
Add and then okay it's been added and
yeah ok it's a lot of steps is a kind of
that take away I think it does show up
it does work but then the next question
becomes why isn't it's just bookmarking
what's different about this process and
bookmarking after all they're just
actions that save the URL two different
things
in one case my bookmark list in another
case my home screen why didn't we just
add an option in the bookmarking flow
to let you add a shortcut to your
desktop as well the key difference here
is what separates apps from pages you
can book air horn or calm or you could
book bookmark a specific location at air
horn or comm that lets you get to a
foghorn it's a different thing and we
use URLs to name many different kinds of
things in fact on the one hand a blog is
what you might think of logically as an
application example.com for instance you
might navigate individual items with
inside the blog and that's a separate
entity it's a smaller bit of the overall
whole the same blog hosts many articles
all of which get their own URL from the
browser's perspective though these
things are equivalent URLs don't give us
any hint about what the application is
versus what the item is we don't really
know there are universes under
themselves we start the process of new
every single time that you load content
as users it makes sense to bookmark
individual items right but it makes a
lot more sense to add the application to
our home screen one way we resolve the
tension in our existing single page
applications is to create common UI we
believe application shells that hosts
all the different sorts of things that
we're going to navigate around
conceptually this is the UI that will
always load basically no matter what you
do inside your application it's the
application logic and the stuff that you
need to load in order to be able to show
any content at all jeff posnick is gonna
be helping us understand how to build
and cache application shells in a few
minutes but the important thing to
understand right now is that your app
shell is the stuff that should always
load no matter what an app shell should
at least boot up enough to be able to
say sorry mate I'm offline I don't know
what to do here as we survey end-users
they frequently tell us that what makes
an app an app is the ability to work
offline and yes many native applications
do a terrible job of this but at least
you know it's the apps fault not the
platforms focusing on the user
experience like this is very clarifying
the overall criteria for something to be
happy are clear-cut when you talk to
users apps should always start up they
should always have distinct home screen
icons and apps are things that you want
to invest in they're not one-off
experiences that you'll never come back
to as
all to get the banner that I was just
showing you your application needs to
meet some very specific user
requirements first your site needs to
have a serviceworker and when it
specifies to start URL in the web apps
manifest the URL must be something that
would load using the serviceworker
all the time even when you're offline
next because we have a serviceworker
your site has to be served at a secure
origin luckily for debugging that also
happens to include localhost and there
are flags that you can send a chrome at
the command line that will let you
whitelist other sites but in general
that means that you have to have TLS
it's 2015 Edward Snowden happened TLS is
now the baseline if your site isn't on
TLS now is the time to start in order to
avoid the spammy behavior we also that
we all shook our heads out earlier
chrome doesn't show the prompt until the
second time you visit an application the
required time between the visits of
those navigations changed recently to be
much shorter but expect us to keep
tweaking this heuristic our goal here is
to strike a good balance between helping
you optimize adoption of your
application while avoiding the spam
Eunice that I think we all cringe at a
little bit ok so to get a great home
screen icon and to have a splash screen
that really works to be in a task
switcher with high fidelity you're also
going to have to tell us a lot about
your application and to do that we're
gonna use the web manifest format and to
tell you all about web manifests I'd
like to hand it over to my colleague
Andres Bevans from opera thank you
hi everyone my name is andreas Bothans I
work for Opera Software where I'm a
developer relations lead and also
product manager of opera for Android now
you may be surprised you have two chrome
dev summit and suddenly there's an opera
employee talking to you but sort of the
context a little bit for that is that
opera has been working closely with
chrome on various engine and
standardization related topics so since
our engine switch three about three
years ago opera has been a very active
chromium and bling contributor and just
to give you some numbers
I know these are commits and you know
commits can be small and and big but
just it gives you a sort of feel so
we've done thus far for more than four
thousand upstream commits to chromium
and more than 3,000 upstreams commits to
blink so we collaborate a lot with
Google on various things and this is so
and so I'm very happy to be here thank
you Alex for for heaven and the
organizers for having me so opera as
well is super excited about progressive
progressive web apps potential to lift
up the web's capabilities so we're
really excited about that and we've been
working hard on supporting them we are
excited because of a number of reasons
they're live apps and they're part of
the real open web they're not being done
somewhere in a secluded corner where
something happens with JavaScript and
stylesheets or so but it's really it's
really all rels are being used and and
it's it's the real open web as we know
it it's an extra on top of that to
enhance that experience there's an
ongoing standardization effort which i
think is very important so that other
browser vendors can also start using
them implementing them and so on and we
see wide adoption and they're also a
great match for budget phones these
installable web apps they take less
space on the device and especially in
emerging markets where opera has a lot
of users this is this is an important
concern people are concerned about you
know the large amount of megabytes apps
take and so progressive web apps are
really good match for this kind of use
case so in back in September we shipped
opera 32
for Oprah friend or so for Android with
support for manifest and this may seem
easy but it was actually quite complex
it was not just a chromium intake and
you know there we were we had to do
quite a bit of work on it there was a
lot of interaction required also with
with the Android and sort of the top
layers and we also to rework our startup
sequence which had to be rewritten for
for making this progressive web apps
work well in Opera so a little bit about
the web manifest so web manifest store
metadata for progressive web app what
this means so what is refers to our
icons description colors and related
info that lets browsers create high
quality experiences for the launcher
icon the tasks which are a splash screen
and so on so what I would like to do is
have a little closer look at some of the
code for these manifests to work so
first of all we have to the pages of our
site we have to add this or something
like this to the head so a link element
that points to manifest.json file that
is typically hosted in the root of your
site and this is what such a manifest
can look like and on the right here I
will have a little demo app that I just
made for the for the purpose of this
talk you can also check it out and look
a bit at peak at the source code and so
we're going to look which parts of the
manifest relates to parts of the
interface on the right hand side so when
I add something to the homescreen right
now you still have to do this manually
but we were also working on adding this
screen prompts so you click on at the
home screen you see here this this word
is referring to the short name in the
manifest we use a short name because on
when the icon is placed on the home
screen there's of course not too much
space so if your if your app name is too
long it will be truncated so that's why
we refer there to the to the short name
so think about using a good short name
for your app that looks nice on the home
screen of course also we use the one of
the icons of the icons array that you've
specified
when you this is another view so when
you go to the tasks or to the
application switcher there you also see
you know you see it just listed as a
standalone app a progressive web app is
just listed next to the native apps so
in this particular view it's actually
really hard to see which is the native
app and which is a progressive web app
which is very exciting
it really shows you how these
applications are lifted up from the
browser up to the level of native apps
and so in this particular case the the
bar on top shows uses the short name
again uses an icon of from our icon
array and also the theme color so in
this case I've specified a huge slightly
darker hue of purple just to go well
with the site then something else splash
screens opera has added splash screens
you can try them out right now in the
latest version at supper at 33 and
chrome also has them in the beta Channel
and so how this works is so when you
launch the application the moment
between clicking the icon and until the
full page the first view is loaded of
your web application there is some time
there and so we use this time to show a
splash screen automatically generated
for this black screen we use the name so
the full name of the web application and
I can again of the icons array and a
background color that sort of indicates
maybe you want to make it match with the
color the background color of your web
application that you launched later on
so this being said there is also another
coming soon a splash screen member in
the manifest and then you will be able
to define a custom image but for now you
can use this one and rely on this one
already as a splash screen for your
application also worth pointing out here
is that you for the icon and this is
just a gotcha here Alex stressed
specifically when we were preparing this
presentation the size of the icon should
be 192 by 192 to work well in the splash
screen so then let's look at those last
three parts of the manifest haven't
talked about yet the display member is
quite interesting display
property so you can choose between
standalone standalone sort of hides the
browser UI and only shows the the bar on
top of the of the OS with the clock and
Wi-Fi status symbol maybe notifications
and so on and the bottom navigation bar
so this is what most apps use you can
also go fullscreen this is a more
immersive experience maybe for a reader
or maybe for a game and so on we'll see
another example of that later on
and there is also a browser mode you can
choose this just will open the web
application in in the web browser as you
would normally do the advantage of that
is is that you can rely on the browser's
built-in navigation buttons and so on
maybe that's what you want to do for
your application and you don't want to
create your own navigation around your
application then we go back to the
standalone example for a second and what
is interesting here is that the display
standalone part of the manifest
corresponds you can use this with
display modes in CL and CSS so you can
use a media make a media query that says
here at media display mode standalone
and then specify conditional styles that
will only be applied in standalone mode
in full-screen mode and so on so like
this you can make small design tweaks to
give an optimal experience for the user
once they have added your site to the
home screen then another interesting
feature here is orientation you can lock
the orientation and this normally you
don't have to set this but for instance
in case of air horner its lock to
portrait mode because you don't really
there's no point in it changing
orientation when you turn the phone
around so it just stays like this this
button will work in all directions
don't try it out during my talk because
otherwise here a lot of sound and then
this is another example you can also try
it out it's it's on github it's a little
game we made and it it uses landscape
orientation and I've also combined it
with full screen and so you get a little
game that you can play and that uses
this this special full screen and
landscape mode of the manifest and then
the last part here is the start URL this
is the
well do you want to you want users to go
to or when when they open the app from
the home screen what I've added here is
a question mark home equals true this
can be home equals one or home screen
equals one or you can just leave it away
the point of it is that you can it
allows you to track where users come
from if they've opened your app from the
home screen or not so this is just a
little tip you can use or not use
depending on what you need it for
then little something about these app
installation banners that Alex talked
about currently supported in Chrome
coming soon in opera as well for this
application banner you need your
manifest needs to have a name short name
and icons array as well with a mono 92
by 102 I can and the start URL must
match the serviceworker what this
basically means is that you need to make
sure that you start URL must some
content must be surf there even if the
application is offline or something like
that you the user must always see
something they must not get a blank page
or an offline page if all this sounds
complicated and you just want to get
quickly started with with creating
manifests there is a manifest generator
made by Bruce Lawson
you can add URL of your current site and
immediately it will generate a manifest
based on the metadata that are currently
in your website you probably want to
tweak it a little bit later on and
deploy it and start using it on your
HTTP enabled site so to roundup opera
support in a nutshell is we have service
workers landed earlier this year we've
got manifest support at the home screen
prompts are coming real soon and push
notifications are also on the radar the
the general story is really excited
about this this will come also to other
browsers Firefox is also working on
service workers and push notifications
and so on and we hope to get everybody
on board and this is really exciting for
us so thank you very much back to Alex
thanks Andres so under s mentioned that
there are a lot of options to thank you
as you build your progressive web app
and put together its manifest and I want
to highlight a few tools and techniques
that you can use to ease development as
you go andreas mentioned Bruce Lawson's
excellent manifest generator but I also
want to highlight monaural Marie's
manifest validator it saves tons of time
and trouble
specifically the sorts of things where
you leave an extra comment in your JSON
as we found out to our chagrin earlier
this week and spend an hour trying to
debug it so yes use this this is great
next you are Freeman gonna find yourself
one antic totally nuke the world clear
all the cache data blow away the
serviceworker is when you're working
with a physical device and the easiest
way to do that in chrome today is to
step into the lock icon on Chrome for
Android go to site settings click
through hit clear and reset and then hit
clear and reset and then you're done
and so that is super helpful when you
refresh the page you should get the new
world started all over again while
you're working with a physical device
and by the way it's absolutely essential
to understand the performance properties
of your application on a physical device
because they aren't the same as they are
on your for core i7 MacBook Pro I
promise you
specifically JavaScript so get a
physical device but when you're working
with a physical device it's sometimes a
hassle to go and try and debug on the
device itself so chrome inspect is
probably your best friend hook your
device in a USB go to Chrome inspect and
then you can hit the inspect button
which will bring up the full suite of
dev tools and the forwarding for the
screen is the coolest thing in the world
because you can actually use your mouse
and keyboard to navigate around the
application on the device I'll see the
taps show up on the device if you turn
on tap highlighting as well and you'll
be able to get to be the bugging console
you'll be able to step into your
serviceworker inspect the resources on
the device all that kind of good stuff
and it's worth specifically highlighting
that if you are using chrome dev today
soon beta you'll be able to go to the
resources tab and see on the left hand
side the serviceworker
button at the bottom this is invaluable
because as Jeff he's going to describe
service workers in a minute when you're
getting through the service workers
installation flow you need to know that
your service worker is activated and
that there wasn't an issue when it
installed and so this is the easiest
place to get at this information super
helpful
next a major challenge when you're
developing progressive Web Apps in the
recent past has been that you don't
really know when that set of four
criteria are all met right each one's a
little bit different you have to have
TLS we have to think that you have TLS
you have to have a manifest that meets
all the criteria you have to have a
service worker that matches all this
stuff and so getting those all lined up
can be a little bit of a pain the
easiest way that I know to try to
understand whether or not your site is
gonna trigger the banner is to see if
you get the banner but that has the user
engagement check as well so there's a
flag in chrome flags that lets you
bypass the user engagement checks so
that every single time you go to your
progressive web app that banner will
show up at the bottom it's the easiest
way to verify that you've actually hit
the mark give it a shot
similarly on desktop because we haven't
shipped progressive web app support
there yet you're going to need to flip a
couple of flags if you don't happen to
have an Android device handy on your
person and so to do that you can go and
disable the user engagement check again
and then enable Add to shelf
both of these flags are available in dev
and beta versions of Chrome today and
what you'll see if you do this is you go
to an progressive web app that would
meet all the criteria and you'll get
this little button at the top that lets
you say add don't worry about what it
does right now it's not the final thing
we're still iterating we might not even
do it but this is the easiest way to
debug you've actually hit the mark okay
lastly a few things to consider well you
were building your progressive web app
first if you go ahead and hide the URL
bar you're gonna need to provide a lot
of your own UI having a refresh bar or a
way to get fresh content is essential
because you won't have the browser's
back and forward navigation you'll also
have to provide high fidelity navigation
throughout your entire application so
keep that in mind when you're
constructing your app one last point on
that as I'd mentioned earlier the media
query to help you hide and show that
navigation is
it's a great way to not double up on
that you eye surface area when the
browser URL bar is there the first time
you load it ok next another piece of
missing you I will be the share thing
the share intent the share button in the
browsers case the URL bar you normally
just highlight the URL copy it to your
clipboard and paste it wherever you
wanted but that's not an option that's
available to you necessarily you'll have
to think about rebuilding that UI in
your own fullscreen application or check
out Paul Kinlan latest blog post about
how to do this on Android using the
intent system it's great next we send an
event every time we're about to show
that banner at the bottom the on before
install event lets you know that we
showed the banner so that's great
helps you log it out but also it lets
you cancel it let's say you're at an
inopportune time maybe inside of a
checkout flow it's not a good time
necessarily to meet asking the user to
keep the thing to their home screen so
using the on before install event and
canceling it lets you choose when to
show it later because you can wreath row
the event if you cancel it on one page
navigate to another page will send the
event again we'll keep trying until you
either tell us yes it's fine to show it
or the user clicks away great and lastly
we've heard you about deep linking we
understand that the progressive web app
experience in chrome today isn't
brilliant for deep linking but we're
working on it changes in chrome in the
near future will allow you to focus
existing tabs from the serviceworker
when a user navigates to a page and
we're trying to figure out better ways
to let you control deep linking and
which version to launch in the future
we've only just started supporting
progress and web apps in Chrome and
we're excited that they represent a new
way for you to keep your users engaged
and deliver the sort of high-quality
experiences without having to take your
content off of the web we think that the
URL is the web superpower and we're
excited to help bring that superpower
back to your applications without
forcing users to go through stores the
rest of the day includes a ton of talks
that are going to help you understand
how to implement this stuff well there's
a talk on implementing TOS by Emily
Stark and again that's the baseline for
2015 so give it give it your all and
talks about service workers how to do
all this stuff with polymer push
notifications and application shells so
stay tuned or find these talks on
YouTube in a bit and thanks again for
your attention
