where we can design with performance in
mind rather than it being and after for
shipping a user experience that is
performant on mobile is sort of this
symphony between designers and
developers where I think we both have to
understand the limitations of what's
possible like if you're shipping down an
experience on 3G or 4G you're probably
trying to get something that is useful
to the user as quickly as possible
like giving someone a shopping page
where you know they can see an item but
if they keep hitting you know that
button to buy and they can't really do
anything that's probably not what you
want because it's going to cost you a
sale right yeah and when we're trying to
ship these experiences in mind I think
we need to think about what is the
minimal set of things that I want to you
know get down the wire what does that
mean for the design of that experience
does it mean that I ship something
that's a little bit more lightweight a
little bit you know less splashy but is
minimal enough for the user to get you
know maximum benefit from and if I do
want to integrate other design elements
into there how can I do that in a way
where you know we can keep loading
performance in minds like it's
completely possibly look at a lot of the
mobile web experiences the progressive
web apps that large companies have been
shipping lately yeah Twitter lights the
housing calms the flip cards and many of
those experiences have thought about
performance kind of holistically like
when you when you land on a landing page
for any of those sites they load up
relatively quickly they look really
beautiful
yeah but then as you need to transition
from one view to another showing in some
cases very different experiences you
need to think about well how can I do
that in a way where I can make it look
pretty I can optimize for perceived
performance and I can give the user
something useful at the same time now
from a designer's perspective you might
want to make that look as as great as
you possibly can yeah because if you you
know maybe you're used to building a
native app maybe you're used to being
able to just shove you know as much data
in there as you
on for a mobile site there are a few
additional considerations there because
you're basically trying to just ship in
real time all of these bytes down the
wire and you want them to load up really
quickly so I think you need to think
about well what is what is limitation
what is the budget that the developer
probably has in order to ship this down
to the user I'll let them figure out
okay well how much JavaScript how much
CSS we ship down but what can I do in
order to minimize the amount of work
that needs to be done to get that page
loaded up and get that page useful and
so I think that from both sides it
benefits a lot from us talking to each
other yeah I think in recent years I've
seen you know patterns like scales and
loading screens become quite popular for
helping us do that sort of transition
from one view to another with an
experience like that I think that that
requires both sides like understanding
what what it is they're trying to
accomplish they're trying to accomplish
a really good user experience and you
know we're thinking well if we don't
show them a loading spinner and we show
them a skeleton screen instead the user
is going to feel like something's
happening as soon as they tap on a
button you're going to see oh so I'm
probably going to see a little bit of
text here a little you know maybe I'll
see some images here and they're
probably going to stay with that page a
little bit longer rather than saying oh
man that that spinner is just you know
it's still spinning I've been waiting a
few minutes nothing's really happening
and they're probably going to end up
leaving the experience if they see
something like that absolutely another
like a as you get for the three seconds
the more longer something takes and this
whole concept of perceived personal
performance which is quite new for
designers it's like something that's not
necessarily really fast but it feels
fast because you're loading the skeleton
layout first so you can feel something's
happening even though technically
side-by-sides a blank screen loading and
the skeleton is basically the same but
once you get to a three second mark
you've basically lost people's patience
you're basically trying to hack human
perception as much as you can yeah and
but what's interesting is when we design
it we always design the final loaded
thing we don't really think about all
right as this thing is being downloaded
or what happens if X fails to load what
happens if this image is like in a poor
networked environment yes how do we get
to a point where we can design
before the final thing or because you
know you'll get there eventually but
what is there you know like
understanding what a budget means from a
design point of view so we don't really
have a tool to actually say all right if
I will say like you were in sketch and
even to highlight something so why this
is going to cost you 10 seconds or the
equivalent I feel like we're both in the
same bucket where as we've been getting
closer and closer to thinking about
mobile experiences and how to build them
in an efficient way we're having to
think about loading a little bit
differently to how we have in the past
as a developer I think about loading
these days in sort of three stages
you've got the is it happening so is
there anything actually on the screen
even if it's just like a toolbar or a
header then you've got the is it useful
so maybe you're showing me some text at
that point if I'm you know I'm on The
Times or something and you're showing me
an article and then the there's the is
it useful moment so if I start tapping
around the experience can actually go to
other pages can I have something happen
and from a developer side of view that
requires you to think a little bit
differently about how you're shipping
things down a developer probably has to
think about you know maybe breaking up
their JavaScript breaking up the CSS
anything else that they're going to ship
down the wire so that you're just
shipping the minimal set of things a
designer has to think about well what
are all of these loading states that a
develop is going to try showing to the
user and how can I make sure that that
looks as pleasing as possible but it's
also improving perceived performance
yeah providing a performant experience
is something that requires you know
close collaboration between two sides
like I don't think I'd ever seen
skeleton screens as a concept until I
started reading like blogs the designers
are working on yeah if they're like A to
Z of sort of states because I know like
I've worked on sort of like coming up
with visual concepts for offline stuff
but if they're like you have like a
component or widget or thing like if
they're a different state or is it
almost like what I'm asking for
something that doesn't exist because it
depends on the context it just depends
almost as if you're asking for is there
a holistic piece of guidance for
anything on the web
no no write it yourself yeah I think the
answer that is it is nuanced and it
depends on what components you're
displaying in your experience I
certainly know that like if you've got a
card UI you probably want to show like
the card is maybe your skeleton and then
maybe you show a placeholder for the
images and the text that are going to be
in that card I've certainly seen some
people who have taken it to extremes
where you know they'll even show like a
blurred out version of the image or you
know just use CSS to approximate what
that piece of square is going to look
like and then transition in the actual
content when it's there but it's going
to vary it really depends on what your
application is trying to do and what
your latency look like like if you know
if you think that you're going to be
able to deliver an experience in two or
three seconds then maybe you only need
you know two states two or three states
if you are something super complex you
might need more than that but I think
that where as we're thinking a little
bit more holistically about loading from
a developer side we are considering
ideas like progressive bootstrapping or
progressive rendering where you know we
go through these different loading
States and try to show more and more
things on the screen as they come in
rather than just like holding off you
know waiting until you know going from a
page being completely blank and white
and then waiting until the very end and
then just showing everything at once
because as a user you're going to enjoy
I think seeing at least something on the
screen sooner yeah I mean I also wanted
to bring up them flash because I know
yellow flash yeah flashed him to be like
the middle person that could really
bridge the gap between a developer and
the designers like conceptually I under
I learned about code just for
ActionScript in the concept of the stage
I always things to me feels like the
tool but I don't know maybe I'm
reminiscing about something that was
great for designers but terrible for
users you know I would I would actually
say at that time you know we were we
were developing very heavily for the
desktop web I used to be a flash
developer and an ActionScript developer
and so if it weren't for the flash IDE
like I know exactly what you mean about
you know the stage and everything I
would never been able to do like complex
animations or anything like that
we're it not for flash and it was just
such a great tool but also sort of you
it letting you take all of your
creativity and then export it into this
sort of black box that you just threw at
the browser and I think we all got used
to this idea of you know what I'm just
going to be okay with waiting three
minutes for this custom loading progress
bar to show up and do something the very
end of it on the web today like you
could you could build tools to do these
things but having to do that in an
efficient way without you know requiring
a bunch of manual work on your part is
not we're not quite there just yet I
would love if there was a tool that
allowed you to like work as productively
as flash allows you to do and exported
decent stuff but it's been one of those
historically hard problems with web
content like yeah generating code and
also I think users are not as patient as
they once were I know it's karma fight
well back in the old day which was my
back in my day yeah like I remember
watching my spy things the mtv web site
like back in like 10-15 years ago or
like Dazed and Confused five-minute
loading time and you would wait and then
you couldn't read the article property
because it was something that was made
for them for the maker not sort of the
viewer and I don't think people not
willing to wait for that sort of an
eyesore my friend later on mobile I mean
we know today that you know we say that
you know three seconds is the ideal
you're loading time try to get
interactive in five seconds we also know
that for a lot of the longtail web you
know it's it's not uncommon for pages to
take 19 seconds to load and maybe 19
seconds is okay if you've got a giant
flash movie but people are just going to
leave the experience on mobile so I
think that we need to find that balance
where you can come up with a tool like a
flash IDE or something but have it
either generate better code or just work
better with the rest of the tools that
we have available in the ecosystem I'm
personally a big fan of things like
framer jas where like designers can use
code to come up with like really really
beautiful experiences that can be
complex and then hand it off the
developers to try to figure out okay
well how do I actually implement this in
a way that can be loaded efficiently or
can be done efficiently on the web and
that's not a bad place to be right now I
know that those tools are also evolving
constantly like maybe maybe
good eventual place could be you know
where a designer can design an
experience and all the views and
everything and tackle motion and
everything in a great way and the same
school can give the developer you know
enough of the code as an output they can
go and start hacking on it without it
being so divorced from whatever the
designer was using on this they feel
where something's missing and almost
like whatever that tool is will be the
next evolutionary step for industry and
I guess I'm one thing is when are you
going to build a D what are you going to
build it any day now this entire thing
is a commercial for my next my next set
project in order to be good at something
you need to practice that skill but in
order to judge whether you are good at
something you just kind of need
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
