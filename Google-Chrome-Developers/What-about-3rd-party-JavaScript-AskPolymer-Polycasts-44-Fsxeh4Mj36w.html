if I casters Rob here welcome back to
another segment of ask polymer the show
where you send in questions on the
various social media networks out there
and I do my best to answer them okay our
first question comes from danger manly
who asks for elements that contain iron
Ajax how can we mock their behavior so
interesting question their web component
tester itself ships with a few clever
tools but can perhaps help you out here
the first is a function called stub
element and you can use that to actually
replace an element that is like inside
of other elements you could say stub
element iron Ajax and then it's the
second argument you could pass in like
fake Iron HX you can actually create
your own mock element that will swap in
right before it does the unit test that
is one approach the other is to use
something like sin ons fake xhr server
so that also ships with web component
tester the the sin on command is there
for you so you can create a fake xhr
server actually have it send back fake
responses and that way you don't have to
you know spin up a server yourself or
anything to like feed your test data you
can just use this little mock server and
feed data to iron HX that way so two
options there if you're curious we
actually have a video that maybe goes a
little bit more into this it's from a
talk at polymer summit by one of our
team members you can check that out over
here our team of her Chris who created
the stub element stuff he actually gave
a whole talk on this stuff so go check
that out if you're interested Thank You
danger for that awesome question okay
our next question comes from Alan who
asks if I'm using something like iron
lists I'm scrolling through thousands of
items how do I know how do I detect when
the user has scroll to the bottom of the
list so that is a very good question
today it's a little tricky to do that
but the team is building an element
called iron scroll threshold so you can
combine that with an iron list and that
way use a little data binding and we'll
alert you when the user has hit the
bottom of the list that way you know if
you have a million items in your list
but you only want to load the first
hundred at a time the user can scroll
down to that first hundred then you can
you know get that binding event you can
then
lazy load another pack of 100 items and
sort of keep going that way you can
build like kind of a good infinite
scrolling experience so yeah using iron
scroll threshold I'll link it down in
the show notes and you can combine that
with your iron list and hopefully get
that kind of cool smooth infinite list
experience that you're after alright our
next question comes from Cody who asks
how do i load external javascript
frameworks into my components so this is
sort of a tricky bit here I think Cody
was asking how do i load like jquery
into my element so i can use it for
selecting stuff inside of my component
in general we recommend not trying to
use things like jquery inside of your
element definitions it creates two
issues one it means that anybody using
your component is going to have to also
depend on jquery but it also is tricky
because jquery right now doesn't really
know how to work with shadow DOM and so
you could end up in weird situations
where you're trying to select stuff it's
not quite working it's not clear why so
in general we recommend just sticking
with vanilla JavaScript inside of your
element for you know speaking out its
definition you can however depend on
external libraries that do things like
moment j s is a good example something
that like converts time stamps for you
things that aren't interacting with the
Dom necessarily you can load those in
using HTML imports you can create an
import for one of those libraries that
just contains a script tag and pull it
in that way so that's totally acceptable
the frameworks that I want to manipulate
the Dom probably want to stay away from
using those inside your element
definition so thank you Cody for that
question our next question comes from
Tom who asks what should I keep in mind
when styling CSS for web components so I
think the main thing to keep in mind is
you're working with shadow DOM and if
you're not familiar with it it can be
sort of tricky because it creates the
sort of style bubble around your
components I think it's really useful to
learn how to work with custom properties
and how to work with CSS mix-ins both of
those are features which polymer uses
pretty heavily to allow you to you know
jump over shadow boundaries and style
the internals of components without
having to like violate encapsulation and
know what's going on there internally
directly so if you're not familiar with
those things that I just said if that
just sounded like a bunch of crazy words
you can go check out this guy
over here that we've created on how you
style the shadow Dom which we actually
sometimes referred to as local Dom so
the guide is styling local Dom you go
check that out that'll explain custom
properties I'll explain CSS mix-ins and
a lot of the things that you need to
keep in mind when you're trying to style
your first web components so thank you
Tom for that question all right the last
question comes from Alice who he
actually asked a lot of questions but he
asked winter carbonell that's coming and
when will we get es6 with polymer so
carbon elements we're still working on
those we don't have a definitive release
date for that just yet but we're hoping
you know maybe in the next one or two
quarters though should start to roll out
es6 and polymer that's something that i
think we really want to work on this
year we want to make sure that everyone
can write their component definitions
using all the latest and greatest es6
syntax so within the team we are
actually working on some tools which
we're hoping to release again probably
in the next couple quarters to let
people start to use es6 with their
component definitions so i know it's
sort of a bummer to to say like you know
it's coming wait on it but this is stuff
that we were actively working on right
now we just finished a bunch of meetings
talking about both of these topics so
look forward to more on both of those
fronts in 2016 ok so uh thank you
everybody who sent in questions lots of
really great things this week if you out
there if you yourself you've got some
questions for me you can leave them down
below in the comments or you can ping us
on a social network of your choosing at
hashtag ask polymer as always thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
next time a lot of good questions today
thank you everyone who sent in some
stuff what why does they're playing like
to thank you all who sent in some stuff
sorry take three
