welcome back to day two of the chrome
dev summit I'm joined here by jeffrey
posnick jeff is a member of the chrome
developer relations team Jeff you just
gave a talk on service worker libraries
past present future etc so for folks out
there who haven't seen the talk yet uh
what are what are some of the service
worker tools that they can they can use
today sure so I spent some of my talk
introducing or reintroducing to
libraries SW precache and Esther be
toolbox so those libraries really help
with a lot of production-ready scenarios
that we see developers facing sov
precash is great for like taking all the
static assets in your site and pre
cashing them versioning them properly
making sure the things you need for your
application shell is always there SW
toolbox is great for your runtime
strategy so like large images that get
cached as you go but aren't gonna be pre
cached you know you could use sov
toolbox for that but nice thing is it'll
also handle you cash expiration so if
you have some big image that was used a
month ago for an article page you don't
have to worry about that sticking around
in your cash forever so and then you
also touched on some future tools like
future direction for some of these
libraries and so where are you thinking
of heading with with some of these
things sure so we have these existing
tools they're great but it's 2016 some
of these tools have been around for a
couple of years we thought what would
things look like if we were developing
from scratch using the best practices
that people follow today and we're
really trying to go to a more modular
approach with our service worker
libraries we want to publish things as
like standalone modules that could be
pulled in as like es2015 imports and
really have the same functionality we
don't want this to be a step backwards
for folks we know there are a lot of
people who use this in production and
you're happy with it but we wanted to
make it so that if you wanted to just
pick and choose a little bit so the
library to use it just use the cash
expiration we wanted that to work and
yeah that's the general philosophy that
we're taking so it's pretty early on in
the design stage we've like pushed out
really early alpha releases
and we're really interested to see how
people use it so for folks out there who
you know are interested in this and want
to get rolling what is one or you know
one or two resources where they could
get get started yeah I think we'll
hopefully have some links to these but
we have like a really great new landing
page for all our production current
service worker libraries estou be
precache xw toolbox it's a great
resource with a bunch of videos and
documentation and articles there and
we're also really interested in
collecting feedback from the developer
community about the new stuff that we've
been building so there's like a github
issue that we've opened up and we're
we're asking people to take a look at
our proposals take a look at some of the
samples would look like and just give us
feedback let us know what you think cool
awesome so we can link to those down in
the show notes and if you haven't done
so yet definitely go check out Jeff
session Jeff thank you so much for being
with us today thank you all so much for
watching stay tuned for more content
