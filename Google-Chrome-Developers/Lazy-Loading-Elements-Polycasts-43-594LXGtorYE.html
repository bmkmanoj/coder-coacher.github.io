coming into the studio we tweeted out a
question to see what folks wanted to see
in the next episode of polycast and a
lot of folks wrote in and said they
wanted to know how to lazy load polymer
elements to improve the performance of
their apps so that's exactly what we're
gonna cover today now to do that we're
gonna start off over here at the polymer
Doc's and we're gonna go down to the API
reference and some folks might not even
realize that we we have an API reference
but it's kind of hidden down here in the
sidebar for the documentation you go
click on that and that's gonna take you
to this sort of classic polymer doc
layout if you've seen this before on
other elements and this is where you can
find all of the properties and methods
of the polymer object itself so a lot of
really cool stuff inside of here this is
also where for instance like the polymer
template Iser documentation is so if you
wanted to create your own version of dom
if or dom repeat you could use template
Iser to do that just a helpful take bit
there but what we're interested in here
is this polymer base object polymer base
is sort of the base prototype for all
polymer elements and it's where we hide
interesting like methods and properties
and stuff like that the one I'm into is
called import href down here we can hit
the in bigan button to make it larger
and so what import href is gonna do it's
gonna give us the ability to dynamically
load an HTML import at runtime it's got
a few arguments that it takes the first
argument is we're gonna give it an href
so basically just a path to some
component or some HTML import that you
want to pull in at runtime and then it
wants callbacks for on success on error
and lastly it takes an option which
specifies whether or not you want the
link tag to have an async attribute on
it so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to use import href I'm gonna build sort
of a sample application this is the app
that I have thrown together it is called
poly Mille
it's a social network for foodies and I
guess people that like stir fry because
there's a lot of pictures of stir fry
and you can either go to this sort of
the the Browse section and you see here
that I've got all sorts of yummy photos
or you could go to the Activity Feed and
you can see maybe like I'd be posting
status updates from all the cool awesome
restaurants that I am eating at right
now the main thing to take away from
this is that
these two sections have very very
different content right this one is as
well a whole bunch of cards with some
paper buttons on it right and this
Activity Feed is instead just sort of
these like little little status blurb
things so there's no reason to load all
of this all these card elements if the
user is just starting off in the
Activity Feed right it would just make
more sense to load that at runtime to
kind of like reduce the bandwidth for
our total application so to do that
we're gonna use import href over here in
our code editor so this is my ex app
element that I have started off with and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have an X
app element inside of except I will
chuck in a little iron pages here and
inside of iron pages we'll have sections
for the different bits of our app that
we were interested in so I've got a
browse section and an activity section
and we also got the page j/s rotor
loaded into X app as well so if we go
down to the JavaScript definition we can
see that I've got kind of a basic route
stubbed out and what I want to do is
when the route changes to either the
Browse section or the activity section
I'm going to call polymers import hrf
method load in my element definition
once that's loaded in I will then tell
iron pages to switch over to that
section now the first thing I want to do
though since we're starting off just at
like slash right now what we're doing is
we're actually just loading a shell that
looks kind of like this right we don't
have you know we're not hitting either
the browse or the activity section so
the users kind of got you know nothing
to look at so I'll start off by
redirecting them page dot redirect over
to the Browse section so this way we
just have kind of like a nice starting
point I'm gonna write another handler
for browse so page slash browse and
you'll notice here that I'm using es6
fat arrow of functions that just makes
it a little bit easier to to deal with
the scoping of the this value inside of
these handlers so I'll say page dot
browse and when I first want to do is
see if the element has already been
loaded has this page been loaded before
because if it has there's no reason to
import it again so we'll call polymers
is instance method and this is something
that I don't even think it's it's well
documented it might
seriously not even exist anywhere even
our docks but I spoke with our Czech
writer this is a thing you can use it to
sort of check to see if an element is an
upgraded polymer element so because both
are browse element and our activity
element have IDs we can reference them
using automatic node finding we could
say this dot dollar signed on brows so
if this is already a polymer element
let's just go ahead and return no reason
to do anything
no no importing or anything like that is
needed but we will set the selected
value to browse and then what that's
going to do is that's going to tell our
iron pages up here to switch to that
section so you can see where we're
binding it's selected attribute to that
property okay
now if the element has not been loaded
if it hasn't been upgraded yet now we're
gonna import its definition so we'll
call polymer dot base dot import a tree
and we're gonna pass it a path to the
HTML import for the browse section that
we want to load so elements slash X
browse slash X browse HTML and then
we'll give it a success handler to run
so we're gonna say alright cool the
element loaded in let's now set the
selected state to browse that'll tell
iron pages to update and now we can
return exit our route here we should be
good to go if we go back and we look at
our application now and we'll refresh
the page it should redirect to the
Browse section and it should start
loading in all of those cards awesome
right now we need to do the same thing
for the activity section so I can just
grab this entire route right here and do
some do some dangerous copy and paste
work here and we're just gonna go
through and any place where it says
browse will just flip it out for
activity activity
thank you spell check so when we go to
slash activity we're gonna check to see
if the activity element is upgraded if
it is returned if it's not import it
let's go give that a look so refresh the
page and we see our browse section
looking good we go to the activity
section and boom we got our status feed
showing up right there now there's still
a lot of unanswered questions to this I
kind of showed you the the quick and
dirty version of using import href but
well we didn't talk
was you know do we need to volcán eyes
these things in two different bundles
and if so how do we exclude common
dependencies or can we just use HTTP - -
maybe like server push all the things or
multiplex stream all of our dependencies
so there's still a lot of things that
remain to be worked out and what we're
gonna do is we're going to talk about
those in an upcoming episode of polymer
but today for what we've done here if
you have any questions please leave em
for me down in the comments otherwise
you can always ping me on a social
network of your choosing at hashtag ask
polymer as always thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you next otherwise
you can keep me on a social network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
