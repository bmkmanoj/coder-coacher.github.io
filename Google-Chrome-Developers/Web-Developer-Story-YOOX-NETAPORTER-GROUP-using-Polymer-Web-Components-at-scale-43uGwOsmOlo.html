for me is that is pushing forward web
component standards web components were
in the wilderness for a while lost in
limbo but now all the browser vendors
are implementing the api's and we can
push forward and that's portait we use
polymer to build a collection of
components that developers because then
pick up and drop into any project
they're working on currently we're
working on a listing page that's like a
product catalog but it's going to be
personalized and tailored for every
customer at the moment this has been
rolled out to a subsection of our most
valuable customers but going forward it
will be available to everyone when we
build components we try and take on the
methodology that was coined by Brad
Frost which is atomic design so we break
everything down into its most granular
level and then build up from there where
we make sure our components are
shareable and reusable if no one's going
to reuse it
there's no point creating it as a
component so ideally for us it contains
many things styles behaviors rules
monitoring version in all these things
we put together to build an atom and we
call those atomic components the biggest
launch of polymer and web components in
that support a has been the product
details page this is where a customer
will evaluate a product to see if
they're interested in purchasing on here
we have upsell modules which are like
you could wear this with also the form
of how they select sizes but I suppose
the single biggest component would be
the add to bag which we need to drive
revenue so if we had problems with that
and we wouldn't make any money we're
using polymer to solve workflow
challenges by having a standard catalog
of elements are available we use the
polymer standards for self documentation
and their own components for demoing
this means a developer can just come
along see what components they can use
how to use them and how to implement
them this has been a huge win for us so
for me I'm most excited about the
progressive web app movement it's the
one thing that I think will allow us to
get near-native previously we've never
been able to offer native-like behaviors
or customer journeys whereas now with
the way progressive web apps are working
and all the new browser API is we're
really getting a step closer to that so
we have all these exciting challenges of
how we build these new applications but
also how we test them
and for me I think that it's the best
time has ever been to be a web developer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
