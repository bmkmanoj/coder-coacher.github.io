would love to use tools I use something
to watch my files I use frameworks I
just use this mountain of tools and the
thing about tools is that typically
they're like so far in front of the
platform that we're building on so I use
a library to select Dom nodes and that
gets around the fact that like different
browsers have different implementations
of like how to get elements by IDs and
classes and I use things to compile
other things and it's great but if you
imagine your tools has a boat yeah but
you've got cause on the screen right
like yeah this is just gonna excite for
me if we imagine our tools as a boat oh
that that's beautiful out like that well
done okay and the platform is this slow
boat it's sort of behind and this fast
boat has an anchor and it's kind of like
just full throttle going ahead okay this
analogy I don't like late you drop an
anchor to stop the boat from moving
right no no it's it's a sea anchor you
know the sea anchor anyone know what a
sea anchor is obviously a sea anchor
because everyone knows we'll just tell
Matt it's you know when this there's a
storm you put the sea anchor and it
keeps you pointed towards the waves so
you don't tip over sea anchor but you
can still move the boat with the anchor
down yes yanker right okay
tooling is the boat yeah that foam is
the anchors that push still moving got
you okay all right so in this analogy
which is really solid
speedboat okay these tools are racing
ahead but the cool thing is this anchor
sea anchor as we know hashtag sea anchor
it's good it eventually catches up where
the boat was at one point you know so
the platform catches up to where the
tools were at some point and and that's
good yeah and it can happen super quick
as well so we all know yes 2015 right
yes yes so a year ago we would have been
looking at something like this so this
is the feature set list across the whole
range of rousers I think the top one is
about 68 69 percent of feature
completeness in Asian Firefox so
realistically if you wanted to use this
stuff in 2015 you needed something to
compiler yeah I mean there's a lot of
red yeah it's not good I'm a fan of the
color red but it's it seems like if I
wanted to use arrow functions
rady structuring etc insert feature
feature feature feature I would have had
to use a tool that would turn that into
es5 or lower yeah you're gonna need it
Babel so just alright I got it I'm in
2015 okay that's the state of things now
it's really nice it's green so now
you're looking at like well over 90
percent across all the browsers so you
don't actually need that tool that you
had before you can just run it in the
browser now yeah right I can open up the
dev tools console and type arrow
function and be like it just works it
just magically works inside of dev tools
I don't have to pre compile like I use
es2015 or es6 as it was known in 2015
which is weird
she was es6 it doesn't mean but but i
don't have to use a tool to compile yeah
that's the point in the space of a year
we have one tool we had to use we needed
to rely on it and now it's not needed so
my name is matt gone I work on the
developer relations team for the for the
web that I can do them again I feel like
I did not get to know you in that
introduction didn't get to know my soul
very boring can you do it again um okay
my name is Matt gaunt
I'm from Britain I like my tea in the
morning with a little bit of milk no
sugar wit milk builders tea yeah
no venom if I'm milk in your tea but
that's how you do it sounds a little
strange bull strange my name is Sam and
I like my tea in the morning just with
nothing just a teabag and I just like it
where it's really hot and you know yours
then you burn your tongue and then I'm
really awake so that's how I like my tea
I don't want to use the word masochist
but it feels right
no you're just you're just really
jealous of my life hack
stupid jelly so this talk was something
that Sam kind of concocted in his head
to a certain degree
I'm here to balance it out I think yeah
yeah so I I can relate to you this is
reality of web development I see I don't
think you can but you're gonna say you
do anyway so we're in this world of the
reality of web development and we use a
ton of tools you have your watch process
your compile process etc etc etc and
things are fine and this is how things
have always been yeah just more and more
tools and so you're working on your
project and it might look something like
this like I made a teeter-totter did I
like this a lot its tools platform and
every time we add a tool we get further
and further away from the platform so
you know you're using a framework and
you're compiling your JavaScript or
maybe not JavaScript some other language
to JavaScript and you get an error in
your code and there's like a fog of war
and I'm playing a video game I can't see
what's in front of me it's just this
huge call stack area like where's my
code where did this error come from and
that's the thing like we had tools you
get further and further away there's
more abstractions between you and what
you're actually trying to like compile
to which is the platform so it seems
like a bad thing
yeah so the point you're trying to make
is the fact that we have all these tools
and it's kind of abstract thing away
from the platform that is the point that
I said but I'm glad we're PS it thank
you
so the reason I
skeptical of this talk with Sam and I
use the word skeptical to be polite to
him he said something a lot nastier the
first time but that's fine skeptical I
like that it's better skeptical of my
ideas yes because I looked at the past
couple of projects I've been making for
the past year or so and when I look at
that the first thing I do is either take
a gulp build process or something that
I'm used to using in the previous
project and moving over into the new one
that's what I do or I'll take something
like web starter kit which comes with a
pre-built build process yeah you have
about tools in there like to compile
your JavaScript to compile your your
sass or something and the responsive
breakpoints but this is this is like the
web starter kit so can i order this from
a catalog and then I can build the web
you know if you send me a check I will I
will send you it in the post
yes so I can build the full web with us
yeah got a whole web I promise it'll be
the web in a box that sounds like an
awesome kit little LED that blinks on
top and everything but this is how I
start it and make my matte matte you you
have commits in this too right so you're
just bragging right now
no I'm smelling yourself feel like my
name is Matt gaunt and you should use my
tool I see I see what's happening
it's a beautiful impression of me thanks
so I worked on it um but the point that
I was getting to was this is how I
started and I ended up using these tools
I come to know these tools and I come to
love these tools so this is just how I
create projects and to go back to the
previous point of light Babel you don't
actually need it if you want to run
something in the browser today and it
kind of comes with this weird side
effect right if you're gonna pull in all
these tools from the first thing in you
run npm install well that seems really
fast though so that seems fine oh this
is gif time by the way this is about a
minute and a half and I've sped it up
because I figured you didn't want to
watch paint dry wait right is that
another Matt well gif time can I install
that to like speed up my npm install I
wouldn't be surprised if cinder has a
module out by the end of today gif time
gif time I like that that's good but
this is the weirdest thing right we
start our projects by installing half of
the internet before we even do anything
and yet you think of when we start the
web this is probably what we all know
and love right yeah I mean I remember
this I remember I think I got like a
book or something and I was like I'm
gonna make a website and so I saw that I
had opened these tags or something's
words and then I I said okay and then I
had to look on the keyboard it's like
okay where's the hungry alligator and
the not so hungry alligator I genuinely
hope you write a children's programming
book and that's how you explain it yeah
seriously yeah so once I figured that
and then there was a slash that was the
opposite forward back slash but it
looked forward I didn't understand it
but I found it so okay I press that I
saved it and then I went to my browser
and I reload the page and I saw my
website and then I could go back and
type edited or alligators and then
reload and then I had this awesome
developer workflow when I was like eight
live reload no tools I didn't have to
install anything it just worked and this
was awesome but as you pointed out we're
in a really bad state in compare that is
that's a nice way to put that bad yeah
sure terrible maybe it's a different way
of different there we go
sure so that's that's the premise of
Sam's talk yeah once you wants to get
back to the eight year old Sam okay so
so let's suspend reality for a moment as
I think any of my ideas require you to
do yeah you don't really live in the
same world as us do you know so we're in
this suspended reality state and we are
going to go all in on the platform Emlyn
we are going to not use tools we're
going to just use these platform
primitives these really powerful things
well we don't even need to suspend
reality to do this like we've seen this
this kind of stuff happen in the past
right yeah time and time again and I
think everyone can relate to I know you
want to be your favorite things rounded
corners yeah like I had a sweet way of
doing this so it's 2004 and we are in
the state of suspended reality and I am
your client
and you are going to make a button for
my website obviously sketch existed in
2004 right
well obviously vectors were so hot in
2004 but you'd start off you make your
image and you're like cool I got my
rounded corners that's the sweet and you
you cut it up and you like you don't
need one corner and then you got the
reproducible bit seems good you do the
right thing and you create sprite from
it because you know you want to be
efficient how many slices do you have in
that like nine slice right
I don't do nine slices that's that's
that's two new school for me right now
but you got to drop it in your page
obviously I'm using tables right husband
four yeah that's what you got to do you
got you CSS sprite sheet you pick out
the bits you want and like it's awesome
it scales and ah look all right so well
you delivered your button I'm not so
happy though because I don't like that
color blue can we change that to red I
really like red that's fine but I've got
a you know I gotta start again right
like you know okay while you're in there
I was looking at this on my phone and it
looked kind of blurry so I think that
like it my phone screen is better than
my computer screen or something so can
can i maybe if your phone's broken no I
think it's just like like yeah more
pixels no no it's fine well that's fine
we got pixel ratio we can do some
JavaScript fun and then maybe make a
second sprite sheet and then we got one
for the 1x okay okay oh and while you're
in there you know like my users have
been complaining they don't really know
that they can touch on these buttons so
can we make it so when you hover I get a
drop shadow but then when there's a drop
shadow I'm gonna use a bunch of
different backgrounds and so that
background needs to blend in correctly
with all these different colors anything
that works
no how about no how about your designer
just doesn't force me to cry at night
well I am a great client mmm all right
oh well
so as as web platforms sort of
identified people wanted these rounded
corners yeah and obviously spec authors
came and saw this and there was a
regular pattern and it was painful so
they came out of a solution right
this is CSS rounded corners to go with
the angry the the the alligators the SS
surroundings yes it was called order
radius but yeah fine if that CSS rounded
corners use CSS to ax equals border
radius already right so a border radius
kind of emerged there was this desire
from the community to be like hey we
want to do these rounded corners and
then how did we as a community respond
to that but we said oh it's like flat UI
is way in so rounded corners are totally
lame thanks for the present of the super
awesome thing was but the point we're
trying to make here is ultimately there
was a gap in platform Matt did you draw
that yeah hey okay I'm just letting
myself standing at the precipice of that
gap yeah all I can hear in my mind is
please mind the gap when the lining from
the station Jim Tom I've been teaching
him how to say that over and over I
watch the videos on I got a lot of those
they don't have those in the New York
subway it's just kind of like good ah
please mind the gap when are lighting
the trains anyway there's a gap in the
platform we wanted rounded corners it
was insanely painful to do so we as the
web developer community do what we do
best and we made a tool that we found a
way of doing it as that is a as a nice
rope bridge did you drop it I gotta say
my photoshop skills the day I made this
was top okay so I we have this rope
bridge and like the rope bridge in this
case was like Photoshop or some image
editing program to do the slices so as a
community really here these tools and
these methodologies how to do this okay
I'm with you cool and then we got
border-radius so the platform is
providing us a nice road another bridge
that's a good bridge make mics multi for
archers Oh platform ok the platform
relay border-radius great here's the
solution the platform came in we didn't
need tools things were awesome
I'm gonna say if you're sick of this
analogy by this point I just leave no
I'm joking I'm joking but this is the
point we're trying to make and we keep
on seeing this pattern over and over
again so let's say something else Oh SAS
preprocessors yeah because we're better
to be a programmer than in your CSS
files dude with clients like you that
want to make changes every five minutes
can't blame us so love you so obviously
I still use SAS I still love SAS for the
fact that CSS variables and mix-ins and
stuff I need variables and mix-ins and
this is literally the penultimate reason
of why you SAS this bit at the top
background color green it would help if
this worked seems like you have a syntax
error in your stylesheet no sorry that's
a terrible demo there we go how it's
good can't even do simple simple codes
all right but the point is this is
basically all I want it for is it like a
variable at the top this is background
color so whenever I want to change it I
can do and then we've also got mix ins
which again I still love add include
rounded and then boom that's just a
mixin so I can reuse it everywhere okay
so you have variables and you have this
idea of mix-ins which lets you kind of
reuse chunks and multiple places seems
like a good thing so is this a gap in
the platform and there's a tooling
solution Wow okay I'm with you so now we
have CSS variables the the platform is
caught up so a variable just starts with
- - got background color red and then at
the bottom we've got background and
we're just using bar the variable name
and the cool thing about this is we have
JavaScript access to these variables so
we can change them on the fly right yeah
and then I'll just change all of the ref
as you're going along that seems pretty
useful and this is SPECT this is in
browsers now like there's nothing going
on here it's just working and there is
also an early spec for mix-ins as well
so here we've got the rounded mixin
super obvious what it's doing but the
bottom we can do at apply and it's this
at apply draft spec there's basically
saying this is a kind of solution to mix
ins that we've been seeing from other
CSS preprocessors okay but this is even
better than what sass was doing because
instead of in lining that code
everywhere I used to extend what this
does is it just points a reference to
that mixin right yeah so I can actually
ship less bytes to my user which seems
like a to do and PS I just want to
applaud you for your use of a pink color
because it's I think there's something
more to a poet here the fact they
haven't enabled the web platform flag in
this in this instance it's on your
machine that does it sorry folks this is
actually in Chrome believe it or not but
it's behind a flag because it's a draft
spec but it's gonna work I still like it
it's nice but again the point we're
trying to make is was a gap in the
platform we had these tooling there's an
off ramp here where we don't need to use
it anymore so I think people are sort of
getting we're driving at yeah but like
ok so I saw that I have some CSS things
but like I'm a programmer and I want to
see some some JavaScript things you want
to see some JavaScript yeah okay well
how about xhr can you write an xhr top
of your head right now yeah totally
program I mean you yeah this is - it's
fine I get it you're challenging you
understand the reality of web
development so xhr okay so let me just
get into the head space okay I see it so
we start with XML i'll capital because
xml is capital yeah and then there's a
capital H then TTP capital H the rest
lowercase requests okay HTML xml
httprequest got it yep and then we pass
the URL and we need to open this
stay open got us in the ghettos the URL
and then you need listeners I don't
remember what the listeners okay I can't
do it I'm sorry I forgot okay well how
would you do it well I just use jQuery
like dollar signs out yet
right of course you would because
yeah man I like that you quoted yourself
well it's actually a retrospective um
what I'm saying is jQuery the number one
answer my Stack Overflow I just quoted
myself but wait you didn't say like the
- or the pound symbol or the asterisk I
hate you so much sometime but the play
is the Sam's getting app is jQuery super
nice because you can just do something
like this it's all awesome and happy
yeah so the community created these
libraries that got around the craziness
of that xmlhttprequest thing and they're
great things like that get that post and
then if you're like really hardcore you
just use dollar sign that Ajax drop down
right to the bare metal dollar sign that
Ajax I love that but the other side of
this as well and the main reason I say
JK is number one on sort of on Stack
Overflow is the fact that it's got tons
of extra functionality as well we can't
we can't knock it things like map things
are the JavaScript like spec well didn't
have a boy waiting and each and map they
flipped the iterator to the I and the
value so you had to remember to flip it
back when you were going in between them
right yeah sure sure great so much I'm
just pointing out like you're saying
wrong things but anyway jQuery solved a
gap in the platform it was a great tool
all right though when does the platform
come in and then I'm gonna drive now are
over like D Drive
whoo here's how to fetch the fetch API
okay the fetch is basically super
similar to jQuery so fetched this is it
you're gonna make a get request returns
a promise which means you can do some
happy promising and like jQuery returned
the promise like a deferred thing but it
was like a promise so okay this feels
very similar to what the community had
come up with we have now signed up yet
now it's turned into a fetch that
returns a promise that gives you a value
that you have to call Jason on our text
and handle the stream and then you get
some value okay great that's a lot
better because I can type fetch
I can't really type XML HTTP Rick
better yeah how I type just sing it okay
this is great but one of the main things
to kind of point out here is the with
jQuery you're kind of tied to jQuery
right like you write you rely on the
dollar sign if the dollar sign is in
there everything goes well it just
doesn't work it doesn't go anywhere so
this kind of this weird thing we use
jQuery and we should because it made our
lives easier but when the platform
caches often gives you something
comparable should really be the
preferable things so your code just runs
wherever you want
and since fetches javascript thing and
fetches in a reserved word we can just
polyfill that it should just work but
since we're talking about retro things
we're talking about jQuery and I have a
new sign such a long time I want to go
further back in time I want to go to the
Year 1997 I think Sam you would have
been eight eight a good eight years old
I would have been about nine I think I
would have just got my Nintendo 64 I had
it for a year I was really getting good
at goldeneye by then I used to race me
in Mario Kart and win because you
cheered by playing so much more before I
got mine yeah okay so 97 I'm there I'm
in that headspace awesome and this was a
time where everything was much simpler
javascript was used for sparkles on your
cursor well Brendan Eich was like oh I'm
glad you guys finally figured it out
JavaScript true purpose was that
sparkles behind your cursor
I don't know how Brendan Eich would feel
about that but I'm sure it's fine but it
was a peak for JavaScript of this yeah
definitely definitely a peak moment for
me at least but some other people that
were building websites were like hey
these sparkles are really awesome you
know be even better if we fix up like
our forms so we don't have a gigantic
table of input fields that I have to
fill out and then hit submit and
hopefully we don't get like 500 from the
server because I filled the date format
out wrong like maybe we could give some
feedback to users there and then in the
page rather than just use it as a
document
so what did we see the community sort of
do there was this desire from developers
to have these kind of rich widget
primitives and so people came in like
hey I'm gonna make jQuery UI I'm gonna
make dojo I'm gonna make Yui and I'm
gonna create these these primitives
these JavaScript primitives but still
like these really powerful widgets and
knobs and dials that make the web
awesome it was ultimately something that
every developer wanted they wanted to be
able to make these rich components
because there was no alternative on the
platform I don't know about you but I
pulled in that date picker I think on
every single project I was like well I
guess I'll pull in all of jQuery UI and
the whole theme files and all everything
and just I have a date picker though so
it's worth it it's awesome it was a
really good date picker it's I'm pretty
convinced this is still the number one
thing that I'll see everywhere on the
web is the date picker but you love the
accordion so you're like I have an
awesome one that's issue the only memory
I have a j.crew you I was just like I
wanted it for that accordion that sweet
sweet accordion look your whole website
wasn't accordion actually it was that
good but let's take an example of a dojo
component okay
dojo so this was like you could create a
little counter or widget with this but
what I find fascinating about this
markup is that if you squint just a tiny
bit you can turn on you to a web
component done
all right web components are this new
thing relatively new and they're
basically the platform's answer for
these primitives is these awesome little
components that give you life cycle
events like when I'm attached when I'm
detached when an attribute changes which
is like basically all you need to create
something awesome so we have created our
fancy counter web component which what I
what I'd love about this is dojo had
this idea with attributes and we would
basically use the Dom and then
progressively enhance the Dom into a
component and web components come in and
says okay well let's just make that
standard so you can define your own tag
types and you can just put in your Dom
and things aren't Sanchi ated and that's
really good yeah because ultimately it
means if you wanted to share that
component you just share it by someone
taking on their component they aren't
certainly too
on all of your tooling or whatever other
decisions that you've made along with it
so the platform came in and standardized
and created this new new primitive for
us yeah so we're kind of in this
scenario ready for a lot of these tools
we have a tooling bridge because that
was the first way we did it that's how
we showed we had a desire Andy for
something and we have this platform
bridge right next to it the interesting
thing is everyone's still kind of using
the tooling bridge still everyone is
using Twain bridge when I start a
project I have a gigantic NPM script
that I run and watches everything and
compiles it it moves all my files around
and runs lint and reloads my browser I
have this huge cooling bridge and I just
sort of ignore the platform bridge
because for forever it never existed so
there's kind of this interesting
dichotomy because there's also you take
something like border-radius we had that
tall thing it was so painful that we
basically burnt it right like I don't
think anyone in this room would ever go
to Photoshop just to get that effect so
we should be doing this for every single
project that we start is going do I
actually need this tool or has the
platform giving me something equivalent
but but since we're in this state of
suspended reality we're just going to
take the platform bridge yeah but there
also comes another point of we're not in
suspended reality right like I have to I
want it off to people all right well
okay so like if you're you're saying I
work on a real project though Sam and
what you're saying doesn't make any
sense
so I like how you're making me sound
unreasonable for that well yeah that's
the right way to kind of a trick but I
hear you so let's take something like
border-radius we all know that we burn
that bridge because hey guess what
supports really amazing and it doesn't
matter but if we take some the other
things we've talked about so CSS
variables oddly enough is actually has
pretty good support in all the browsers
I think it's just iron edge that would
probably be the one that would put me
off so now I need to worry about how do
I support those browsers because if CSS
variables don't work and I'm relying on
them that's not gonna work too nicely
for them and then if you take some like
fetch it's even worse like it's Firefox
and Chrome that has it none the other
one so I still need a solution for this
stuff and normally this is the reason
why we go for tools we want that
wide support but at the same time we
don't need it in the browser we're
developing on but what I've noticed
about these charts that I think that's
interesting to take away is a Chrome and
Firefox and these newer browsers have
support for these features today which
means that as a developer working on my
web site in my developer workflow of
2016 title drop and it's gonna see we
did we can use these things so in
development mode I'm just using these
primitives and I don't have any tools
running you don't need to compile
anything is it's back to the notepad
days so what I think you're trying to
say is this wow that's nice right so a
developer workflow should always
prioritize speed and what I mean by that
is I want that experience that had when
I was eight editing a text file
reloading my browser it works it doesn't
get any faster than that and when I
shipped to my users I should prioritize
correctness but what is what is
correctness really what is he correct
correct
and I would argue that your user doesn't
care what framework you're using your
user doesn't care what the underlying
API is and how they're working they care
is can i order my falafel on the website
and get it delivered to my house does
that work or does it not work yeah the
thing that I realized about this slide
was Sam was able to do the upside down
upside down question mark without
actually glimpsing he just kind of did
it for muscle memory well it's kind of
my favorite symbol because it's like the
non-committal question mark you don't
know if the person is going to talk back
to you and you're like how are you doing
upside I watch mark so if they don't
reply you're totally okay but if they do
it's like oh it's provocative
you gave me the weirdest look when you
said that that been like that but
luckily we have tools for this stuff so
the idea of rather than jumping these
tools a minute we're developing we can
actually just do it as a production step
to give us this correctness it's a nice
to put it so CSS variables you can use
something like CSS next and this is
super nice tool what it'll do is it will
inline the CSS variable value that
you've predefined or you can even make
it do a full back where it will define
first the value in just the normal hex
color value or whatever you want
followed by the CSS variable one so in
the browsers don't support it it will
just use the first one and ignore
whatever else and that way you can still
do the JavaScript thing there's even a
post CSS transformer that you can layer
on to give us that mixin support hmm
yeah if you want to yeah I mean it's
still experimental but it's cool that it
exists yeah this is the thing if you
desperately need it so that's kind of
cool so then we move on to JavaScript so
we got Babel which is basically unpack
Babel a bowl no no it's battle it's
Babel
like seriously I've had discussions with
addy on Tony Tony tips it's Babel no no
no it is it's definitely Babel its Babel
what are you gonna do you're gonna cool
the career of Babel yeah looks like
seriously you doing this right now yeah
when we call Sebastian you know what
you're saying
WebKit you're doing the same right now
hmm see if they'll pick up
see this is what happens when you try
and cool someone in London they just
don't like you well you know I just need
a card over to work it's gonna work it's
not you ready let's see there we go what
are you doing are you actually doing it
yeah hey smashing hey what's up okay
yeah he's on the phone so my my friend
Matt and I were having this debate is it
Babel or Babel yeah yeah all right here
just it's I promise no it's not yeah
okay it's actually him on the phone
sadly I thought you were making it up no
no it's it's really him okay so I bought
Babel right sorry the sidetrack I just
needed to fine you have problems with
babble babble anyway don't you Sam I do
oh this is good you took a picture of my
tweet yeah I did okay it was a sage
tweet you even replied so sage so sage I
like that okay this is my issue with
babble today we use these es2015
transformers and it takes all your code
that's written using aerial functions
whatever and it compiles at es5
regardless of what you're shipping to
your users like your users are using
imagine like only chrome in this
hypothetical world and we're still
compiling everything even though Chrome
you don't need it yeah and so what I
like about tools like autoprefixer is
that you can specify a range that you
want to support for your CSS prefixes
and then slowly there are less and less
prefixes because all the browser's kind
of standardized and things get better so
I want the same thing for Babel yeah so
PVC you'd go light I want Firefox and I
want to support - two versions before
the current stable one so then it looks
at the spec tables and goes oh we've
already got features support for that so
I'll stop fiddling with it so yeah if we
could get this on Babel that'd be pretty
cool yeah and I talking
to one of the guys that works on Babylon
he said he's working on it now so
awesome that's great so then things like
fetch JavaScript as a polyfill because
it's JavaScript okay so that means that
I can pull in this polyfill and I can
use fetch in my browser on all my
websites today yeah so this one's from
github it's super awesome he's done a
ton of different projects there's also
someone who's wrapped this for a node
module as well so I'm pretty much using
it everywhere now it's really nice and
then what components
yeah just like we we just talked about
this idea of web components these
primitives on the web that I can create
they have life cycles and no one they've
been attached and detached and I can run
JavaScript and it's all isolated and
beautiful there's a polyfill and I can
use them today
yeah just everywhere detect whether it
works and then load it well that sounds
really good so ultimately we're are in
this scenario where we've got this
massive tool chain and there's a certain
degree of tooling fatigue where it's
just like great the first thing you have
to do is install the other stuff and
then it kind of works and then if it
doesn't work then I need to go change
something and then the configuration is
broken or something else has happened we
want to change that so well right
instead of instead of building with
tools and using all of these tools to
build our website and we ship all the
tools to our user essentially what if we
would write using the primitives on the
web and then what the users get is just
a slightly augmented version of that
depending on what their browser supports
so it's like our tools become part of
our deploy process but not part of our
development process and like there's
this really interesting wind that
happens when you do this if we write
things using vanilla JavaScript using
web components and things that the
platform has support for that means that
when I say hey Matt I have written the
best date picker ever and you're like oh
cool totally rad I'd love to use that on
my project I don't know why you came the
we do yeah you Luigi but you can just
pull it right in you don't have to pull
in my tool chain for doing this date
picker like with yeah there we go yes a
material design Lite is most material
design built with sass so the thing is
if you wanted to take just the ripples
from the button that's cool but
certainly you have to take all the sass
with that to just use that one thing
which me
using less or stylus or something else
you've got to preprocessors rather than
one row as if it was in CSS variables
you could just take it as is drop it in
your web page and you're done okay so we
build with the primitives on the web
your code becomes portable across
projects which is awesome you don't have
to pull in extra libraries and so then
when we ship to our users we add a
slight tooling tweak to polyfill support
and that means everything works so in a
kind of roundabout way you're saying
embrace the platform I'm saying embrace
the platform exactly so when we embrace
the platform I think everyone wins the
developers win because the developers no
longer have to worry about their tool
chains during their development workflow
and the users actually eventually will
get the most optimal solution because
they're getting these primitives which
are optimized at a browser level not in
a tooling level and so the users walk
away with a working website and a
website that probably takes less bytes
to function because you're not morphing
everything just for the sake of it
exactly
so thank you everyone for listening
