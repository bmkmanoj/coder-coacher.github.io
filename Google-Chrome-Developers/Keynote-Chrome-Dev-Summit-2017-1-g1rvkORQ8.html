at the fifth chrome dev summit yeah
thanks for everyone coming to Yerba
Buena into San Francisco and for
everyone on the livestream
we have an exciting couple of days for
you I'm Ben Galbraith I'm product lead
for the chrome platform team
I'm Diaw now man Google was developer
relations lead the two of us have
actually been working together for over
20 years on the web across Mozilla Palm
webOS and his developers building native
and web experiences and now we're
working with the web community here at
Google and we couldn't be more thrilled
the reach of the web is truly massive
with billions of people all over the
world using it constantly and people use
the web no matter the device that's
what's so special about the web whether
you're framing experiences for desktop
or from Oban and whatever device is
going to come to us tomorrow the web is
going to be there for you but back to
the day we're really excited about the
quality of experiences that we can build
on today's web platform for the past few
years we've been talking a lot about
progressive web apps pwace are defined
by specific new capabilities that we've
talked about before like serviceworker
right but for us PWI really is about
providing users with fantastic web
experiences the load really really fast
that seamlessly integrate with a user's
device that are reliable in the face of
uncertain network conditions and are
really just highly highly engaging we
find that developers who embrace this
philosophy who take advantage of the
latest web capabilities to optimize the
performance of their web experiences are
seeing great results take trivago a
major travel services company who bet
early on PWA they started experimenting
with a small team of three developers
and a designer and after seeing initial
promising results they kept iterating
and today they have launched PWA
experiences in 33 languages and 55
countries
and trivago have seen a hundred and
fifty percent increase in engagement for
users who have added their site to the
home screen and in 97 percent overall
increasing conversions we found that
these kind of amazing results are
typical of developers around the world
who make this sort of investment this is
made possible in large part by the broad
browser support for serviceworker
including browsers in the next billion
users regions of the world and we're so
excited that both the Microsoft edge and
the WebKit themes have announced that
they're working on adding serviceworker
support we think this is big news that
really signals the global demand that
we've heard for PWA features I don't
think I've ever seen so much enthusiasm
for a single dip yeah and then again
when people found in the WebKit console
that the serviceworker object was right
there to blow up amazing as we've worked
with companies that actually use service
workers we've seen common patterns time
and time again so we package them
together in an open source project that
we call work box this encapsulate what
we've learned into a library that you
can then just incorporate into your own
code using workboats means instead of
boilerplate code such as this you can
bring it all down you can choose from a
set of caching strategies that are
available to you and just choose the one
that makes sense so you take work box
and it really streamlines the creation
of serviceworker enabled sites and is
used by 70% of all ship serviceworker
sites around the world today definitely
recommend that you check it out
serviceworker
requires that sites use HTTPS for all
their requests so this gives us a
natural opportunity to check in on our
efforts to drive HTTP adoption around
the world we've been at this for many
years now and we've been evangelizing
the importance of HTTPS and investing
and making it easier for developers to
migrate such as by sponsoring the let's
encrypt effort along with many other
companies in the industry we're pushing
hard here because migrating traffic to a
secure transport layer is one of the
best ways that we can provide security
and protection for our users we closely
monitor how much traffic
is passing through HTTP in Chrome and we
share this with the community in our
transparency reports the latest of which
we just released this morning and were
really pleased with the results for
example on Android chrome is now serving
64% of its traffic over HTTPS which is a
50% increase year-over-year from the
prior year and we're seeing strong
increases on other platforms - also
worth noting 71 of the top 100 sites now
default to HTTPS which is also a big
year-over-year increase over 37 sites
last year so when you consider the huge
size of the web these kinds of changes
these increases are almost stunning but
we know that we're not done yet earlier
in the year we started to mark o
insecure forms that accept a credit card
number a password is unsafe what you're
gonna see from us this year is we're
gonna mark any insecure form is unsafe
so if you aren't on HTTPS yet now is the
time and it's never been easier speaking
of forms we think it's really important
to streamline the form data entry
experience as much as possible we want
to take away as much the friction
experience as we can and on mobile of
course this is even more important
autofill is one of the ways that we do
this in fact over nine billion form
interactions every month are aided by
autofill and we found that on Android we
save over 12 seconds on the median form
entry when autofills used so as
developers we have a big impact on this
performance by ensuring that we hint our
forms with autofill completion hints
giving our users the smoothest possible
experience with autofill chrome autofill
ability to store credit cards and
synchronize them across all of your
devices is particularly helpful with web
payments but there's an opportunity to
do a lot more here to make web
transactions easier so we've been
working on payment requests the new API
and browser UI for facilitating
web-based payments j.crew the american
fashion brand here recently implemented
payment request and they've seen great
results let's take a look at this
as I buy this lovely pair of bear socks
once I've decided to buy I'll add it to
my bag and start the checkout flow when
I click checkout now we see in the
payment request UI in action rendered by
Chrome giving me an easy and fast way to
share my payment and shipping
information which a crew resulting in a
very fast transaction 50% of their users
are now going through this flow on both
mobile and desktop and it cuts down the
transaction time by 75% this new
experience works wherever payment
request is implemented that's currently
in chrome edge Samsung Browser and both
Firefox and Safari have announced that
their support is coming give it a try
it's also worth noting the payment
request is a particularly good fit for
mobile in fact I want to give a mobile
example now with fancy comm this is a
marketplace for discovering cool new
products and they've just integrated
payment requests also with the Google
payment API which is the best way to get
access to the hundreds of millions of
credit cards and debit cards and other
forms of payment like PayPal that Google
have on file for users and the Google
payment API was actually just opened up
this morning to merchants we're already
seeing the payments ecosystem embrace
payment request to this example stripe
they recently integrated the Google
payment and payment request API into
their platform with their beautiful
stripe elements library another major
area of form-filling friction and
frustration is authentication you'll be
shocked to hear that we found it to be
one of the biggest reasons why users
never return to a site and I'm sure that
we've all had experiences that feel just
a little bit like this one nope so we're
excited to share that today we've
launched a new sign-in library to help
this library allows developers to take
advantage of the fact the millions of
users have already signed in with Google
properties and allows you to offer these
users a one-time one tap sign-up
experience for example here I'm using
Zillow to browse for my new home and
visit in the site for the first time and
I want to mark this of
the affordable San Francisco home as a
favor but to do this I need to create an
account because Zillow is using the
Google sign-in library and I've already
signed in to Gmail in Safari I'm able to
do that seamlessly with a single tab it
was just there and gone the dialog that
you saw pop up from the bottom was all
that was required to create the account
and in this example with the popular
tribal website kayak it shows how the
library facilitates subsequent sign ins
with similar ease and the Google sign-in
library also integrates with the
credential management API if the user
already has a username and password
saved and it's based on an early draft
of an open ID standard thank you let's
switch gears and talk about media media
is one of the biggest use cases on the
web both for consumption and sharing
Mary mica just had a report where she
shared that some people spend five and a
half hours a day interacting with media
on their devices that's like two
Bladerunner showings back-to-back that's
a lot of Bladerunner that's a lot of
labor the recent deprecation of flash
really shows just how capable though the
modern web media platform is here's an
example of joy' cinema where they bring
this all together and show a really
really nice web media experience that
shines the web has been adding deeper
integrations between web media and the
underlying operating system and we've
implemented these in chrome for example
with the media session API your web
media sessions are synchronized across
devices and UI surfaces on Android just
that your users expect even when the
browser window isn't open and with
Android oh we've already added support
for picture and picture ensuring that
web content is a first-class media
citizen on the platform we mentioned
media sharing alia the camera is
obviously so important with mobile and
we recently updated the image picker UI
in Chrome to make it easier for users to
upload their content right from their
gallery as you can see here in this
example with Twitter's web property
then when you get access to the live
camera feed using getusermedia it now
gives you full frame access and the
ability to control the camera hardware
such as engaging the flash mucking
around with the ISO levels and so when
you put all of this together you can
really create amazing things take
Instagram the popular photo sharing
experience they've invested in mobile
web support to make it easier for users
that have devices with constrain
capabilities or our user in generally
unreliable network connections to do
that they're taking advantage of
adaptive bitrate streaming using the
open source shaaka media player they're
using image capture and filters WebGL
add to homescreen and serviceworker
powered offline support and they're even
using the new background sync
capabilities and more they're here the
chrome dev summit with a booth that you
can check out to see a demo of all this
and they're also participating in a talk
tomorrow where they explain how they're
building this experience it's pretty
cool it's really cool it's great what so
these meteor AP is arnaud important way
to create web experiences that feel
tightly integrated into the user's
device let's continue in that vein today
we're announcing a new way to integrate
your web content with Android so
originally the way that you integrated
web content with Android apps was with
the webview API which is a modern web
render inside of the Android SDK then we
created custom tabs which allows you to
take advantage of the user's browser to
render web content in your Android app
the advantage to using the browser is
that custom tabs provide a consistent
rendering experience across a wide array
of Android devices and it provides
access to the users profile such as
cookies autofill data and more
however this experience is designed with
opening other web sites in mind it's
kind of a mini browser embedded inside
of the app so we continue to show the
toolbar at the top of the screen so
that's great if you're building
something that kind of has to keep going
out to different content like an RSS
reader or something but what if you want
to use content on your own website you
probably don't want to show a toolbar
within that experience instead you can
provide the right experience directly in
your app and this is now possible with
the new capability we're announcing
today called trusted web activity by
launching a trusted web activity any
Android app can directly include app
like content serve from their own site
with the benefit of custom tabs but
running full-screen this enables you to
combine the best of native and web in
one experience on the website that means
up-to-date content small on device
footprint and you can share this across
all of your platforms and from the
Android side you can take advantage of
everything Android has to offer such as
access to Android activities and
services and integrate them with any
other aspects of Android such as the
Android and apps shortcuts that you see
in this example we'll be releasing a
preview of trusted web activity support
in chrome developer channel soon and
it'll be available in the Android
support library so other browsers will
be able to support this try it out and
let us know what you think now let's
move on from platform api's and
integrations and talk about the core
primitives of web development the Holy
Trinity if you will of HTML javascript
and CSS these are the key technologies
that you work with day in and day out
and they've each landed massive upgrades
that you can use today
first up HTML one of the recent big
additions here has been web components
which gives you a cool new way to share
complex functionality by defining your
own custom HTML tags it's a great way
for you to encapsulate complex front and
functionality into reusable components
they can also be integrated into a wide
array of web front-ends we have cost
graded the polymer project to facilitate
the adoption of web components even
across browsers that didn't yet natively
support them this has been kind of a
breakout year in my opinion for web
components throughout the entire
industry with browsers like Safari
recently search shippin built-in support
and with new tools from the community
like svelte
skate and stencil for some reason they
have to start with the letter s I'm not
sure why but we're starting to see a web
community come together for this tooling
ecosystem and these things are starting
to feel a little bit different they're
feeling more like compilers than
libraries where they generate lean and
fast web components that are ready to
use to make web components easier to use
with today's web frameworks we earlier
this year launched a new site called
components custom elements everywhere it
helps you understand how each of the
frameworks supports web components so
you can make great decisions and
understand how best to integrate them
with the web app that you're building
and developers all over the world are
seeing the benefits of web components
williams-sonoma is a great example of an
ideal use case because they own the
portfolio of life style furniture brands
and so they need to reuse a lot of
common web front-end code across a
variety of different sites they're using
web components and it helps them achieve
this reuse and also interoperability
with a variety of web frameworks and
here at Google were betting big on web
components are widely used mobile
framework and relies on web components
to provide high performing
domain-specific tags for specific use
cases like news websites or as shown
here ecommerce sites like overstock with
over four billion amp pages across
twenty five million domains loading in
half a second on average amp is a great
example of web components at scale and
they rely on web components as the
technology that helps them deliver their
easy-to-use tag vocabulary the latest
version of YouTube also embraces web
components and uses polymer resulting in
an experience that's up to fifteen
percent faster than the previous site
YouTube developers are actually been out
to reuse over a thousand custom elements
across the multiple sites that they
build which is a really big deal for
that team so that's some of what's
happening in HTML now let's talk about
CSS we've all gotten a cheap laugh out
of this old chestnuts it's such a cheap
shot you know but you know what we think
modern CSS is actually genuinely all
so now for us the biggest news here is
gridlayout
which really gives you an amazing way to
define fluid responsive layouts for a
modern web application and community
resources like grid by example show you
exactly how to make it work for you with
tons of specific layout examples kudos
goes out to Rachel Andrew for all of our
hard work in the community here it's
great to see how these things work
together for example using grids for
your app combined with flexbox four
components kind of feels like a match
made in heaven and what's most exciting
is you can actually use all this stuff
there is broad browser support for grid
layout so now is the time to dig in and
apply it to your own web experiences
this takes us to JavaScript the last
member of our Trinity so to speak and
it's had a fascinating history going
from its origins in the 10-day epoch
hack at Netscape to unfortunate episodes
like entire versions that were specked
out but not fully shipped
yeah they don't remember es full yeah
ActionScript do you know yeah it was the
thing half life that time fortunately
does feel like a bit of a distant memory
as modern JavaScript has come a long way
with browser suppo iterating and
improving rapidly in fact in the last
year the majority of browsers have
shipped compelling support for a whole
new batch of features in JavaScript
known collectively as Ekman script 2015
and crumbs coverage is now basically at
100% you see a hole see a green there's
only one small feature that the browser
community has all generally agreed
wasn't a good idea and won't be
implemented so it's basically all here
yeah I love seeing all the screen modern
jas of course brings us classes arrow
syntax async away and a huge range of
features that make it easier productive
and plain fun to build on the web
we've also shipped module support along
with others like Safari and we're
working on fully shipping dynamic
imports we believe in the next year
modules will be the way to build and
deploy your sites
I like this code sample because it shows
off dynamic imports and this is actually
really important because we're
constantly optimizing our sites to be as
fast as possible in the initial
load and this enables us to restructure
how we think about JavaScript so that we
just serve what's needed for that
initial experience and gradually suck in
the rest of our resources as we need
them it's really pretty cool of course
all of chrome support for these new
JavaScript features comes thanks to v8
our JavaScript engine we just shipped a
really ambitious new release of v8 that
has a completely new Ryoga texture that
has resulted in substantial performance
improvements we have a whole talk that
goes into detail on this tomorrow we
wanted to share some of the highlights
for you starting with the speedometer
benchmark now this is a benchmark that
has a reference app that's written in a
bunch of different popular modern web
frameworks and we exercise a v8 on it
and we found the new architecture has
resulted in a 22 percent speed
improvement for us on speedometer we're
also looking at VH performance in the
top 25 real-world web sites and we found
a 5 percent performance increase with
the new version and finally looking to
the future we have this benchmark Ares 6
that is focused on measuring VH
performance running the next generation
of JavaScript features anticipating
broad uptake and preparing us for the
future of the web and here we see a 40%
speed improvement so we're really
excited about what the team's been able
to accomplish in optimizing the v8 so
these improvements are really important
but not just for chrome also for nodejs
developers are there any node developers
in the audience there we go there we go
very good very good where v8 of course
is the engine of node and the v8 team
takes this very very seriously we have
dedicated engineers working to support
node and we don't allow any commits into
VA if they break node itself v8 also
provides support in chrome for something
called web assembly commonly referred to
as wisdom of course wise ohms we talked
about last year provides a compilation
target for low-level code such as C or
C++ and it provides bindings that
enables that code to access the
capabilities of the browser what's
exciting for us today is that wiesen is
now finally available across a huge
swath of the web with support in Chrome
Firefox and Safari across
desktop and mobile and coming soon in
edge wait a minute
I think edge actually ship support of
this and are rolling it out to all of
their users as we speak on stage today
pretty awesome
so for the first time since JavaScript
we have a new widely supported runtime
target in the browser we think this is
huge news we want to give you a feel of
what ways um actually enables so the
Google Earth theme threw together a
quick demo of their low-level code base
utilizing WebGL compiled for wasm and
running in chrome it's incredibly
exciting to see this kind of
functionality come to the open web and
we're pleased to share that both unity
and Unreal Engine have announced that
they have plans to support wisdom with
their market leading game engines so we
think this is going to be a really
exciting space to watch in the coming
months it's a big moment for the web so
we've just talked about a bunch of
updates to the web platform there is a
lot to keep track of and so it's more
important than ever to have up-to-date
documentation for all of this that's a
really big job and so we're excited that
last week Mozilla Microsoft and Google
all came together and shared the news
that we've teamed up to place all of the
web platform reference Doc's on
Mozilla's developer Network site along
with Samsung and the w3c we've actually
been collaborating here for quite some
time but with this announcement we
formalized the partnership with the
creation of a new MDM advisory board
this is just one of the many ways oh
thank you for the thank you this is just
one of the many ways in which the
browser vendors are collaborating
actually I think there was an NBN staff
we know it's really important to you to
build applications on a web with really
broad compatible and predictable
semantics so we're also pleased to give
you an update on the web platform test
project which we talked about before
we're pleased to share that over the
past year we've increased the test pass
rate by 18 percent in chrome and fixed
over 500 interrupt bugs we're continuing
to make
progress in this area and we've also
seen Safari edge and Firefox make
similar improvements all of us working
together to make the cross browser
development experience better all right
now we want to touch on some of the work
that we're doing in the tooling space to
make developers more productive our
flagship tool here is of course chrome
dev tools which is directly integrated
into chrome itself to help with daily
web development tasks and one of the
most important features of dev tools is
lighthouse which provides you with a
detailed audit of your site and offers
you actionable steps for improvement and
lighthouse can also be run from the
command line so you can easily integrate
it with your continuous integration
infrastructure which I'm sure all of us
use to ensure our web apps are are of
high quality we're gonna share more
details on the latest updates for dev
tools and lighthouse tomorrow but let's
get back to continuous integration for a
second we recently launched Papa Tia a
new open source project to control a
headless chrome instance intended for
use with testing and automation we
actually think it's incredibly powerful
to be able to fully command chrome with
simple script just like this anything
chrome can do is a quick function away
it's pretty amazing in fact it's kind of
weird there's a website we have called
try puppeteer that you can go to where
you can actually exercise puppeteer
which means you can run the headless
Chrome inside of the head full chrome
and then render HTML through its try it
out it's great so tools like lighthouse
and puppeteer give you incredibly
valuable insights but it's important to
remember that on the web your users can
come from all over the world as we
talked about in the beginning and
because of that they're gonna have very
diverse ways of experiencing your site
now webpagetest
is a vital tool here giving you detailed
site performance information from
locations all across the globe you
should make a habit of checking your
site a webpagetest org slash easy to run
against real devices and it even
integrates with lighthouse plus you'll
get bonus points from alex russell if
you do so and today though we're pleased
to announce a brand new project that can
help give you an even larger performance
perspective we call it the chrome user
experience
port it provides a snapshot of how
Chrome users all over the world are
experiencing a sample of popular
websites across mobile and desktop
devices and various network conditions
in this initial release we're focused on
loading metrics such as first content
full paint all of this data is published
to bigquery where you can use a sequel
like syntax to analyze it in this
example we're running a query that
returns the fraction of users who get a
first contentful paint event on google
origins in under a second as you can see
it's pretty fast we're excited to share
all this information with you and we're
looking for your feedback on the
structure of the data set the metrics
and the dimensions of everything that
we've included here let us know what you
think alright we started the talk
telling you how excited we are about
today's modern web platform with a
steady stream of new capabilities
expecting expanding what's possible in
web applications and with the core
primitives HTML javascript and CSS being
dramatically upgraded and green across
all of these different modern browsers
and an entirely new cross browser
runtime target with the web assembly and
a bevy of new tools and other support
resources we hope you agree the modern
web is truly an amazing platform and
across the world
developers have noticed and are
dramatically upgrading their web
experiences and reaping big benefits
we've touched on a couple of examples
here as we've talked this morning but
over the next two days you're gonna see
a ton of real-world case studies and
great demos that will help you see what
you should be building in your web apps
more importantly while we're all
together we want to hear from you and
understand what you think we should be
doing next so let's say we have a great
conference and work together to build a
better web thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
