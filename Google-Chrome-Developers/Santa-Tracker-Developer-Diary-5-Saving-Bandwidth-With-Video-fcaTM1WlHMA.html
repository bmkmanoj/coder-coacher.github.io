the Santa Tracker series I want to talk
a little bit about gifts and befores and
just generally saving your users
bandwidth let's have a look so this
episode heavily features one of my
favorite scenes it's called present
bounce it really brings me back to my
youth
you can drop conveyer belts on the
screen and press buttons to have a
present roll into Santa's sack you've
also got your bouncy things and stuff
like that sometimes I can do this level
in one try not quite this time so one
thing you might have noticed when we
loaded this scene and I just reloaded it
now is we get these tutorial cards well
we wait a second they only show up if a
user doesn't do the thing we want them
to do so in this case it's telling the
user to drag the conveyor belt onto the
screen cool I'll do that the tutorial
will now go away if we wait a few more
seconds will actually see a few other
tutorials so we've got a few bits and
pieces of you need to click the invader
to change it and you also need to press
the button to start the level what I
want to pick on is that in previous
years these were actually gifts and if
you look at this figure here there's two
megabyte gift picture in previous year
that if we use a download of this
tutorial image that actually download
two megabytes of gif and this came from
a good place in Santa tracker we tend to
avoid having a lot of text we much
prefer using iconography and animation
too so shall we user what to do we don't
want you have to read a lot to really
sit down and play so we had this gift
which was great
now we can actually do thanks to browser
advancements is send an mp4 down there's
one catch if you have an mp4 you can
have it autoplay but not if it has audio
this works really well right because
this gif doesn't actually have any audio
lining up with it we just want to show
an animation what we actually do is it
converted this animation directly to an
mp4 we actually use an online tool you
can google for a couple although most of
them are just front ends to the
open-source tool ffmpeg so if you have
gifts that already work and you like
them you can just typically convert them
one problem you might have though is
that these gifts end up having no
transparencies it's a nice property of a
gif that actually you can have
transparent pixels so this matches our a
little cloud effect so let's talk about
how we achieve that effect the video
isn't transparent so how do we add this
cloud effect around the edges so let's
have a look again so if we look at our
source code we can see that we've
actually got a video element inside our
sata2
element which is the thing that manages
these clouds which you see on the page
this video tags actually not displayed
if you look at our CSS you can see that
it's actually display:none the user
actually never sees the video it you
know as as it is so you can see here we
have an on play handler this is the
polymer syntax for adding an event
listener in card so this just basically
means video element dot out event
listener play so whenever that happens
we call blit to canvas play is called
every frame that the video is played or
drawn and so what we do whenever that
video is played is we actually take it
we've reset the canvas and then we
actually do a couple of things firstly
as you can see here we've lit our shadow
image that's the little shape that we
want to have this video fit into we then
turn that actually to white for various
reasons that shadow starts out as black
for us we then draw the video using a
sudden composite operation and what that
basically means is that we'll only draw
things within that shadow that we
already have so we've lit the video
which is the current frame we can
literally say V which is our video
element and we can literally draw it to
the canvas and now we have this lovely
video playing here that's actually
playing in a different element being
drawn into the canvas right in front of
us with no real performance loss
whatsoever and this video most
interesting enough is only about 80
kilobytes compared to two Meg's
obviously this is the worst possible
case I could find we've got a few
examples of maybe a couple hundred K
down to 20 or 30 K and actually another
challenge we face is that many of our
gifts were already highly compressed and
when gifts compress what actually
happens is you get a lot of bling and
spots around the edges so it turns out
putting them into ffmpeg isn't really
useful because it's actually going to
try to maintain that weird compression
that you kind of saw in that asset so
unfortunately the some of our gifts that
we don't have the source code to which
we can't really fix so we're kind of
stuck with them for a bunch of reasons
if you look at a tutorial folder here
we've got a a code buggy dog gif file
and if you look at this image you can
see there's a few artifacts around the
edges so you know this one's only 200 K
which still feels like a lot but
actually turning it into an mp4 makes it
even bigger
which is kind of a pain but we don't
have the asset for this so we're not
going to bother fixing this for now so
as well as converting our gifts to mp4
is to make them smaller we also do a few
other compression things on our media to
make them better
so if a P and G's we use PNG crush or
zopfli to make them smaller and for
SVG's we use SVG or and occasionally a
bit of manual tweaking to make sure that
they're the smallest they can be so
Santa Tracker has a ton of SVG
throughout its site you know the trees
the cute houses and things like that but
we often find that they're way too
detailed for the screen they're being
drawn out you know we originally use an
asset when it was this big and now it's
this big so we'll often make sure we
reduce the amount of detail we send down
to the user because if they're not going
to see it it's not worth putting in our
SVG and a tool like SVG or doesn't
really know that it just tries to make
them compressed if you are curious about
the approach we took today to play our
video and make you know Jerome asked
around it be sure to check out some of
the links below this isn't a new
practice we've done for Santa tracker
but we've hopefully taken it and used it
in a you know really nice way so thanks
for watching and I'll see you on the
next episode you can subscribe to the
google chrome developer channel down
here we'll check out some other great
videos along here
