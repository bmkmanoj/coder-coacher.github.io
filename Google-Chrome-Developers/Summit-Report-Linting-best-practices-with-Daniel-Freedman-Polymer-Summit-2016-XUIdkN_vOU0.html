here with Daniel Freeman aka the danwon
if you're playing a poly Mon we're
outside the the codelab area right now
at polymer summit and Dan you just got
done talking about unit testing
integration testing linting a bunch of
cool topics for the folks who haven't
seen your talk yet can you can kind of
like a like an overview of some of the
material that you touched on well sure I
went over es lint and poly lint are
preferred tools for making sure that
your elements are linting and they're
just getting rid of all the easy errors
ahead of time and yeah and and also a
web component tester I know you work on
that did you cover that some as well in
your session I did I went over how to
set up web component tester and
integrate it with your testing I also
made a side to paper checkbox our
example element that you can go look at
and see how we use web component tester
okay okay cool right on so for for folks
who are new to testing yeah like what is
what is one thing you would you would
recommend they go do and get into a
project that they check out or something
like that to help them sort of get off
the ground and learn about testing yeah
the the biggest thing people should do
is they should go to the paper check box
element and get set up for Travis CI
which is our continuous integration
provider and get their element tested on
every commit on every platform and just
make sure they know browser is given
them troubles ok right on very good
advice that's sage advice from the
danwon right here so Daniel thank you so
much for being with me today thank you
all for watching again we're gonna we're
going to keep shooting more of these
interviews live from the palmer summit
