splash screen for web apps launched from
the home screen on Android you can defer
script execution until idle with request
idle callback and push notifications
will automatically dismiss on desktop
these are just a few of the new features
for developers in chrome 47 let's dive
in and see what's new in Chrome making
the web app experience better has been a
major focus for Chrome to make it easier
for users to re-engage with your app Add
to Home screen puts your app directly on
the Android home screen and you can
customize the way your app looks when
it's launched by modifying the web app
manifest adjusting colors eliminating
the address bar and more in chrome 47 a
dynamically generated splash screen is
shown even while chrome itself is
loading making your app look that much
more polished in the past users
typically saw white screen while waiting
for your app to load the splash screen
is generated based on a combination of
information from the web app manifest
including the app name background color
and the icons chrome will use the icon
that is closest to a hundred and
twenty-eight device pixels so on a 1x
device that's 128 by 128 pixels or on a
2x device its 256 by 256 and so forth
personally I recommend providing a 1x a
2 a 3 and a 4 X version of your icon
that'll make sure that you're well
covered for all devices when a user
launches your app from their home screen
the splash screen is shown and once your
app begins to draw the splash screen
disappears one of the biggest problems
hurting critical paths is lots of
JavaScript executing at the wrong time
if it's run at the wrong time for
example when the user Scrolls the page
or you append a Dom element while the
user is tapping a button
things can become unresponsive request
Idol callback changes that in the same
way that request animation frame allows
us to schedule animations properly and
maximize our chances of hitting 60fps
requests idle callback will schedule
work when there's free time either at
the end of the frame or when the user is
inactive functions registered with
request idle callback are given a
deadline and should return before that
timeline is reached otherwise you'll
introduce jank if there's still work to
do the function can register for another
request idle callback to continue the
work during the next idle period request
idle callback is now available in Chrome
and is coming to other browsers soon in
the meantime you can check out the shim
so give it a shot and let us know what
you think by tweeting us at chromium dev
push notifications powered by service
workers have been available since chrome
42 and we've heard from users and
developers alike that on desktop
notifications would remain visible until
the user dismissed them chrome 47 now
automatically dismisses desktop
notifications after about 20 seconds
unless you set require interaction true
when calling show notification there are
lots of other new features for
developers for example array.prototype
includes which simplifies checking over
a membership you can now enumerate
cameras microphones and speakers with
the Navigator media devices API and
prefixed encrypted media extensions are
now disabled in favor of unprefixed Emes
these are just a few of the new features
in chrome 47 for developers be sure to
check out the description below to get
links to more details and learn about
some of the other new features if you
haven't already subscribe to our chrome
Developers YouTube channel to stay up to
date with the latest news I'm Pete
