dev summit were so excited to be here
very happy to be able to share our
enthusiasm all the excitement about the
web ecosystem with you and talk across
these two days about all the things
we're doing to help you be successful
building for the web about all the
things we're doing in chrome very
excited so let's get into it so our
mission on Chrome our mission is to move
the web platform forward this is as true
today as it was when we first got
started with chrome nearly 10 years ago
I'm so very excited about that
like I said over the next few days we're
gonna have a lot of content for you a
lot of great stuff talking about how
we're working to try to make the web
better and work with you to great create
great experiences on the web now
ordinarily at the beginning of these
talks we usually update you on the
number of chrome users in fact last time
at Google i/o we mentioned that there
were over a million chrome mobile users
which is just awesome there's been
tremendous growth but this year I want
to present a slightly different number
this year I want to share or sorry not
this year it was the same year but at
this moment I want to share that we have
over 2 billion active chrome browsers
this is across mobile and desktop so
rather than focus on one platform I
wanted to make this point that they're
just a lot of chrome browsers out there
and well that's great for us and
everything and I don't mean for you to
be excited about that I think what's
exciting about this to you all is that
when you're thinking about building for
the web this means there's a lot of
browsers out there that implement the
latest web standards and implement all
the latest and greatest features that
when we're talking about how to build
for the web how to take advantage of
these new things that's reality you can
actually take advantage of that there's
a lot of users out there with modern
browsers and it's not just Chrome
there's lots of other browsers that are
implementing the latest standards too
there's a lot of energy and excitement
in this whole space which is really
really great to see I think it's
fantastic and so that all gets to the
point that the web has tremendous reach
we know this this is this is why it's
such an attractive platform it's such a
cost-effective
low-friction way to get experiences in
front of users get in front of real
people and that low friction is it's all
made possible because of links URLs
that's just that's the super power of
the web right we're very used to that
and the links are getting even more
exciting so I wanted to invite you to
pull out your phone if you have an
Android phone or if you have Chrome on
your iPhone
there's beacons in this room Bluetooth
beacons so make sure you have Bluetooth
turned on and if you're on an iPhone you
don't have Chrome setup right you can
check this URL here it'll give you
instructions but the point is the
physical web made possible because of
Bluetooth beacons and and your Android
device observing those beacons and
sending URLs out into this room URLs
that are contextually interesting to you
so in this case there's a beacon
broadcasting the URL for the chrome dev
summit web app web app so it makes it
very convenient this is sort of leaning
on the power of URLs as a user you can
just quickly go under the notification
shade on Android click click on the
physical web entries there find yourself
on an experience there's not much hassle
to that it's really great
now there's another beacon in the room
for an app called poly Monde a web app
called poly Monde this was created by
the polymer project polymer team so poly
Mon is a free-to-play location-based
augmented reality game it uses your
mobile devices GPS capability to locate
capture battle and train virtual
creatures called poly maan that sounds
kind of familiar right anyways so you
collect poly maan by locating members of
the polymer team in the real world in
this conference venue so check it out
it's really cool it's a lot of fun so
like I said contrast that seamlessness
that ease of finding yourself on
experiences thanks to the web with the
cost of installing and software that
friction really matters so by some
estimates every interaction step that
you expect a user to take in order to
get to your experience can cost you up
to 20% of your potential users think
about that for another moment
compare like one tap to say three taps
that means you're potentially losing
about a third of your users or imagine
or taps versus one tab now you're
potentially losing half your users
roughly and so that's that's a big deal
right we all know this that's why we're
all here we excited about the web we
know this potential is it's real it's
awesome and so the web the web is really
great on mobile we've been very focused
on the mobile web for some time and of
course the web didn't grow up with
mobile being a reality but the web has
been awesome for the mobile has been
awesome for the web and it has really it
helped expand the whole market for the
web make it make it making it so much
more easy to reach users think about it
you have a mobile phone in your pocket
the fact that you can sit on your couch
and not have to get up off the couch to
grab the laptop but you can just pull
out the phone browse the web access all
this wealth of information shop for
things etc it's so convenient I just
recently I I I pulled out my phone my
Nexus phone and I bought a pixel phone
it was so easy
of course now there's a delay probably
babies yeah anyhow of course we know
that the web has lots of challenges it
wasn't again built with all that in mind
with a mobile in mind and all these
challenges these constraints have led to
an innovation really
we've all had as a community had to
figure out mobile and we've done made a
lot of progress so there's gonna be a
lot talking about that of course the
mobile web has evolved a lot from the
early days and this this chart is just a
reminder I think most folks are familiar
with us the mobile web usage has what is
that anyways the mobile web usage has
far eclipsed desktop web usage this is
you know going back a couple years and
so I'm sure what many web developers are
familiar with this and it means building
for mobile web is a priority and mobile
web brings visit so many challenges of
course mobile devices are vast and very
different screen sizes CPU constraints
memory constraints power constraints all
manner of constraints and of course
connectivity constraints we're all
familiar with the good old offline
dinosaur right
YUM and of course connectivity
constraints are not just about
reliability are also about bandwidth and
latency and some of these challenges are
extremely acute for a lot of your users
because 2g networks are reality for many
people in the world and if you look at
developing markets it's even more of an
issue nearly two-thirds of users in
developing markets are are stuck behind
2g connections it's a big deal
infrastructure is improving but we don't
expect this to 2g to go away anytime
soon it'll still be with us so there's a
lot of challenges there to address 2g
and the web itself you know the whole
point here is that the web is a very big
thing it's worldwide it's in the name
it's it's everywhere it it's it's a
wonderful tool for so many users there's
easily three point over three billion
users across the whole world using the
Internet that's like ten times the size
of the u.s. if you think about it
there's just a large addressable
population and then nearly 2 billion of
those are in developing countries so we
look at current estimates of Internet
users we see that while there's roughly
about 280 million in the US about double
that in India about 460 and in China
upwards of 720 million the web is truly
global it's a there's a there's a lot of
users all over the place
and if you look at just the gross last
year a lot of is concentrated in places
like India where India it's all about 30
percent growth over 100 million new
users coming online that's really
remarkable that's 10x the growth of
China hundred times the growth in the
rest of the world in emerging markets is
where a lot of the new growth is gonna
come from as well just focusing on India
for example 65% of that population of
that country is not yet online that's
860 million potential new users 20 times
the number of users not yet online in
the US and so I think actually the
reason why I make a focal point of India
is not just that there's a lot of users
there but actually that we're seeing
some of the most interesting and
remarkable web development happening in
India and the reason for that is because
a lot of these users who are connecting
to the Internet
for the first time are doing so you know
not from a laptop they're doing it from
a phone a phone that is very
underwhelming by what many of us are
used to these are phones with 512
megabytes RAM at most very limited
screen sizes very underwhelming CPUs
limited my already mentioned memory
limited storage right a lot of these
users they don't have a PC where they're
going and backing up their data that
phone that phone there's the computing
device that's where they're storing
information they care about it's not
easy for them to install another app in
fact it's very common you talk to people
they say I wouldn't install the app use
it for a little bit and then uninstalled
it so I could have that precious
precious storage space for something
else so we're seeing a lot of innovation
in this area because it turns out the
web is actually a fantastic tool think
about it the web is designed it's a
streaming platform you can bring part of
your experience down incrementally it's
designed for constrained storage it's
great for constrained networks actually
and with thanks to a lot of the new
api's have been going into the platform
we're enabling developers to have a lot
more control over how their web
experience works how they can deliver
the experience and how they can you know
create a good experience for users so
we're gonna talk a lot more about that
so there's just a lot of innovation
happening here out of the need to
address those constraints and it's
really that necessity that is is leading
to so much in innovation and I think
it's really exciting and so my point
really is that Web Apps worked really
well in emerging markets they also work
really well here and all that approaches
techniques and technologies that have
been developed at work are working for
folks in India they work really well
here too I think we all know what it's
like to have poor connectivity but we
also know what it's like to have LTE so
this is this is the point web works
really well in emerging markets a year
or so ago we had early pioneers in this
space like Flipkart showing the way
developing lightweight web experiences
that could incrementally come down onto
the device can't be cached and and
deliver a delightful experiences to
users behind 2g connections other
companies have been embracing this
approach as well one that I want to
highlight is is boot media a beaut
streaming video streaming service
this comes from Viacom 18 which is joint
venture between Viacom and Network 18 so
they just set up a this is a this is a
new service and they got online very
recently they built a web experience in
fact 40% of their traffic goes through
the web and they by building for the web
they were able to really reach a lot
more users more easily and in fact just
getting started here they it took them
only a matter of like three weeks to
prototype and experience that they were
happy with and it convinced them that
they should continue to invest and
they're investing further there the next
version will feature offline caching of
snippets of videos so that users can
preview movies and TV shows and other
boot originals easily so that's very
exciting so this is all about building
progressive web apps I think many of you
have all heard this term before we've
been talking about it for a while we
introduced it last year and progressive
web apps are not just about anyone
technology or any set of technologies
it's not even about you know anything
like that it's more about a new way of
thinking about building web experiences
we have experiences that are radically
improving the user experience and we're
gonna be talking a lot about this but
these experiences that you can create
the thing that I want to show you and
have you leave with is knowing that you
can create experiences that are just as
immersive just as engaging just as
native feeling as any experience you
expect to find on your phone I think
that's really exciting the combining the
power of the web with sort of the form
factor of mobile and creating
experiences that really delight users
and that you get a lot of value out of
and so there's a lot of different
companies joining in and seeing success
and we're gonna be talking about a
variety of these over the course of
these two days but I'd like to just zero
in on one and take a moment to show you
a demo so this is about CNET CNET has
built an experience at cnet.com / -
today it's a progressive web app and so
let me demo that for you I'm gonna
switch over to the overhead here so I
have my snazzy new pixel phone and I
have seen it tech today at it
homescreen so I'm gonna launch it and it
comes up smoothly nice little transition
there so be scrolling of course this is
a little carousel so I can browse
different articles oh try not to read
the news too much so anyways you saw
that was all very smooth fluid fast as
what you'd expect on a mobile device you
might have might notice that I'm on
airplane mode that's pretty cool right
maybe you thought I already had Chrome
running or something like that
so I'm gonna just let's get rid of that
and let's do it again same thing you saw
before it's pretty cool right oh oh it's
just in case you didn't have a had any
doubts that was just a website I added
it to my home screen anyways thank you
let's go back to the slides so really
great to see the work that folks like
CNET are doing but they're definitely
not alone excuse me
another partners are going to talk about
is Alibaba and Alibaba is one of the is
the world's largest business the
business platform in over 200 countries
so they built a progressive web app over
the summer and they're seeing 76%
increase in conversions and this is
about users interacting with support
when they're interested in a product so
it's very exciting that's a huge key
metric for them and seeing that kind of
increase is significant and I and I want
to I want to just make the point real
for you so like single today is an event
that Alibaba sees is an event in China a
day where lots of lots of shopping
happens this is an event where people
feel encouraged to buy something for
themselves and the singles day happens
on November 11th 11:11 which if you
adjust for time zones is right now and
this is the biggest shopping event on
the internet and they expect to see
nearly 20 billion in revenue which is
three times more than Black Friday and
Cyber Monday combined so investing the
progressive web app was
a big deal for them a significant thing
and seeing these kind of conversion
rates is a big deal so I think it's
great to see folks having this kind of
success building for the web building
for the mobile web and tile Tran will be
up shortly after me to share more
partners stories with you so progressive
Web Apps talked about this before like I
said we've been defining them as
reliable fast and engaging the point is
progressive web apps are about creating
a much better user experience like what
I saw like what I showed you with the
scene at Tech today example and by
reliable I mean things like well you saw
how I was offline and I tapped a home
screen icon the experience should work
right that's what a user expects that's
the point and when it talks about when
you think about fast this is a great
stat comes from double-click study where
they found that users abandon 53 percent
of users abandoned sites that take
longer than 3 seconds to load
interesting thing about this is that a
year ago that number would have been 40
percent so users obviously don't have
the patience they might wish they had
and so it's really important to pay
attention to that initial loading
experience and you saw with the C net
example that it was very nice and so all
this is made possible thanks to the
serviceworker api we is but it's not
just the serviceworker api it's about
using it properly and we're going to
talk a lot about that but the
serviceworker api just to refresh you is
an API that lets you have control over
your caching strategy and offline
approach to building your experience so
you can manage how the network is used
by your web web app and that is really
the huge enabler for the web platform
and we estimate about 3 to 4 percent of
all page loads in chrome are now going
through service workers which is really
cool so focusing in on performance this
is another another way of looking at it
and I really like this quote it comes
from a member of our team if you
wouldn't make eye contact with the
stranger for the time it takes you takes
your web app to first paint it's too
slow so this is getting at that sort of
awkwardness of like when I'm waiting and
waiting what
bending and first paint that's about
getting some pixels on the screen
drawing something right there's no
reason why that can't be done quickly
there's lots of challenges of course but
we want to show you how to be successful
with that and it's not just about
getting some pixels on the screen it's
also about making that experience
interactive shortly thereafter and so
with that in mind you'll going to hear
us talk a lot about this metric getting
your site interacted with in five
seconds over a 3G connection again not
everyone is you know lucky enough to
have an LTE connection so focusing on 3G
seems to make sense and if you have an
LTE connection should be able do a lot
better than this but five seconds is is
a great metric to that we're going to
talk a lot about and this is made
possible thanks to things like service
worker but that little sort of leads to
designing your web application better
chunking it up better there's other
technologies like HTTP 2.0 which are a
big enabler here and oh by the way
Service Worker API requires TLS and HTTP
to give brings TLS so these things all
work together very nicely we're very
excited about these technologies and
helping you achieve these kinds of goals
and build fast experiences for the web
so when it comes to engaging you saw how
I had a website on my home screen it was
engaging experience normally what you
expect from the mobile web
well you expect that it's easy for users
to land on your site it's so so easy
thanks to the power of URLs for users to
discover content but what about getting
back to that content that they liked
well often time that means the user
might have to like remember the thing to
bookmark your site or remember the
origin or remember all the steps that
got them there and of course when it
comes to mobile that's nowhere near as
effective as just getting your icon on
the home screen so a year ago we focused
on this problem and we introduced app
manifests and an ability for the website
to indicate that it would be great to
prompt the user forget them to add the
site to the home screen and this has
been a you know a great a great feature
and you should think about add to home
screen is sort of like a lightweight
install that's kind of the experience
that I showed you there and on Chrome
or sorry we've seen from partners a lot
of great success from Add to Home screen
this stat comes from Alibaba which I was
talking about earlier they've seen four
times more engagement with Alibaba
thanks to Add to Home screen for four
users who have added Alibaba to their
home screen so that that makes sense
it's not actually surprising it's good
to see it borne out like this so add two
home screens of an important thing we
know that intuitively and indeed it is
based on the data we're seeing we've
also been tuning Add to Home screen so
we've been playing with the heuristics
one of the things we didn't want to do
was just spam these prompts in front of
any user any time I want to be
thoughtful about it so we've been tuning
them and seeing by tuning them by
reducing the amount of engagement
required on the site before we show the
prompt they're actually getting 48% more
conversions or installs or users adding
these sites to their home screen which
is a really great stat and then all
without actually increasing the number
of users who ignore the prompt or
dismiss the prompt so we feel like
there's a lot of opportunity here to
continue refining it so just want you to
know from chrome from the chrome team's
perspective we're working to tune this
and make it work even better we're also
playing around with different formats
why not call it install actually and so
here we're definitely experimenting with
that but I think there's some
interesting questions here but it's
exciting to try and I'm really excited
to share that we're also looking at
experimenting with deeper integration
into the Android OS and this is this is
really cool so today the way Add to Home
screen works is it's putting a widget on
your Android device and what that means
is the user if they remove that they're
not going to find the app though the
icon in the all apps and that can be
confusing so we're working to improve
that so that when you go through the Add
to Home screen flow what actually will
mean is that your website will actually
be available in all apps it'll be in
places where you expect to find app
icons on the device this has been a big
effort there's a lot of work still to do
we're experimenting with this it's going
to be in preview shortly on the chrome
dev channel for very very excited about
this change and some of the other things
that go along with it are things like
giving you the ability to update the
icon and change the name of your of the
thing that's been pinned to the
homescreen which is a really obvious
thing that you should be able to do and
then also we're experimenting with
granting notification permission when
the user goes through the add to
homescreen flow that's something you
also that's not that's something that a
user actually is used to when they think
about the way Android permissions work
so we're just looking to like smooth out
the rough edges here make the experience
work a lot better I'm very excited to
share that and Paul Kinlan will be up
here a little bit later talking more
about how about this change so the other
other big way that that they the
developers like to re-engage with users
on phones is with push notifications
this is something that we've been
working on for a while been seeing a lot
of adoption it's very it's it's a really
key feature think about it
users who are interested in getting
notifications it's a great way to remind
them that there's interesting content on
your site and there's been a lot of
adoption so 18 billion push
notifications sent daily which is a big
number
Thanks is exciting but even more
exciting so we've seen over 50,000
domains using push notifications this is
really really interesting
because it sort of speaks to the
longtail aspects of the web the web is
really great at enabling the long tail
of developers and just to give it one
one example this comes from Carnival
Cruises so on Carnival cruise site you
can book book a trip you can put it on
hold maybe you're not sure yet if you
want to buy it and then they'll they'll
offer a feature to notify you when your
holds about to expire and they get about
a twenty five four percent opt-in rate
for this and when the notification
appears in front of users 42 percent of
them actually click on the notification
and land back on the Carnival Cruise
site that's a big deal these are users
that they might not have had coming back
otherwise and it's a different topic
seamless sign-in this is something
you're going to hear more about later
today this is about the credential
manager API that we introduced around
back around Google i/o but now we have
some early partner results and I want to
share those with you in the case of
Aliexpress
they're seeing an 85 percent reduction
in sign and failures which is really
cool and pintura is seeing about a 10%
increase in desktop logins so these
numbers are all about these are early
early data but people are seeing success
and the nice thing about the credential
manager API if you don't you're not
familiar with it is that it's all about
avoiding situations where users have to
enter their re-enter their username and
password because the browser already has
that information and we can negotiate a
seamless way for for it to it to allow
you to log in and getting logged in and
signed in is really important especially
for your engaging engaged users and
we're also going to talk a lot about
payments because we know this is really
important part of the web ecosystem a
lot of works gone into improving
payments on the web we've of course put
a lot of effort into autofill
improvements in Chrome there's also the
payment request API which is all about
making bringing one tap payment to the
web very excited about the Zack will be
up later talking about this so I think I
think it's clear that building
progressive web apps makes a lot of
sense there's ton of value here it's a
lot of work going in to improve the
platform and make it so that you can be
really successful building progressive
web apps and we want to I also want to
take a moment to talk about some of the
tools that we're building to help you be
successful and these are just some of
the tools that I want to highlight we're
gonna be talking about these throughout
the conference and these tools and
others first is lighthouse this is a
Chrome extension that we built that
helps you zero in on some of the things
you could do to improve your progress at
web app it's sort of a an analysis tool
it helps you optimize your progressive
web app you'll hear more about this from
Paul Irish a little bit later then the
second one is real-world condition
testing or simulating Network and CPU
conditions that you might find in the
real world this is a new feature of the
dev tools in chrome I was very handy
very useful of course there's no real
substitute for real actual device
testing a lot of your users do not have
fancy new pixel phones and so on
and so it's important to test with a
diversity of phones to make sure you're
building an experience that works for
everybody and Alex will be up later
talking about how to do that with again
with dev tools there's also a new
security and application panel in dev
tools which are really handy you're
gonna hear more about these but they're
really helpful to help it did enable you
to explore what's going on with your
progressive way about being able to
explore the cache is really a nice
feature and so the other tool I want to
take a moment to talk about is polymer
and we've been working on polymer for a
while now this comes from the chrome
team we built polymer in the beginning
because we we wanted to we wanted to do
it in conjunction in concert with the
improvements to the web platform and
polymer is all about web components and
web components are a new feature of the
web platform we wanted to develop web
components the right way building
polymer was a way to sort of guide that
process from our perspective and
polymers you know great library makes it
really easy to build for the mobile web
and that's that's that's important we
again we want to make it easy for
everyone but web components of course
there's been quite an arc and the
development of web components the
initial versions that we launched in
chrome you know they weren't they didn't
see a lot of adoption from other browser
vendors that's unfortunate but we went
back to the drawing board work with them
in the standards bodies and today I just
pleased to announce that we're seeing a
lot a lot of shared enthusiasm for these
api's in fact apple has started shipping
some of them like shadow dom v1 this is
a big deal if you're familiar with
polymer shadow dom is the most
complicated piece of the whole web
components set of feet of technologies
and getting this implement it natively
means using web components can be done
in a much more lightweight fashion it's
great to see and even on the tip of tree
of WebKit now custom elements v1 landed
and it's not behind a flag or anything
so it's fantastic to see all this
progress HTML imports will figure it out
and this is lap of partners adopting
polymer using it as scale including many
products from Google today such as
YouTube really really excited to see all
of this all these folks seeing success
with polymer and at the polymer summit
just a couple weeks back a few weeks
back we announced polymer version 2
which in addition to being based on
these new v1 specs of web components
also is a much lighter weight faster
take on polymer and we're really excited
about you're gonna hear a lot more about
it later in addition to polymer being a
library that helps you build web
components we've also fleshed out the
whole polymer a bit more with the
polymer app toolbox to make it easy for
you to build applications a lot of times
this is where folks are struggling this
makes it a lot easier to prototype and
build experiences and really happy to
announce that there's been a lot of
interest in the community around web
components we have this new site beta
web components org which you know folks
are just pouring in different compel
events and that they've built so it's a
great great community site great
opportunity to kind of see what other
folks are building and take advantage of
these components again the whole point
with web components that these are
reusable chunks of code and technology
that you can use
so speaking of web components I also
want to talk about HAMP and amp is
another great tool for helping you get
on the web and be more successful in the
web and amp is actually based on web
components it's got a custom markup
which are just web components there's
over 700,000 domains now publishing amp
so it's seeing a lot of adoption and
this is web components being used it's
scale the amp is like I said a great way
to get content in front of users and it
can also be a great way to get content
and users that leads you leads them into
your PWA leads them into your
progressive web app and we'll talk a lot
more about using amp and pwace together
tomorrow so those are some of the tools
also want to just make a few notes here
about predictability and what I mean by
this is you know we want to make the web
easier a lot of times you know thanks to
quite a lot of legacy there's a lot of
little
dark corners and so on and challenges
for you as you're thinking about
targeting a bunch of different browsers
so this is a big focus for us and our
goal really is like I said at the
beginning to move the whole web forward
and that includes making making it one
platform as much as we can and so like I
said the web should just work she just
worked for you so we're focused on web
standards we're focusing on working with
other browser vendors this
collaborations that we've had a really
important it leads to things like I said
with web components and a serviceworker
api and so on and so forth and we're
also working to sort of get better at
doing a new feature incubation and
figuring out how to like work with the
standards community to bring features to
to market in a better way so a lot of
progress here our focuses like I said
just on making things easier for you I
don't that know I just want to share a
tool that we put together which is this
browser bug searcher it's just a
convenient tool lets you search bugs
across all the different browser engines
I think can be very handy so check it
out and so also on the education front I
want to mention that there's been a lot
of so in addition to the chrome dev
summit which which your head and we had
a year ago we also had the progressive
web up web app summit in the summer and
we've been having these progressive web
app Road shows which is taking content
talking about web web progressive web
apps and helping developers be
successful so in fact we just had one
yesterday in San Francisco maybe some of
you attended it but this is content than
code labs and scripts that you can take
it and use yourself to put on a
progressive web app event in case
there's not in case the roadshow isn't
coming to your community we're also
working on a longer instructure
instructor-led for education programs on
progressive web apps so look for more of
that to come so looking ahead I just
want to wrap up a little bit by saying
that you know obviously the web is a big
deal you're all here for a reason we
love the web right there's so much
energy so much innovation so much
enthusiasm a lot of excitement you can
see how the how this path of discovering
out the mobile
has gone and how we're how we're
accelerating towards you know figuring
out these wonderful progressive web app
experiences that can make make the
experience is so much more delightful
for users and help developers be
successful reaching those users there's
a lot of other new technologies I didn't
mention that are coming to the web and
enabling other really exciting
opportunities think of feature think of
features like web assembly there was
just a cross-browser Developer Preview
announced recently on this web assembly
is an evolution of as emoji is which was
informed by some of the early work that
we did on Native Client web assembly
combined with wedge yelling now WebGL
2.0 bringing open OpenGL ES 3 to the web
imagine the kinds of experiences that
this can enable this technology Knable
obviously things like more immersive
games but a lot of other really cool
stuff we're very excited about that and
then you combine some of those
technologies and the things we're doing
with with new new new platforms like VR
think about that VR and actually the
kind of convenience that the web ads and
kind of capabilities it adds to the are
your on you have your headset you want
to be able to like dig in on something
and explore things and if you have to
stop to install apps it's not gonna work
great
so the web is actually a wonderful fit
for such an environment
think about a our augmented reality here
you're looking out onto the into the
real world and missus feature stuff
imagine something tagging real objects
in real space with not just names and
descriptions but like URLs that you can
go and find out more about that object
URL is such a powerful tool in that kind
of world and the web is such a great fit
and I think it's on us to kind of just
explore and develop and all of us I mean
to figure out this kind of figure out
how the web can be leveraged since these
kinds of environments I'm very excited
about the possibilities there and then
think about Internet of Things IOT you
saw earlier the example of physical web
to get access to URLs that are
contextually relevant to you but imagine
you're walking up to some kind of device
and it's broadcasting a URL to you and
that URL is the application that you use
to control that device thanks to API is
like web Bluetooth you can imagine how
that would work right you walk up to
some kind of a device and it broadcasts
a URL you know you've got the control
website and it's talking web bluetooth
to that device and interacting with it
that seamlessness that low friction of
the web it's such a great superpower you
can imagine it in so many other
applications so anyways these are just
some some thoughts on that and I'm
excited to see what what what you all
will build and what we'll build together
I'm excited to be part of this ecosystem
I think it's really exciting like I said
we have a lot of awesome content for you
today and tomorrow so thank you for
