actually excited about this so um but
also if you don't know me which should
be the vast majority I'm surma and at
this point it shouldn't really surprise
you that I work for Google in London so
as Matt just said I kind of wanted to
piggyback off of the slogan that you
have heard multiple times today and you
will probably hear a few more times
today I'm sorry about that but most of
time it's true and we used it slogan
also already excessively at Google i/o
this year where we announced polymer 1.0
and I was in the audience and I was
thinking but what if there isn't and
since I thought it's probably a safe
assumption to make good i'm not the only
one with that question i thought i'd use
this opportunity in particular the
polymer summit to write an element with
you something that shows like a few
little tricks some design patterns that
will make you write an element that
integrates well with the rest of the
elements are already out there so that
you will have a good app so as I said
with polymer 1.0 we also announced the
catalog at Google i/o by now there's
actually more catalogs out there is that
you can just find and have like
collections of elements but for us we
have these collections of collections to
be exact that solve multiple use case
that you will encounter when you're
writing your apps so we have wrapped
most of the client side ap is if you're
looking for a server-side API chances a
little bit slimmer but they're steadily
growing over time and especially for
Google API it's we have basically
element eyes all of them and I think
element eyes is a word now we've gained
obvious a lot of experience while
writing these elements in terms of what
kind of parents they are and we
discovered a few practices and that's
what I want to share with you however I
want to be clear that what I'm saying
and what I'm going to be saying our
patterns that are not untouchable just
because your google these are things
that we found to be working well but
polymer 1.0 is still
the new so things will have it will
evolve and be trashed and maybe be
deprecated at some point in terms of
patterns and the new ones will come up
at some point so here's an example of
what we're going to look at today's
scenario is pretty clear you have an API
but you don't have a specific element so
the question is what you're going to do
so this could be like some third-party
API this could be the API of your very
own startup and you thought about
wrapping this and this is something you
might be asking why would I want to wrap
the API in an element in the first place
and this is something we're actually web
components already shine because they
give you the ability to turn something
like an API which you would usually
usually lose programmatically into
something that you use declaratively and
that is really powerful concept it gives
you two kids it gives you a common
vocabulary to talk about what you
actually want to do and gives you the
ability to be composable something that
Kevin already talked about very much it
also something it's really nice is that
it gives you the ability to do
refactoring because you're literally
moving elements around either from one
element to another or just inside one
element so polymer is really standing on
the shoulders of giants and namely web
components and all the other web
standards we're actually combining
another hood so I hope I've convinced
that you do want to write an element for
your API now the question is how do you
do that um the main goal usually is is
to hide the complexity but still make it
available to the developer if he wants
to and how you achieve that is usually
by using two-way bindings excessively
two-way bindings are really powerful
concept that we give to you inside
polymer and I'm going to show you how
this works and but even for AP AP is we
have elements to talk to in a generic
way we have seen before the dash an iron
Ajax element something that turns
vanilla xhr requests into a polymer kind
of thing and we have even more of these
kind of generic element in the catalog
so before you start
always take a look at our and all the
other catalogues if there's something in
there that you want to combine into a
new element because composing is really
the main thing to do so I thought for
this talk I would use a website that we
all know and love and probably use every
day which is read it and there is no
element for that I just said that
actually so we're going to build what
you're seeing right now together so this
is straight up just off the shelf
elements which is a paper input it's
paper radio buttons it's a html5
standard list and and we're just
composing these intro an app that will
allow us to list the current entries in
a certain subreddit so everything is
there except for one element and that is
how we actually get the data our
connection to the reddit API and i will
use reddits JSONP api for multiple
reasons once and for once it allows us
to avoid the course issue and it forces
me to stay read-only for this talk
otherwise this would not be a 20-minute
talk and also we already saw iron Ajax
before and this will actually utilize
another element from the catalog so this
will be the app this will be the app
that uses the element that we are going
to write it looks kind of overwhelming
right now but I hope at the end that
this will kind of make a lot of sense to
you so don't try to realize just now as
I said it's all off the shelf elements
except for the reddit API element which
is what we are going to focus on right
now so the use it should be kind of
obvious to you I hope it takes a
subreddit as a string and it takes
sorting as a string to decide if you
want to see the hot topics the new
topics or the controversial ones and via
the post attribute it spits out an array
of the poles that are actually in the
subreddit according to the sorting that
was usage now start let's start
implementing and as we've said before
and I think Rob said that it is kind of
weird to think about having elements in
your code that don't render but for API
elements it would actually be confusing
if they did so a rule of thumb is is if
you actually have
an API an element for an API don't put
any visual content in there just have it
as an element that you take a reference
to and that's it no more and you can see
here like a very slight version of
composing we're using another iron
element inside our own and this is the
iron JSONP library element this element
is great because it makes iron JSONP
weirdness into something that feels
kinda alright even though it's still
JSONP so for example this element takes
via the library or l property or
attribute it actually takes the URL to
load and takes care of generating a
unique callback name for you so you can
even fire off multiple requests
concurrently with that element and don't
have to worry about these different
requests interfering because each
request will get its unique callback
which is really good also note that we
are actually binding the library URL to
a property called request URL this is
actually the I think the most important
property of our own element but we're
going to get to that in just a minute
let's look at the other properties first
because they're actually really simple
so the first one is the subreddit
property it's obviously a string i'm
using reflect to attribute but know that
reflect your attribute has to be used
with care because what it does is it
actually d serial as he realizes the
actual value to the dom and DC realizes
it if you're actually going to use it so
this can be really slow especially if
you do it often or if the value is
actually huge if it's like a huge JSON
object so for example I will not be
using reflector attribute on the post
property because that would make
everything look ridiculous also in this
particular instance I like using
reflection attribute because it gives
you the ability to look at the current
value and the Dom inspector of your
browser and also a reason why it would
look really weird on post because it
would be like a huge json string in the
middle of your API inspector um but
since we're using our we're writing an
API element right now it's safe to you
reflect your attribute because these api
elements are usually only used once on a
single page notify has been introduced
multiple times before
this is just there so we have it
available for two-way binding and as I
said two-way binding is what we are
going to use a lot because it's really
really powerful sorting exact same thing
post is the first property that's
actually a little bit different first of
all it's obviously an array not a string
so we are having a different type here I
also declared read-only as i said this
element is going to be read-only you
will not be able to post something to
read it by appending to the post
attribute or something and also what's
really interesting is that posts will on
the sides generate a setter function
that is called underscore set posts so
we can set the value obviously but from
the outside if you assign to the post
property it will actually raise an error
and you know you will have done
something wrong I also added a default
value just to make sure and notify again
for the two-way bindings there's
actually a fourth property that I didn't
talk about because it's not really
important but i did add it which i
called base URL so technically this
reddit API element is going to be able
to talk to your private hosting over it
if you have something like that but the
default value obviously uses the
official API endpoint of the front page
of the web that we all know let's get to
request URL because this is where it's
actually going to get interesting
request URL is fi set bound to the
library URL of our JSP element so it's
supposed to have the value of the end
point where the JSONP request is
supposed to be sent to and as you can
see here it's actually a computed
property so what that means is that
we're declaring or we are saying use
this function to actually calculate the
value of its property and these are the
parameters that the value depends on and
then polymer does something right it
takes care for us of the fact whenever
any of these properties change it will
automatically re-evaluate this function
and the request URL property will assume
the return value of that function this
is the function that is going to be
called it just effectively concatenates
all these different attributes it also
pens the percent call back percent
placeholder that is
a predefined place holder of the JSONP
element it will be replaced by the
uniquely generated name for the callback
and what this means is whenever any of
these attributes is change the URL will
be recomputed it will be immediately
passed on to the JSONP element and this
will in turn mean that this request will
get fired off we will get new data so we
have just written an element that is
completely event-driven without us ever
touching the kind the explicit event
infrastructure so whenever the user
changes like clicks on one of the radio
buttons or changes a separate name
immediately data will get reloaded and
you will immediately see the new posts
on the app that we have written so as a
last thing to look at is just the event
handler new data that we defined that we
are using just their and that's actually
pretty boring the data that we get back
from reddit is huge its exhaustive so
I'm just mapping over the post and
taking out the title and the link
because that's all we need and then i'm
using the previously mentioned set posts
function to set the value of our reach
only post attribute so let's get back to
the app that i mentioned earlier it's
still kind of overwhelming but now we
know all the elements because everything
else is off the shelf as i said so let's
look at the step-by-step so first of all
we have the paper input we have
introduced paper input before and we
know that we actually don't need to do
the colon colon trick that Kevin
mentioned and I'm doing it anyway for a
simple reason because I'm not listening
to the value changed event but to the
change event which is a Dom native event
I'm doing that because if I flap that
out every key press would have emitted
an event and our dome would look like
this every key press would fire off a
JSONP event and we don't want that by
rebinding this value to the change event
I'm effectively waiting for the user to
click somewhere else outside the element
then the input field will emit I have
changed my value only once and then
we'll fire off the JSONP request so
we'll only have one request on the
bottom line the next element that we
have is our radio group it's straight up
a radio group with radio buttons I
actually just want to eat you
excuse to use emoji in my slides it's
just one of three sorting is pretty
straight up and lastly and this is
probably the most interesting part of
this front-end part of the app it's adam
repeat we are using the red api to give
us the post two-way binding and passing
that in as a one-way binding to the dome
repeat so we are using this to render
all of the titles of the post and the
current subreddit and we'll link to the
post by using an anchor tag and now
suddenly this should not look as
complicated anymore usually I should
actually kind of see what's going on
it's kind of straightforward so to
summarize we actually just build an app
that reacts immediately to user changes
without having to do any bookkeeping of
our own this is one of the powers of
two-way binding snore extra wine wiring
required so as a last thing and I wanted
to go to the Platinum elements Matt just
talked about a lot of them but he talked
about the usage when I looked at them
especially at the serviceworker elements
I was kind of amazed if you know the
browser level API of service worker you
know that it can get kind of weird and
then i looked at the platinum service or
her elements and it was just black magic
voodoo i did not understand how it would
be possible to wrap this weird api this
used outside your main thread into an
HTML declarative style thing that is in
the main javascript read and once i
looked into the implementation I
actually realized it's a really really
nice pattern to hide complexity but
still give you the ability to go through
the veils and actually do everything you
need to do if you wanted to so this is
the serviceworker register element it
registers a service worker for you
pretty straightforward you can hook up
two events to get notifications about
when the service worker has been
successfully installed or when it's been
updated or when it's failed so you can
react appropriately you can influence
the registering process itself but you
can't really do anything else with a
register element alone you can say
please cash these files or please call
this JavaScript function when a certain
request is being fired so as an example
I
a used import script and fetch these are
two elements that you can use inside the
register element you can put them as
children to the register elements and
basically say import the script for me
and executed inside the serviceworker
and then you can say please call this
handler whenever a request from the web
page is being made matching this pattern
and this handler would have been defined
in one of these grips that you imported
earlier with the import script tag you
can also already see a little bit of
energy there so the question is how does
it work how does this communicate with
the service worker and that you can
actually kind of modify this it's
complicated but that's the point right
Yuri hide the complexity for you so I'm
going to explain to you now how it works
and it's going to be a little bit
unwieldy but in the end it's just about
this pattern of using children elements
so the first thing that this register
element does is it iterates over its own
children so it looks on all children and
checks if the element has an underscore
get parameters function and if that's
the case it's going to call that
function and expect this function to
return a promise and it collects all
those promises all these promises in an
array and the next step is going to wait
for all these promises to resolve
expects its each promise to resolve to
an object and then merge these objects
together into a huge object this object
in the end will kind of be a description
of what you want the service worker to
do in adjacent object notation so to
speak this object in the next step will
then be URL encoded in a stable matter
and then used as a query part on the
navigator serviceworker register call
when calling a serviceworker script that
we provide from the SW toolbox that
Google published a while ago in case I
lost you that's fine but that's kind of
the point this is really complex the way
we try to shove data from the main site
to the serviceworker side we have to
jump through a lot of Hoops to make that
working but you don't have to worry
about it because it's all encapsulated
in both the register elements and to end
in the children element you can arrange
inside and
this multiple times so you're actually
really just declaring what the service
worker is supposed to do and if you ever
find yourself that you have to write
something really complex and you wanna
write an element try to break individual
subparts into sub element that you can
use inside which is a really nice parent
to actually make it reasonable to you
and can be able to give your team may be
a way to talk about this without going
nuts also to be honest thus code on the
slides right now is already simplified
by me the code is even more complicated
in the repo because we have a few corner
cases we have to catch so in any case if
you're interested I encourage you to
actually look at the code because it's
really really good and I have a few more
links for you that if I think a really
good introduction on how to write
elements that you just look at the code
and see what they're doing they are
usually very readable and they have been
field tested so you know that they will
work and just to make something clear
this is really just the tip of the
iceberg polymer 1.0 or poly all your
point one point one is still kind of new
like we are we know about elements we
don't know that much about apps things
are still changing and evolving there
will be new parents coming up they're
probably going to be better than
something that we're doing right now so
jump in and let us know how you're
solving problems we're really interested
to see if your questions hit me up on
Twitter or I'll be around I will be
around especially in the code lab area
so I swing by there and thank you for
your attention
