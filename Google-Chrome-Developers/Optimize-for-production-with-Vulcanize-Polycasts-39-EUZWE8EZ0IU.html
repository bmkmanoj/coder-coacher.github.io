the show I want to talk about
performance as web developers one of the
things that we often do when we're about
to deploy a site into production is we
take all of our scripts all of our
styles we can catenate them together to
cut down on costly HTTP requests now if
you're working with something like
polymer and web components it's
important to remember to also
concatenate your definitions for web
components as well because those count
has HTTP requests to so today what I
want to show you is a tool that we've
created called vulcanize which you can
use to cut down on those HTTP requests
and make sure your polymer apps are as
performant as possible now before you
get into any of that I first want to
show you kind of the impact that Vulcan
is going to have on your app so what
I've got here is over in the terminal
I'm just going to run polymer starter
kit i'm going to use its development
server that comes with it so when our
own gulp serve just to boot this up and
i haven't done anything to this project
yet it's just a fresh check out of
polymer starter kit so see we we see
that sort of starting page and when we
open the dev tool so if we go to the
network panel and we refresh to load up
our app we can go down in the corner
there and see that this application is
currently making 65 HTTP requests for
that one simple page which is quite a
lot now if you look kind of up at the
top of this you'll notice that it lists
these files here like iron fit behavior
dot HTML and polymer micro HTML those
are all of our web component definitions
being fetched individually so let's see
if we can cut down on this using a tool
like vulcanized so this is the same
example again this time I'm going to run
gulp serve dist this is our distribution
server it's going to run vulcanized for
us it's going to take all those imports
and concatenate them together and now
when I go to the network panel and check
things out you'll notice that we've gone
from a 65 request down to just 14
requests for this applications that is a
huge huge difference you can imagine if
you're building a massive app with
hundreds of elements inside of it you
would definitely want that sort of a you
know performance boost that vulcanize
would give you so how do we do this well
there's two ways to run vulcanized you
can either run it from the command line
or you can integrate it in your
build.prop
using a tool like gulp so I'll start off
by showing you the command line version
and then we'll switch over to using gulp
to start off with the command line you
just want to run NPM install dash G to
do a global install of vulcanized so
we'll pull down vulcanized and this is
going to make the vulcanized binary
available to us from the command line so
we can just type vulcanize whenever we
want it'll process a file for us ok so
we've got vulcanize installed now what
I've done is I've set up a very simple
project here you can see I've got an
index file with a single HTML import in
there that's pulling in elements dot
HTML inside that file I've got a few
more HTML imports where I'm loading in
these two elements X foo and X bar and
looking at their definitions these are
just really vanilla kind of boilerplate
polymer elements but they're going to
help us demonstrate how we're going to
bundle all of this stuff together so
what I want to do is take that elements
HTML file and just sort of crunch it
down as small as I possibly can over in
my terminal I'm going to run the
vulcanized command and I'm going to
point it at app / element / elements
HTML and when I run this just from the
command line it's actually going to walk
that tree of imports take all those
files concatenate them together and just
return the output to standard out so
that's kind of useful if we were going
to like pipe this to some other command
but what I'd really like to do is write
this out to a file in my my disk
directory so to do that i'll run
vulcanize again first I'll make a
directory actually to hold my
distribution then I'll run vulcanize and
I'm going to vulcanize that elements
HTML file and then I'll just use the
little arrow symbol to write the output
to a file in my disk directory which
I'll just call elements dot HTML as well
now if you don't want to use the arrow
key or whatever if you want to use the
options like command line flags and
things like that you could also just use
the dash 0 option basically does the
exact same thing and so will write out
to this file elements vulcanized HTML
now there's a lot more options that we
can pass beyond just output we could
also tell vulcanize that we want it to
inline any external scripts that are
elements depend on or pull in any of
their external style sheets or strip out
all of their comments all of these are
available as command-line flag so you
can really customize the bundle that
you're building with vulcanized
and honestly I would recommend using all
three of these flags just because it's
going to you know crunch that file down
as small as it possibly can be so now
that I've run that I can go back to my
editor and I can look in the disk
director E and we check out that
elements HTML file you'll see that now
it's a bunch of stuff chucked inside
here we've got polymer all up at the top
all the JavaScript for it and any HTML
it depends upon if we keep scrolling we
go all the way down to the bottom will
actually see X foo and X bar those
elements from our little sample project
they're crunched into this as well all
their HTML all their javascript is here
so this application which may be was
making before four or five HTTP requests
to boot up should now only be making one
HTTP request for this single file this
is a really great start but it's kind of
a bummer to have to run this command
from the command line every single time
you want to you know build and mess
around with your application it'd be
nicer to integrate it as the part of a
build step using a tool like gulp so to
do that I'm gonna go back to my command
line I'm just going to run NPM install
I'm going to save it to my dev
dependencies and I'm going to pull down
gulp and gulp vulcanized and since this
is NPM now we wait
now we've got those dependencies
installed we can go set up a gulp file
so I'm going to go ahead and require
gulp I'm going to require both vulcanize
and i'm just going to write out a really
simple gulp task for our vulcanized
process will tell it to pull on elements
HTML well pipe that to vulcanize and
then we'll pipe that to our district
turi i'm also going to write a default
task which is going to run vulcanize for
us and this is starting to shape up to
be a pretty nice boilerplate for like a
little polymer project that we could
launch into production if i go to my
terminal I run gulp it's going to go out
it's going to do that bill process for
me right just pretty cool there's a
little bit more that I can do here I
showed you those command-line flags
before 44 in lining scripts and
stripping comments we can add that to
our vulcanized task as well we just
passed it an options object with those
same options but this time they're
candle cased I'm also going to add a
copy task here so I can copy over my
index file and my web components
polyfills to my disk directory and now
when I run gulp I basically set up
everything I need for a production
polymer site I can run a little server
from that disk directory you can see
here in my elements showing up I've also
got my web components polyfills loaded
so if you want you can even use that
gulp file as a starting point the next
time you want to mess around with
polymer the main thing to take away from
this though is if you're launching
polymer in production you should always
always always make sure that you run
vulcanized before you do so it's going
to dramatically improve the performance
of your application by cutting down HTTP
requests and ultimately it's just
something that everyone should be doing
in their polymer app now I want to cover
tools like vulcanized and a few of its
friends and some future episodes if you
have any questions on this episode you

you so much for watching and I'll see
