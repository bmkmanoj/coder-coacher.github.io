media and I think maybe two episodes ago
I explained about - and MSE and HLS
right so I've been making another
prototype in fact I'm to be honest with
you I'm quite a way on with the build
but I was away at blinkin in the States
last week and so the diaries are lagging
behind reality a little bit but we'll
come on to that in a while what I want
to do is I want to talk as I say about
media I talked about - in MSC and HLS
and I've been making a prototype using
the shocker player so let's talk about
that first of all why would I use
shocker player mmm
because if you've got MSE and you're
swapping between different quality
versions of your video you have to do
things like tracking the bandwidth you
have to figure out where you can switch
and get the next segment of your video
and all these kinds of things and it's
actually a tremendous amount of work
that I don't think is worth doing when
you can get the Shaka player for 43
kilobytes gzipped now it feels to me
like that's really small for what it's
actually doing on your behalf you should
actually have a look through all the all
the like Doc's everything so I will link
to it in the show notes about the Shaka
player and where you can get it and have
a look at the demo and all these kinds
of things
just loads it's really quite small for
what it is and I felt like you know what
actually it's got loads of unit tests
and it's just it's properly done so
that's what I've been using right so
with that in place how do we actually
would we use the Shaka player that's
what has been on my mind and that's what
I've been working on so let's have a
look at what's on my screen so if I've
got a bunch of ffmpeg commands what I'm
I should explain what I'm going to try
and do I'm going to start with a video
I've been starting with one video that's
running at HD and then what I wanted to
do is make different quality versions of
this so I'm using ffmpeg in film
screening but these ffmpeg commands
which is just I mean they're sort of
reverse engineers from looking around at
documentation and kind of other ways of
doing things I just chose like 720 or
514 or 360 but let me just show
you this there is a page on the YouTube
help that covers live encoder settings
but nonetheless encoder settings bit
rates and resolutions so for example
they're saying if you're going to do a
1080p video you'd probably want it on
1920 by 1080 big surprise but bitrate
would be you know 3000 to 6000 close per
second so when I doing this for real and
not just kind of in placeholder mode
sort of like let's just do a few
versions just see how this works I would
probably be following something like
this to kind of go right that's what a
1080p looks like that's what a 720p
should have 480 and so on all the way
down to the ones that I care about the
most
so I do I'm just running ffmpeg just
making a bunch of these like three
different variants of my video
the next thing I'm using is a thing
called the shack a packager and what the
Shocker package' does and that is quite
a mouthful to say shack up acadia it
feels that it just has a nice little
bucket i really like it because there
one more time for you shakka package'
yeah yeah and what it does is it takes
the videos that you've got all the
different variations like your 720p the
540 360 and you give it a profile so
whether it's live streaming or video
on-demand I'm doing on-demand not even
thought about live streaming you tell it
where you want it to output the -
manifest because that's what it's going
to do for you can take in all the video
and so on and it's going to split things
out into like video tracks audio tracks
different qualities all of that and you
tell it how much for example you want it
to buffer which in my case I'm saying 3
seconds would be good just get me 3
seconds up front further down the line
they'll probably be some dancing that I
need to do there around 3 buffering
video content so that for example we can
give you a flying start with video but I
don't really got my head around that
space yet like how do we get first 5
seconds of the video primed by a
serviceworker so that we can just play
instantly however you thought about that
and in the - manifest you can just say
hey you know what when you first load
this video just trying at the first 3
seconds off to network that's one thing
and then segment duration that you can
see here
is as I understand it is how often you
can switch qualities so I'm saying every
three seconds if you need to you can
switch qualities this to the Shocker
player through the - manifest you can
switch over to things what's important
about that is when you reverse back up
and look at the video calls you see here
that there's this key and min ki int
know sinker what what we need to do when
we take our original video and we we
turn it into the different quality
versions we actually have to put these
things called iframes
not-not-not iframes like we would
they're different iframes there i
friends but they're not iframes you not
i mean they're just their video iframes
that basic becky friends that's what
they are they're keyframes so we need a
keyframe so my my kids i'm doing it
every 24 frames which means because it's
a 24 frames a second video I'm getting a
keyframe every second right so every
time we hit one of these keyframes is a
safe point at which we could switch to
another quality so the the segment
duration should if I understand this
correctly be a multiple of the keyframe
so if I've got a keyframe every second I
could switch every two seconds four
seconds five seconds long as it's a
multiple of what my keyframe value is
that make sense I hope so but I have a
segment duration of three seconds that's
what I'm saying right what I also do as
you'll see here is I actually do three
more packages along for the 720 one for
the 541 for the 360 because I was just
interested in whether I might need a
separate manifest for the offline stuff
which I'm going to come onto shortly
right oh so taking a video turned it
into three different quality versions as
I say in production you do you go
through that YouTube help and just kind
of be like okay I need like five or ten
different versions and so on and you
probably just set up a pipeline for
processing videos and then we're going
to package them up into into a dash
manifest or have a dash manifest which
points to all these things let me show
you what one of those looks like sample
manifest full that's that's the one so
this is more the Shocker packager
outputs for us and you can see that the
that means italo's in here and it's it's
a bunch of XML but here's the the
minimum Buffett anguish is up three
seconds that I set how long the video is
so the media presentation duration is 71
seconds in this case and then inside
here you'll see that this these things
these adaptation sets means
representations but you'll see what's
crucially important here is that you've
got a representation for the 640 by 360
960 by 540 and 1280 by 720 so you can
start to see that it's listing out all
the different qualities of videos that
you can that you can actually use for
playback which tallies is entirely with
what I passed as a packager in the first
instance and it has really interesting
things like the amount of bandwidth that
that particular video course is going to
need the codecs it's using a bunch of
other stuff as well and to be honest
there's a bunch of stuff in here I don't
fully understand like the initialization
range not quite sure what that is it's
quite exciting I'm sure you'll agree
maybe no I don't know and then further
down we also have audio configurations
as well so again we've got 360 540 and
720 audio I have a feeling that in
reality you probably only just want like
one audio track something that's like an
mp3 or an AAC or you know you probably
the video quality I reckon is going to
change a lot more and be the one that's
the more bandwidth sensitive than the
audio is my guess so you might just be
like well just going to take one audio
track and I'll have different loads of
different qualities of video but I don't
know I'm still figuring a lot of this
stuff out for myself
right so let's take a look at some of
the code to actually take that -
manifest and put it into into use with
the Shaka player so this is the code
which is not particularly neat I'll give
you the heads up it is very very much
prototype code but hopefully we can just
kind of pick out the bits that make
sense for this particular context here
we go so we have this init player
function that I've got here and all we
do is we wrap video element in the Shaka
dot play kind of makes a wraparound and
starts kind of giving us a dish
all things that we can do but we can
also talk to the video element directly
if we need to insert the dot play and
you know seek and all those kind of like
current time and other things that you
normally do with the video so it's kind
of nice actually it's a really nice way
of working that you just kind of still
predominantly s'en to events from the
video player but when you're actually
setting it up and doing playback it the
Shocker player stuff kicks in and
switches all the different calls he's we
it's pretty cool I actually really like
it so the thing we do is we give it the
manifest so the manifest that we created
with the Shocker package we can hand to
the player the monitor the Shocker
player and that's a lot of the API is
promise based so we call it with the the
URL for the manifest and then when it's
loaded and it loads the manifest and the
first little bit of video across all the
qualities listed so it kind of gets you
know the first few seconds of you know
the 720 and the 540 and 360 or whatever
versions you've got does that and then
it fires the the callback for the point
fives the dots then of the promise that
says okay you're good to go
so when you get that now you can see I
actually have a bit more code going on
here which we'll talk about in a minute
because I've been trying to get it to
work offline as well been successful in
that at least partially successful so
we'll talk about that as well
but you can then start calling play and
that will work so let me just show you
what that looks like so we don't talk
Paul so as you can see on my screen
there is a video and actually if I go to
the network tab you can see it's
requesting if there's a moment in time
it's requesting the 360 video of 5:47
20s decided that my bandwidth because
it's coming from localhost my bandwidth
can support this 720 and off it goes and
it makes let me show you this as well
this is quite interesting it makes what
we call range requests so the request
itself only has a request and therefore
only house request now the request has a
range in there which is rather than
saying give me all the video at once
it's saying I want this byte range to
that
bite range and the Shocker player
figures out that range request itself
based on the I guess the bandwidth and
how big this segments are and it goes
well I guess I need that number of bytes
next to make that next chunk of the
video so it makes this range request
there are other ways to do it you can as
I understand instead of having one big
mp4 file or whatever video file you've
got WebM or whatever you can also do it
in chunks and actually have individual
files and that's also our way to do it
I've gone for one big file because I
think I'm going to have to pass one big
video file across for Chrome casting
later on so it just made sense for me as
a site I'm just kind of one big video
and make little chunked range requests
off that and that doesn't say that's
working so we make one of these range
requests and the server the response
from the server is it's over here and it
looks pretty tiny but it's basically
just those you can see the size of it I
mean the original file is much bigger
than that but you can see that you just
get say four hundred and seventy seven K
of the video however much of the video
you it thinks it needs so it all works
and you can see as well that the the bar
here in the controls only fills up with
the amounts buffered so all good that's
working just fine now let me show you
what actually happens if we try it again
but this time I'm going to throttle the
network connection back down to like
regular 3G so probably as a guess it
will start asking for the 720 yet you
see it started asking for the 720 video
but soon enough I reckon it's going to
drop down and ask for the 360 when it
figures out that actually the bandwidth
isn't so good and again this is what
shakka player is going to do for you so
I don't have to do that which is
brilliant because it's code I wouldn't
want to right now you see now you can
see the requests are for the 360 video
and the 360 audio that's what it's
decided
I actually want cool so now is kind of
like the - side completely sorted let's
have a quick chat about the HLS as well
in my script further down I take those
725 40 and 360 videos and I call this
media
file segment which is something you can
get downloaded from the Apple developer
portal and what that does is it will
slice and dice the different videos into
particular formats for this m3u8 you can
see this is it's like a playlist file if
we actually go and have a look and I
think let's have a look 720 n38 I don't
really know what I'm looking at other
than I can see that there's like this is
like three seconds and it tells you
which sequence of files you see it makes
all these files in the process of
running media file segment err so that
does that bit and then after that I move
some stuff around but then you call
variant playlist creator which is
another one of these tools that comes
with you know the Apple downloads that
you get and you pass it to these three
fly lists in my case but all the
playlists that you've made and it makes
one master playlist which looks like
this
and that is essentially I guess roughly
equivalent to the dash manifest I
measure that on the technical side 1b
but for Android and desktop Chrome and
desktop Safari and whatever you can just
use MSC and that will just work so
you've got the dash manifest for those
but for iOS Safari today you do need to
create one of these m3u8 so it's kind of
it's you know the C equivalent I guess
of the m3u8 good on the code side if for
whatever reason we get an error from
loading the manifest which should happen
I believe on iOS because it will go our
I've tried to load the dash manifest and
I tried to do all that stuff on it it's
just not working I have a fallback that
just says okay switch across to HLS
which is where you get that m3u8 file
and you just say video dot source equals
m3u8 so it's actually very very
straightforward to use very convenient
to use and iOS Safari will just kind of
go oh sure and it'll start adapting and
getting the right things for you so you
don't actually have to do an awful lot
with HLS other than point your video
element at the m3u8 playlist file I
think the upside of
is that the shakka player can what money
and you know manage the bandwidth and
you get to have a little bit more or a
say on what bandwidth you would think it
should have which track you think it
should lock into and all those kinds of
things if you if you want to with HLS
it's much more like the user agent just
kind of goes I've got this and if it
decides to download the entire video
there isn't much as the developer that
you can say other than sure so it is
worth knowing that that's what's going
to happen I mean there's nothing you can
do about it particularly the only way
I've found actually to at least tweak it
a little bit is to say on the video
element that you do preload equals
metadata if you don't set the preload
attribute it will go off and download
all of the content which may or may not
be what you want there you go
right I'm aware that I've taken quite a
little bit of your time but I still want
to show you the offline stuff so I hope
you sticking around hope you enjoying
this let's have a quick look at what it
does what we require for the offline
stuff to work so at the moment
everything's just going off to the
network and the idea was all wife
what if we could pre fetch everything
into the cache into a cache so that when
the request goes out for that part of
the mp4 file so in the - version that
the serviceworker can be like oh yeah I
got this this is already in the cache
I'll just create that I'll handle that
range request I'll get it I'll get the
item out of the cache get that bit of
the file and then just send it back so
it's kind of transparent as far as Shack
is concerned we just kind of go you know
just get that video and it will go off
and it enough chatter let's look a
little bit of little hang on let me get
my words right let's look at some code
there we are
you want to thought it was so difficult
to say but apparently for me yes here we
are serviceworker this is my
serviceworker
as it is today and this is really the
interesting bit so imagine that this
fetch is called on every time a request
is made from the page okay cool
what we do is we do a match against the
caches and
there's a match we'll handle it if not
we'll just do like a pass-through
so what we need to do is figure out well
at what situation would we call the cash
is not much and get something back and
the answer is when there is something in
the cashes so if we went off and got the
video and audio and everything else that
we've made and put those into the cash
then we get a cache hit one thing I
discovered and I was very grateful to -
Jake Jake Archibald
if you don't know should follow them
Twitter and Alma and he was helping me
figure out how I should actually handle
the range response remember I said that
when we make the request it's a ranged
request we only ask for a certain byte
range when we get a cash match we get a
cash match for the whole thing so if we
just say well return whatever the cash
has you'll rather than returning just
those bytes you'd actually return the
entire video which is not what was
actually asked for you we were only
asked for bytes from say zero to a
thousand for example so we actually have
to do that ourselves so what I do is I'm
taking Jake's code here and what we do
is we can create a ranged response so
that takes in the request and we find it
from the cache but what we do is we call
dot array buffer on it and that gets us
the entire video we'll come back to that
in a moment and then what we have is
some code that looks through the range
header and goes okay which bytes did
they actually want and then that gets
sliced out from that array buffer we set
the status to 206 which i think is
something like partial content or
partial response or something along
those lines that says you're not getting
the whole thing you're just getting for
that little bit that you asked for with
the range requests and we said a couple
of other headers like the content links
and the content range and then we
returned that instead for me this is a
bit unpleasant not only because there's
a bunch of code in here that could arrow
I guess could go wrong but mostly
because calling dot array buffer at the
moment on the response would get me the
whole video so if it's like a one gig
video calling that array buffer will get
me a one gig array buffer in memory for
every request and the solution here I
think is going to be to slice and dice
the video
instead of one big file in the cache
actually have lots of different files
like smaller chunks inside the cache and
then just pull out the chunks that we
need to make the ranged response we'll
see how that goes when we actually want
to get to production and how big the
videos are and whether it's actually a
thing but I fully expect to actually
have to do that I should also mention by
the way that there is a offline
implementation already in shaka which
uses index DB to do its thing so that
all takes care of it but it does it
doesn't use a serviceworker today it's
all in the foreground it populates index
DB but it also does other bits and
pieces like if you've got eme and
licenses which again I don't understand
fully it will store those for you as
well
right let me do show you though what it
actually looks like when you do this so
when I hit cache video hopefully oh so
to the regular 3d let's do no swaddling
always only life was actually like that
we used to go no throttling you see now
we've got the cached video so if I just
clear that and start running it now all
the requests are coming from the
serviceworker essentially it's doing its
job the serviceworker is stepping in and
rather than going out to the network
it's actually creating the response from
the cache so that's where a way to
transparently provide the video to the
Shaco player so all this code in fact
the whole site code at the moment let me
show you this is up on github you can
get it at github comm slash google
chrome slash sample media PWA will link
to that in the notes below if you want
to have a play around with the prototype
I'll add a prototypes folder to this so
you can at least see roughly speaking
what I've been doing and go from there
in the meanwhile have fun I'll be back
very very soon with a an explanation of
what I've been doing on the server side
catch you later
hey folks thanks for watching don't
forget that there is more content that
you can find kind of over here ish and
if you want to subscribe is probably a
button oh maybe there maybe somewhere
around there click that if you've not
done that brilliant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
