entrances I'm Zack I'm a product manager
on the chrome team and I spend most of
my days thinking about how we can make
payments on the web particularly on the
mobile web easier less painful and
all-around better experiences for our
users so I'm really excited by the
credential management API especially for
someone who like talks to ecommerce
people all day long and people who sell
high engagement and easy sign-in is is
really critical and it's really great
but if you think registration forms are
difficult we should talk about checkout
forms a lot more form fields a lot more
questions but I think that you're gonna
see a consistent theme emerging through
like our talks here today which is this
one of let the browser help you there
are certain advantages that we have as a
browser especially when it comes to
reducing friction and making life easier
for users especially things around
repetitive data steps things that the
users can store inside of the browser's
but we're trying to do our expose api's
and give you tools to reduce friction
and make things easier for your users we
saw it in Koreans while management and
we'll see a very similar theme with what
we're doing in payments but first a
little user activity just before we go
off for lunch which are some questions
okay great so first question just
curious how many people here actually
enjoy the process of buying something on
the web using their mobile device okay
good
yeah and some people but by large no and
whether we should come talk I'd love to
hear like what is that you'd like about
buying things on the mobile web and what
it is that you don't as much a second
question and I would be really impressed
here how many people can remember all
the details of their credit card I'm
talking full 60 digit number really CVC
on expiration okay it's more than I
expected I got to be honest like okay
we're still like under 15% but okay cuz
I've even payments out for like 18
months and I think I have yet to
remember a credit card number that's
great and then okay final question how
many people enjoy the process of handing
over all their sensitive credit card
information to a random third party
server
I'll get one it's almost like I'm asking
these questions to lead up to a
particular point and and there was a
points and the reality is that most
users finds payment difficult they find
it insecure and scary and frightening
and they find the process of doing it on
the mobile web particularly bad and so
we had this number we talked about it at
i/o as well and it hasn't really changed
which is that on average we tend to see
about 66 percent fewer conversions on
mobile than on desktop and again we
think there's an answer to that which is
all around again high friction the
difficulty and issues around
trustworthiness and security and so
we'll talk about sort of how we're
addressing those today and how we're
trying to bring fast simple and secure
payments to the web platform but this is
a little I'm a p.m. it's a little bit
too PME for me actually and so I have a
much better mission for us inside of the
chrome team which is we're trying to
save the world from annoying check out
forms so I'm trying to save the world
from virtual keyboards and having to
memorize and all of those terrible
things I actually started this joke of
the better payments Bureau a couple of
months ago and now it's become like a
thing so anyway but actually Chrome has
been fighting the good fight against
annoying check out forms for many years
actually
we start with autofill back in the day
you guys are probably familiar with
autofill this is my one slide on it it's
not really the topic today but consider
this my 10 second plea to say if nothing
else leave today and set autocomplete
types on your check out forms it helps
us it helps the users helps the browsers
and it basically ensures a hundred
percent accuracy on autofill I'm not
here to talk about that today I'm really
here to talk today about payment
requests which is this new API that
we're building for the web to really
help solve a lot of the problems I've
been talking about but before I talk
about what payment requests is I want to
talk about what payment request isn't
and that's because payment is
complicated there are a lot of players
in this space
and I just want to sort of set up fronts
and sort of help alleviate any confusion
so the first thing payment request is
not a new payment method so we're not
trying to create Chrome pay or browser
pay or yet another X pay button on your
website
that's not fundamentally our goal our
goal is to help users pay that they went
the way that they want to pay and do it
quickly and efficiently secondly we are
not trying to become a gateway or a
process or or some entity that literally
moves money in the ecosystem so it's not
we're not trying to step on any toes
here or like enter into this ecosystem
we think that the market has actually
done an incredible job here already
players like stripe and Braintree and
others have done a really stellar job
over the last couple of years of taking
the incredible complexity of accepting
online payments and making it really
simple they've removed the burden of
things like acquiring banks and all the
couples of PCI and they put it all into
a easy-to-use API and so our goal is to
ensure that whatever we do plays really
nicely with all these gateways and
processors but that's not fundamental
goal to become one the thing about all
these great new services though is that
they've really focused on developers
which is great they've made your lives
easier and it made easier for you to
accept payments but the user experience
has largely remained the same you have
to go from the state where you know
nothing to a user to everything and
formfields tend to be the way that we do
this so payment request was
fundamentally built for users I mean we
think it's pretty good for developers
too and it's pretty easy and we'll sort
of talk about code samples but
fundamentally like my goal I think about
users and how I can help them and help
them get through these burdensome flows
on mobile faster and more efficiently so
what exactly is payment request well pay
requests like I said is a new
standards-based API and standards-based
I want to emphasize that we joined the
web payments working group almost a
couple years ago now and every major
browser is a vendor we have financial
institutions from around the globe and
we're trying really hard to build
something that everyone can integrate
that all forms of payment integrate with
and all browsers can do so that users on
a variety of devices and ecosystems can
continue to leverage and have the
benefit of it we're just in the early
stages of it and sort of will talk about
where we're at but that's sort of
fundamentally our goal and so when we
started to think about what design this
API looked like we had two high-level
goals in mind and they sort of reference
back to my original question set the
first one is we
to build a seamless easy-to-use checkout
experience on mobile in particular we
wanted to make sure that users like
could minimize typing and minimize
friction as much as possible and the
second thing is we really want to bring
more secure payments into the web
platform in many ways like the web is
one of the the last places where it's
very commonplace to exchange over all of
your sensitive information to some
unknown third party and even though
there's an answer to this from the
payments community with regards to
tokenization the web really didn't have
a great answer for that which is why
we're really excited that we've brought
Android pay into the web platform and
again we'll continue to expand that but
this brings tokenized forms of payment
so in the events of data breach or other
problems you as a users are protected
but also it also reduces the burden for
for you as developers and merchants and
so those are our two high-level goals
that we had and again the idea here just
at a high level is that if you think of
your traditional checkout flow it looks
something like this it's you know
anywhere from like two to five pages
maybe one for single page things and you
have somewhere between like 10 and 40
form fields where you're asking a
variety of questions things like what's
your name what's your shipping address
what's remail what's your phone number
what's yer credit card number what's
your expiration and then you have users
who are like you know trying to like do
all this on their mobile device and at
some point they're like man and I kind
of give up and maybe they go to desktop
later or most likely they don't and you
know and Aaron talked a lot about the
growth of mobile right and so we really
think we need to fix this and make this
easier and the way this happens with
payment requests is you can imagine that
the browser sort of plays this role and
and helps facilitate checkout across
this the the highest friction point so
we take that common set of data those
common things that you request and sort
of leverage our strengths to make it
easier for users to to be successful so
before I could show you a demo I want to
talk about what types of data is
actually supported by payment requests
so the first one is probably a little
bit obvious but it's a form of payments
so at the end of the day you need a way
to actually request money from the
ecosystem so it needs some sort of form
of payments right now in Chrome we
support - we support credit cards and
Android pay I put etc on here because
the
is to support more but we'll talk about
that a bit more later and so you always
have to request a form of payment
you can't call payment requests and not
want to form a payment that would just
be weird and then would just be request
arbitrary user data API so the other big
thing that we allow you to request is
shipping address and shipping options so
for physical good purchases you can
leverage the API to say hey give me
their shipping address and then there's
a dynamic mechanism for you to take that
address and then populate shipping
options that have updated pricing etc
you can also request a phone number you
can request a an email address of course
for like sending a receipt or even
prompting sign up afterwards and coming
soon actually but not quite there but in
a couple of months is payer name support
and these are all flexible you can
request any of these or none of these if
you want the idea is to support a broad
range of of use cases out there so if
you're like a ride pickup service you
probably don't need you if I don't need
everything but you definitely need let's
say a location like an address and a
name let's say or if you're a physical
good you may may or may not need their
payor name because you'll get that from
the shipping address so it's flexible
and you can sort of accommodate
experiences as as fits your the business
but the really important point here is
that all of these data points can be
stored and returned by the by the
browser so users by and large trust
chrome to store this data they trust us
to store their names their emails and
even their credit card data and so the
question is like why put users through
the burden of a form that they have to
fill out manually and like you saw like
sabine slide about like fat fingering
and the difficulty of mobile keyboard
typing and those problems were
multiplied across all those form fields
so if you can save them the burden of
doing that we think it's worthwhile and
sort of payment request is really
designed to do that but let's go ahead
and just let's just going to sort of see
it in action switch over to a demo here
see if we can see all right excellent
I'm gonna you open up Chrome on stable
and I'm actually gonna use the exact
same shop API that's oh and you see it
it auto sign man
you have to love and a good demo goes
right and but otherwise it's the exact
same website polymer shop demo except
I'm gonna go a little bit further and
actually just make a purchase so I hit
the shop now button you know I
definitely don't have enough Google
hoodies so I'll just source wet shirt so
I'll just buy it yet another one so it
standard shop you see that there's like
size and quantity I won't affect those
but you see that there's there's two
buttons at the bottom there's a typical
Add to Cart button but there's this also
this Buy Now button that Buy Now button
is based on feature detection so we're
checking to see if payment request
exists and if it's there great let's
leverage it and if not it would you
would just see an edit card but I'm
going to end use the rapid checkout
approach and so I tap on the Buy Now
button and you see that this this
payment sheet slides up from the bottom
this is a payment request in action so
you're looking at sort of natively drawn
UI it's controlled by us we can through
it but it's populated with data from the
merchant so you see that my total amount
is there $22.15 i defaults to my form of
payment that i prefer which is android
pay if it's available only cuz it's
faster and more secure you see it
they're also requesting my email address
for the purpose of sending a receipt and
the only thing I need to do here is
select the shipping address
it's very difficult to ship a sweatshirt
to someone if you don't know where it
goes so I'll tap on that you'll see that
the payment chief slides up to full
screen and it has my addresses
automatically populated for use these
are our two Google offices here so I'll
go ahead and shift to the one in San
Francisco where I work you see that when
I do that the shipping options are
automatically populated there and so we
have a free shipping in California
option or in Express shipping and if I
change those it will dynamically change
the price so you can see here that
express shipping changes but of course
why would I pay more I'm gonna go back
to zero that seems to make a whole lot
more sense to me and now I'm ready to
pay so we just have the pay button and
then you'll see the Android pay screen
slide directly up we're running the test
app so it says unrecognized ooh you guys
wouldn't have that and because I've
actually authenticated in the last
couple of minutes I don't even have to
do any extra authentication on Android
pay I'll literally just tap the continue
button a responses comes back and the
transaction
successful so pay with Android pay no
keyboard no typing all I had to do was
tap and select and confirm my shipping
addresses so really great really
seamless we're really excited about it
and just to show you that if you don't
have Android pay available no big deal
we can always change our form of payment
and if I didn't have Android pay I would
just default back to my credit card in
this case a Visa card that I have once
again I'll select my shipping address
and options I hit the pay and the only
thing the only keyboard we can't get rid
of is the CVC input everything else we
have so I'm gonna do one two three I
used to do like a live credit card on
this and I discovered that what that
didn't work well for me so I've switched
to a demo card but either way the same
the same concept applies we'll talk
about what's happening behind the scenes
but this is all client-side basically so
it's all happening super fast and pretty
great they're really excited about that
and now maybe we can switch back to the
slides and talk more about what it takes
to make this actually happen so how do
you leverage payment requests well it's
pretty simple there are three parts to
payment requests two of which are that
are required and one of which is
completely optional and so we'll talk
about them in order the very first one
are payment methods so we need to know
basically all the ways that you can get
paid this could be a wide variety of
things in the future
so it could be I accept Visa and
MasterCard and AMEX and Discover JCB
UnionPay it could be in the future I
accept Ally pay or idea or PayPal etc as
long as people are built into the
ecosystem like I said for now Chrome we
just launched so we're starting with
credit card support Android pay and so
it looks a little bit like this
so we basically pass in this thing
called method data and metadata is an
array of objects and those objects each
have a an array of supported payment
methods so you can see here that Mont
the first thing I support our credit
cards i support the standard for Visa
Mastercard Amex and discover that's it
nothing else to do it just as I accept
this in the future coming out in a
couple of months we have added support
for granularity
for things like debit or credit or our
prepaid but for right now essentially
when you say visa we sort of assume you
can accept all visa and don't make a
strong differentiation there but the
second one is a little bit more
interesting and this is Android pay
there's sort of an abbreviated version
of this but to support Android pay you
see that there's an additional key
inside of that object which is the data
data is sort of a generic object and
it's a payment method specific the
reality is that different payment
methods out there have different
dependencies different things that
you're going to pass in when you
instantiate it by default so for Android
pay for example you always have to pass
in like your merchant ID you have to
pass in what kind of token you would
like either network or gateway we don't
have a full example here but and then
what happens then is when a user chooses
to pay with one of those forms of
payment we basically bundled it all up
and pass it on to the payment app so and
then the payment app uses that data plus
things like origin and assertions from
chrome to basically verify that the
payment app is the right one
and so the payment can can continue so
it's pretty simple but the idea here is
that you throw everything you can at the
browser for ways that you accept payment
so if you can accept a like a hundred
different ways of paying around the
globe tell us a hundred ifferent ways to
pay because what the browser does is we
find that spot in the middle between the
set of ways you can get paid and a way
that a user can pay you and give a user
an optimized experience about the ones
that make the most sense for them so you
solve for example in the demo that
Android pay and a Visa card were
available but let's say that we had
removed visa as an option then visa just
wouldn't show up because that doesn't
make any sense and so for as you go
across the globe there are wide variety
of ways to pay but we recommend giving
us all to them and then we'll find the
best experience for the user to optimize
around their preferences their defaults
and what what is the best thing for them
the second bit of data is also quite
important so now that we know how I can
pay you we need to know how much money
you wants to get paid and this is what
this looks like
great so the first thing the most
important thing that's required is this
total attribute three parts basic
there are two parts really the first
ones are label so we customize this so
if you tell us total will display total
but you this could be like authorization
donation whatever you want and you have
to we have to know an amount and the
amount is compose of a total amount of
money and an underlying currency code so
we know for example or the underlying
payment app that we transferred to knows
what currency to charge in we're also to
support display items so just like I
showed you like when I tapped on the
total those line items I came down that
basically told you how the total amount
was reached this you can't we also
support this it's a wholly optional you
can pass in you can pass it if you want
or ignore it we recommend it it's nice
to give a high-level overview to a user
about the things that inform the total
amount things like the subtotal tax
shipping cost etc less of like a full
itemized receipt and again in more of
like a high-level overview one important
point payment request does not do math
we're not good at floating point math so
if you pass in you know you have two
line items that sum to five and your
total says four like we're not gonna
throw anything so you're totally in
control of this thing so just keep that
in mind and they're by the way it might
be some use cases where it makes sense
for those not to a line but by-and-large
just want to point that out the other
point to note is that transaction
details can also contain shipping
options and in this case if you put them
in there by default we support default
shipping options we only recommend you
use this if you're highly confident that
your shipping options will not change
then they're not dynamic so if you
support for example world wide free
shipping and it never changes no matter
what the address is
feel free to default populate this but
if your shipping is dependent upon a
user address then we recommend waiting
until you've gotten a user a user
address event which we can talk about a
little bit and then you can use that to
dynamically query against whatever
service you use to calculate prices and
you can repopulate this and that's the
important point that basically the
transaction details object can actually
be updated and overwritten throughout
the lifecycle of payment requests at
certain events and points so if a user
changes their shipping option you saw
like how in my demo when I changed my
ship
the price change and the list items
changed that's because when that event
took place
we repopulated those set of transaction
details and so you have that flexibility
in control on those events and so that's
how we get sort of that dynamic pricing
model that exists out there and so again
don't do default shipping options unless
you're highly confident they aren't
going to change and the final piece is
the extra information
the optional set of options and that's
that things I talked about user address
shipping support name email and phone
all entirely optional but definitely
useful I think there was like sort of
this myth out there that the the only
drop-off point in the funnel is the is
the process of putting in your credit
card but really like the entire checkout
funnel is well a funnel and so like
wherever your users experience friction
and there's a step others are drop-off
so we highly recommend taking advantage
of these these different pieces and so
there's a few that we support like I
said and it's as simple as passing in
just a bunch of boolean's basically do I
want shipping yes
do I want email yes etc and you can
again these can be variable so you can
say I don't want shipping but I do want
a name and phone number or you can say I
just want an email address to send a
receipt to for example it's completely
configurable and again the idea here is
to support a wide variety of use cases
something funny that is minor that we
have coming soon in the next couple of
months is we're adding support as well
for a shipping type value it's pretty
simple but the idea here is that let's
say you are buying a pizza one does not
ship a pizza right that's just weird
like we deliver pizzas and so it's a
very minor feature that allows you to
actually specify shipping delivery or
pickup as like the address type so we
still call shipping address underlined
in the system but this way in the UI a
user would see oh I want my pizza
delivered two three four five speed
streets
I don't want it delivered or if you're a
ride-sharing service for example you can
say pickup and it's your pickup address
where you're currently at or located and
so that's the value of that particular
little thing again pretty minor but
allows us to just have like a better
user experience underlining the whole
system so now we just put it together
basically and we get that whole
experience
that we talked about or I just showed
you so the first thing we do is we
instantiate payment requests and we pass
in our method data way that we things
that we support we pass in the
transaction details again how much money
what currency code what line items do we
once and then our optional options right
so in the case of our demo that I went
through that would be request shipping
true and request email true but again
that one's completely optional
um you see here I've also added an event
listener to my shipping address change
and we support two events in the system
shipping address change and shipping
option change these are this is that
dynamic mechanism that allows you to
receive the events parse out the new
details let's say so if a user selects a
shipping address that event fires you
can actually pull out that full shipping
address we don't do just the zip code
because you can't get fully accurate
shipping information with just a zip
code so you get a full user address you
can use that at that time to call event
update with this basically says hey you
know browser I'm thinking I need to
calculate this you can call your
back-end api's and you can update
resolve a promise with new transaction
details so again that updated
transaction details object can now
contain your updated set of shipping
options including the empty set of
options and an error which says like
opps sorry we don't ship to you know
wherever it is that you're trying to
ship to so that's also supported and so
and by instantiating payment request or
not there's no UI that shows it's just
instantiation when you want that actual
payment sheet to slide up from the
bottom
oh we called that show that show is
actually our signal and we actually
raised that payment sheet and put the
user through the process that returns
like a promise and when that promise
resolves you have a payment response and
that payment response contains the
entire set of data it's just a JSON
object that contains the entire set of
data that you requested so for a credit
card for example you would know what the
underlying network was so Visa
MasterCard etc and then you would see
credit card number phone number
full CBC expiration etc think like the
same set of data that a user would have
typed out into your form you're now
getting just from the browser as a JSON
response
you can use that to basically send that
response directly off to your gateway
your server or even let's say in the
case of like like you know scribe API is
like directly to over to the API is for
tokenization it's completely up to you
because it's all plaintext these
responses it's important to note our our
method specific so if you selected
Android pay as your form of payments
then when that response comes back it's
gonna look like an Android pay response
you're gonna be able to select this
there's a key and they'll tell you that
oh there the form of payment they chose
was Android pay and then you'll have to
expect that the Android pay details
object looks different than a credit
card one which may look different than
some other form of payment like an alley
pay etc I mean in a good that's because
different payment methods have different
requirements and are different systems
and call things different things
the final step here is we just need you
to tell us to close the UI because once
you get this payment response back we
actually show us a little loading
spinner and the little loading spinner
is sort of waiting for you to come back
and let us know the the result of the
transaction we highly encourage but do
not require that at the time that
payment response comes back you try to
make the payment there are legitimate
use cases where you can't do this things
like 3d 3ds flows etc but by and large
if you can submit we recommend it and so
you call the complete you can call with
success or failure but you can also call
it with nothing this is basically an
affordance for the browser to do like
special UI considerations in the event
of success you know like a little
animated check mark or something but
yeah it's totally optional but the
important thing is that when the UI
closes will actually resolve that
promise and that promise is your cue
that the UI has been completely torn
down so if you have animations or things
that you're trying to time with the
close of that wait for that promise to
resolve and then you'll be guaranteed
that any chrome UI has now been stripped
from the page and that's it on with that
you basically have the hold experience
so in just a few lines of code you
basically get help user alleviate all
that friction and difficulty I'll type
in all those annoying form fields pretty
simple but also again with Android pay
and other future forms of tokenized
payment you're basically getting easy
tokenize forms a payment that reduced
like the burden of CBC memorization etc
so really excited about this and this is
all possible because the browser is sort
of sitting as the middlemen there
proxying data back and forth between
native apps on the device and and the
underlying website and the developer
that's requesting it so my last few
minutes here I want to talk about just a
few UX considerations and
forward-looking stuff so first one is my
very bold hyperbolic statement to say
kill the cards which is maybe a bit
strong but just sort of my way of saying
if a user is coming to your site or you
for a lot of users who come to your site
on mobile that only make a single
purchase why put them through the burden
of opening the page adding it's a card
finding the cart page clicking the card
page going to review page go to the
checkout page then finally starting the
process there on mobile
want to optimize their experiences
payment requests allows you to do that
quickly and immediately so consider
adding like Buy Now buttons directly to
your product pages especially on mobile
when it makes sense again this moment
won't make sense for all businesses but
I would encourage you to go back and
sort of check the numbers and see if
like this might be a powerful tool for
you guys to leverage to help your users
just a few other things really quickly
that I've talked about and you've heard
mention here today is thank progressive
enhancement this is a new API it won't
always be available so you can't
necessarily completely depend on it
especially in a cross-browser way yet
although hopefully we'll get there so
think what happens if it's not available
you'll still need a fallback flows etc
the second one of course is we encourage
you to keep the set of list items high
level so don't think of it like an
itemized receipts we don't want the user
to select this long scrolling list in
the UI if possible try to keep it high
level subtotal tax things like that if
it's single item you can put it in there
but by and large we encourage high-level
subtotals and things like that and then
last one something to consider is that
if you already have a user's information
and you already have a credit card on
file or some way to pay I wouldn't
expect you to use don't think you have
to use payment requests like give the
user the best experience they can and
that means go ahead and just leveraging
what you already have on file but if you
don't have anything and you don't have
the credit card or the credit cards
expired you need a new one
a consider payment request as a tool to
help these users you know we talked
about you know we talked about sign up
first right but that might not always
make sense for your business if you
think about it like maybe your your p0
or your most important thing is getting
user through that checkout flow then you
can request an email address from
payment requests and now all you need
from them at the end of that funnel to
sort of optimize the experience for next
time is a password and so consider sort
of leveraging this again these are tools
to help you be successful so just a
quick status update so we are live in in
Chrome as of m-53 so we've only been
live for about say eight wait weeks now
and it's sort of a quiet launch we had a
great set of early launch partners that
we worked very closely with and they
integrated and tested and gave us a lot
of great feedback again the API is still
early
chrome is the first browser to
implements and so we're really thankful
to all of these players for their great
feedback and from it we're actually
making a lot of changes and improvements
and enhancements to the underlining
experience and so I just want to talk a
little bit about what you can expect to
come soon so the first one that we're
working really hard on is support for
third-party payment apps as you go
around the world there are a lot of ways
to pay in India you know you have like
paid TM and snapdeal and all these other
new emerging wallets and you go to
Holland you have ideal if you go into
other countries a whole new forms of
payment that are not just credit cards
and Android pay and we want to be able
to support all of this in a nice open
way where we can support users from all
over the globe no matter what and so
we're really close to finalizing this
and we hope to have support next year
secondly we have a lot of spec and
feature enhancements coming so we have
the shipping address types I talked
about you'll be able to call this within
an iframe coming up soon as well as much
other small enhancements and
improvements and then we also have much
of UX improvements so we added a are
scanning just recently so you can now
just like scan you if you don't have a
credit card you can just scan it
directly into into the into the UI so
there's things to make it faster easier
and fundamentally better onboarding
flows and then just quick time lines
here just so you're aware we're sort of
targeting in 56
that's our January release as like our
next big major release it's gonna have
all these enhancements all these
improvements and we're really excited
about it on
you'll continue get updates along the
way this is all live in chrome stable
and we'd love to continue to work with
you and get your feedback um everything
I've talked about today is available
online in a lot more detail we have
integration guides a bunch of examples
in sample code where the phones come up
and then we also have a game start with
Android pay Android pay is really simple
with payment requests it's like less
than ten lines we do almost all the
heavy lifting for you so just a quick
shout out there but I'll be around the
rest the day I would love to chat with
you learn about your challenges things
that you think you need from the browser
ways that we can help you be successful
especially in checkouts
so thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
