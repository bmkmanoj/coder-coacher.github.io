development right yes and it's important
to to be properly cross device testing
stuff so it looks beautiful and it's
fast and performant and everything we
try we try there are a lot of tools
involved in that right so what would you
use there are a lot of tools out there
what I use those probably a bad example
like I think one of my main issues is
what these tools are really hard to just
get set up and working all together and
just happy so for me it's browsersync
but I'm really heavily relying on dev
tools like the device emulation mode and
I'm still doing the browser wobbling
back busines forwards device mode has
got presets for all the devices in there
I know but the problem is like dev tools
takes up X amount of space and then
you've got this is why you've got you
got it like so I've got a second monitor
specifically for my full screen dev
tools and you can
yeah but then I need a second monitor
like I do a lot of it just a my laptop
nothing else so I get what you mean
though like it that like if I could just
stick to device mode I work but dev
tools and just doesn't munch well with
me in my head okay nice mode like just
on this one screen yeah that's the only
thing alright sounds sounds like
something we could be doing better so I
use I use browser stack pretty heavily
it's great for like just so browser
stack is like a cloud-based service
where you've got a subscription and you
can just like fire off URLs and then
open them up and different OS is
different mobile devices yeah
here I've got like my site loaded up on
Io
on the go an iPhone six-plus yep and I
can control I can control the device I
can navigate on here it's not just a
static screenshot so it's actually
pretty useful yeah and I find browsers
duck pretty useful it's got you know
support for screenshots and all that
stuff I found rather stacked to be
really useful when you want to do like
manual testings so your Vishu your your
making changes especially when you do
localhost tunneling you just make local
changes it's almost immediately back on
the emulator you can scroll around and
it's great before like I say manual
testing I've used source labs where I've
actually created scripts to the chili
just take screenshots of it run simple
tests like how long it takes pages to
load different things like that and that
was quite a while ago that I did that
like now you've got things like web page
test for performance and everything but
source 5 seems like there's more geared
towards like automation of tests yes we
use we use sauce labs for things that
continues integration it's like so so
you've got a per request that you want
to make sure works across all your
target browsers sauce labs is perfect
for just like mailing that use case yeah
browse the stacks really good if you're
I think if you're working on personal
projects I know there are people that
use browser stack and sort of see I set
up as well with selenium and what else
so I think you and I both use browser
sync actually I never used to use
browser sync because and then you met me
and your life was better no I learnt
about browser sink because of you but
the thing that you never told to me was
that you
so when you're in the Gulf are you can
actually just define a proxy for browser
sync to actually go through so yeah at
some point I expect you to replace there
we're going to really it's gonna happen
why do you think we keep on doing this
so you can define a proxy which in this
case I just say the proxy is localhost
and then what happens is I can have an
engine X server and then browser sync
will create a separate port and it will
just inject the JavaScript the browser
sync needs to work which you never told
me about so I've only just learned about
it but it means that now I can have the
devices like this and it'll sync scrolls
it will sync touches it does what
I tell it to do and that's like awesome
and yeah it's just any visual changes
that I make in terms of code it'll just
reload and it will just happen which is
really really nice because you have
devices like this on your dad like desk
or I'll even have it with a couple of
browsers just on my desktop machine
running and I can just do any kind of
commands on here any actions and it's
just matched across all the browsers or
all the devices yeah browsers things
awesome like we I think we covered it in
another episode that it's also got this
really nice UI for configuring you know
network throttling configuring you know
do you want it to sync clicks and forms
and scrolls and all that other stuff so
browsing is probably my favorite
cross-device testing tool I'd say the
other thing that we use pretty heavily
it's just like regular old VM set up so
people some people use VirtualBox I use
VMware but it's just it's really nice
being able to easily fire up like old
versions of VMs with IE and edge and all
those other things on them yeah I don't
have a Windows machine so I pretty much
rely on that VMware images well I'm
sorry the VirtualBox images because yes
that's them for me it's much easier than
usually similar browser stack or so so
this one I'm gonna do a quick test to do
it locally works a little bit better in
my opinion and it's the same with them
emulators for mobile devices like I've
especially safaris like the iOS emulator
is really really good Android okay not
so much but you know so actually there's
something that I came across when I was
in Tokyo recently and it's a tool that's
been in development for two years and it
kind of blows the water out of any other
cross-device testing thing for Android
yeah it's called I think it's called
open STF it's by its bytes you guys that
the work at cyber agent but it's just it
basically it's the kitchen sink for
mobile device testing and it gives you
this really a beautiful visual catalog
of all the devices you have connected up
you can easily control them
you get like are you familiar with dev
tools screencasting feature
yes so this basically does that but for
all these the other devices you plugged
so that's like says def tool
screencasting is great for a single
device this is great for like a
multitude of them where you want to set
up a device lab and this is very much
like I always say this is like a
supplement some and I browsersync
because this basically helps you control
all the devices in terms of like
launching the browser and pointing them
to a particular URL which is the one bit
that I hate about all of this and it's
pretty much all I've ever done with the
mini mobile device they've stuff with
Pete LePage like that entire focus is
like how do I launch a browser with this
URL and it seems like they've basically
taken that and then just put it on
steroids and make that ridiculous this
is the best thing ever it's so so
awesome so I guess we just need to go
set it up yeah I definitely want want to
get this set up in Google and there's a
lot of people that we've got a firm that
know we're gonna keep this for ourselves
just ourselves nobody else no one else
can touch it
never</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
