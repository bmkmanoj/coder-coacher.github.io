manager working on Chrome for Android
I've also got Alex today I got a text
from Alex he said the web is still too
slow just let me do a couple more traces
he's very serious about web performance
so I guess he'll join later on if he
didn't catch her whole talk in the last
session you might want to look it up on
YouTube later I thought it was a really
crisp overview of why we are so excited
about the web
it's the biggest platform in the world
bigger than any other OS or any other
form factor and there hasn't been
another platform like it in the history
of computing so what we're going to
focus on in this session specifically is
the web's role as a platform for apps
for deeply engaging experiences and
specifically progressive web apps but
let me start at the beginning why build
apps on the web if you have a
significant mobile web presence today
it's likely that it already has a lot of
visitors and you're not alone here's a
recent breakdown comparing monthly
unique visitors to the top thousand apps
and sites and what you see is that the
web reaches three times as many people
and you might have heard in the
developer keynote earlier today that
that reach is growing faster too
historically though most user has
visited the web in passing particularly
on mobile where it's a lot harder to
type a URL than it is to tap on a home
screen icon you might watch a video clip
or read an article but you're not that
likely to come back later because native
apps have had access to features like
push notifications and icons on the home
screen users who engage deeply with
services on their phone have tended to
do so through apps so looking at the
amount of time user spends in those same
apps in sites the average for apps is
much higher than it is for the web so I
think the opportunity here is pretty
clear what if you could give users a
deeply engaging experience as soon as
they landed on your website instead of
asking them to take the high friction
step of installing a native app
what if they could get a native-like
experience from the web and the good
news is the past few viewers have seen a
dramatic increase in the quality and the
capabilities of web apps the web
platform has there to broadly support
features like push notifications
placement on the home screen and
technologies like serviceworker that
make your site more reliable so if
you're not familiar with the term Web
Apps taking advantage of some of these
technologies are called for breadth of
web apps they're reliable they're fast
and they're more engaging as a result of
this change folks who are investing in
the mobile web are seeing great results
a lot of decisions have been made in the
past assuming that it's too hard to get
users to come back to your website I
know that that's changing the way that
we should investor change - let me dive
into a few more examples here way back
in 2011 the Financial Times abandoned
their native apps we built a web map
using the best technology available at
the time and apps FD comp is going
strong ever since reasonably that
experience has gotten even better as
browsers pot up to support developers
building deeply engaging experiences on
the web and now their site is a fully
fledged progressive web app that means I
can save it to my home screen and even
read an article while I'm offline the
Financial Times will sync an offline
section of the paper so that I can read
it even while I'm on the train that just
uses the serviceworker and they've even
got an offline enabled podcasting app
which is available at listen to FD comm
so you can build these pretty
sophisticated experiences on the web
today and it's fascinating to see how
prescient the Financial Times was back
in 2011 fellow publishing giant Forbes
just took a similar step launching their
progressive web app for mobile and
they've even made a slick video to match
their new experience
Midian access in the web there's no
place huge the impact the web on the
newsroom employs monument it's now more
than leader telling this is important
you really have to start to build from
scratch what is a story on the phone
with a progressive web app there's a
link Taffet install with no friction the
PWA is on their phone and once that
isthmus story we are able to alert you
to hate as a nation if you're interested
in whatever areas that you are you can
install that subject topic and we're
going to serve you the content you want
that's going to change our business
integrate the technology has enabled us
to make our PWA
faster than your current website we're
now able to deliver visuals fast
dependable start to delivers visual
respect sir where we can start to change
the formats
people are willing to stay longer stay
stay longer a see more advertising the
PWA is going to result more
personalization personalization will be
healed
we realize there's Tory's ampere
audience that's knowledgeable that's
pretty compelling stuff and I want to
underline a couple of statistics that
they called out in that video after
rolling out the progressive web app
Forbes saw a 43% increase in the number
of sessions per user and those sessions
were double the length on average so it
turns out that a better experience for
Forbes these users was also great
business move sorry for the delay this
isn't just about publishing lyft has
also launched their new but new mobile
website as the progressive web app with
the needs of users in if emerging
markets in mind and you can try it
yourself a trial if calm in emerging
markets where you can't take bandwidth
or even connectivity for granted it's
harder for your audience to get into an
app and so instead of making a site
which is a landing page asking users to
take this high friction step to install
lifts PWA is a feature complete version
of lifts just without the install step
after all the goal isn't to get users to
install an app it's to get them using
your service
so to recap users are already visiting
mobile websites making the experience of
your mobile website radically better by
building a PWA helps you engage and
retain users who are formerly just
passing by the pivotal moment for any
app is when it earns a place on the
users home screen with progressive web
apps that happens when users choose to
add a site to their home screen
improvements to this key step have been
a focus for us lately and they're
rolling out now and there's actually a
flag you can enable here if you want to
test it with your own site there are two
key changes here for engagement first
something we've heard consistently from
developers and users is that it's
confusing the progressive web apps were
on the home screen but not in other
parts of Android system UI like the app
for our
as part of the improved at the home
spring experience users can find them
now find it there now
they'll also set up in system settings
allowing users to manage progressive web
apps more like other apps but I want to
emphasize that this is actually pretty
general
for example this up and suggestions and
open from the Google search widget this
is deeper integration for progressive
web apps means users will be able to
find them in a lot of places that were
formerly reserved formerly reserved just
for apps second something else we
averted that it's confusing that for
sometimes progressive web apps would
load in a tab in chrome and other times
as a full screen activity after the user
had added it to their home screen so I'm
happy to say now that we'll be able to
handle intent from links opened in other
apps or in Chrome that means that users
who have added their your PWA to their
home screen will get the immersive
version of your site whenever they
navigate to it okay now let's take a
closer look at the manifest which
provide the metadata to enable
progressive web apps to be added in the
first place this is the same manifest
that you would use today so I'll add
users to add shortcuts so if you support
that today and you have a progressive
web app all of this happens and you'll
switch over without requiring any extra
work so it starts with the name and a
short name if you keen to talk about
progressive web apps or app manifest
before this will looks pretty familiar
the short name is actually what shows up
on the user's home screen and in system
settings and the full name will appear
basically where there's space for it so
in the chrome prompt and in the splash
screen which shows before your site
loads then you've got an icon you can
specify multiple sizes here but we
recommend at least one icon which is a
ping with at least 144 pixels to the
side 192 will scale up even better and
then icon gets used in a few different
places so in the app drawer as I just
showed you in the rest of the system UI
on Android inside of Chrome when users
are prompted to add your site to the
home screen and they're used to generate
that splash screen the start URL is so
to speak that the main screen of your
app it's what users will get when they
tap on the icon on your home screen
and if it's open in the background
already they'll just pop back to
whatever page they had left the display
mode controls how your app shows up on
screen usually you want standalone which
is sort of like fullscreen you won't see
a browser toolbar or other browser UI
but you will still see the Android
status bar and the Android navigation
bar so this is by default sort of what
native apps look like but there are also
a couple of other modes coming to Chrome
so first full screen which in contrast
to standalone does cover up the status
bar and the navigation bar that's what
you see here with paper claims that
world and minimal UI which is a new mode
which is a simplified toolbar with your
URL and allows users to see it and copy
it more easily then there's scope even
if you have an app manifest today you
probably don't use this code because the
date it actually hasn't done anything to
affect the behavior of your app however
with support for links coming in to from
this field does now have some meaning so
a core part of the user experience of
progressive web apps is that they open
reliably and users never see a network
error from the browser in chrome that's
the dinosaur page and that's ensured by
having a serviceworker which handles the
set of urls inside your progressive web
app but if you do provide a scope
explicitly in the manifest it'll
restrict the set of URLs that should
open in your progressive web app in its
immersive form the scope of your
progressive web app will also define the
boundary of your app so right now
navigations to other sites from your
progressive web app that is navigations
outside of the scope will open with this
little URL bar on the top you can see
here that little bar isn't all that
useful we've heard from you all that
it's lacking especially compared to what
you can do opening content for native
apps so to close this app we're planning
to move this to a more feature full and
familiar UI it'll allow you to copy the
URL to open it in Chrome or jump back to
the progressive web app that open that
content with the X and we're looking
forward to getting your feedback on this
as it rolls out later this year ok so
you have a progressive web app with a
man
now you want to make sure your keys
across and your eyes are dotted so that
users will be able to add it how do you
figure out what precisely qualifies as a
progressive web app the best way
detective requirements is to use
lighthouse where you can see there's a
section called user can add site to home
string it's pretty self-explanatory if
those are brain your site should be
aníbal on any Android device as we
announced today lighthouse will soon be
integrated and DIF developer tools
making this even easier to get at and we
also know that being able to add your
site predictably is important so we make
changes to these criteria carefully and
with advance notice on the chromium
developer blog so with all those
requirements in place users can be
prompted to add your site after the
browser fires beyond before install
prompt event today that prompts looks
like this in chrome it's fired ones
determined your site is an eligible
progressive web app and that the user
has been sufficiently engaged with your
site the intent of that engagement check
is to avoid spamming users with requests
that they aren't likely to accept and we
said it from developer summit last fall
that we were experimenting with the
threshold for user engagement at the
very beginning this is a few minutes and
a couple visits to your site and we've
heard from a lot of developers that this
wasn't very predictable
and so in the most successful variant of
that experiment we saw banners rivering
increased by half and remarkably the
user acceptance rate didn't change much
even though we were triggering earlier
so we saw a 48% increase in the number
of installs as well and what that
suggests to us is that we were being too
conservative before and so on pleased to
say that we've decreased the engagement
threshold in chrome stable targeting
your prompts is even better than leaving
it to Chrome so you can hold on to the
under 4 installed prompt event and show
the prompts later at a time that makes
the most sense to your app Flipkart for
example in this screenshot delayed
prompting users until after they
completed a purchase a moment when users
are engaged and getting a lot of value
from their service and this led to three
times more users accepting the prompt
than I had before pretty soon we're
going to be taking this even further by
firing on before install prompt for
sites as soon as chrome understands the
site is a progressive web app if you add
a listener for this event early on in
your page chrome will suppress the
default prompt and these triggering
things all flow up to you which gives
you a lot more control when they're
prompted spreader from a user action the
display will change from the toast at
the bottom to this style of modal
prompts and the get here this better
aligns with the way that users and sites
are using Add to Home screen today in
fact we see that most additions coming
from come from crumbs overflow menu with
sites often actually point to from their
own UI and so by giving developers more
control and the ability to repress when
the user can't something it'll be easier
to show more timely and relevant prompts
so to summarize again you can make your
mobile web experience radically better
by building up bwa and that can help you
engage and retain users who are already
coming to you we've been working in
particular to make it easier than ever
for our users to add their site add your
site to their home screen to improve the
experience and users engagement once
there and with that I'll hand it over to
Alex to talk about some of the other
platforms building for PWS and some of
the new capabilities
thank Sam can't wait to see all that
stuff roll out later this year hi
everybody I'm Alex Russell I'm a
software engineer on the chrome team
like Sam mentioned and I wanted to spend
the next 15 minutes or so making you as
sad about web performance as I am
no I'm I'm kidding of course
kind of maybe I did promise Sam that I
wouldn't use my last minute slide
editing power to make this secretly a
performance talk it is actually taking
quite a lot of self-restraint for me to
not go into why it takes 40 seconds for
this site to load but I'll do it
so where were we was it progressive web
apps again okay right so acid xpcom is
awesome but you might not know that
progressive web apps are also on Chrome
OS so if I go to a pesky calm in a tab
on Chrome OS and I spent a little bit of
time on it I'll eventually get an add to
shelf banner very much the same way that
I would on Chrome for Android to put
such add to homescreen prompt at the
bottom if I click Add I will get a new
item in my shelf at the bottom and if I
launch it it shows up as a full screen
window a standalone thing it even shows
up as a differentiated item in the task
switcher it's a real boy it's a full
first class application this is pretty
great so Chrome has been taking some
steps to make progressive web apps work
on the desktop but it turns out we're
not alone
for the past few years we've been
extraordinarily lucky to work with our
friends at the Samsung internet browser
team to develop the standards behind
progressive web apps since version 4
that they released last year Samsung
Internet has had great support for
progressive web apps you can even try it
on Google Experience devices today out
of the Play Store so in addition to the
usual add to homescreen banner that
you'll get with a user engagement
threshold Samsung Internet has been
forging ahead with new ideas about how
to communicate to users that they're
visiting something that isn't just a
regular website so here's Twitter light
again if I land on Twitter light I see
the usual star button at the upper left
when I first land there if you've used
Samsung internet you'll know that this
is a little button that lets you
bookmarking
it's a quick action for that but one
Samsung internet detects that the site
is a progressive web app that star
changes to a plus that's a visual cue to
you that this isn't just your regular
website there's more to do here tapping
on the plus brings you it up to this
menu which lets you both bookmark and
add it to the home screen so it's
persistent queue that lets you
understand that this thing is the PWA so
here's how the experience skills in
context this is the site that I am
particularly partial to and not just
because it loads fast as you can see
Samsung Internet's progressive web app
integration feels fast and fluid just
like Chrome Samsung internet progressive
web apps get their own top-level
activities in the task switcher one
launch from the home screen and they
launch display standalone too so if you
follow Android hardware you might have
heard of the new Dex Dex is an add-on
for the recently launched flagship s8
phone which was released last month next
is a bit like a dock for your phone it
gives you a desktop mode letting you
connect an external mouse keyboard and
monitor all driven from the phone that
you put inside the dock as you saw on
come west there's kind of no reason to
believe that progressive web apps can't
excel on the desktop too so here's the
same flow the Samsung internet team sent
us this video showing adding a PWA to
the desktop launching it and once
launched it again launches in its own
top-level standalone window because
making responsive multi form-factor
experiences is so easy and fluid on the
web the polymer shop demo works great in
both form factors I think this is an
outstanding testament to what's possible
with the web today and because web apps
are standards-based advanced features
like push notifications can follow you
to whichever browser you happen to savor
on your Android but that's not all
thanks to the open nature of standards
our friends on the Microsoft edge team
have also been working with us on
compatibility for features like service
workers and web push but what I'm really
excited about is some of the stuff they
unveiled at their build conference last
week in Seattle later this year Windows
10 will gain some very deep integration
with progressive web apps in a first for
progressive web
the Windows Store will crawl the web to
discover which sites are Bank users will
see them as installable apps in search
results and developers will be able to
easily claim store listings listings in
the Windows Store let users discover
progressives wherever they might be
looking for them either in a tab or in
the store so progressive web apps like
jig space will always be available in
the browser of course but if you're
searching for the same experience in the
store they'll be listed there too
installing these apps is just like
downloading any other app from the
Windows Store next up they're tiny but
if the developer all you had to do was
build a great progressive web of
experience you didn't have to target a
brand new runtime apps that are
downloaded in this way get all the same
UI affordances as native apps including
the ability to be configured installed
and uninstalled naturally just like you
would any other Windows 10 app billions
of users across desktop and mobile are
getting first-class support for
progressive about experiences this year
I think it's a great time to be a web
developer this is hugely exciting so
people you A's are everywhere in tabs
for sites that you visit on the home
screen if you want them to be on your
desktop and soon inside stores for apps
that need what the web already is great
at that opens up huge opportunities if
you saw Rahul's mobile web State of the
Union
you know how vitally important that is
to businesses and how P WASR positively
impacting sites worldwide but what keeps
me up at night on the engineering side
is a set of things that the web hasn't
been great at a few years ago people
sort of thought it was nuts that we
would do push notifications and deep
system integration without coming up
with a brand new format and a brand new
way of packaging and distributing
applications I mean everybody else was
using stores right but we've got some
great examples now things like Twitter
Lite Ola cabs Forbes and lyft showing
what's possible if we just add a couple
of things that are currently missing
from the web and how much better that
can be so what is that next set of apps
on the chrome team we've been kind of
preoccupied with the question why aren't
all of my social and media apps
progressive web apps so back in 2013 we
were started
to answer the question why don't lab
apps ever feel great on a phone the
answer was a set of capabilities that
reinforced each other to make reliable
apps that loaded quickly every time we
had to solve the offline problem hence
service workers to participate in a tap
and swipe ecosystem on your phone we had
to make it possible for you to access
them from the home screen and inside the
notification tray so we worked on Add to
Home screen and notifications and
manifests so what next
well we think it's a similar
constellation of new capabilities
targeted specifically at social sharing
and media we've been working on a lot of
stuff over the past year to expand the
power and reach and progressive web apps
but I want to highlight a few that are
close to shipping namely web share
improve media selection image capture
and shape detection this is not by any
means the full tour there will be lots
of there from other talks so to appoint
you add a few of them but rest assured
we're continuing to expand the set of
capabilities for the web so if you've
implemented a modern web site you'll no
doubt be familiar with the endless
opportunities for performance
degradation that social media widgets
add as bad as that performance problem
is on desktop it's much much much worse
on mobile I promise I wouldn't turn this
new performance talk so here's the shiny
video this is Twitter light using a new
experimental API called web share web
share lets sites trigger a share and
head on Android in exactly the same way
native apps can on other os's
web share triggers whatever the built-in
sharing system is to instead of pulling
in half a dozen social network scripts
to enable sharing the browser can now do
the heavy lifting for you that's a huge
win for performance and for consistency
with the OS triggering sharing is pretty
simple you just called a navigator touch
share method with a data that you want
to share and you'll have to provide
either text or a URL in order to for it
to work out the API is asynchronous so
it returns a promise which integrates
nicely with a new async function syntax
come in to JavaScript as you probably
guessed we're also working on the
ability for peat regressive web apps
that have been installed to handle
intent to that's happening via the share
target API and you should look for both
of them in a chrome near you sometime in
the next year another major issue with
sharing from the web today is that when
you go to selective photo
or a video to attach to a post you'll
often wind up seeing an intent chooser
that looks kind of like this now I don't
know about you but the difference
between camera and camera wasn't
immediately obvious to me it turns out
that the one on the left is for taking a
still image and the one on the right is
for video who knew the last one files
brings you into a system provided file
picker like this this isn't the nicest
UI but and while it's functional it
shares a problematic commonality with
the first two because this is using the
Android intent system to launch another
application into the foreground that
means that Chrome can go to the
background where it might be killed
specifically on a low memory device so
you sit there and you go through you
find the perfect thing to upload along
with this post you hit OK and suddenly
the page is reloading where did it go
this is a pretty bad experience so to
get rid of the confusing dialogues and
to deal with the memory pressure issues
we were working hard on a new UI that
mirrors what most native apps have taken
a shine to for similar reasons here it
is
this new picker is faster and more
intuitive and I'm happy to say that it
won't require any extra work from you to
take advantage of it like the social
apps you're used to it allows you to
select items from context already
there's also work happening to make
background uploads of large media files
easier and if one shot background syncs
are already shipped last year in Chrome
that means it's now the most reliable
way to do an action like posting
something to the web it even retries
when it detects that you're back online
from a disconnected state all of these
api's work together to make sharing and
media easier and that's a big
improvement for selecting photos that
you've already taken but what about
camera based apps I always tell the team
that the web is for cat gifts and making
cat gifts is too darn hard on the web
what's up with that
luckily they agreed and the image
capture API is shipping in chrome 59
this API builds on Chrome's really great
getusermedia infrastructure to give you
access to
detailed information from the camera it
also lets you build your own controls to
manage important features like zoom
level focus mode color temperature
redeye reduction flash contrast
saturation exposure I can keep going
it's a long list and we finally are
going to get control over those features
on the web in the next release of Chrome
there's so many options for image
capture that I'm not going to go through
code examples for them because it would
be basically an exercise a regurgitating
web idea and I don't know about you but
reading web IDL is not my idea of a good
time
so luckily the polymer team has been
paying attention to this problem space
too and they put together some high
quality components that let you easily
integrate image capture into your app
check them out at web components or by
searching for the app - media component
set it's pretty great stuff such as it's
increasingly important for AR and media
applications is the ability to quickly
understand what's in a scene though this
is helpful both for focusing when you're
taking a photo but also for matching
effects to faces and things that you
might have in frame interestingly it
turns out that face detection shape
detection and text recognition are built
into nearly all modern alessa's and in
the case of things like QR codes
sometimes even into the firmware for the
camera itself that sort of thing is
expensive and slow to do in JavaScript
and can potentially jank your main
thread at a moment what you really want
it to be smooth you're taking a photo
after all you want to put some pictures
on screen like web share having the
platform doing the heavy lifting for you
can really transform the quality of the
application that you deliver to the end
user so we're bringing shape detection
to the web using the new image capture
constructor you can easily grab a frame
from input that's coming from the camera
or any other media stream whose contents
you can actually read from there the
face detector lets you scan captured
frames for faces returning a list of
detected faces with X Y width and height
attached to each of them you can capture
multiple faces in a single frame and the
CPI takes care of all the Sibley bits
for you same for the barcode detection
it works exactly the same way you grab
frames from the screen and pass them
into image capture and then you decode
them using the new barcode detector
object it does exactly the same thing
except the barcode barcodes not only
have X Y width and height but they also
have a raw value giving you the decoded
value of the QR code of the barcode that
you're currently looking at and while
this may not seem like a big deal to
those of us who don't live in countries
where QR codes are used every day in
many parts of the world physical
commerce is increasingly mediated by the
ability to quickly scan QR codes this
capability unlocks the ability for
progressive web apps on the web to
compete on equal footing letting
commerce focus progress web apps easily
integrate a heavily used feature at much
lower cost you no longer have to set
your own QR code detection library down
the wire this is great for users and
