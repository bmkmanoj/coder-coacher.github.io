session or is that something what to do
next after the talk will have the talk
so then I will save my little talk with
it later then we have a very very good
panel here of people who are extremely
experienced in basically real-time data
I strongly recommend you just read me
the panel introduction from all of them
we've got Henrique geotag right here
John fallows Wesley who actually did
this lovely on slide demonstration as
well which by the way is right there and
then to my left we have is if Martin
Martin and Rob sorry welcome I do
recognize that we had the odd slide up I
really strongly recommend that you guys
take a look at that and get it started
as a perfect introduction to this talk
if you are on an iPhone and you bring up
that web page and it goes to sleep you
must refresh the page because the
WebSocket gets closed down automatically
perfect introduction so why we're here I
also would like to try using it during
this talk so as many of you as possible
can bring it up we'll ask like some
questions along the way we'll see how it
goes but I think right now we need a
general introduction that's what I mixed
we're here for so please all right see
if i can get my slides back on the
screen here maybe we go okay hi guys my
name is henrik your tag i work at a
company called and yet and i've been
building real-time web apps now for
about four years we started out using
XMPP and Stroh pjs and bosh and Exum
panda all that stuff back in the day
long polling then WebSockets came out we
started messing with that saca de oh and
the like recently have gotten really
into WebRTC I think it's useful before
we get too into the technical stuff to
kind of step back a minute and kind of
realize what what this really does in
terms of the web the web is really about
human communication and so these are my
kids oh and they love their grandparents
a problem is their grandparents live in
Sweden for those of you who with a
typical American geographic
understanding it's far away
sorry that's low I'm sorry tonight it's
not this crowd I know so we built an app
called so every every Sunday my kids get
to talk to my parents over a nap we'd
built called taki io that uses web RTC
talk e io is the first app I've ever
built that actually pasts the mom test
meaning my parents can use it what it is
is like any time you're on the same URL
you're in the same conversation that's
all there is to it so no login and off
no friending nothing and it's using
WebRTC there's nothing to install it
just worked so to me I mean it just
serves as very kind of practical example
for how how altima tlie like these
real-time technologies are actually
bringing people together and helping
make the web better so let's talk a
little bit about WebRTC we're going to
cover other stuff too but I want to
focus on this a bit because it's been
kind of a recent focus of mine
hypertrophy really is a lot more than
video in a browser it's it's actually a
low latency peer-to-peer networking and
that's that's really exciting so one of
the other cool examples of what you can
do with this technology is a is a
computer CDN piercy dan was actually
built by the same guy who did google
instant but anyway it's it's this really
cool concept of where say it actually
uses data channels to send files to
other current visitors so say for
instance I'm hoping I'm hosting like a
simple little video site right I'm
actually hosting my own videos all of a
sudden I'm on reddit and I'm getting
slammed so normally that would be
expensive for bandwidth but in this case
the kind of swarm of people that are
gathering on your site to watch this
footage can actually download it from
each other so instead of to kind of
create this this almost ad-hoc like
BitTorrent type network which is really
fascinating it's just kind of an example
of what you can do with this stuff also
given kind of recent stuff with the NSA
and with encryption etc etc etc I
actually think WebRTC is really
important for the web it's decentralized
it's encrypted and yes maybe there's
backdoors who knows but ultimately like
this is stuff
we should be doing and it's a big win
for the web so how are we doing so far
well let's start with a story a year ago
we built and yet we built HTC JSA to tjs
was a kind of a demonstration used at
CES by ATT to demonstrate making and
receiving actual phone calls in a
browser using WebRTC which is cool we
got to work but with way too many
caveats it actually required running a
certain modified version of chromium
that the Ericsson team was maintaining
not ideal it's gotten better so if you
look at this here what we actually have
is a nexus 4 running Firefox nightly
again nexus 7 running Chrome for Android
and then a desktop running Firefox table
and chrome stable all in the same
conversation at the same time so we have
it's gotten better that's available now
in some mobile devices and
interoperability is improving for voice
and video suite so we're good we can all
go home we should just use this right
WebRTC is still quite finicky and if you
try to do anything with it you've
probably discovered this so just to kind
of give an example here's what you have
to do to set up a video call right now
between two users so first of all
getting user media sounds really simple
you request access to the camera in the
microphone right you think the methods
are still prefix or just fine i mean
that's to be expected they throw very
different error types so in firefox the
air handler that you give it will give
you a string back in chrome it will give
you an error object as its supposed to
but neither quite full as the spec as
far as telling you what went wrong so in
addition specifying constraints for like
a i want a smaller video is available
kind of with limited support in chrome
and not at all on firefox at the moment
screen sharing which is actually really
important for replacing something like
Skype or Google Hangouts is available in
Chrome but it's kind of flag very hard
to detect arrow types requires HTTPS so
even if you're running localhost and if
you don't have your own self sign
certain it will just fail silently and
you won't know why so as a result we
what do we do we create abstractions so
we wrote a getusermedia module to handle
that part
attaching media stream also something so
once you once you request media you have
the stream object and it's your job to
then attach that to say a video element
or an audio element this has gotten
better there's the API is just more
similar now but you have to convert it
to a blob URL attach it as a source in
chrome you said autoplay to true and
Firefox you attach it and call play
point is there's differences and often
you you want to mute the users own video
so they don't want echo back to
themselves etc so again now that's
another thing that should be simple now
has become another module that we were
making so beyond that I think that a lot
of people don't understand about
peer-to-peer is ultimately you have to
have some mechanism for the two peers to
discover each other it's not like we
just magically know each other's
external IPS and we can just send stuff
directly so and this this is not in the
spec at all it's purposely left out so
it's totally greenfield and actually
think that's good but that means as a
developer you have to do a lot more work
you have to help users discover each
other it to help them figure out how to
pass data messages directly to another
user which is not something that's
necessarily in the tool bit of the
average JavaScript developer so can now
you need some kind of server server
technology as well to be able to handle
this with socket i/o it's not hard but
it's a it's still something that's new
for a lot of people in addition if they
do some level capabilities detection for
certain things so for example if you do
screen sharing from chrome it won't
appear for a Firefox user but there's no
way that you would know that
programmatically without specifying
through the signaling channel but hey
you got users in this chat who are
actually at Firefox so there's just a
few few oddities like that so then we
write a signaling server so peer
connections so this is kind of the
mother this is like the the thing that
does it all right this has some quirks
as well so first of all the prefix which
is again to be expected I don't think
that's a bad thing create data channel
so this is the data stuff that we're
going to talk about this is extremely
finicky at the moment so you have to
pass a very specific set of option to
create a reliable channel vs
a unreliable channel it's supposed to be
reliable true or false but that doesn't
actually work in either browser as I
just talking to Kyle about of there is a
upload limitation in the default
settings for Chrome so in order to
actually do get this to work yet so if
you want to bypass a file around you
have to actually modify the ftp that you
send tricky stuff so anyway we read a
wrapper for that other challenges data
channels that are currently not at all
interoperable between chrome and firefox
you can only do one video stream /
connection and all of this is to just
there are other browsers that will do
this so it's not going to get any better
web RTC is also unique in that this is
actually the first time I know of where
browsers have to speak directly to each
other there's no intermediary so once
you set up a signaling channel like they
better be interoperable and that's a
whole new level of spec compliance
that's required in order to make that
work and I can only imagine how
interesting it will be if Microsoft and
Internet Explorer decide to do this as
well so I wrote a library called simple
/ t just basically you provide a
container for local you provide a
container for remote videos and when
it's ready you join the room and it
works makes a bunch of assumptions but
this is the kind of stuff you need in
order to actually make this approachable
there's alternatives obviously there's
pjs focused on data channels open Tok
and there's another guy who's done a
bunch of interesting experiments kind of
running out of time here so anyway so
the big thing I think this is really
important is a tinkerer ability is
actually what drives adoption of new
technologies so we like to play with new
stuff and that every does so in the same
way that jQuery made the Dom accessible
to lots of people socket i/o made web
sockets accessible as a lot of people I
abstraction library such as sin Weber
see I don't care if it's that or
something else but hopefully makes it
accessible to more people as well and we
really just need more open web hackers
to really get into this stuff and build
things with it if not it's going to be
relegated in the one of these like hey
this would have been nice and it never
actually works I really think that you
know if you haven't been playing with
web RTC like get in there build stuff
with it make it
it's phenomenal technology it just needs
people to to make it work so file bugs
feedback improve api's push for
interoperability we made a little site
with a compatibility chart we're also
piping kind of feedback data from actual
humans about the quality of the
connections but encourage you to get
involved let's make the open web even
more awesome with web RTC thanks guys
okay first is a test can we bring up the
moderator screen again okay i want to
see we have 40 people connected right
now just this is do a quick test how
many of you would be lying if you said
you liked the talk this is a test
there's one item vision it was just a
logic question guys work with me here
excellent good I just want to say I
wanted to see if we got lots of numbers
that's all I wanted to say so okay now
that that's working I would like to do
you follow what Steve said which is have
each person take about 60 seconds to say
any comments things you like to add on
200 degree talk so if we start with
Martin is this working yeah yeah so I'm
I'm in hundreds some great work on web
RTC in it so it's very interesting
especially the data channel stuff in my
opinion but I think we shouldn't forget
about other other technologies web
sockets it's only what two years old
it's only just now becoming really
available in a lot of browsers and
there's a huge amount of stuff we can do
with the TCP connection to the browser
okay rom yeah I mean there's not a huge
amount to add to that but from my point
of view I think what's most interesting
and particular with WebRTC is is the use
beyond audio and video and so I'm keen
to discuss a little bit more into those
kind of ye cases perhaps games the CDN
stuff and just hearing a little bit more
about what's next I mean we have the
implementation today and there's issues
with that but what what could we do next
to make things better excellent John
yeah so I I agree with the point made
earlier about other technologies being
highly relevant here I think the reset
out solve different problems and you
know to talk about the point about
signaling channels I think going through
a server intermediary but technologies
like WebSocket are ideally suited to
that and WebRTC of course is ideally
targeted at the peer-to-peer direct
connectivity so I see it as a very
powerful blend of technologies as the
web's lols going forward of course Lee
yes let's see it the centralized part is
a little you know we got to get past
that but first is for this tool all the
remotes your hand you're holding in your
hand it would be cool if we could pull
out WebRTC to use the mic and now that
way you wouldn't have people running
around hand and Mike's out so I mean
there's so many use cases so many
possibilities of tickets excellent okay
I think we like to move to our first
question I think that's Andrew bets if
you'd like to
do we have a microphone for engine I've
actually got the Pearl might say I
should be fine just I've got 100 notes
here so just give me a second right so
web sockets and other real-time
protocols are commonly blocked by
corporate proxies and content inspection
firewalls and that's particular problem
for the sort of customers we have at the
ft how much is this stifling adoption
and what can we do about it what do you
want like to take that go John so I
think just taking a little step back
into history I when WebSocket was first
added to the html5 specification wasn't
even called WebSocket it was called TCP
connection and when we saw that show up
we decided to hop on that and try to
improve the protocol to make it
web-centric and bring HTTP to bear so
it's actually a web compatible handshake
and the reason that we did that was to
avoid tripping over some of the problems
we've seen before on plug-in
technologies getting defeated by
corporate firewall so we felt I was a
huge step in the right direction now
even given that we still find situations
where even though all the traffic might
be over port 80 and 443 even went three
krypton firewalls and things like that
that they can still intercept but it's
definitely a much better situation than
it used to be and in our particular case
at King we've implemented some heavy
lifting on the emulation side to even be
resilient in those situations initially
we wrote the emulation stuff to kind of
precede the adoption of the standard so
we get started with WebSocket
architectures over five years ago but
but moving forward it tends to become
something that's still there to support
older clients but also to address any
intermediaries than my beginning in
today are you saying it's not a problem
or it's easy to work around on the on
the vanilla RFC support for the protocol
encryption is a big help but even in
those situations there can be
intermediates that will decrypt Andrey
Krypton the critical path and can still
intercept and then there's also many web
sockets that don't want to be encrypted
for other reasons in terms of
performance and things like that from
our perspective we seen it be an issue
in the wild for non non compliant
browsers trying to do emulation we found
waste in our a Malaysian technique to
address those shortcomings your comments
I just make one little comment I would
say you know for this kind of audience
there's very little barrier you should
you know you can jump on with WebSockets
but if you really want to address all
use cases as Jon says you know ssl does
help but you need to think about other
full of black strategies one of the
things that would would really help and
we maybe could think about is we do add
pusher a lot of work to try and to use
to reuse successful transports again but
we don't really have enough information
about the the browser's network
connection to meet always able to make
good connections so maybe that's a
something that we can talk about later
how we can discover you know like in the
responsive images discussion this
morning we were saying you know the
browser has more information than the
web application this is a case where the
web application could do with some more
information really and the audience
clearly likes that comment one of the
that was odd okay that was keep that up
that was awesome one of the comments on
the new google moderator said that TLS
actually is an effective way around this
just in any comments on TLS being a
useful thing yeah John just said that I
mean you know we find that but
unfortunately there are examples I mean
for us you know we've had schools for
example and they often block ssl they
you could have kind of a pretty bad
situation okay you know comments we want
an expression this problem is very
relevant to our party see as well I mean
it's the whole concept of punching
through a firewall to get a something
that you can push directly to an end
user is actually really difficult and
this is something that the likes of
apple and skype have spent lots and lots
of money trying to solve and I would
really love to see some of these
technologies be more broadly available
there's a few open source project
there's a problem there's a server
called stun d but like a lot of these
are really difficult problems
and I wish that they were more openly
well-documented solutions to dealing
with this rather than having to as a
blog post that came out yesterday did
actually try to decrypt what's going on
with facetime and what they're doing to
multiplex ports and all kinds of stuff
I'm this is not my area of expertise but
I know there are people here who are
really good at this stuff and please
please share your work this stuff is
needed in order to make web RTC good ok
the next question is up by someone as it
Gus goossens we can get him a mic please
hi there seems to be some functional
overlap between web sockets and what web
RTC when should you use one or the other
I can take that so the fundamental
difference is WebRTC is is designed to
be peer-to-peer so web sockets if you're
going server to peter server to client
that's a better use for that the i think
really where the the comparison comes
from is the fact that once you've
established a data Channel it's largely
the same API beyond that there there are
different technologies so if you go in
peer-to-peer weber to see if you're go
on you know through a server then web
sockets so go ahead please as you can
say one of the the other made manger
differences as well as again looking at
beyond just video and audio so for
example multiplayer games and web
sockets and WebRTC are incredibly
different because one gdp and one's tcp
so you have unreliable data connections
and reliable data connections which just
allow for very different way of doing
multiplayer communication you just
cannot do at which base multiplayer game
using WebSockets but because you have to
wait for things to come through but what
WebRTC is allowing us to to use
technologies that we've been using a
native environments I just say the
support is a little flaky for reliable
and unreliable data channels but it's
part of the spec to include both so
hopefully
that becomes easier to use and one of
the things i would think that we're
likely to see as the unreliable data
channels become become reliable is is
that actually people were going to
implement this on the server side and so
you know to be able to communicate with
a game server via UDP from a browser
that it's a pretty big thing yeah i
think that's a great point and also i
think we touched on earlier as well
about using WebSocket server centric
strategies for signaling and set up
around WebRTC is another another
interesting variant one other thing i
would i would mention as well in in
deployments in certain industries
obviously the security boundaries of
these things often crop up so it's very
interesting challenge to address some of
those I boundaries of where the trust
boundaries reside amongst the users and
amongst the server in a consistent
manner across both technologies isn't
there a perception that that this is
like a classic web thing where we've got
one standard that doesn't quite work so
we can with another standard that
overlaps a bit and it's just kind of
confusing because they kind of her
somewhat related or can we really say
that there's a pure vision each one of
these things and they both exist they
can both be parallel and it's ok as I
said earlier I think these are
complementary technologies that create a
powerful combination as we move forward
and I think they have well suited
purposes in each in each way I also
think that I there's there's certain
issues like the ability to successfully
navigate through these spirals and
proxies on the WebRTC side that you know
in certain some of the fallback cases
for a web RTC for reach ability
WebSocket can potentially lend a hand
there too cool excellent we have another
question then from Mattea Scotsman
oh my question is will WebSocket
protocol replace server sent events in
the future why must we have both backs
if web sockets can accomplish the same
tasks that sse does and more it was
another example possible overlap I can
take this if you like clues and I would
say you know the service and events is a
very simple protocol and so I think that
drives a lot of adoption early on but I
think what we will see especially as the
WebSocket spec and it gets more widely
adopted and a lot of some of the missing
features become available for example
encryption is currently possible with
service and events but not web sockets
that stay directions well yes of course
there are extra functionality but I
think the question is for just the use
cases that one would currently use
service and events are you know what's
likely to happen for example
multiplexing is another thing that might
allow people to use a single a single
connection to address to address you
know many use cases on the page I'm just
add to that I've thinking back to when
we were working on the spec on this
stuff I you know comet was the flavor of
the day when it was certain events was
being standardized as a way to
effectively standardized comet behavior
several years ago and around that time
WebSocket was starting up to so this
exact question came up during
standardization process and apart from
the the points that we made already one
of the overarching arguments that was
left was that by having a simplified
interaction with server sent events it
created a surface area where the browser
had more control over the actual
behavior and the idea was that on mobile
platforms this might actually allow the
same abstraction to be retargeted at
mobile specific solutions that didn't
necessarily involve making a traditional
HTTP requests over a traditional TCP
connection and getting a stream of
information coming back down it you know
so so there are different different
implementation strategies for the
abstraction if the abstractions left
high that the versatility of WebSocket
obviously means that you can cover that
use case in many more
and Wesley you actually had a comment
earlier on we were talking about
possibly speedy push this just adds to
this layering yes so I mean the way we
send data to the client there's
bi-directional there's with WebSockets
there's SSC there's and now we've got
HTTP two point O coming out and we've
got right now what we can implement is
speedy and that's available in I know
node and jetty and other servers so like
we've got these three options to choose
how to push data to the to the client
and and so that's with HTTP two point oh
is there going to be I mean it's going
to be web sockets layered over speedy is
that going to be the approach or is it
going to be pure web sockets or speedy
going to have a mechanism to do
bidirectional like push and then also
receive messages on one channel that was
that was kind of my question which I
don't know the answer to are there any
HTTP two experts in the crowd yeah that
would be really interesting don't be shy
based on what I've seen so far speedy
I'd expected to play out where HTTP and
WebSocket going parallel over the same
envelope at a speedy connection is at
least an option because to keep web
sockets out of that would be to create
additional resource hog on the client
server connection for the TCP endpoints
so it seems like a very natural
consequence of having selected an HTTP
handshake to get started WebSocket to
let them all play nicely together cool
your comments we want to make about this
okay Christopher Froelich you get a
question number four coming up mr.
so the web RCT web RTC spec has driven
centralized solutions but nub etc to a
decentralized problem what can we do to
bring a secure fully decentralized
solution to bear that's tricky I mean is
ultimately yet to have some discovery
mechanism right there are some attempts
I forget the name of the developer now
there's a project where basically you
end up copying and pasting stp blobs
back and forth over whatever mechanism
you choose it could be email it could be
whatever and it still uses stun ice and
turn to actually connect and I with
firewalls I don't see that going the way
I mean I don't know how to solve that
problem I would love to see a solution
ok I want make sure we also encourage
people to ask questions we've been going
we're running through our questions just
fine but feel free to just jump in and
get on the delegate list if you'd like
does anybody want to add anything to
that question about centroid service or
working ok well I suppose one of the
questions is whether we actually in when
do you need a decencies decentralized
solution and when you do not need a
decentralized solution I mean I was not
quite clear and what exactly you mean
what what are the benefits that you'd
want to see from a deep set from a
decentralized solution so the first
example that comes to mind is video
collaboration so my family and I which
we've all got smart phones you know high
resolution cameras in our pockets and
we'd like to be able to shoot and
collaborate on video together in real
time and the overhead and trying to
figure out where we are out and back
down to each other seems like a lot when
you just want a simple way to connect
people that want to ok well that makes I
mean that's a perfect example for WebRTC
I mean that that's when you need that
super low latency in the UDP kind of
started communication that makes perfect
sense well in theory Stern and I should
help you locate and figure out that
those they are in fact on the same
network and then be able to connect to
that's not a complete solution but it's
something what sure so just to
antagonize that point of it if we're all
independently connected say via mobile
data so we're not on the same network
and we're using just a plain vanilla web
app there's there's no clear path to a
central server necessarily in a quick
and easy to use way right now you're
talking about connecting devices that
really are not on the same network at
all and that's a whole different type of
problem I think I mean I think that
would be awesome but I don't know quite
how that I don't how to fix that one
okay Kyle actually I believe has a got a
question let's make sure that he gets my
cozy sitting over there this is a
delicate so we can make sure you didn't
I hope they're so it seems like there's
two major reasons why centralization
still happens the first ones
discoverability obviously if we don't
have any way for two different people to
get hooked up on a blind date then they
don't know where to you know what
restaurant to show up at so somebody has
to introduce the two but that seems like
that should be solvable through other
bands like you know there's been other
peer-to-peer networks music sharing and
you know BitTorrent and other things
like that seems like there should be
ways to sort of solve that problem but
there's another problem that one of the
reasons why people centralized stuff is
because they want to build for it so
when companies are creating products
around this stuff if we truly completely
decentralized and everything was
peer-to-peer nobody'd know that that was
happening and nobody could have make a
buck off of that so how do you see that
sort of tension happening where we do
want to get rid of centralization but we
don't want to not be able to charge for
it for instance I can comment on that so
in my opinion the telecoms of the future
are Google Facebook and the like the old
traditional telecom system is likely not
to stick around somebody didn't like
that
but but really I mean if you think about
it the reason phones are so successful
in there so prevalent is because I can
call anybody I have an ATT phone I can
call somebody and Verizon why can't I
call somebody from Google+ on from my
facebook account the whole concept of
Federation does not currently really
exist in a broadly accepted way and the
web and I think the reason is no one's
pissed I think if if if that I mean
that's something that if it was retro
actively imposed on not somebody color
pissed there we go I guess I don't I
don't I mean that's that's that's the
bit of I mean that's I think that's why
there's kind of this whole silo effect
going on but is Weber to see architected
to solve that problem is the issue it is
so yeah I mean it's certainly it's it
providing just a very base level of
technology as far as the communication
piece but in order to do in order to
actually you know connect the two you
need other technologies on top painting
the discoverability piece you need the
adjustability you need a strong identity
so you can say i am a google user you
can reach me at my google account that
sort of thing and that's so wherever she
is one of the pieces it's not it's not
all of it and the great thing about what
about CC is that it's enabling uh you
know all the web developers in the world
it's removing a huge number of barriers
from being able to actually innovate in
that space we've for too long we've had
you know desktop applications that have
you know i'll be able to I think the
discoverability side of things as well
as a big problem because right now it's
just sort of like you set up to the
developers and stuff like that and
there's there's so many ways to do it I
mean you could man nearly place these
blobs and stuff which is stupid but you
can do it but I mean there are ways that
we need to we need to look at how to
better solve those kinds of problems as
well like I mean pairing devices or
things like that so it's not always to
people that are trying to connect it
might be one person trying to connect to
devices so for example I might be want
trying to connect a mobile device to a
TV to remote control it discovery
mechanisms for that are going to be
incredibly different than connecting to
people who have full control over
processing can just join a chat room or
something yeah so those are the kind of
problems I want to see
solved in lamont and people are kind of
approaching that and there's a few
solutions with trying to replicate
things like Apple bungee and stuff in
the browser and requesting that from the
browser vendors but there's not been
significant traction on that yet but
sounds to me like there's going to be a
whole topology of applications like an
awful lot of websites can just put in
video chat to our tech support line all
right that'll be a trivial thing for
them to do because it's entirely through
their own stack then it's about getting
bigger and is that any issue that we
need are you trying to say that anymore
standards for the bigger to happen well
I mean these these things have existed
for quite some time xmpp is extremely
stable and extremely well used and it's
not something that web developers like
but they've they've gotten really good
at solving these problems there some
efforts in underway to specifically want
to Stan's iio which is basically the
attempt to make to give a clean
JavaScript API to XMPP and another one
is at XMPP FTW for the web and you know
in thinking of things like browser ID as
a potential alternative to identify you
know to be able to provide that strong
identity piece because once you have
that adjustability actually becomes
fairly simple in terms of once you know
how to reach you but release these
solutions all very heavy weight
solutions right all the XMPP you know
even if it has a nice JavaScript API one
day I think what Rob's talking about is
just saying well you know you've got two
devices next to each other you know can
they just make a little kind of chirp or
a little some video communication or
something like that to discover each
other I think we're kind of seeing
people approach those problems and very
very slightly at the moment like the
whole idea of using audio to connect a
device on Boris monster that are
ultrasonic demo right right yeah so
there's there's people already exploring
and potentially not exactly in this area
but there are solutions around right now
and we've got solutions for pairing
Bluetooth devices and stuff like that
like this methods and means I think we
just weed not seen people use them just
yet and we will as people start using
WebRTC beyond audio and video and that
will just come in time excellent we've
got a question wedding from David
actually from the audience
david sticker and then we'll go in a
techno Tasha's question and we see a
rise of security issue where people are
actually trying to open to many TCP
connection to web server and are
actually killing the web server by
opening two mini TCP connection so
people tend to actually remove
keep-alive to avoid this kind of issue
what do you think about web socket and
security for this kind of problem and
how can we solve this well I one of the
things that was put into this back
towards the end of its finalization of
the standard was a clarification on
what's the maximum upper bound on the
number of web sockets that can hit a
server at a time and it was unspecified
so we want to get that cleared and at
the time decision was made to not limit
it but also to add a caveat to that the
only one handshake could be outstanding
to the same target server at the same
time so from a browser invocation
standpoint you know spending up lots and
lots of web sockets in rapid succession
I would give the server an opportunity
to intercept and potentially detect
repeated attempts and therefore mitigate
that I in general I think that things
like speedy is an envelope as we touched
on earlier underneath these things tends
to mitigate some of that at the at the
physical TCP layer and also having
higher level abstractions on top of the
WebSocket going forward that's more of a
you know like a publish and subscribe or
an event-driven more architectural
approach to things allows you to
partition up the universe of address
ability so you don't just think of it as
connecting directly to the thing you
want to speak to just because that's the
end of the WebSocket once you're
attached to the architecture then you
can reach all murrieta services through
that same channel cool I think we're
having the next question is actually
quite high level about I plovar dizzy
particular Natasha if we can give you
that one thanks so this questions from
an anonymous and a bandwidth throttling
especially for multiple HD video streams
is extremely hard to do properly
is there any risk that WebRTC will vary
greatly by implementation I think most
likely I'm assuming this is about 121 is
one thing viewing 124 125 I think it
gets to be much harder and are we going
to see possibly you just fall over
because Firefox doesn't do it as well as
they chrome this this is actually my
opinions to two problems one is so for
example skype what they will do from
what I understand is they will elect the
kind of strongest connection it's not
just connections about the ability to
encode and decode video really quickly
so you need you know strong device and
strong connection to kind of be able to
serve as a rebroadcast ER and currently
there that's kind of part of the spec
but it's not really there yet like if
you take a media stream from one user
and attached it to another it just
doesn't work that's absolutely crucial
for the stuff to be able to be usable
for handle and kind of these other
interesting network topologies mesh is
only good for for so many because you're
uploading your video to each each person
that you're connected to and so is
everybody else so your upload bandwidth
becomes a huge bottleneck didn't you say
the WebRTC it doesn't throttle down so
yeah that there needs to be control
mechanisms for adjusting bandwidth them
that they just are not in place as far
as I can tell nothing I've tried has
worked well looks like my ex I actually
was working at a video conferencing
company and that was probably the
biggest aspect of our secret sauce was
to throttle bandwidth properly so if a
part is he isn't thinking about it it
seems like it's kind of heading for a
bit of a train wreck I don't think it's
not thinking about it I think it's just
the implementations aren't quite there
yet that's my impression there's there's
I've kind of raised it to some of the
Google folks who are working on this
stuff and that's kind of the answer I
get back it's like yeah we know this is
the thing we got to deal with and I mean
Google Hangouts they're well aware
there's a low bandwidth mode for that
and we need to be able to do the same
kinds of things without rira questing a
lower a smaller video size we need to be
able to kind of adjust them based on
quality and lost packets we're it's this
kind of problem as well it's a political
early the one-to-many kind of the
bandwidth problem is applicable in games
as well so where the background is from
my point of view but like if you're
building multiplayer games you quickly
going to overcome over that problem and
it's not something you can necessarily
avoid in that circumstance because you
have to be communicating out to these
multiple players in a game but there are
ways and like people have solved these
problems before and there are ways to
sort of reduce the amount of information
you're sending so for example in a game
you don't send updates for people that
aren't necessarily in your vicinity or
something like that so it's not always a
technology problem it's just a creative
way of thinking about how the data is
being sent to all the different people
are you sending it to the right people
there may be a hundred people in the
game but the might need be to that are
actually applicable and need the updates
that you're sending another sort of
separate point to that is I think we
might need to you know it's only the
very early days in terms of peer-to-peer
connections on the web so if you look at
you know historically you'd have clients
like Skype that are open for many hours
unstable you know internet you know
broadband connections what happens for
example on battery life on a mobile
device when you have suddenly you've got
four different connections and it's
sending the data four times sending the
video to four different plans and you
said earlier about strong peers is that
actually realistic on the web I mean our
web browser you know our tabs open long
enough for that to be realistic I don't
know the answer to these questions but
yeah it so it's a big push to I mean you
you have around 50 people connected here
all day long you using a WebSocket
connection and I mean let's see my
battery life I've got about twenty-five
percent left so I mean it's a it this is
the same thing I mean people are
connected they're using this protocol
all day long at this conference and you
know it's draining the battery so and
that's one to one to a server right what
happens if it's one too many with a
WebRTC right data curation well they
also takes a lot of power to encode and
decode video of that test and and to do
it with multiple people at the same time
so that's that's a huge drain on power
right there and I know my laptop fans
are going crazy when I'm testing with
like five people so the big problem this
seems to be back to the kind of
discussion this morning about images I
mean for real time data do we need to
change the way to delete data delivered
for someone who's battery concept
constrained versus in
no as PC yeah see the same thing I mean
for responsive video essentially again
this comes back to games like these kind
of problems are being solved in games in
the way you sort of throttle the
communication depending on the bandwidth
capabilities of each person and stuff
like that so there's a lot of lessons we
can we can take from things like games
and and this is why I'm so adamant on
not focusing so much on audio and video
although yes that is the use case right
now some of the problems that we're
approaching our are being solved on
being licked a in other areas i think
it's just interlinking the tomb and
trying to sort of combine them and come
up with a solution well I am surprised
that maybe is a web community we always
going to wring our hands a little bit
about saying everybody and inclusiveness
and so forth and sugar crush doesn't
give a damn about battery life right
they just like you want to play it then
just plug the damn thing in right and
now I'm not saying that's correct but
it's to a certain extent the Native
community kind of washes their hands of
this a little bit are we trying too hard
just saying I think enabling mobile is
really really really important because I
think yeah it's certain things don't
matter obviously like if you're playing
some hardcore game you're not going to
be sitting there forever maybe but it
does not take it into consideration when
these are the actual physical hardware
limitations that we're dealing with i
think is selling arsenal short yeah and
also i also think it's important that
you know you got things in place to
avoid accidentally doing right so we
want to make sure that developers aren't
accidentally draining their battery mean
if it's if it's a deliberate decision
that's one thing but if they just happen
to be on the end of a bandwidth
connection that's a little little less
capable you want to be able to react to
that I think we have week we're getting
the api's to play with this kind of
stuff as well known and actually i'm not
seeing people implementing this yet but
for example using the battery api and
actually if the battery level is at a
certain point changing the way your
communication story like that yeah yeah
my point by the way wasn't a serious
they say we don't care but to say it is
interesting that some apps don't care
and we just do seem to be a little
holier than now sometimes which is
actually good to have an aspiration
that's all I think that may very well
just be the difference between thinking
of it in a platform perspective versus
thinking of as
application perspective yeah okay okay
actually question were six of them
you've already answered I believe Steve
there has a question he needs a
microphone actually I think it was
robbed is actually just touched on this
WebRTC seems to focus more on the audio
video streams and data channels are a
special case shouldn't all peer to be
communication just be data streams where
the different data types can be
interpreted as appropriate I mean not
all peer-to-peer is how how do you mean
like should they all be the same legette
they're just data channels or most the
panel has just completely been talking
about audio and video but audio and
video are just a type of data right okay
it has specific characteristics and you
know why is the focus purely focusing on
those rather than just coming up with a
more generic dated him and I just get a
quick long one-liner I think it makes a
better demo which is why it's which is
why I landed first that's my opinion
it's also kind of special case in summer
in certain ways that you have to you
know you're trying to negotiate and cut
in encoding types etc but yeah I mean
fundamentally I agree with you I think
peer connections you're still doing the
same thing you establish a single
peerconnection you add and remove data
channels you add and remove video and
audio channels it's still one peer
connection at least that's the way it's
written in the spec so hopefully it's
actually yeah I don't good yeah I think
I mean generally yes they aren't they
are types of dated but the the media
streaming is incredibly different and
much more complicated than just sending
sort of basic data across so there is a
reason why they are separated but i
truly do think that the the data channel
side of thing like sending generic
non-auto non-video kind of data is where
WebRTC has an incredible amount of
strength from where we're not really
focusing on yet so right now we're not
exploring that too much but I'm very
interested to see how that is
and because audio in video yet is the
interesting thing and that's kind of why
WebRTC was created and that's the
exciting thing like imagine being able
to call skype from a browser that's
incredible use case but it's now where
do we take that technology and what's
next and I think the data channels is
where that's sort of hiding of course
the mean as far as I understand there's
some some thought of bringing in other
kind of media streams not just audio and
video you know what about you know
temperature information or sensor
information I think I don't know if
something's happening that I don't
really know but I've heard it mooted as
a possibility yeah well actually was one
comment I want to make which is that so
often we expect these specs to be
perfect and if they're not perfect we
can really upset at them and look how
bad the web is and so forth it shouldn't
we just maybe sit and get cut WebRTC and
maybe others a little bit of slack and
save me to your point what can we do as
a community to kind of exercise things
and then get some feedback what we do
just to do that yeah I mean definitely i
always suggest everybody in here if you
haven't start playing with this stuff
it's it's phenomenally just it's very
very night the word disruptive but it's
ridiculously disruptive technology like
I mean I I seriously built my own
telecom to call my mom with in Sweden I
mean come on like how I'm not supposed
to be able to do that and so this is the
kind of power that it provides you and I
would love to see everybody here really
get in on hacking on this stuff Steven
well I guess just on that on that that
last point just what you said there if
we can quickly pull the panel you say
this is awesome like what are the use
cases with the panel with the panel half
if you could each nominate a use case
for WebRTC of something cool that you'd
like to see that you think that this
technology enables excellent question we
just go through video copy yeah I mean
so like it would be cool if the remotes
that you guys are using like I said
earlier you could just pull up
getusermedia and you wouldn't have to
hand you a mic you know you could just
speak to your phone microphone and beat
broadcast so that would require like
hooking up to the AV here it would
require you know writing the code to
handle the binary data but yeah and then
there's like a lot of geolocation like
in room a geolocation like there's been
a lot of investments made in companies
doing this lately where you're actually
can find devices in the room with much
greater granularity using like you know
a geolocation API so with WebRTC you
could say okay I knew this I guess you
would have to have some centralized
mechanism but you could find out all the
people like the color blue and then you
would be able to pull up a video chat
with them in this room you know using
that newer technology so there's
complementary technologies I guess that
would be required for that use case but
that's an idea okay yeah I think just
enabling the the Internet of Things
machine of things kind of stuff I you
know because a lot of times with a
centralized model we assume that even
though these devices may be talking to
one another that they are actually able
to potentially mediate or coordinate
against some connected server system so
you know just not having to rely on that
always being around but still blending
these two worlds together seamlessly I
think that's a tough challenge to do
well but just raising the abstraction a
little bit so it makes these things easy
and get it out of the developers hands
for trying to solve all these complex
problems
I co Zayn we call these things I call it
the web of things missed out of the
internet of things because we think that
a lot of the challenges that we see in
trying to connect together those IP or
lower level protocols with WebRTC that
we don't actually see so much in the
WebSocket because it's web-centric is a
cheap I raising the bar a little bit and
connecting everything together at the
web level instead of thinking at the
internet so we say web of things cool I
would love to see Pierre distributed
rebroadcasting why couldn't I pull up my
my phone and and be able to stream
something just off my phone to the
entire internet if you have a proper
rebroadcasting ability where Pierre
could relay that feed you could
basically create that you could turn
every person on the planet with a
smartphone into a news reporter capable
of live broadcasts which is phenomenal
and that's again that's video and audio
but I think that particular ones really
interesting of course you could do the
exact same thing with any other type of
data examples she can't think weaning
off the top my head have been too
focused on the video stuff oh cool I've
got taming the simplest one is this
games and how that's going to completely
change now we've got UDP and unreliable
data but the second one is is the wipe
of things like these interconnected
devices in actually having the the non
human interaction and device is talking
to each other like that's where it gets
really interesting we have phones
powered by JavaScript the entire
operating system is written in
JavaScript that's incredible we now have
like Audrey know like devices powered by
JavaScript and stuff like that and how
how are things going to change and how
could we use WebRTC to interlink those
devices and what does that now allow us
to do that we couldn't do before using
web technologies that already are
interoperable with all of the other
things that we have available to us like
the hardware AP is and just all of the
other web AP ice that's where things at
very very interesting yeah I think I
would just reiterate that point I mean
it's it's enabling it's disrupting the
the control any and it won't when you
need a ultra-low latency connection
between two objects it's now possible
for web developers to build those things
so you know you have a control surface
for a quadrocopter or something you can
now build that in
web presence Nathan but is it going to
be an issue that not to me arduinos be
running chrome right now right so how do
we get WebRTC into these lower level
devices someone needs to build it okay I
mean he's only sure I was following what
you said because what you said is great
but there's no immediate way for us to
do that correct this is Rudy developers
right huh somebody can do it this is
partly why we're waiting for asking
about WebRTC on the server and things
like that like once you can get into
things like nodejs then then this is a
huge I think we have a few minutes left
and christopher has been patient will do
him and then I think you okay
Christopher you know that Christopher
sorry apologize if I sound like a broken
record but um as soon as you said
enabling technology I'm brought back
again to the idea of decentralizing the
solutions I mean you think of dissidents
dissidents oppression say in Arab Spring
and the potential that exists in the
phone to directly connect people without
a central network connection that isn't
possible or emergency response as
earthquakes hurricanes take out
centralized communications it seems like
the technology exists assault help solve
these communication problems because I
greatly just a comment I mean that's a
really interesting problem and that's
something I mean I'm not developed for
but I've been thinking about a little
bit and the whole idea of mesh creating
sort of mesh networks out of nowhere
using these technologies is incredibly
powerful like the ability to then spread
communication amongst adult global
network is crazy you have to get over
the the actual connecting the two
devices together problem but if we can
solve that than what you can actually do
with that is incredibly powerful it's
kind of like the only way you do that
now is to carry around some external
antenna with you with extra power supply
and create your own network I mean that
would have to be like standard issue
emergencies yeah I mean that's the day
but your phone cannot power that kind of
transmission and that kind of a
findability so you've been patient one
more question
see it doesn't seem that you need a web
browser in order to in order to have
WebRTC you could always do it through no
door through and JavaScript on chip
device right it's a simple matter of
programming just doesn't exist at the
moment there have been some efforts
there's actually a no-go Bertie library
they tend to bind to lib jingle and I
don't quite know status of that it
hasn't had much activity but I think
we've got the wrap up so thank you very
much if you like the session please give
us a vote and pretend you don't give us
a vote and and thanks whoever is writing
the script to do like 50 votes go ahead
and up that to a hundred awesome thank
you much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
