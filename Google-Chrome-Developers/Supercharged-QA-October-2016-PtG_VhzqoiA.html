Q&amp;amp;A on the view tube videos that we do
the most commonly occurring question
seems to be what code editor are you
using and I thought well I'll answer the
question it's fair enough but before I
do I just wanted to save for me it's not
a big deal I used to work in a former
life on servers and I'd get to one of
the servers and it would basically have
no le to whatsoever and I would just use
notepad and fix the thing so for me I
come from a place where it's just a way
to mess around with Cody I like it
fairly minimal I like it to kind of be
you know without bells and whistles I
suppose so with that caveat sort of said
let's actually have a look at what i'm
using now in my case I am using Visual
Studio code which i recently switched to
and which i think is it's brilliant i
love it let me show you around a couple
of things that I think are really good
about it let's say I've got this
sendevent function in my code if I say
new custom event or something like that
which is part of the web platform it
will tell me what I should be putting in
there so it says it's you know there's a
string that is the the name or the type
of the event that it is so i can just
the name of the event that's going to do
it and then i can use a dictionary for
other stuff that i need in there like
bubbles true and stuff so for me the
fact that it's you know going to sort of
start recommending what i should
actually put into these as parameters
for me that's a huge deal I think that's
incredibly helpful it saves me I'm too
often do reference type stuff all the
time the other things you see here I've
got the red red line under new and
that's because I've actually got a bunch
of extensions installed one of which is
es Linton fat let's just talk about the
extensions i have installed I have
editor config which is a very good way
of setting what the project's settings
are that you want to use so in my case
for this is the the supercharged code
that we do server and I the editor
config is fairly lightweight we indent
with spaces to spaces there's a little
fight that we can all have tabs versus
spaces whichever works for you the
character set you know trim trailing
whitespace and insert a final new light
so basically this is like project wide
things that I want to use so that's a
really handy little extension es lint is
the other one and that's why that code
is red because I basically do not use
new for side effects while I'm just
because I'm not assigned anything so
event equals that and then I can just
you know now it's saying you didn't use
event so there we go so i'll just send
that there you go and there's my
function actually finished that's the
that's really nice and now I know there
are no errors and so for me the linting
built-in linting and again you can get
that with virtually any to any editors
that's cool and then last I'll mention
the document list which for me is also a
nice little thing if I just do that then
it starts to fill in the the jas doc for
me there and it's saying Bram is that
but I would say it's a string so that's
fine sends a custom event you see how
grown up I'm being I'm documenting my
code what's wrong with that absolutely
nothing so there you go that is as much
as I actually have in my editor I mean
there are loads of other things as we
all know that you can add but for me
that's the minimal thing i like the
checking i like this sort of code
completion suggestions stuff that you
get and so i mean i recommend it but i'd
recommend item as well and sublime
they're all very good so pick whichever
works for you but thanks for the
questions hopefully now that puts that
one to rest i'll catch you probably with
Surma because he'll be showing up at
some point next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
