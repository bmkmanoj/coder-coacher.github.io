animations something the load browser
vendors have been working on recently
with this today we have trained Steven
who is working on specification as
chrome engineer and we have alex
commerce key who the program manager
who's right behind the open web and a
lot of different areas and he's working
with us on the red making stuff we also
have Brian burns from Mozilla who of
course is the guy behind a lot of
animation inside Firefox and as I just
wanted to talk a little bit about what
web animations is and it's the next
generation and it's coming to your
browser me you not just that very soon
you'll be able to try and eat your own
browser in fact today you can try to
leave the polyfill that we'll talk about
a little bit later in the program okay
so um the motivation the reason we're
actually doing this weight is because
right now we'd like to have the web
platform as powerful as all the rich
media applications that we've had before
like flash and Silverlight etcetera so
very similar to be a contender we need
synchronized animations we need cool
integration with media with video and
what here and we need a whole lot of
different things and so maybe then and
it looks like our hangout as completely
died but that's okay it is my laptop
swinging I thought I press quite so
might still be okay all right so how do
we tell if we're actually on it we don't
know but that's the idiom forecasting
live things go wrong so any case the web
animations specification is being
developed inside a joint task force
between the CSS working group and the
SVG working group and every browser
vendors behind it at dobbies behind it
Mozilla's behind it pretty much w else
is behind it and we're hoping to see it
natively implemented within Chrome and
Firefox sort of sometime towards the
middle of next year starting the work is
starting now so I just like to cover a
few things about how this animation
stuff works so Shane should we talk
about the model the like people when
they think of animations they probably
think CSS animations I think SVG
animations but what we're trying to do
is unify these two together
what we have is we have a split model
where we have a tiny engine and we have
an animation engine and the idea is that
the tying engine can let you
declaratively generate animations or use
javascript to create animations or even
CSS syntax to create them and then the
actual animation engine itself is inside
the browser and drives everything just
like magic now the thing about the
design of the internal animation engine
that will sit inside the browser is it's
designed to be compatible with CSS
animations and transitions and it's also
compatible with smile animation in SVG
which a lot of people are familiar with
so Shane can I just ask you like what
kind of the primary benefit of having a
separate timing engine from an animation
in July how does that actually help with
the developer like what's what's the
rationale me a sign language is there a
rational yeah I guess if there's a few
benefits one of the things is that it
keeps the model very simple and easy to
understand and you have your timing
phase and that gives you your timing
values and that disputes into the
animation phase and um because the two
are separate you can reason about what's
going on with timing separate from
what's going on that animation and that
allows us to provide more sorts of
powerful effects um Brian might have
some things to add as well about why
we've just added to this range yes
thanks um and welcome demetria's owned
by our chariots and see they've been in
to do I know I meet your cell phone make
sure you tell wow thanks Oh in it so one
of the big ones it means you can
completely wrong with pooja example
animation part and just use the timing
part and that lets your example and I
made anything you like you could emanate
canvas you could animate audio and
absolutely anything but you can still
reuse the tiny features of the model um
with your own animation component so you
can get all the benefits of frame rate
independent animation in reversing and
sequencing in all of that
and you can apply to anything you like
so it gives you a lot of flexibility and
the reverse is true know you could feed
in your own timing and reassess the
animation part well well that's
excellent so now another thing I know
Brian you've worked on a lot of
animation with SVG in Firefox and um one
of the names of the model of course was
to get these two to work together so do
you do you see this is as having been
achieved what do you think there's still
a lot of work in that area yeah I mean
there's still a lot of work to do in
general I think I'm optimistic that we
can actually achieve that we still have
a lot of work to go in terms of
specifying some of the detail of how the
to map onto the model but the feature
set of the model for example is very
much based on the features available in
SVG and CSS plus one or two extra things
that you think are critical at least
from the feature set point of view we
shall be all right and also I've been
working with the CSS script for example
to change some details about how
rounding is done to make sure the two
models are going to be compatible in
some of those areas as well so yeah
optimistic we can do it but still a lot
of detail to work out descriptors oh um
introduce Dimitri perinovsky who's of
course the author of Raphael but a lot
of people use for animation in web pages
now to make sure you are representing
adobe of course and one of the things
that the day we used to have you know
pusher quite a lot of splash and what we
find with html5 is the feature set just
doesn't support flash doll animations so
um I know you're pushing to make sure
that the model works so doing a kind of
perspective from adobe's point of view
about whether you're backing web
animations do you think this is a good
future direction for browser civilian
sir well obviously web animation
animation in general is very important
part of the web and if we know where the
flesh was one of the main
animation points were while on the web
and nowadays the CSS animations and no
script animations taking part taking
like esta fate of the flesh and adore
being particularly interested in to now
making this things whether creating
maybe tools for developers again to make
things better and generally supporting
this standard in particular very much
because well the animations as I said is
very important part of the web cool all
right now like what I'd like to do now
is actually show a screencast the cost
which shows you web animations actually
in action like doing doing something
cool Brian do you think you'd be able to
talk us through that while it's running
sure I'll just um maybe I should use it
in the browser that's working just give
me one man I'll get this so you're doing
that i should mention this is the
october video of animation so things
have changed since then some of the
names and things like that so i don't
use it as a reference for fractional
coding butter hopefully you can see some
of the concepts
I can see something there okay so if we
select that window we'll go back to the
start and this way okay so this is just
a example of a very simple animation we
create and in this case any object
that's now an animation object say what
element it's going to apply to and then
just described the animation just in
this case translate it minus 60 pixels
so you can see the wave they're just
move to the left then having created
that we can tweak the timing parameters
of it make a little faster in this case
and play it again and they're not just
another simple example again I'm going
to make an animation object and target
it at the Sun and this time we'll rotate
it fair let's just give that a try also
the point 5 is the duration just half a
second now we can of course change all
those tiny properties in this case we're
going to set the iteration count to
infinite and the animation will just
keep playing I forever a few more simple
examples here and this case we're going
to open the door it's same as I've seen
before but this time it's applying to
actually HTML using a 3d transform which
is not available on CSS and SVG yet and
then we're acquiring some timing
functions to the animation so users in
it's a little hard to see in the video
but you can see the the rate of change
and then we can now place it as well so
that's just using features of the timing
model
in this case we're going to try to
synchronize some different effects so
I've got a door closed animation and
I've got another animation that tilts
the picture we'll put them into a
sequence group and what it does is runs
one animation and in the next and we can
actually make quite sophisticated and
arrangements of sequencing in this case
we've got three animations the door
closes and at the same time the picture
tilton is a half of dust from the door
and we can tweak the different timing
properties within those groups so that
the puffs of dust actually occurs sorry
the window tilted moment later the next
thing is demonstrating the separation of
the timing model in the animation model
and in this case what we're going to do
is we're going to provide a JavaScript
function as the animation function so we
won't use the usual behavior of this
setting a property in this case will
write a function that produces a sound
as the animation plays so you can use
the animation to actually do anything I
guess you can't hear it because I'm
speaking too loudly ugh or alex is not
speakers not near the microphone but you
can then put that custom animation the
audio into an animation group just like
a regular animation and you can reverse
the audio and joking that adjust the
timing function on the group just
reusing the whole timing model finally
there's a little demonstration here in a
feature called templates and that's
something that we're just investigating
at the moment as to whether it will
include that in the first version of the
spec or not but I basically it lets you
define an animation once and then apply
it to a whole range of elements I'm
putting all of those features together
you can see um we can sequence the whole
thing in quite a sophisticated way and
especially if you could hear the audio
you can experience some of the power of
the model where all of this time it
applies and not only to the animation
but to the idea as well so next look
that's really cool I guess everybody
who's watching is probably thinking how
is this even possible like how could we
like mangle this stuff happened when we
haven't got it in browsers yet well of
course that's because we have a polyfill
we have a young a JavaScript shim that
actually shows us how this works if
you're out what you need to do who is my
partners to be my video anymore but you
can see this beautiful URL link right go
to that link inside who taught GL's
flash ID cuddle 0 X D and go there and
there's a missile the JavaScript spores
to the people miss the polyfill for this
stuff you'll be able to try it out and I
just wanted to ask Alex who's just next
to me um you're kind of pushing a lot of
the stuff in crime other than modern you
know and web features like um have you
see a native implementation of this
going versus the polyfill that we've
built an experiment with so the great
thing about a polyfill is it allows real
web developers to provide feedback about
the actual API which is great because if
you're just expecting this thing as a
mailing list it's very hard to
understand how the developer usability
will be at practice and then once we
developers use this and give us some
feedback on it helps us have more
confidence than what we implement the
browser will be the thing that that what
does want to want to use for the years
to come that's really important step to
use the polyfill cool all right well we
encourage everyone to go and play with
an experiment and we've got a few
questions that are we had am you've got
a bunch of questions out that people are
curious about to do with this stuff so I
will just tell those right so first
question could SVG based animation be
generated real time in the browser and
is there any program for it well who
knows about SVG ha that's a little bit
Dimitri would you like to
no okay well that's a release it's
probably yes yes because basically these
the whole owner of a brave animations
spec is to be able to allow you to you
know write JavaScript that generates
animation objects and then applied
refugee content I think the answer this
is pretty much an unequivocal yes it is
there's a motion about animations today
or innovations with illumination
something / animations with the web
animations so yes so rather than having
to create nodes and insert you know
creating an animation though with
JavaScript and inserting in the tree
which you do today you could actually
just use the JavaScript API that
connects to the model and this will all
work but possibly even better than that
you'll be able to define fragments of
animations using the SVG declarative
syntax and then hook those together in
novel ways in real time Louisiana
javascript in yeah cool next one yes
actually I've been working on a project
that does just that um it's not a panna
cotta animation project where it
generates SVG animations in the browser
um but yeah we're the tape your honor
that would be a lot easier to realize so
yeah you can do it already but we hope
it will get easier cool maybe you maybe
you could even create animations to an
SVG and then apply them to something
else wired Jastrow VPI you could upload
a new HTML pregnant right you already
again well like this next question this
is an interesting one would it make
sense having animated animations for
example animate the animation duration
by using the Heron from a parent element
then you can slow down or speed up a
keyframe loop or make it dynamic with
JavaScript um so we want to support some
of those features like being able to
slow down and speed up animations
dynamically unfortunately if you if you
start to animate animations you run into
all sorts of performance issues and it's
really hard to make your animations move
nice and smoothly on the web environment
so yeah look for some limited versions
to some of these features but maybe not
full-blown animation of elevation yeah
that's that's very good point one of the
key design principles of this
specification is that we can hardware
accelerate so
to be able to have our Explorer 8
effectively you need to be able to
predict the future and program your hard
work and do it and so if you're
modifying the animation with another
animation that makes it a lot trickier
but it still looks like it could be fun
if you do it well as crazy aunt Leigh
well that's crazy things all right the
third question is I like to know well so
we all okay now I don't know how I to
answer that so I might just not answer
it very well anyway okay so another
question here and how to speed up
animations requestanimationframe the
polar ish and described as a mass little
tricky but I want to know if to the
animation will be faster in canvas SVG
web GL or simply html5 now this is a
tough one we were the parents room it
depends though the answer is it depends
it's a very good answer like Brian would
you like to maybe comment on this really
oh no no no yeah I guess most browsers
are going to optimize particularly for
HTML and canvas at this stage so yeah
it's going to depend on the
implementation to a large degree what
but particularly the more could um you
can do declaratively that is the more
you can do for example using CSS
animations rather than script then the
more opportunities there are two for the
browser to accelerate it so I guess
that's probably the better way to think
about it yeah so in world where you
didn't even have requestanimationframe
what you might have done is to a set
timeout but then that means that was a
bad pattern because it meant that if
you're if the you might be doing too
much work or too little work to get the
innovation look right in a World War II
declaring your animations using this
kind of syntax that means we could make
it go as fast as we as we can in the
browser like it naturally goes faster if
we optimize those cases for you later as
opposed to sort of locking in the frame
rate yeah and it also means that the
browser makers can continually improve
performance of animation
like release new versions of the browser
that you know speeds up existing
animations we know about without your
changing alone in JavaScript or that it
yeah that's a huge amount is there are
of course certain properties that will
be faster de Mme so for example CSS
transforms which master enemy it often
then changing the top and left
properties in the math lesson books and
forces layout yeah right exactly I wish
I'd add to that one thing which is even
if you you must use script with this API
we're proposing and you still avoid a
lot of the work to the browser and so
it's still I is potentially faster than
writing it all yourself because you're
offloading so much to the browser even
though it's not purely declarative so to
speak and it's potentially faster than
writing a script it's basically you have
you have a couple layers of couple
layers so make things faster just things
that things are happening on the browser
level which makes things faster just
like Bayern mentioned already six faster
than JavaScript code then if you could
have the declarative animations which
you could juggle inside your JavaScript
code which uses the API then it's still
happening on the browser level and we've
sprayed existing animations which could
be optimized on the hardware level this
makes sense given pasta and all you
could just go with all good declarative
animations for everything if you can't
do at the moment but you can any be
clear go animate something that you
can't forget if you want in the way you
want so it's it's like a couple of
levels and the worst case scenario just
write everything making the cord and it
will still be faster than whatever you
could code right now in JavaScript bra
cool all right one last question before
we go and the question is could SVG
based animation be generated real-time
in browser and is there in program for
it I think it's actually the top
question we asked the beginning so in
fact that's a deuca all right well
thanks everyone for listening and thanks
everyone for being here this was great
to actually bounced around a bit of the
info about this stuff please try the
polyfill machine but remember go and
download it experiment with it you can
do an animation to
in fact this afternoon you can go and
put together a web page try it out play
with the API go to the w3c site to look
at the draft specification and provide
us feedback and look forward to sending
people using it out in the wild but
thank you Alex thanks Shane Thank You
Dmitry thank you Brian thanks for coming
and which I'll see you later it's likes
ya later on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
