season of the develop diary the first
one I built the chrome dev summit site
this time I'm going to be building a
video media app so expect things like
chromecast support expect things like
adaptive streaming expect things like
service workers and offline me there's
going to be loads clearly there's going
to be loads but what I thought I'd do in
this particular entry is just show you
around the design so in the past little
while I've been working on the designs
I'm not a designer so I just sort of
play it design and I'm now going to show
you what I designed so there we go
that's me that's what I do apparently
right on my screen then let's have a
look what we've got we have let me show
you this actually this is quite
interesting right I mean I think it's
quite interesting I guess you do too
because you've got this far into the
video right these are the icons now you
might be like why is he got so many
icons the answer is this top one is kind
of greeny turquoisey one that's what I'm
currently going with as bird like the
default icon probably the one that gets
added to the homescreen on the
homescreen and then below it this purple
one let me explain ah the problem is the
turquoise II Green is what if you get
some poster frame for video that's like
art really orangey or just a really
different colors and that would really
clash with that turquoise so I thought
well I take although we'll just change
the color scheme of the site the icons
and everything else to just match so
I've been working on some code which
I'll show you soon that does the thing
called median cut which is just a way of
slicing and dicing the colors from an
image so that you get a representative
palette a representative sample from
that image it's not that complex to
understand or even to do but it seems to
work out pretty well anyway so I saw if
the album arts picture post frame I
don't know what to call it it's got
loads of different oh it's a picture
that represents a video
is this purpley one here which looks to
be the Millennium Bridge in London
looking of simples Cathedral if it's
that then it's more purpley one inning
to the icons purpley then this flamingo
that is not doing the flamenco but if it
was it will be a flamingo doing a
flamenco this bright orange flamingo
that gives us this kind of orangey look
bottom one arguably should be a bit
bluer but the code came up with these
kind of grayish colors so that's what I
can top to work for for now I might be
probably adjust the code as it goes
through anyway
icons they are going to adapt to the
content of the site so what does the
actual site look like well this is what
it looks like on desktop let me zoom in
for you here since our fall too far back
it up moving out right at the top you
can see there's the icon there's
basically a featured video with a big
play button in the middle like this is
the one that I think you should watch
and it's not right corner if I do sign
I'm not sure if I'm going to need to or
want to or you know see how it goes
there isn't a big me too but it's an
opportunity for me to try using the
credentials API so that seems like a
good thing to do anyway we'll see how it
goes
if you tap on your little avatar picture
you get you know a menu there we've been
managing your downloads and your history
and stuff like up star rating the name
of the episode so the show and then the
episode underneath it underneath that
we've got some new releases there's sort
of thumbnails for those whether or not
you watch the particular one star rating
for some reason I only bother putting in
the duration on the left-hand one
obviously I was having a lazy day
because really it should be on all of
them oh well so below that we also have
a kind of marketing Yee area because
again if you're going to build a media
app you kind of want to be like hey you
should you know add to homescreen O's
and be awesome and then below that
there's just can't even put the
thumbnail didn't even put some nails in
I just dropped in a grid placeholder for
his more contents gonna go here and
then a footer at the bottom so fairly
fairly straightforward let me see what
else is worth showing you because you
can go offline there's a version here
where we've said show me only the
downloaded ones only and then we gray
out any that you can't play and we put
this banner at the top it's like I'm
only showing you the downloaded ones if
you want to see all your videos switch
off that so that grows out yep all the
ones that you can't see mobile there's
yeah mobile is actually not so let me
just open up properly mobile is not
vastly different really to the desktop
when I design I tend to design desktop
first because it means that I think
about everything that needs to go in
there and then I think about how to fit
that appropriately into a mobile space
rather than starting mobile and adding
features in because I think that could
be quite frustrating for people they
like but you can do them on the desktop
why can't I do that on the phone so that
tends to be how I I do the design
I actually build mobile first but I
design desktop first whatever right what
else can I show you oh the video player
the actual video player that's where all
the fun stuff is probably gonna be
hiding I imagine this is what it looks
like and we could zoom that down a
little bit a bit big so we have video
playing there's a close button as a
skipping back and forwards by 30 seconds
and I see how that feels in my 30
seconds might be a bit too much I don't
know
pause play big one in the middle but
also a small one if your thumbs down in
the bottom corner you might want to just
tap that a time slider scrubbing things
there so that means further into the
video volume control that one may or may
not pan out because on a mobile you tend
to I think do you tap that button would
you or would you just use the phone's
volume I think you probably the phone's
volume so I'm not sure about that one
full screen again on something like iOS
you probably have full screen by default
if you tap on a video I'm pretty sure
that's what it does still does whereas
other ones might be inline playback
again we'll see how that goes taking the
video making that available offline is
grand and then a chromecast button going
to be fun
adding chromecast support is actually
there I think there are two ways to do
it which is interesting because I think
there's the presentation API and then
there's the remote playback API Wow
we've got fun stuff to come anyway so
that's playing videos so hopefully you
see the kind of thing that I'm trying to
build it's you know think of any video
playback service like video on-demand
playback service it's that kind of app
basically cool right I'm going to stop
it there because I don't want to take up
too much of your time I think in the
next entry what I want to do is I want
to talk a little bit more about video
formats and just what I've discovered so
far about how video playback can be done
it's it's interesting it's definitely
much more involved than I thought it was
going to be uh-huh see them hey folks if
you're upset that this video has
finished don't worry there's more there
about here and you can click on them and
then they'll start and then they'll be
more video and at the end of that you'll
probably see me at the end going if
you're disappointed that this video is
finished then there's more and you can
do that all day every day or if you
decide to not do that all day every day
and you want to subscribe there's a
button kind of Hira should click and
then you'll always get notified when we
put stuff on the channel aha
