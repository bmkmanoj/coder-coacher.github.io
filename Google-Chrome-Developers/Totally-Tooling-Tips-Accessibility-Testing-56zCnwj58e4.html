good it's good did you get a haircut
I did a haircut new accent new new new
look you feel it's good it's good you're
looking better than before you feel
better than before
you're not mad I am NOT no hi I'm Rob
Dodson I'm a developer advocate on the
chrome team sure Rob just just sell sell
yourself I mean hello and also uh you're
selling stuff also host a little show on
the chrome Developers YouTube channel
called alley cast world-renown is that
what we're calling it yes well world
renowned I see people around the world
have renowned it I think okay all right
believe what you want to believe but
today we're gonna be talking about
accessibility audit Angley right
what is your workflow for that look like
yeah so over here on my laptop I've got
a site that I've been working on this is
called lifestyle it's got some cool like
hipster photos and stuff like that
people have styles of the accessible and
famous all right yeah and what I usually
do when I'm you know working on
improving the accessibility of a site is
I will use the new audits panel in
chrome dev tools which is very very nice
if you go to create a new audit you'll
see that you've got like a number of
options inside of there so you could
look at PW anus best practices etc one
of the topic areas is accessibility so
you can just go run just an
accessibility audit if you don't you
don't feel like doing the other tests
here's one that I ran against the page
and it's doing pretty okay right it's
got on anyone not so bad but there's
definitely a few issues that we need to
fix and in particular one that I see a
lot is is color contrast so you've got
your your your foreground text maybe is
a little too light on the background
color one of the nice things that we can
do with the audits panel is we can
actually dive in and we can see which
elements specifically have failing
contrast so here I can see that I've got
this like product card price element and
if I click on that and stretch this out
a little bit you can see it'll take me
over to my elements panel and I can
actually scroll in to view the actual
element that is failing just
this price right y'all nice and it
already selects the domnode for you
that's cool yeah and so one of the
things that's really helpful is you know
really this is this allow me to sort of
quickly identify this node but one of
the things we're working on which is
over here in Chrome Canary right now is
actually a color picker that will make
it a little bit easier for you to fix
those contrast issues so if you're in
something like Chrome Canary you can go
into Chrome colon slash slash flags you
can look for the word developer tools
experiments oh you're in flags and
experiments you look like to live
dangerously oh yeah oh yeah so
dangerously so we enable the developer
tools experiments right we step into the
future it'll refresh our browser for us
we can go back over here pop up in as
the dev tools click on this little
Settings menu
good where it says experiments da da and
here we can see we've got accessible the
inspection as well as color contrast
ratio line so let's see what that does
so we'll go find that same node that was
giving us problems over here inspect it
and then we can see in our Styles panel
I got a little color swatch and click on
that and you'll see that there's this
little line inside of my color palettes
this is actually a sea mmmmm-hmm this
was actually telling us like where are
our colors needs to be in order to have
sufficient color contrast so since we're
above the line we get this little
warning that says we've got a little
contrast I happen to know that this is
not like the final look for this piece
of UI it's still being iterated on but
it'll be something like this where
you've got a line and you can sort of
tell which side is the good side of the
bad side so I can actually just drag
this below the line that warning goes
away you can see over here it's also
like updating my element live in the
document and it'll sort of tell me what
the good color contrast ratio is so I
can just grab that value right off here
and then go back and just fix it in my
CSS that's pretty neat so I was trying
this out the other week and something
that occurred to me was that you know if
if you use a developer realize that the
contrast is a little bit off do you need
to go back to your designers at that
point and say well is this okay for our
brand and
thing is that's when they should be
factored in earlier on in the process I
ideal yeah like this is there's there's
definitely other design tools out there
there's I think there's plug-ins for
sketch and things like that which will
also help you look at the color contrast
for your designs and make sure things
are not too low contrast anytime you can
catch that earlier in the process make
sure all the designers are on board and
all the stakeholders are on board and
and that sort of like makes it easier
when those things come downstream for
folks to implement it and it doesn't
kind of like a contentious issue or
anything cool that's that's awesome
the house audit also had some other
accessibility stuff in there as well
right so it had contrast no I was
highlighting all the tributes to alt
attributes yep yep so yeah if we go back
to that report let's see here so yeah a
few of the things that that this site
was failing it's missing some alt
attributes we've got form elements that
don't have associated labels the big
problem there is you land on a control
and maybe it says that it's a button but
it doesn't tell you what kind of button
right is it the you know sin my social
security number to hackers button I
don't want to click that button right I
want to make sure that I'm clicking the
right kind of controls I know what I'm
interacting with we've got over I think
32 tests or maybe even over 35 tests in
in the lighthouse accessibility checker
here and under the hood these tests are
all based on a library called axe core
which is made by some folks at a DQ so
yeah we we work at the axe core library
we leverage to the test from inside of
it and we sort of integrated into dev
tools you can hop around and inspect the
notes real quick that's awesome so this
is great again for locally checking on
your accessibility issues what about CI
and continuously monitoring your
accessibility is there a story for that
too yeah absolutely so the the
lighthouse library itself can be used as
a standalone node module so you can pull
that into your CI process if you want to
do that or alternatively you could use
the axe core library that is powering
these tests and you could use that
standalone the the nice thing there is
you can sort of decide which
accessibility tests you want to turn on
or off depending on sort of the criteria
that you're trying to meet very cool so
we've got lots of great tooling for
accessibility auditing what about docks
or education
material yes we have that as well so if
you go to developers.google.com/live
Sunda mental slash accessibility we have
a whole section there on getting started
with accessibility for the web and it
also includes links to our Udacity
course so that's like a multi-week kind
of hands-on experience where you
actually like build stuff and watch a
bunch of videos and kind of get up to
speed on accessibility very cool yeah I
feel like my lifestyle is more
accessible already yeah cool yeah thanks
for having me today
yeah thanks for coming down awesome yeah
people should check out ala cast oh yeah
oh yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
