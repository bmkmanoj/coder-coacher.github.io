natural not to know the width of an
element after all you're supposed to
respond to the different sizes of your
users screens however sometimes it is
desirable if not required that the
element maintains a certain aspect ratio
CSS does not yet have a way to give an
element an inherent aspect ratio so this
is a problem but we can work around this
with a little trick when you set padding
top of an element to percentage value
that percentage is relative to and now
brace yourself the parents width the
white of the parent the more padding top
as counterintuitive as this might seem
it comes in incredibly handy for solving
our aspect ratio problem to make our
element keep an aspect ratio we said
padding top to the inverse of the aspect
ratio in percent you can do the math
yourself or make use of CSS calc
expressions our element will now
maintain its aspect ratio huzzah the
astute viewer however will have noticed
that despite all the math a padding is
still a padding and will push down the
content of our element to counteract
that we have to add a little repellent
that can negate the padding effect and
we're done
nobody likes adding wrappers but
sometimes there is no other way he went
some you lose some see you next time
we've all been here before
there's the chrome there's last video
you should click it go
I'm not gonna stop until you click</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
