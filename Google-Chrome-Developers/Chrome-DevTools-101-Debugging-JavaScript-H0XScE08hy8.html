find and fix JavaScript issues you might
be spending more time debugging than you
need to this tutorial shows you how to
make the most of chrome dev tools so
that you can debug your JavaScript as
quickly as possible I'm going to use
this buggy demo here to demonstrate all
of the debugging tools and dip tools I
recommend that you open up this demo
yourself and follow along with each step
the link is in the description whatever
issue you're debugging you always want
to start by reproducing the issue you
want to find a series of actions that
consistently reproduces the book in this
demo when I add five and one the result
down here at the bottom is 51
obviously that should be 6 this is the
bug that I need to check down at this
point you might be tempted to use
console.log to infer where the code is
going wrong sure it may get the job done
but it's rather inefficient first you
have to find the relevant code which
could take a while on a big code base
then you have to sprinkle constant log
statements throughout the code then you
got to reload the page and look at the
logs but maybe the logs didn't give you
all the information you need so you got
to go back and add more logs and so on
with dev tools you can pause the code in
the middle of its execution inspect the
variables that are in scope at that
moment in time and walk through your
code one line at a time
open dev tools by pressing command
option J on Mac or ctrl shift J on
Windows and Linux then click the sources
tab the sources panel is where you debug
JavaScript it has three main parts at
the top left here is the file navigator
pane where you can inspect the files
that the page uses after clicking on a
file you can see the contents of it here
in the code editor pin and down here is
the JavaScript debugging pane which
you'll learn more about shortly note
that when your dev tools window is wide
the JavaScript debugging pane moves to
the right if you take a step back and
think about how the app works it's
probably safe to guess that the
incorrect sum gets computed in the click
event listener that's associated to the
button therefore you want to pause
code right when the eventlistener
executes event.listen their breakpoints
let you do exactly that
expand the eventlistener breakpoint
section then expand the mouse category
then check the click check box dev tools
now pauses on the first line of any
click event listener that executes back
in the demo click the button again and
dev tools pauses on the first line of
this on-click function the blue
highlight indicates what line of code
you're currently paused on if you're
paused on a different line of code press
resume script execution until you're
paused on the correct line you paused on
the wrong line because you have a Chrome
extension which registers click event
listeners on every page that you visit
if you try the workflow I'm describing
in an incognito window you can see that
you always pause on the correct line of
code event listener breakpoints are just
one type of a breakpoint dev tools
offers many other types for example you
can set a breakpoint on a specific line
of code or when a Dom node changes or
when an exception gets thrown and so on
after this tutorial I recommend checking
out our breakpoints guide which teaches
you when and how to use each type the
link to that guide is in the description
too I'm paused in the click listener and
now I want to execute the code one line
at a time the code stepping control is
right here let you do that click the
step into next function call button to
investigate a function further for
example when I step into the inputs our
empty function it jumps me to the first
line of that function when I'm confident
that a function is working as expected
I can click the step over next function
call button the function executes but I
don't walk through it line by line for
example if I click to step into the next
function call this line here would be
highlighted blue meaning this is where
I'm currently paused but when I click
step over next function call the
function executes to completion and I
pause them the next line of the function
that I'm currently stepping through last
suppose I'm stepping through a function
and I realize it's not relevant to my
bug in that case I can press step out of
current function and dev tools executes
the rest of the function if this doesn't
make complete sense right now
I recommend creating a snippet which is
a little block of JavaScript code that
you can execute at any time set a
breakpoint and your snippet and play
around with the code stepping controls
yourself in order to understand how they
all work back in the script I can tell
that the bug is probably somewhere in
the update label function rather than
stepping through a bunch of irrelevant
code I can set a line of code breakpoint
right around where the bug probably
occurs to do that I just click the line
number next to the code this blue icon
indicates that there's a breakpoint on
this line when I press resume script
execution dip tools runs all the code up
until that lime and then pauses before
that line executes over here in the
JavaScript debugging pane I can see the
call stack that caused this code to
execute I can click on the functions to
see where each one got caught the scope
section shows me all the local and
global variables that are currently
defined at this moment in time I can
click on values to edit them but I'm not
going to do that right now however when
I look at these values they look
suspicious they're wrapped in double
quotes which means that their strings
this could be the cause of the book I'm
going to investigate this further over
in the watch expressions section here I
can watch the values of variables over
time you can store any valid JavaScript
expression here for example I click Add
expression then type type of sum then
press enter and I can now see the value
of that expression as I suspected sum is
a string when it should be an integer
now I'm going to open up the console to
test out a potential fix for the book
when I'm paused on a line of code the
console has access to all the variables
that are currently in scope for example
when I evaluate addend 1 it returns 5 I
think I can fix this bug by converting
the addend 1 and adding two variables
two integers before adding them so let
me try that now yep that fixes it I can
verify that this change fixes the bug by
editing the code directly from dev tools
first I'll resume script execution then
make my change
save the change I press command s on Mac
or ctrl s on Windows and Linux
then I click deactivate breakpoints so
that I can test out the app without
triggering the breakpoints I've set now
the app sums up numbers as expected all
right you now have an excellent
foundation and how to effectively debug
JavaScript using dev tools from here I
recommend learning about all the
breakpoints that dev tools has to offer
as I mentioned before we also have a
JavaScript debugging reference where you
can learn about literally every feature
related to debugging in dev tools links
to both are in the description thanks
for watching and happy bug hunting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
