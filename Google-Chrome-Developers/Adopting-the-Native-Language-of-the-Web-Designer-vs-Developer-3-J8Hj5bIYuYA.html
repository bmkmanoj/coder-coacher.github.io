influenced by the world of graphic
design in that the language that we use
so it's just like above the fold came
from the print world and it does feel
like we're getting back to that
restrictive and space again especially
like with like native dresses web and
all these other to me meaningless
debates when it's like we ignoring user
experience I mean what's your ex what's
your feelings on some of these are like
language being influences and where we
are right now in the industry in terms
of like influence so I feel like we've
gone from a world where we took our
language and our inspiration from print
yeah and that we applied those
constraints of the web to a world now
where we're taking our language and our
constraints from naked apps and we're
applying that to the web and what I'd
love for us to do is to end up in a
world where we have language and ideas
that are native to the web itself that
embrace the fact of the web is hypertext
not just aid another way to build native
apps one of the projects my team works
on is the progressive web app directory
and we've been trying to collect a lot
of people's progressive web apps and
capture metrics currently lighthouse
calls but we have plans to bring in
other metrics and when you see a few
hundred PWS all in one placing it goes
through the law you start to see common
conventions design patterns you are
exactly such as damn burger menu so the
hamburger menu is a classic one where
it's in there even though most people
are natives the native app world are
looking at them saying well actually
we're taking key functionality in our
app and we're hiding there with no users
and we're discovering people can't find
it but if you've seen you will redesign
to go away from the hamburger menu if
you look at say the YouTube app yeah
we're going to interfaces that expose
the functionality make it discoverable
make it obvious and I feel like for the
web we have to go through that same
process but I can't just be following
the tail lights of maker
it has to be saying if I'm building
something for the web it has to be
responses because on the web the same
URL can be seen on a voyage iPhone all
the way to a 30-inch monitor and so it's
doubled respond and progressing with a
directory is guilty of this we are
working on fixing it we end up with a
world where it looks firing your phone
but on your massive desktop monitor
there's a little bit of functionality
swimming in an ocean of whitespace yeah
I mean do you feel that we're abandoning
responsive website because it felt like
for a while maybe 10 years ago
feels like the revelation of grids and
that we're designing for that we're
designing in the wrong way so hence
producing the wrong thing so fixed pixel
became like you know abandoned but do
you feel that responsive web design is
now being abandoned because we're
following like a very strong native
pattern as opposed to following the web
so I think yes but it's the weird thing
is we now have the tools to do
responsive really well we had the
understanding and just as we're getting
to that it's become something that's
boring
people aren't doing it that's all going
well actually has an adaptive solution
or here they think that assumes we're
going to have a mobile dot on MDOT site
that's going to be very apt like and
then we'll have some legacy thing for
the desktop and yeah it is it does feel
like an abandonment of the responsive
design but we don't have something to go
to instead and I feel like we stole when
we think about designing for the web
we're still stuck in what our tools give
us so if I told assume we design with a
bunch of static images a set of static
screens yeah we're stuck in that box
whereas we should be thinking what are
the content what is the sub screen
module what is the thing that we want
the user to do on all of these screens
how does the user get from this page to
this page to this page notice i'm using
print language yep because i can i say
page to page and people know i mean like
if they screen to screen and people
think I'm talking about link to that yes
but we don't have a thing that is native
to the web probably my favorite example
of something anybody
did about this the PhD thesis by guy
called Tom tomorrow okay and it tries to
tell us that if you want to make an
argument in a hypertext environment you
can't assume the users going to start at
the beginning at your front page and
then linearly go through it they're
going to come in at some arbitrary point
and you've got to give them multiple
paths to get to all of the relevant bits
of the argument and since his work 15 16
years ago there's been very little that
I've seen and it's very little I've seen
making it to people's production web
apps or pro production web sites yeah in
fact one of the questions I often ask
myself is what if we haven't called
these things progressive web apps what
if we call them progressive websites
what would be different what would we
have change which conventions would we
have established that we don't have now
so you think the word app is influenced
us to design from the UI to the patterns
and conventions of native yes and if you
were to imagine the world where we were
saying washi you know what we're happy
that the web is not like an Apple
environment we like the fact that the
web is a hyper media environment when
you look at the web and people they take
the hypertext aspects for granted just
like people take a responsiveness for
granted and then it's very easy to say
well actually this works on my phone and
it works my other phone it's responsive
enough but it have a problem with say
mobile first and us focusing going from
the extreme of desktop only to the
extreme with only mobile hence the MDOT
websites or some of the challenges that
pwace ways I think you're right I think
we also confuse building some days
mobile first we're building something
that is native to the device the user
has so if you think about a app or
website that really exploits the user's
device they're going to ask what
capabilities exist in this device that
don't exist in other devices and as you
can please evolve and new capabilities
get added we should be asking ourselves
what can we do now that we couldn't do
before
so probably the most interesting new
capability that's been
the two devices is fingerprint and
you're seeing more more apps they were
actually instant typing using a password
once you've logged in wants to see your
fingerprint then all because we know
it's you yeah I mean it seems like there
is a potentially another debate and I've
always been frustrated by you know so
the whole flat versus skeuomorphic or
native versus web it almost feels like
native web or native web and at work is
that the new debate I mean is this
possibly damaging again like you know
just another you know million conference
two million videos million books written
about you know the patterns I mean what
do you think the solution is before we
create another scandal so I think a lot
of people see native and web as
converging and a very long time ago I
found this wonderful Greek word chiasmus
the idea that you have two ideas and
they meet and crossover so you're in up
in a world where apps are much more
hypertextual and websites are much more
app like and they cross over and they
borrow features from each other so it's
not quite convergence but I don't think
really nativist is where though even the
app web versus native web argument is
productive but I do think looking at
each other
each side and asking what can we borrow
from them whilst preserving our own
identity because if you get progressive
web apps everywhere that all look kinda
feel like native apps that isn't a
victory for the web because now you just
find a way to build native apps using
javascript yeah you've thrown away URLs
with thrown away
hypertext reality you throw away the
value the browser's give you if you load
your progressive web app fullscreen
there's no URL there's no way to share
there is no way to browse beyond the
confines of that native app without
ending up in a very confused environment
at which point could you just use the
native app so we have to make sure that
the web doesn't lose our soul yeah
because the point with make
an app like if you lose yourself can you
be a perfectly developed without
designing yes would you be a more
empathetic developer if you knew more
about design in the setting yes I think
you would and I think that there's
nothing wrong with saying that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
