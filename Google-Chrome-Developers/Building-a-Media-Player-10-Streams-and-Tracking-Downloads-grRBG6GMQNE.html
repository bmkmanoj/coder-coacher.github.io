you do an awful lot of architecture and
wrangling and then people kind of
looking over your shoulder go so you
know what have you been working on you
like well Lots but there's nothing
really to see it's just a lot of
machinery under the hood so has it been
for me with the story of offline in this
particular app the immediate app has to
offline cases one is relatively standard
I suppose that you go to a video and you
say I would like to watch this one later
but and we have to go and download not
only the video but things like its
poster frame for the video element its
album art so we can do the media session
API it's - manifest all those things and
you kind of go yeah I just get a bundle
of things and I'm going to go and get
those and download them and one of the
things that in this area that still to
land on the platform for which jake has
an explainer at least is the background
fetch API wouldn't it be great give them
that list of files that you want to get
to be able to hand off to the browser
and say hey look these 10 files
would you mind you know going off and
getting them for me and just fire an
event when that's completed so that I
can decide what to do I can put them in
a cache or I can do whatever I feel like
doing with them well that's certainly on
the way and it doesn't exist right now
so what I'm doing is when you click on
the I want to take this video offline I
do in the page I do a fetch and I
populate the cache myself now allows
quite a lot of code in and of itself
because I'll show you why and the let me
tell you about the second use case
that's one thing the second use case is
this imagine that you have watched
episode 1 of a show that you're
interested in and episode 2 is probably
going to be of interest to you maybe you
subscribe to the show or something and
what we want to do is run getting the
entirety of episode 2 you know ask for
that and that's quite a lot of space but
what we could do is maybe just get the
first one minute or two minutes of the
show because
that kind of prefetching idea is good
because it means that when you hit play
how we can to give you a flying start
and we can drop back to like the
adaptive network side later on and so
I've been trying to tackle both of those
now in this particular video I think
what I want to do is I just want to talk
about the serviceworker and the case of
getting all the video that one will you
say I want to take this video offline
for later let's talk about approaching
that problem now I'm not going to dive
into every little bit of code there are
bits and pieces in there that quite you
take awhile to explain and I think it's
probably the case if you just look
through the code it probably make more
sense but of course if you do that and
you have questions we have the comments
below for you to ask your questions so
please do feel free as always to go
ahead and do that right you know talking
let's look at some codes right I am in
the point in my app j/s where thanks to
the UI and so let me show you the UI I
should have started there really imagine
you are let's see but this video of me
and Jake here and you click this and we
don't need this list you know so I'm
just going to close up yeah let's close
up and you click the make available
offline button and we start saying that
was very quick that was very quick
I wish the internet was always not fast
for me but it isn't and because it isn't
we have the offline case haha
perfect the the bit where is the
spinning dial you know all that kind of
stuff right what's actually happening so
in the app I fire an event that causes
this on offline toggle to be triggered
and the interesting bit here is while I
check whether that we actually have the
thing and you know if we've already got
it then you know do you want to remove
it and so on and will delete it but if
you haven't which is that case that
you're just looking at then we want to
add it suit to our cache and you can see
I have this offline cache class here and
I try to add this thing so that's why
the rubber hits the road so we should
head over to that in that class let me
find the actual abs function here and it
takes in a bunch of things if we
support caching then we just bail but we
build a sets of assets that we're
interested in remember I said it was
things like the poster image and so on
in fact we have them in here in the
constants yeah these are when you go
offline when you take a video offline
here's the things that I currently get I
get the our work I probably only need
one of these actually to be sir anyway I
get both artworks a small poster image
and the large poster image and I pretend
so I get the 720p offline manifest which
is a reduced
- manifest with just a 720p video and
the audio instead of all of the various
options but I pretend as it's called -
manifest so when when later on I I ask
Shaka just get - manifest if it has got
it stored offline he gets a full one
with all the representations if it has
that it's thought it's just going to get
the 720p one that's my way of locking
Shaka into the soccer player into only
ever playing the 720p video so it builds
up the the list of assets that we want
to get and you'll see I have this
special magical chunking thing here hmm
right this is proved to be quite the
journey because above you if you didn't
cache ze episode the entry where I
talked about the idea that when we make
a request for the video we do a range
request which means we don't ask for one
gig of video up front for example we say
I want these bytes - these bytes I want
just this raised like thousand bytes or
two thousand bytes or whatever and I
said at the time with my prototype this
is going to be a bit of an interesting
one later because in production if
you've got a large video you don't want
to store it as one big file and then
pull it out entirely into memory is like
a one gig array buffer that you then
slice for example so what I do is as the
files coming in when I'm doing this all
part of this downloading of say the
video files and the audio files I have
this chunking tie which basically means
on its way through please split this up
into chunks later on in the
serviceworker which if
time I'll show you I asked for the
chunks that we need so for example I
have I think at the moment half megabyte
chunks and so if you asked for a
particular range it might be that I need
new chunks 9 10 and 11 and so I get 9 10
and 11 and I create an array buffer from
those three array buffers one big one
and then I slice out from the that array
buffer the bit that you actually asked
for so it's my way of making sure that I
don't pull out too much data into memory
I chose in my chunk size I chose half a
Meg at random as a sort of a guess that
maybe we'll need two maybe three
occasionally and sort of a Meg Meg and a
half in memory it's yes it's a bit
garbage II know I don't like it but it
does mean that I'm not pulling out a one
gig video into memory every time we make
some things always a gig but I'm just
saying you know think big video and that
would be the problem now a longer-term
solution for this that I'd love to see
on the platform is the ability when you
say caches match and you give it the URL
that you could give it some options
besides say the cache name but you can
actually give it the range as well
saying do you happen to also have bytes
1,000 to 2,000 and or you know I assume
it does if it's got in there but it
should you know those kind of things
should be you should be able to give you
the answer right as and no I don't
because the file is only 500 bytes long
or yeah sure what a lot of that needs
specking it's not a thing that exists
today so it's something I'm actually
having to do and it's a bit of a pain
point but every so well just said chunk
true and that required a whole heap of
explanation see what I mean
so what does the chungqing do well we
keep going through the code so we build
on this list of assets that we actually
want to push and eventually we get to
the idea of downloading and downloading
is here and this is the this is probably
one of the more interesting bits because
what I do is I have a thing with which I
call track download interesting and this
actually looks probably fairly
straightforward I imagine to many of you
if you haven't done serviceworker stuff
this will look slightly bit up if you
have it'll look make sense
we open the cash and we take whatever
the request is and the responses and we
just pop that in the cash if it's not
such a chunk if it is we cash in chunks
so we seem to be doing two things with
all our responses all the things that
we've asked to download we're doing two
things with firstly we're tracking them
and secondly we're cashing in chunks now
I better not say the word streams three
times in quick succession because if I
do
Jake will show up and I think we can all
live without that don't you okay
streams that's what we're doing imagine
that we've made a fetch request and one
of the things we get back is a is a
readable stream at least you can in
chrome today you can also say with the
response you can say give me the JSON
get me the text get me an array buffer
but you can say I want to read this as a
readable stream and in order to handle
this when a response is read once it's
consumed actually in in this world which
means you can't do two things with a
single stream you can't both say tracker
download and count the number of bytes
that are passed through the stream as
well as cache it into chunks like read
the stream and chunk it up as it goes
but you can clone a response which is
kind of like peeing the stream if you've
not done anything with dreams the idea
is that imagine that the t-shape and it
comes up the middle and then splits up
into two it's our way of taking the
stream and turning it into two streams
which is exactly what I'm doing here so
let's have a look at what we'll do
so imagine them we've got say the video
coming down the wire okay
we're going to do two things with it one
we're going to track the download
secondly we're going to cache it into
chunks let's go down to the the track
downloads oh where is that where is
track downloads I should just look at
yeah okay so each response what I do is
I get a reader I get a reader you can
see here actually I clone it so that's
the first thing I actually do maybe I'd
clone it to make sure that whatever I do
here on the response means that it's not
going to be consuming the response and
puppet being used somewhere else oh the
first thing I do is when I get one of
these responses are fetch the video come
the French comes back and I go right
clone it first of all clone this okay so
that I can now operate independently
with my clone of the the response and
then I ask for a reader on the on there
so clone dot buddy get reader I which is
a readable stream and then I can start
reading and I get there's a callback
that you pass to the promise when that
happens so you read the read from the
reader and then you say on stream day to
do this thing and it's a bit it's a bit
convoluted actually when you do stuff
with this because it's kind of it's you
kind of call the callback and then in
the callback you sets up the next
callback of the call back yes you do so
on string data we just say well are you
done if so you know if blah blah blah we
complete it is the general idea because
if one of the things that's the case
here is that we've got a byte total so
remember I'm getting like five or six
files and so the byte total has to
represent the entire total of all five
six however many files and so each one
of these responses is contributing to
that total and when one of the streams
finishes it will if the byte count isn't
the final bite amount well we don't need
to do anything if it is the final bite
amount we've actually completed the
download of all our files and so we can
basically say yet we're done
we can call this callback which is
something I registered somewhere else
it's like okay update the UI and all
those kinds of things so remember now
we've we've had say the audio file come
in or the video files come in we've read
some bytes and we basically keep
tracking the length of each of these
reads and that allows us to say well how
many bytes have actually come in and we
can post back to this on progress
callback with the how many bytes we've
got and how many bytes we're expecting
in total and as I say when we're
finished we can call this uncomplete
that says write all the bytes are in
we're done so that's what the tracking
part doesn't that's a great way of using
streams it I say it's a great way it's a
garbagey way unfortunately because
imagine every time this callback is
called the this results here has
it's an array buffer I believe it's got
lots of bikes in it and I don't do
anything with those bikes apart from
asks for the length I would love it if
we had some mechanism with say a fetch
to say just give me progress events like
you do with xhrs
that would be a nice thing and I believe
it's something once again that my friend
Jake is were looking at hurry up Jake
and whoever else is working on it
I have needed it I need it anyway so
that's one part we're tracking the
download we basically asked for all the
bytes that are passing through the
stream and we post back every time we
get an update basically doing more bytes
came in and that's what I used to do
that pie chart
it's got time probably one if we have
time I'll quickly show you how that pie
charts done is pretty neat and then the
other thing as I said was caching into
chunks so this was the idea that instead
of a one gig video or a half gig video
or 200 mega in the cache instead what we
want to do is we actually want to
separate it out into like half Meg
chunks and then we can build our
responses in the serviceworker later
so the caching jokes wasn't one you know
once again we're cloning the response
probably don't technically need to do
that we could just consume the response
here if we wanted to not the similar get
a reader and what we do is we go through
reading injunction every time we hit our
chunks size we commit that particular
chunk into the cache that's this commit
buffer here and then we reduce the
amount that we're expecting still to
come in by that chunk size and we kind
of restart again so we kind of have this
buffer and we fill it up and then when
that's done we basically pop that into a
response then we reset and go again and
eventually we run out of bytes which is
the result done when we commit whatever
buffer size we've got left there at the
end so let's imagine the same sort of
the half Meg we learned up with like
Kunda bytes at the end we just commit a
final buffer we just does 200 bytes in
the commit buffer has this it has a
coupler it has one header that I set
which is just a chunk size because I
need to know later on about how many
chunks were actually
the tongue sizes that were actually
stored in case I've got a part chunk at
the end and I need to kind of note you
actually have enough bytes to satisfy
this thing the the range request that
came in anyway nonetheless we do a cache
put of that chunk and actually on the
front end let me show you what that
looks like if we go to application and
we take a look in the cache storage you
see I've got CDF showreel here which is
the cache for this particular episode
and there you go loading seats flip down
this the 720p stream all the way zero
one to go you just love string based
order and all the way up to what's
that's 32
yes into 32 half megabytes chunks cool
so that's the first bit and you can also
see here by the Roses the artwork and
everything else and you can see I
actually keep keep one cache directly
for this video that means that later on
it's a lot easier from my UI perspective
because I can say when I'm looking at
this video and I look at its URL I just
go do you have CDF flash show real by
the way caches and if the answer is sure
then I go cool I'm going to assume you
have that video and so my add and remove
is based at the kind of cache level so
when I say get rid of this so if I
remove this offline copy it and then i
refresh the cache storage refresh it
there you go you see that that entire
cache is gone but it didn't get in the
way of saving the assets that I need for
they know all the the icons and
everything else cool makes sense
hopefully all that makes sense also I
have the the older chrome dev summit one
that I was running on localhost 8080
flashbacks of fun right I am gonna stop
there I think and in the next century I
will actually show you the corresponding
other side which will be the
serviceworker code but before i do i did
say i was going to show you the dial let
me just show you this this here right so
this one it goes we and it goes around
like that in the dial how do they do
that before we go I'm going to show you
that
really really quickly it's in the where
is it where is it where is it where is
it the download progress for this it is
basically this is what actually gets
called by the on progress callback the
percentage value is a value between zero
and one which is the byte count over the
bikes total okay
and it comes in and we have a target
which happens to be an SVG and that
matters because what we're actually
doing is doing an SVG path path it's an
SVG path oh yeah and you can see here
what we did is we take that percentage
and I do a little bit of cos and sine
work figure out what arc we actually
need based on the percentage so one is a
full revolution and then it's some
proportion of that revolution so this is
this is something I didn't know before I
actually started doing this I had a
sneaking suspicion that with SVG you
could create paths on the fly and I had
a sneaking suspicion that arcs might
well be one of those things and you can
see here that this is what exactly what
I'm doing so I find the target
I find a simple plastic dial which is
just a path element inside the SVG and I
go through and I create based on a bit
of calculation what I think the arc
should be and then it's got weird flags
like this large art flag and targets all
that how to look at the documentation on
how to do arcs inside of SVG dates it is
slightly bizarre I'm much more used to
the canvas way of doing things
oh well but this works brilliantly so I
based on the percentage I just spin the
an arc through and I just sort of make a
pie chart thing right and then I set the
attribute and that causes the the SVD to
update and it all works really well
actually really am very happy so this is
long there's a little bit of code here
or 50-yard lines of it does the job just
great and obviously means in my you I
can give a nice bit of progress to the
user on how well the
the download process is going so there
you have it that is the process of
downloading the files chunking them
using streams giving programs updating
the UI and we're not even done yet
because we actually haven't even
responded to the users request or the
players request for range range requests
use it hang on let's try that again
we haven't even responded to the video
players range requests coming through
the Service Worker for that one you have
