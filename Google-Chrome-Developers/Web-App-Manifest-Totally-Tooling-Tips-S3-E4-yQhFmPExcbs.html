for lonely people okay what does it do
was it cool it's called words with cats
now where's the cat's billion it'd be
named now I want to show an icon on my
phone's home screen someone launches
this and I also want to be able to show
like in an icon or some visual in a
splash screen is that reading a
dictionary or something cat reading it
do you or a thought leader how can I get
that done so that's the Chrome now has
the item screen stuff so basically if
you meet a certain set of criteria when
a user is basically engaged with your
web app it will come up the little
banner saying hey we'd like to add this
time screen so you basically to be on
htps and to have a serviceworker and you
need a web app manifest and then after
that it's basically depending on the
user coming back a couple of times then
it will show the banner so the web app
manifest is the main thing that you need
to enable all of this along with the
other bits but the manifest is just a
JSON file at that point so it's just a
JSON file is this a chrome only thing no
no this is all the standard space so
basically any browser can look for this
link rail tag that links to your
manifest.json file at that point they
can pass it and it's just gonna be you
have to have certain things to find for
then browser to take it all out right so
the manifest lets me customize my icons
what other what other stuff can I
configure in there oh oh you can define
short name which would be the text
underneath your icon that you'd normally
see theme color which chrome uses is
like the URL color along the URL bar
background color is for the splash
screen so if you have that add times
you're gonna click on it it'll launch
and basically while Chrome's loading
what you can do is show especially in
this like solid color and then have an
icon on top of it along with the text so
background color does that you've got an
array of icons so again depending on
what the browser wants to use the icon
for it will just pick the best size for
it
start URL is super awesome what that is
is basically you remember back in the
day we used a bad time screening CRA's
like hidden in the menu yeah so what I
would always do is whatever page you are
on
that is where you will get pointed to
when you click on the icon for the home
screen
start URL lets you define where that is
now so if you were if someone was in the
middle of a blog article clicked on our
time screen now you can say actually
just go to the home of the blog then
you've got display display is basically
rather than launched in browser mode you
can sit there and say actually I wanted
to go fullscreen fullscreen the same way
that an Ava dup native app might look
like right yeah exactly but alongside
that there's also in the spec
orientation so you could theoretically
lock it to portrait or landscape cool so
for games that's particularly yeah like
you want to do like 4 Stooges like thumb
sticks and yeah the nice thing
especially I was gonna say with the site
URL you can actually then add the query
parameter so then you can like track how
many people are using it so like
homescreen equals true and then
analytics would just show you sure so
that's pretty much the bulk of it nice
is there if I wanted to like validate
that I've got a legit manifest is there
a tool I can use for that yes someone
has built a web app manifest validated I
think dev tools were also gonna do it so
you could like force and download of the
manifest and get dev tools to pass it
I believe we mentioned as much in
totally tooling tiers but I haven't
actually used it yet myself and
admittedly if you don't use something
like that it's kind of hard to figure
out whether it's working or not yeah so
those well worth checking out ok so
we've talked about the web app manifest
the manifest validator we're checking
out dev tools is looking at it are there
Doc's on this available as well the best
thing to look at is poking --lens
blog post it covers example manifests
how do I detach the HTML page and then
how to debug it as well so that's
probably best pet sweet and plus is in
web starter kit and a whole other host
of the projects that we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
