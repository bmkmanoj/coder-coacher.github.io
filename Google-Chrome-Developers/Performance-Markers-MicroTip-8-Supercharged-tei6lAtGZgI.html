of code better than that one and my
answer usually is it really depends on
the context and you should probably just
try them both and measure the impact the
user timing specification provides a
standardized way of collecting timing
data and either visualizing it in dev
tools or even allowing you to send it to
your analytics together real-life
performance data with performance mark
you can save the named marker with a
current timestamp
this allows you to track when a certain
point in your code was executed so for
example I could save the marker when my
lazy loader is done loading all my
non-critical styles but arguably more
important is performance measure which
allows you to measure the time span
between two of your markers this allows
you to track the duration of certain
processes so in my example I could not
only measure when my lazy loader was
done but instead how long it took to
load all my non-critical styles you can
view all your markers and durations
using performance get entries they will
contain name type as well as timestamps
and durations alternatively you can use
dev tools performance timeline to
inspect your markers the easiest way to
do that is to use the entries panel to
find what you're looking for and that's
it a small tool to help you make
performance driven decisions when you're
developing your app see you next time
this was a supercharged micro tube but
did you know we also do live streams and
you can watch the most recent one over
there more importantly you can subscribe
the channel
and watch other series like any cast or
Co tooling tips and the best of them all
