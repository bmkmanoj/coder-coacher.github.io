progressive web apps summit I'm Rob
Dodson joined by Sarah Clark sara is a
year the program manager for web
training in developer relations for for
Google and one of the big things that
we've been talking about here at the the
event is this progressive web app
nanodegree bye-bye Udacity and can you
tell the folks out there who might be
unfamiliar with that kind of stuff like
like what is a Udacity nanodegree and
what is included in that so you dasty
nanodegree is a credential program it
means you don't have to go through a
full University and get a full
university degree instead you get a
degree in some very practical topic like
web development so a year ago at the
last CD s chrome developer summit we
announced the senior web nanodegree
program for basically taking it out
current everyday developers and building
up to the point of being team leads now
we're building on top of that with a
progressive web apps specialization the
specialization is a series of short
courses and we're about to launch the
first two on an intro to progressive web
apps and on web push and that will be
coming out within the next couple of
weeks and the other more advanced topics
that you've seen here we already have
classes being developed on how to do
those things so somebody be able to take
a short series of courses and master all
the aspects of progressive web app
development but even before that we
already have courses on offline we
already have courses on pretty much all
the big topics that you saw yesterday
and one of those topics being
accessibility and so I can't I have two
very shamelessly like plug this now so
one of those courses that that we
launched the other day was on web
accessibility and the importance of
accessibility not not just for desktop
apps but making sure that you're
thinking about it for mobile as well um
you can talk about a little bit about
why you think accessibility is important
for developers to consider in their
process so in mobile devices started
coming out I was teaching a lot of
mobile web development and one of the
things I realized early is we all get a
little disabled often with our mobile
devices it's really different doing
something in a bus
with their phone out in a noisy
environment and weird light and all of
that then it is to me something on a
desktop and so good accessibility is
just good user experience design you
know if you build for people that have
vision constraints or audio constraints
well guess what those are the same
constraints we have every day out in the
world with a mobile device now now for
for the sessions that we're seeing here
if someone is what is watching right now
they're interested in learning more
about this content right they want to
take a deeper dive what what would their
next move be so you can go look at
documentation but also most of this
sessions mentioned at Udacity course do
you really have a choice you can do some
self-study read the docs watch the
videos or you can grab a course they
tend to be reasonably short you can
usually if you're full timing it do them
in a day or two but they go really
in-depth and are really focused on
practical topics and they're all free so
come take a look at what we have at
Udacity and keep an eye on the
announcement emails after this
conference will be announcing new
courses as they come out right on Sarah
thank you so much for talking with us
today if you're interested in learning
more about these Udacity courses we're
going to include a link down in the show
notes to the nanodegree to the
accessibility course to all the goodness
that Google is producing over on Udacity
right now as well as links to the docs
and of course links to the chrome
developers YouTube channel and the
playlist looks like we're turning out
for a break so we're going to get back
to things thank you all so much for
watching and keep staying around for a
day two of the progressive web app
summit
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
