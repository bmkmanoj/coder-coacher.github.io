SPEAKER: Remind me why we are w
earing the suits? 
SPEAKER: They said to make it j
azzy, so we are wearing suits. 
SPEAKER: I feel like an enter
prise job developer or someth
ing. 
SPEAKER: Do we have time to 
change it? 
SPEAKER: Oh, let's change it. 
SPEAKER: C'mon, we don't have 
time for this.  We will be fine,
 we will be fine.  Hello, you ne
ed those.  
SPEAKER: Sorry about that, I 
just -- I feel so much more c
omfortable now. 
SPEAKER: You have 10 seconds, 
get ready. 
SPEAKER: We're not jazzy enough.
Nothing more we can do 
about it now.  Can 
you play that? 
(Saxophone 
playing).

SPEAKER: What was that? 
SPEAKER: [ Laughter ]. 
SPEAKER: Beginner's luck. 
SPEAKER: Welcome to Chrome Dev 
Summit 2016!  
SPEAKER: [ Applause ]. 
SPEAKER: How is everybody doing 
in the room? No, no, you can do 
better than that.  Open up in 
the top, row are how are you d
oing? In the back? The front? 
The front gets it.  The left? 
The right? And the live stream? 
Wait -- 
[ Laughter ]. 
SPEAKER: And speaking of the 
live stream, if you are joining 
us on the live stream, thank you
 so much, there are viewing part
ies around the world, in offices
 and homes.  Lovely to have you 
here, you are very busy and 
awesome you made the journey to 
see us today. 
SPEAKER: And we have some mat RS
S toers to deal with before the 
show.  One is the code of c
onductconduct, and as all good 
conferences should have, it goes
 like this.  We encourage you to
 be excellent to each other, say
 hi to new faces and build on 
each other's idea and reporting 
uncomfortable experiences.  We 
have a zero tolerance policy for
 harassment.  Do share your ex
periences, positive or negative,
 with the speakers and the 
staff.  And the code of conduct 
is posted around the building is
 on the website.  
Apologies for reading it from my
 phone, this is the official sta
tement.  From a personal perspec
tive, we have been in the indus
try now for over 10 years, we ar
e kind of part of the old crowd 
now. And I don't know if it is 
too optimistic to say that in 
that time, things have started 
to get better, a little bit, s
lowly but surely.  It feels like
 now, more than ever, they -- we
 need to double down, you know? 
We need to be kind to everyone, 
welcoming to everyone, and we n
eed to be heroes to those that 
aren't having a great experience
.  No matter what is happening 
out there, we need to make it 
right in here, in this industry.
[ Applause ].  
SPEAKER: So we have two days 
worth of talks, breakout s
essions, code labs, panels -- 
and as the talks are done, the 
videos will start to go up on to
 the website as well.  So keep 
an eye out for those and we can 
set notifications for sessions y
ou are interested in on the 
website as well. 
SPEAKER: You did the notificati
ons didn't you? 
SPEAKER: You have heard enough, 
we will get things started. No 
finer way to do that than with 
the keynote, the VP of Chromes e
ngineering, please give it up 
for Darin Fisher! 
 lause ]. 
SPEAKER: A round of applause for
 Paul and Jake, you guys are a
wesome.  Welcome to Chrome Dev S
ummit, we are so excited to be 
here and share the enthusiasm 
and excitement about the web e
cosystem with you and share th
ings to help you be successful, 
building for the web and things 
we are doing in Chrome.  So 
let's get into it, our mission 
in Chrome is to move the web pla
tform forward, it should  it is 
true today and 10 years ago whet
her  when we started.  Over the 
next few days, we will have a 
lot of content for you and a lot
 of great stuff about how we are
 working to get the web better 
to create great experiences on 
the web.  
And now, ord  ordinarily at the 
beginning of the talk, we tell 
you the number of Chrome users. 
At Google I/O, there are over a 
million Chrome mobile users, 
which is awesome.  There has 
been tremendous growth.  And th
is year, I want to present a s
lightly different number.  This 
year, I want to share, or not 
this year, it is the same year. 
But at this moment, I want to 
share that we have over 2 bil
lion active Chrome browsers, 
this is across mobile and d
esktop.  So rather than focus on
 one platform, I wanted to make 
this point that there's a lot of
 Chrome browsers out there.  
And, while that is great for us 
and everything, I don't need you
 to be excited about that, what 
is exciting about this, when you
 think about building for the w
eb, there's a lot of browsers ou
t there that implement the 
latest web standards and all the
 latest and greatest features.  
When we are talking about how to
 build for the web and take ad
vantage of these new things, 
that is reality.  You can take 
advantage of that, there's a lot
 of users out there with modern 
browsers. 
And, it is not just Chrome, ther
e are lots of other browsers 
that are implementing the latest
 standards, too, a lot of energy
 and excitement in this space wh
ich is fantastic.  And it gets 
to the point that the web has t
remendous reach, we know this. 
This is why it is such an attr
active platform, it is such a c
ost-effective, low-friction way 
to get experiences in front of u
sers, to get in front of real p
eople.  d then, that little fri
ction is all made possible becau
se of the links, urls, that's 
the super power of the web, ri
ght? 
We are very used to that.  
And, the links are getting even 
more exciting.  So I wanted to i
nvite you to pull out your pho
ne, if you have an Android phone
 or a Chrome phone, there are 
bluetooth beacons in this rooms.
  And you can check on the url h
ere, to give you instructions. 
The Physical Web, made possible 
because of bluetooth beacons and
 the android device observing t
he beacons and sending the urls 
into this room that are contextu
aly interesting to you. 
There's a beacon for the url bro
adcasting the Chrome Dev Summit 
web app, so it makes it very c
onvenient.  This is the meaning 
on the power of urls, as a user 
you can go under the notific
ation on Android, click on Phys
ical Web entrys there, and find 
yourself an experience, not much
 hassle. 
There is another beacon in the 
room for 
an web app called poly man, mon,
 created by the Polymer team.  
It uses the General Pattons cap
ability to locate and capture 
and train virtual creatures 
called 
polymon, sounds familiar, right?
 You collect members of the Pol
ymer team in the real world and 
this conference venue.  Check it
 out, it is really cool and a 
lot of fun.  So like I 
said, contrast that seamlessness
 and ease with the experience of
 the web with the cost of ins
talling the software.  That fric
tion really matters.  By some e
stimates, every interaction step
 you expected the user to take 
can cost you up to 20 percent of
 your potential users.  Think a
bout that for a moment.  
Compare, like, one tap to, say, 
three taps.  That means that you
 are potentially losing about 1
/3 of your users, or imagine 4 
taps versus one tap, now you are
 potentially losing half your u
sers, roughly.  So that's a big 
deal, right? 
We know this, this is why we are
 all here, we are excited about 
the web and know its potential, 
it is real and awesome. so the w
eb, the web is really great on m
obile.  have been very focused 
on the mobile web for some  some
 time, and the web did not grow 
up being a reality, and mobile h
as been awesome for the web and 
it has helped expand the market 
for the web, making it easier to
 reach users.  You have a mobile
 phone in your pocket, the fact 
that you do not have to get off 
the couch to grab the laptop, 
you canyou can pull out your p
hone, browse the web, shop, e
tc., it is convenient.  I pulled
 out my Nexus phone and I bought
 a Pixel phone.  [ Laughter ].  
It was so easy.  hter ].  of c
ourse, there's a delay --. 
And any how, of course we know 
that the web has lots of cha
llenges, it wasn't, again, it wa
sn't build with all of that in 
mind, with the mobile in mind, 
all of these challenges and cons
traints that have led to innov
ation, really.  And we have all,
 as a community, had to figure 
out mobile and we have done -- w
e have made a lot of progress.  
So there's going to be a lot ta
lking about that and the mobile 
web has evolved a lot from the 
early days.  
And this, this chart is a rem
inder, most folks are familiar, 
mobile web usage has -- anyways.
  Mobile web usage has far eclip
sed desktop usage, this is going
 back a couple years. 
So, I'm sure that many web 
developers are familiar with t
his, building for mobile web is 
a priority.  And mobile web brin
gs many challenges, the devices 
are vast and vary, different s
creen sizes, CPU and memory and 
all manner of constraints and 
connectivity constraints, we are
 all familiar with the offline d
inosaur, right? 
And the connectivity constraints
 are not abou
t reliability, they are about 
bandwidth and latency.
Because 2G networks are reality 
for many of the people in the wo
rld and if you look at develop
ing markets, it is more of an i
ssue.  Many  many users are stu
ck behind these connections.  
Infrastructure is improving, but
 we don't expect 2G to go away 
anytime soon.  It will be with 
us. So there's a lot of challen
ges to address 2G.
And the web itself, it is a very
 big thing, the web is world-wid
e, it is in the name, it is e
verywhere.  
It is a wonderful tool for so 
many users, there's -- easily 
over 3 billion users across the 
whole world using the internet. 
That's, like, 10 times the size 
of the U.S.If you think about 
it, there is a larger addressabl
e population and nearly 2 billi
on of those are in developing co
untries. 
We look at current estimates of 
internet users and see there is 
roughly 280 million in the U.S.,
 double that in  India, 460, and
 China, 720 million.  There's a 
lot of users all over the place.
And if you look at the growth l
ast year, a lot of it is concen
trated in places like India, it 
saw 100 percent growth, nearly 
100 million users coming online,
 10 X the growth of China and 
100 times the rest of the world.

where a lot of the growth will 
come as well, focusing on India,
 65 percent of that population 
of that country is not online.  
That is 880 million potential 
new users, 20 times the number 
of users not yet online in the 
U.S. 
And so I think, actually the r
eason that I make a focal point 
of India, there's a lot of users
 there and we are seeing the 
most interesting and remarkable 
web 
development happening in India. 
A lot of the users connected to 
the internet for a first time is
 doing it with a phone that is 
very under whel ming that many o
f us are used to, these are p
hones with 512 megabytes RAM at 
most, under whel ming CPUs
 and limited storage.  A lot of 
these usersuse  users, they d
on't have a PC they are backing 
up data, that is where they are 
storing information they care ab
out.  It is not easy to install 
another app, you talk to people,
 I installed an app, they use it
, and uninstall it so they have 
that precious storage space for 
something else. 
We are seeing a lot of innovat
ion because the web is a f
antastic tool, it is
 a streaming platform.  You can 
bring part of your experience do
wn incrementally, it is designed
 for constraint storage and cons
trained networks. And thanks to 
a lot of the APIs that are going
 into the platform, we are ena
bling developers to have a lot 
more control over how their web 
experience works, how they can d
eliver the experience and create
 a good experience for users.  
We will talk more about that.  
So there's a lot of innovation h
appening here out of the need to
 address those con  constraints 
and it is a necessity that is l
eading to innovation and that is
 really exciting. o the point is
 that web apps work well in eme
rging markets and also work well
 here, and all the approaches, t
echniques, technologies that hav
e been developed, they work for 
folks in India, they work well h
ere, too.  We all know what it 
is like to have poor connecti
vity and we all know what it is 
like to have LTE. 
So this is the point: Web works 
really well in emerging markets.
A year or so ago, we had early 
pioneerpioneers in this space 
like FlipKart showing experience
s that can come on the device, 
be cacheed and give delightful 
experiences to users with 2G c
onnections.  Other companies are
 in this as well, such as Voot 
video streaming service, this is
 a joint venture
 between vicom.  This is a new s
ervice and they are just online 
recently, they built a new web e
xperience, 40 percent of the tra
ffic goes to the web and by buil
ding the web, they reached a lot
 of users more easily.  And it t
ook them a matter of three weeks
 to prototype an experience they
 are happy with and convinced 
them they should continue to i
nvest, they are investing furthe
r.  The next version will have 
offline captioning of snippets 
of videos so users can preview 
movies and TV shows and other 
Voot originals easily.  So that 
is very exciting:  
And so, this is all about buil
ding Progressive Web Apps.  
Many of you have heard this term
 before, we are talking about it
 for a while and introduced it 
last year.  Progressive Web Apps
 is not about just any one te
chnology or a set of technolo
gies, it is not about anything l
ike that.  It is more about a 
new way of thinking about buildi
ng web experiences, web experien
ces that are radically improving
 the user experience. 
And we're going to be talking a 
lot about this.  These experienc
es that you can create, the th
ings that I want to show you and
 have you leave with is knowing 
you can create experiences that 
are just as immerive and enga
ging and native feeling as an 
experience you expect to find on
 your phone.  That is exciting, 
combining the power of the web 
with the form factor of mobile 
and creating experiences that 
really delight users and you get
 a lot of value out of.  
And so, there's a lot of differe
nt companies joining in and se
eing success and we're going to 
be talking about a variety of th
ese over the course of these two
 days. 
I would like to zero in on one 
and take a moment to show you a 
demo.  This is about CNET, CNET.
com/today is a progressive web 
app.  And so let me demo that fo
r you.  
So I will switch over to the o
verhead
 here.  
So, I have my snazzy
SPEAKER: I want to make the 
point real for you.  So single's
 dace  day is an event in China 
where lots of shopping happens, 
this is 
an event where -- and it happens
 on November 11.  And just for 
the time, it is right now.  This
 is the biggest shopping event 
on the internet, and they 
SPAEBLTH  expect to see 20 
billion in revenue, three times 
black Friday and cyberMonday cc
ombined.  So this is a big deal,
 and it is great to see folks 
having this kind of success b
uilding for the web and building
 for the mobile web.  
And  and we will share more 
partner stories with you s
hortly. Progressive Web Apps, we
 talked about that before, we 
have been defining them as r
eliable, fast, and engaging. 
Progressive Web Apps are about 
creating a mump  much better us
euser experience, like what I s
howed with CNET.tech today.  
And I  you saw how I was offline
 and clicked the home screen i
con, it works, that's what the 
user expects. And when you think
 about fast, this is a great 
stack.  It comes from a double 
click study, users at the end, 
53 percent of users abandon 
sites that take longer than 
three seconds to load.  
Interestingly, a year ago that 
number would have been 40 
percent.  So users don't have 
the patience that you might wish
 they had, and so it is really 
important to pay attention to 
that initial loading experience.
And you saw with the CNET exa
mple, it was very nice.  
And so, all of this is made p
ossible, thanks to the Service
Worker API.  
But it is not just the Serv
iceWorker API, it is using p
roperly.  We're going to talk a 
lot about that.  But the 
ServiceWorker API is an API that
 allows you to have control over
 your caching strategy and of
fline approach to building your 
experience.  So you can manage 
how the network is used by your 
web app.  
And that is really a huge 
enabler for the web platform.  
And we estimate about 3 to 4 
percent of all pageloads in 
Chrome are now going through 
service workers, which is really
 cool.  focusing on performance.
This is another way of looking 
at it, and I really like this 
quote.  It comes from a member 
of our team: If you wouldn't 
make eye contact with a stranger
 for the time it takes your web 
app to first paint, it's too s
low. 
So this is getting at that 
awkwardness of, well, I'm w
aiting and waiting, what's h
appening.  
And at first paint, that is 
about getting some pixels on the
 screen, drawing something. The
re is no reason why that can't 
be done quickly, there's lots of
 challenges, of course, but we 
want to show you how to be s
uccessful about that.  It is not
 about getting pixels on the sc
reen, but making that experience
 interactive shortly thereafter.
  And so with that in mind, you 
are going to hear us talk a lot 
about this metric, getting your 
site interactive within 5 sec
onds, over a 
THREEJ connection -- 3G c
onnection.  
Not everyone has LTE, but if you
 have 3G, you should be able to 
do this.  5 seconds is a metric 
we will talk a lot about, and 
this is made possible thanks to 
things like ServiceWorker, but 
that leads to designing your web
 application better, chunking it
 up better, there are other t
echnologies, like HTTP2.0, a big
 enabler here, and by the way, 
ServiceWorker API requires TLS a
nd all of these things work nic
ely.  We are very excited about 
these technologies to help you 
achieve these kinds of goals and
 build fast experiences for 
the
When I talk about engaging, you 
saw how there was a website and 
it was an engaging experience.  
You expect users to land on your
 site, thanks to the power of u
rls for users to discover 
content.  What about getting 
back to the content that they 
like? Often times, the user has 
to remember to think to book 
mark your site, remember the o
rigin, or remember all the steps
 that got them there.  And of 
course, when it comes to mobile,
 that is nowhere near as effe
ctive as getting your icon on 
the home screen.  A year ago, we
 focused on this problem and we 
introduced app manifests, an 
ability for the website to indic
ate that it would be great to 
prompt the user to get them to 
add the site to the homescreen. 
 And this has been a great f
eature, and so you should think 
about add home screen as a ligh
tweight install, that's the 
experience that I showed you t
here.  
And, on Chrome, or sorry, we 
have seen that from partners a 
lot of great success from add 
the home screen.  This step 
comes from alibaba that we saw e
arlier, they have 4 times as 
much engagement from users that 
added them to their home screen.
That makes sense, it is not su
rprising.  It is good to see it 
born out like this.  So adding 
the home screen is an important 
thing, we know that intuitively 
based on the data we are seeing.

 screen.  We did not want to e
xpand the prompts in front of a 
user at any time, we have been 
tuning them and be reducng the 
engagement on the site before it
 shows a prompt, we are getting 
48 percent more conversions or i
nstalled where users are adding 
the sites to the home screen, 
which is a really great stat and
 that is all increasing the  
without increasing the number of
 users who ignore or dismiss the
 prompt, there is an opportunity
 to refine.  So from the Chrome 
team perspective, we are working
 to fine tune this so it will 
work even better. 
We are playing around with 
different formats, why not call 
it install,
 actually the istely experim
enting with that, and I think 
there's some interesting que
stions here, but it is exciting 
to try.  
And, I'm really excited to share
 that we are also looking at e
xperimenting with deeper integ
ration into the Android OS.
This is really cool, so today 
the way add the home screen w
orks, it is putting a widget on 
your Android device.  And the u
ser, they remove that, they are 
not going to find the app, the i
con in the all apps.  And that 
can be confusing, so we are w
orking to improve that so, when 
you go through the add home 
screen flow, what it will mean 
is that your website will be a
vailable in all apps and in p
laces where you expect to find 
app icons on the device.  
There's still a lot of work to d
o, we are experimenting with th
is -- it is going to be in p
review shortly in the Chrome dev
 channel, we are excited about 
this change.  And things that go
 along with it are things like 
giving you the ability to update
 the icon, or change the name of
 your -- of the thing that has b
een pinned to the home screen, 
which is an obvious things you 
should be able to do. we are e
xperimenting with granting n
otification permission when the 
user goes to the add home screen
 flow.  That is not something 
that a user is used to when they
 think about how Android perm
issions work.  We are looking to
 smooth the rough edges and make
 the experience work better, exc
ited to share that, and Paul K
inlen will be up here talking 
about this change. d the other 
big way that the developers like
 to re-engage with users on the 
phone is with push notification
s, this is something that we are
 working on for a while, we are 
seeing a lot of adoption, it is 
a really key feature, if you 
think about it, users who are 
interested in getting n
otifications, it is a great way 
to remind them that there is in
teresting content on your webs
ite.  
And so, there's a lot of o
ptions.  So 1 (800) 000-0000 p
ush notifications sent daily, 
this is exciting and even more e
xciting, we have seen over 50,0
00 domains using push notificati
ons.  This is really inte
resting, because it sort of spea
ks to the long-tail aspects of 
the web, the web is really great
 at enabling the long-t
ail developers.  
And just to give an example, thi
s is comes from Carnival Cruise
sCruises.  On the Carnival Crui
se site, you can book a trip, 
and then they will offer a fea
ture to notify you when your 
hold is about to expire.  They 
get a 24 percent opt-in rate for
 this, and when the notification
 appears in the front of the u
sers, 42 percent of the click on
 the notification and land back 
on the site.  That's a big deal,
 those are users who might not h
ave come back 
otherwise.  
And on a slightly different topi
c, seamless sign-in, this is 
something that you will hear ab
out later today.  This is the 
credential manager API that we 
introduced in Google I/O and now
 we have some early partner resu
lts, I want to share those w
ith you. With aliexpress, they 
are seeing a reduction in sign 
in failure and in Pinterest, 
they are seeing fewer desktop 
log ins.  And with this API, it 
is about avoiding situations 
where the users have to re-enter
 the user name and password b
ecause the browser has that in
formation and we can negotiate a
 seamless way for it to allow 
you to log in.  And getting logg
ed in and signed in is really i
mportant, especially for your 
engaged users.  
And, we are also going to talk a
 lot about payments, we know thi
s is an important part of the 
web ecosystem.  A lot of work is
 going into improving payments 
on the web, we are talking about
 autofill improvements in Chrome
 and the PaymentRequest API, a o
ne-tap payment to the web.  And 
Zach will be up later talking 
about this. 
And so, I think that it is clear
 that building Progressive Web 
Apps makes a lot of sense, there
's a lot of work to improve the 
platform and to make it so you 
can be really successful in P
rogressive Web Apps.  And I also
 wanted to take a moment to talk
 about the tools to be succe
ssful, these are some of the 
tools we will highlight, we will
 talk about them throughout the 
conference and others. 
The first is Lighthouse, this is
 a Chrome extension that we bui
lt that helps you zero in on the
 things that you can do to build
 your progressive web app.  It 
is an analysis tool, it helps 
you optimize your progressive 
web app.  You will hear more 
about this from Paul Irish a 
little bit later. 
And the next is real-world con
dition testing, or simulating 
CPU conditions you will find in 
the real world.  This is a 
feature of the dev tools in C
hrome, it is very handy and u
seful.  And of course there is 
no real substitute for real, 
actual device testing.  A lot of
 the users don't have fancy p
hones, it is important to test 
with a diversity of phones so 
you are building an experience t
hat works for everybody and Alex
 will talk about how to do that 
with dev tools. 
There is a new security and ap
plication panel in DevTools w
hich is really handy, you will 
hear about this and it is hel
pful to enable you to explore 
what is going on with your prog
ressive web app, and being able 
to explore the cache is really a
 nice feature.  
And so, the other thing I want 
to take a moment to talk about 
is polymer, we have been working
 on this for a while now.  This 
comes from the Chrome team.  We 
built it in the beginning becau
se we wanted to do it in conju
nction, in concert with the imp
rovements to the web platform.  
And Palmer polymer is about web 
components, that's a new feature
 of the web platform and we wa
nted to do the process the right
 way and polymer guides the 
process from that perspective.  
It is a great library and makes 
it easy to build for the mobile 
web. And that is important, 
again, we want to make it easy 
for everyone.  
The web component  components, 
there has been an arc in the dev
elopment of web components. 
In Chrome, they didn't see a lot
 of adoption from the other brow
ser vendors.  We worked with 
them on the drawing board and 
the standards bodies and we are 
seeing a lot of shared enth
usiasm for these APIs.  In fact,
 Apple has shipped some of them,
 shadow DOM view 1, if you are f
amiliar, this is one of the most
 complicated part of the web co
mponents set of technologies and
 getting it done natively means 
it can be done in a lightweight 
fashion. 
So this is fantastic to see all 
of this progress.  
And html imports, we will figure
 it out.  ter ]. d, there's a 
lot of partners adopting poly
mer, using it at scale, many 
products from Google today, such
 as YouTube.  Really excited to 
see all of this -- 
all of these folks seeing succ
ess with polymer.  
And, at the Polymer summit just 
a few weeks back, we announced 
polymer version 2, in addition 
to being based on the v1 spe
cs, it is a much lighter and 
faster take on polymer which you
 will hear about later. 
In addition to polymer being a 
library to help you build web co
mponents, we have built the p
olymer web toolbox to make it 
easier to build applications so 
you can prototype and build the 
experiences.  
And, really happy to announce th
ere has been a lot of interest 
in the community around web com
ponents, we have a new site, b
eta.webcomponents.org and folks 
are pouring in different element
s they built, a great site and 
opportunity to see what other f
olks are building and to take 
advantage of those components. 
The point of web components, 
these are re-usable chunks of 
code and technology you can use.
I want ta to talk about Amp, a 
great tool to get you on the web
 based on web components.  And 
over 700,000 domains are publis
hing Amp, and these are web cop 
 components being used at scale.
  It is a way to get content in 
front of users that leads them 
into your PWA, into your progre
ssive web app.  And we will talk
 more about using Amp and PWAs 
togethe
r tomorrow. 
And just a few notes about pre
dictability, we want to make the
 web easier, a lot of times, 
thanks to legacy, there's a lot 
of dark corners and challenges 
as you are thinking about a bu
nch of different browsers, this 
is the goal for us, we want to 
move the whole web forward, that
 means moving one platform as m
uch as we can.  The web should j
ust work for you.  so we are fo
cused on web standards and worki
ng with other browser vendors, 
and the collaborations we have 
had is really important, it l
eads to web components and 
ServiceWorker
 ServiceWorker and so on and so 
forth and we are working at ge
tting better in new feature i
ncobation and work with the st
andards community to bring 
features to market in a better w
ay.  So a lot of progress here, 
and the focus is on making thin
gs easier for you.  
And, on that note, I want to sha
re a tool that we put together, 
this browser bug searcher that a
llows you to search bugs across 
all the browser engines, which 
is very handy.  So check it out.
  And then also on the education
 front, I want to mention that 
there has been a lot of -
- in addition to the Chrome Dev 
Summit we had a year ago, we had
 the Progressive Web App summit 
in the summer and we have been 
having these Progressive Web App
 roadshows, talking about Progr
essive Web Apps and helping dev
elopers be successful.  We just 
had one yesterday in Sa
n Francisco, maybe some of you 
attended it.  This is content in
 code labs and scripts that you 
can take it and use yourself to 
put it on a progressive web app 
event, in case there is not -- 
in case the road show is not c
oming to your
 community.  
We are working on longer instru
ctor-led programs in Progressive
 Web Apps.  So look for that to 
come.  
So looking ahead: I want to wrap
 up a little bit by saying that,
 you know, obviously the web is 
a big deal, you are all here for
 a reason, we love the web, r
ight? 
There is so much energy, e
nthusiasm, a lot of excite and m
ent and you can see how this p
ath, figuring out the mobile has
 gone and how we are accelerati
ng towards figuring out these 
wonderful progressive web app 
experiences that can make the 
experiences so much more deli
ghtful for users and help the 
developers be successful in re
aching those users.  There's a 
lot of other technologies tha th
at are coming to the web to enab
le other opportunities.  Think 
about WebAssembly, a cross-brows
er developer preview was anno
unced on this, and this is in JS
 that was informed in some of t
he work that we did in native c
lient, and combined with WebGL, 
bringing open GLS 3 to the web. 
Imagine the kinds of experiences
 this can enable, this techn
ology can enable.  And obviously
 things like more immerive games
 and a lot of other cool stuff, 
very excited about that.  And 
you combine these technologies 
and the things that we are doing
 with new platforms, like VR.  
Think about web VR  web VR and 
the capabilities it adds to VR. 
You have your head set, you want
 to dig in on something and ex
plore things. If you have to st
op to install apps, it is not 
going to work great.  
And so the web is actually a won
derful fit for such an environme
nt.  Think about AR, Augmented R
eality.  Here, you are looking 
out into the real world and, thi
s is feature stuff, imagine s
omething tagging the real objec
ts in real space with -- not jus
t names and descriptions, but ur
ls you can go and find outlet  
out more about that object.  Url
 is a powerful tool in that wor
ld and the web is a great fit 
and it is on us to explore and 
develop, all of us, I mean, to 
figure out how the web can be l
everaged in these kinds of env
ironments.  
Very excited about the possibil
ities there, and then think abou
t IoT, Internet of Things, you 
saw the example of the Physical 
Web to get access of urls that 
are contextualy relevant to you,
 but if you walk up to a device 
and it is broadcasting an url to
 your device that is controlling
 that device, and thanks to BOOT
H, you can imagine how it would 
work, you walk up to the device,
 you have the control website 
and it is talking with bluetooth
 to that device and interacting 
with it.  That is seamless, is a
nd the low-frictionness of the w
eb, it is a super power and you 
can imagine it in lots of other 
applications.  Those are though
ts on that and I'm excited to se
e what you all will build and 
will build together.  I'm exc
ited to be a part of this ecosy
stem, we have a lot of awesome 
content today and tomorrow.  Tha
nk you for being here, and with 
that I think we have a little v
ideo.  Thank you all.

SPEAKER: Chrome Dev Summit, this
 is an important part in our 
year, we can share with you what
 has been happening for us, and 
what we think is coming up.  And
 so then we got to talking about
 this and we sort of thought, o
h, dear, it is a two-way street.

And what if the audience doesn't
 know web? 
SPEAKER: How can we find out suc
h a thing? 
SPEAKER: We realized, there is 
only one way to find out, which 
would involve someone changing 
the screen over behind us, hint 
to someone at the back.  ER: Get
 it? 
SPEAKER: There we go.  
(Video). 
SP
EAKER:  [ Laughter ]. 
SPEAKER: Welcome to The Big Web 
Quiz.  this is a little 
progressive web app interactive 
game thing that depends on WiFi 
working, our code working.  
SPEAKER: There's no final way to
 make friends with production 
staff at a conference than 
saying you are going to stress i
t. 
SPEAKER: So if you go to that 
web quiz.com, that domain is a
vailable.  So good. 
SPEAKER: And logging, using your
 Google accounts. 
SPEAKER: And then when you sign 
in at the bottom, you will see a
 check box.  If you happen to be
ing on the leader board, check 
the box that says up here on 
leader board, and that is quite 
good if you do, it makes you -- 
it qualifies you for potentiall
y, it is possibly one of the be
st surprises of all time.  We 
took a cue from quiz shows all 
around the world, particularly 
America and thought it is grand
iose, we will do it British s
tyle, this is what you could 
possibly win.  
[ Laughter ]. 
SPEAKER: So that's up for grabs.
Want if you are in the position 
by the end of the day, the top 
spot, you could win and that is 
really something to root at.  I 
hope you are signed in and you 
are happy to play along. 
Should we try and do a question?
We will do a practice one at 
first and see if this works.  
I mean, the main question I want
 to ask, is this going to stay 
or is it going to crash? Because
 was it a good idea to do quite 
a bit of the code -- did someone
 say no? [ Laughter ].  Don't 
say that.  
SPEAKER: What could possibly go 
wrong? 
SPEAKER: We will go and figure o
ut what -- what we do -- 
SPEAKER: So after the next talk,
we will go 
and -- 
SPEAKER: We will commit to the s
ite this morning.  
SPEAKER: Excellent.  So on to 
the next speaker -- 
SPEAKER: Is Thao Tran, and 
before she talks to us, she was 
not convinced that we would do a
 fair intro on Progressive Web A
pps, and so she had a 
video prepared.  
SPEAKER
: The only thing that is faster 
than technology is expect 
expectations, we want it every 
day.  
SPEAKER: The data is still at a 
premium, only costing up to 5 pe
rcent of a monthly wage.  
Let's face it, until now, the al
ternative to native apps has not

been great.  
SPEAKER: [ Laughter ]. 
SPEAKER: Progressive Web Apps 
can now deliver mobile web 
experiences with a native look 
and feel, offering features like
 realreal-time push notificati
ons, adding a site to your home 
screen so you can jump back with
 it with a single tap, even when
 you a
re offline.  
Plus the ability to make quick p
ayments on the go.  
And, all from 
your browse
r.  
This is the next
 generation.  
(Video concl
uded d) SPEAKER: [ Applause ]. 
SPEAKER: Hi, 
. 
SPEAKER: I want to give a shou
tout to the MARBLTHing team who 
put that together, and what we w
ant everyone building today.
I'm Thao Tran, I'm on the global
 partnerships for Chrome on the 
web platform team about early a
dopters of awesome web technolo
gies.  It is great to hear from 
Darin in the overall web plat
form and I will have the oppo
rtunity to tell you more about 
Progressive Web Apps and what's 
happened over the last year.  So
 I did a lot of reflecting in th
e last couple days, not about t
he other stuff, but really about
 kind of where we were last year
 at the same event. so, I wanted
 -- I went back and looked at 
some of the tweets coming out, 
because the FlipKart team had 
just launched their progressive 
web app and that really pioneers
 in this space.  
There's a lot of buzz and exci
tement about what is possible 
for the web and I want to 
echo Darin's sentiment leading 
to a lot of innovation. 
I was concerned about the succ
ess, if it was specific to F
lipKart, the region, to 
Progressive Web Apps in other v
erticals and markets. 
I didn't know if this would be 
hot for a minute and then get s
hovelshelved away, so I thought 
about toys.  This is my son, he 
got a, you know, a gift of re
frigerator food and wanted me to
 build a refrigerator.  So I 
spent two hours going through, b
uilding custom shelves so all 
the pieces fit across all of 
these shelves and most of the p
arents know in the audience that
 most toys last a week, they  it
 is shelved and he didn't play 
with it anymore.  I wondered if 
Progressive Web Apps would have 
the same fate.  
Was the FlipKart progressive web
 app uniform, and thankfully 
that wasn't the case.  So Flip
Kart continued to invest in pro
gressive web app technologies, a
 big refresh of the site, exten
ded it to the desktop.  And they
 battle-tested the Progressive 
Web Apps. They went through big 
billion days, the biggest shopp
ing event of the year for them 
in India.  And last year, it was
 app only, they shut down the 
mobile website.  
And this last year, with the 
FlipKart and web experience back
, they saw as much traffic on 
the web as mobile as they did on
 desktop. 
So it completely affirmed their 
commitment to bringing the web 
back on mobile.  
And so, I think on FlipKart, and
 the Progressive Web Apps, we w
anted to see -- we are starting 
to see momentum in the overall m
arketplace, we are seeing that 
Progressive Web Apps came up as 
a topic of various conferences, 
saw a lot of articles about Pr
ogressive Web Apps, I have a 
Google alert letting me know ev
ery time someone mentions Pr
ogressive Web Apps, because some
times I get flooded.  And I 
wanted to point to three articl
es that really illustrate that 
Progressive Web Apps is broade
ning across all industries. 
So Smashing Magazine wrote a b
eginner's guide to Progressive 
Web Apps, business insider wrote
 about how they are blurring the
 lines between mobile and web, 
and Marketing Land, targeted at 
digital marketers, talked about 
Progressive Web Apps can be the 
next biggest thing.  It is terri
fic to see that developers and m
arketers are all interested in 
these technologies.  
And so, Darin talked about the 
importance of your web audience 
being a world-wide audience and 
we have seen high interest from 
developers globally.  After a 
progressive web app summit in 
Amsterdam last June, we held vie
wing parties across the world 
and these are folks that came to
 watch together with other Googl
eers and other developers in the
 region.  
17,000 developers showed up 
across 35 countries to show the 
enormous momentum and excitement
 for wanting to build these new 
technologies. 
And this tweet, there was a view
ing party in Bangladesh, 300 
attendees and they formed a 
human PWA and tweeted this out. 
Favorite tweet of all time. 
We are seeing interest large and
 small across various industries
 building Progressive Web Apps. 
And I wanted to take a moment 
here and talk to you about 
Progressive Web Apps and build r
eal-life partner stories to get 
inspiration for how you are 
approaching it in your respecti
ve companies. 
It is amazing to see progressive
 web app take a life of it's o
wn, you are seeing the definiti
on go across the web ecosystem 
and it is great to see the comm
unity contribute to what is a 
progressive web app. d we will 
offer our definition and evolve 
it to a what makes sense for 
your site.  
And, ultimately, it is about 
improving the web user experi
ence, probably you saw in Darin
's talk.  We want to make sure t
hat you understand that your P
WAs are first and foremost about
 improving the user experience, 
making it fast, reliable, and en
gaging for it all all users. So 
the common question is: Does 
that mean I have to build a nati
ve app, a PWA, and a mobile s
ite? The answer is no.  The web 
experience should just become 
your progressive web app.  
And so, that means that your 
progressive web app should be i
ndexed just like any other websi
te.  We have also got a lot of 
questions about this as well, an
d so I wanted to just note that,
 we just
 most  posted an updated blog p
ost, where we talked about 
updated guidance in building Pr
ogressive Web Apps.  
And check that out, it was just 
posted yesterday. 
And so we wanted to let people 
know that building Progressive 
Web Apps is a journey, and so we
 wanted to offer up a framework 
for how to think about building 
a progressive web app, often peo
ple say it is inaccessible, th
ere are so many things that I h
ave to do, and so we wanted to s
ay, think about it as a journey,
 you can think about the ba
seline with https and manifest 
file and a couple other things 
and add more and more features 
over time.  An exemplary one is 
pushing your site to add more fe
atures, get faster loading ti
mes, provide a more reliable ex
perience offline and on flaky 
networks. 
So you don't have to track all o
f this up, we heard your feedb
ack and we are putting together 
a baseline and exemplary check l
ist of things to fix, devel
opers.Google.com/Webpack config
urati
onconfiguration/Webpack conf
iguration  web for a centralal 
resource on building on the web.
Darin talked about Lighthouse an
d think about it as a person
alized site for the web to beco
me more progressive.  So with 
the check list, lighthouse CUB, 
and testing on devices, you will
 be out to a great progressive 
web app. 
And we will not talk about Serv
iceWorker and APIs, there's a lo
t of sessions about that, but we
 will dig into the impact of 
Progressive Web Apps and why it 
is a big deal for your users and
 your business. 
I worked -- I had the fortunate 
opportunity to work really 
closely with a number of 
partners across the globe.  It 
has been awesome to have folks 
share stats, we want them to c
ontribute to the ecosystem and 
talk about the awesomeness of w
hat they are experiencing after 
they shipped a progressive web a
pp.  So I wanted to run through 
a couple different Progressive W
eb Apps in different stages to 
show the diversity of approa
ches, regions, and industries.  
So Darin talked about alibaba, 
the world's largest marketplace,
 and  the scale is huge and they
 are seeing a 76 percent incr
ease in convergence.  That is g
reat, but you want to make sure 
that users are coming back to 
your site time and time again.  
And so I wanted to talk about ho
w they saw than increase on ios 
on active users and a 30 percent
 bump in Android. And that bump 
can be attributed to the open 
rate of push notifications is 
comparable to the native app. 
And Housing.com is a major growi
ng online real estate platform 
in India, we are seeing incredib
le innovation like FlipKart and 
housing with Progressive Web 
Apps.  And housing hels users to
 gain market traction.  This is 
something that marketing is thi
nking about, bringing in new use
rs and how much it costs.  
 Housing looked at how much they
 were spending a getting an app 
download versus getting a user 
to go to the website.  It costs 
about $3.75 to get users to dow
nload an Android app.  How much 
do you think it is costing to 
get them to the mobile website? 
75 cents? 80? 50? 7 cents.  
So I wanted to pause and we will
 observe the difference here and
 how much cheaper it is to get t
he user to the mobile website. 
So maybe you are seeing, well, 
the app users are more loyal, so
 maybe you are worth it.  But fo
r that single app download, you 
can reach 53 mobile web users.  
And so that is 53 potential r
e-engagement opportunities.  
And Housing is operateing with 
millions of users, so you  getti
ng more to the website effici
ently is a no-brainer.  
People should take pictures of i
t and send it to the marketing t
eam. 
[ Laughter ]. 
And it is not about getting use
rs to the site experience, you 
want to make sure that they are 
getting a really good user exp
erience when they arrive.  So 
with housing, you are seeing fa
ster page loads and an increase 
in convergence:   The folks from
 Housing are talking tomorrow m
orning, check it out, the second
 talk of the day. 
I will turn to West Elm, we have
 seen adoption in other parts of
 the world and we are seeing 
more and more here in the U.S. 
It is a modern furnishings compa
nies , on its way to doing 2 bil
lion in revenue from online, the
y rely on the app to give the be
st user experience possible.  
And you can see from your own h
abit, you are seeing a growing 
number of users shopping on mobi
le devices.  So I will demo an 
early be
ta that they just launched yest
erday.  
SPEAKER: I have it on my home s
creen, so one of the tenants of 
them watching it, they wanted it
 to be an immersive experience, 
so you are dropped right into 
this West Elm experience, you c
an scroll, everything is super 
smooth, you see the navigation o
n top, they took a lot of cues 
from social applications, so it 
is highly visual.  I ca
n tap in herehere, and I want to
 go through an example of a desk
 I bought from West Elm.  So i
nstead of me searching, I can to
  tap, look at home f furniture,
 desks, office, and as I'm scro
lling through, this is a desk I 
purchased and this is what I s
howed my sister the desk I b
ought.  A very magazine-type e
xperience, and this is the type 
of user experience that we are 
hoping all of you are inspired 
to build. 
And so this is what we, you 
know, focusing -- we talk a lot 
about performance and making su
re that your site is super fast,
 but I think that we really thi
nk that West Elm is a great exam
ple of how to re-think your user
 in actions for today's audience
, about
 casually consuming and being 
inspired about things.  Maybe 
the user will not buy, but they 
want to browse in their downt
ime.  So you can check out the 
url there.
I will turn to Latin America, 
infobae is one of Argentina's d
igital media networks and we are
 starting to see growing inter
est in Latin America for it all 
of these web 
technologies.  
 Infobae's motivation was speed.

rcent of traffic is on mobile.
They took inspiration from The W
ashington Post progressive web 
app demo from I/O and they work
ed with the Post team to roll 
out their progressive web app 
and we can see that the infob
ae's pages are loading in less 
than a second and they are cachi
ng it for offline experience. 
And so you can see in the demo 
from Darin, this is a smooth re
ading experience and what news s
hould be and re resilient to fl
aky networks as well. 
We will talk about Lyft, and 
this is another great use case. 
If you are familiar, Lyft is an 
on-demand ride sharin
g network, app only for a long 
time and they wanted to reach 
users across all platforms, r
each and user acquisition are c
ritical.  
They rolled out an M site, there
 was an article about rolling it
 out for the first time a few w
eeks ago to test the waters, th
ey had internal metrics they are
 looking at and after a month, 
they saw a 5 times more rides t
han expectsd coming through the 
mobile web.  So people are pro
bably wanting to book rides be
fore they download an app.  Here
 is a gif 06  of the user
 experience, after they saw the 
success of the M sites, they wan
ted to build a progressive web a
pp.  And the goal right now is t
o achieve future party with the 
Native American native web app. 
 And they launched yesterday and
 the team will iterate and add 
more and more features over time
. 
So it is about making sure they 
can deliver an experience for a
ll users, regardless of the plat
form they are on.  And they don
't want to have people download 
the app if they didn't need to. 
And I wanted to point out, they 
are trying to achieve feature p
arty by reducing the download si
ze.  They were gracious enough 
to share some of their stats aro
und -- 17 mega bits for Android 
and the progressive web app is 
less than 1 megabyte.  So the te
am is here and they will kick o
ff with housing as they dive int
o building a progressive web app
 and the benefits of being able 
to deploy, update, and e
xperiment quickly for the web.  
And is  so, what I wanted to t
alk about stats little bit, we 
will talk about Make My Trip in 
India, one of the largest travel
 sites in India.  And they dug 
into differences in user behavi
or between the native experience
 and the mobile web experience. 

liar with the India market, up 
to 90 percent of users will uni
nstall the app in six months.  
For an infrequent purchase like 
travel, it can be hard to remain
 on the user device.  After bein
g on the market for a few mont
hs, they shared some
 views about their site. 
Half of Progressive Web Apps are
 the same day reservations, and 
it turns out that these are gen
erally last-minute users, they 
want to book right away and p
refer to do so on the mobile w
ebsite.  So when you want to get
 something done, you want to get
 it done, you don't want to wait
 for a download. 
And the other
 fascinating stat is in fak taki
ng a closer look, the progressiv
e web app visitors were booking 
three times more.  
And this shows that had web is 
great at fulfilling the immediac
y of intense.  And they showed t
he destination cities are much 
more wide spread for progressive
 web app versus native app users
, that people are booking once t
hey arrive on site and they want
 to get a booking done as quic
kly as possible. 
So really terrific stats to give
 us insights into the different 
user behavior, and so they are 
going to -- they have a native a
pp experience and that will ad
dress and be great for a speci
fic audience and then they are 
also building a great progress
ive web app experience. 
And so, I just wanted to make s
ure that, you know, I talked a 
lot about a bunch of these comp
anies, Sea  see the

talk about how to get started.  
You can see how it can imPABLTH 
pact your business, but how to 
get started? So you have to look
 at the different user experien
ce and figure out what you want 
to tackle first.  Sometimes you 
can tackle the envire site, so
metimes you can do a section, 
like CNET Tech Today, and if you
 a larger brand, it is easier to
 start with a smaller STITE  sit
e to become familiar with the t
echnologies and then extend to 
your flag ship.  I will walk you
 through a journey the Wealther 
Channel did the last year.  
Weather.com is a top 20 site in 
the U.S., delivering billions of
 forecasts around the world.  An
d weather is focused on innovati
on and new technologies and it b
ecame interested in how it can b
uild a much better mobile expe
rience.  The journey started 18 
months ago when they had to road
 map what to do.  And you will 
prioritize, tradition HTTPS r
ight now, and we will talk about
 HTTP2 as well.  It was not easy
 with ads and analytics, but ge
tting easier as third parties 
are prioritizing HTTPS as well. 
And in November, they rolled out
 push web notetifications in 30 
and then 62 languages.  In the 
first three months of rolling 
out notifications, they say a 
million opt-ins.  And now they 
are reaching a whole new audienc
e with web push notifications. 
nd more recently, they integrat
edintegrated SWORKers over into 
the progressive web app.  They 
decided to tackle the internat
ional sites first and rolled out
 Progressive Web Apps in 178 cou
ntries, seeing growing traffic 
in China, India, and Mexico.  An
d the weather app team is always
 trying to improve the overall 
experience.  They have been hap
py enough working with these tec
hnologies and seeing some gains 
here that they are planning to e
xpand to a progressive web app f
or the flagship U.S. site in 201
7.  
And I think I really want to t
ell the story, you hear a lot a
bout, I cannot do it in the next
 three months, I cannot figure 
out how to prioritize.  
And given some of
 you that have legacy sites, we 
need to take a step back and see
 how long it will take and what 
it will mean.will not be over ni
ght, think of it like a journey.
And so I wanted to kind of maybe
 walk through the approaches to 
building Progressive Web Apps 
and, I aknow, I have offered up 
a diverse set of sites in how th
ey start building PWAs.  We star
ted to notice patterns in how pe
ople are approaching it, right? 
So some folks are luck e enough 
to build new from the ground up 
and transition experience imme
diately, some will want to ship 
a beta to test and experiment 
with the intention of transitio
ning over a longer time, and so
me want to build on the existing
 experience, integrating APIs in
directly. 
So Housing and CNET are two exa
mples, where they could build ne
w experience from the ground up,
 and I think that they are, you 
know, that that's -- that was th
e right approach for them, Hou
sing for the whole site and CNET
 for a sub-section of the site. 
And with the beta, the demo with
 West Elm, they could not 
transition right away and it was
 tough to describe what the exp
erience would be like.  
Before they got to a beta, they 
built a demo and they showed it 
to the senior leadership. And so
 now they are going to move to 
the beta, the early beta, by the
 end of the year and then the p
ublic beta next year, which is a
 great path and they will move t
he site over time.  
And they will continue to itera
te and bring more futures to the
 PWA.
And as far as existing sites, we
 talked about the Wealther Chan
nel.  Make My Trip started first
 with the hotels section of the
ir site, and then they expanded 
to flight and now they are going
 to continue to add other secti
ons to bring into kind of the 
progressive web app fold. And so
 there's no right way, or wrong 
way, to build a progressive web 
app.  I just wanted to offer kin
d of a framework, as you are goi
ng back to your team and saying,
 section whole site, new, Beta, 
existing, just to get the conver
sations started in terms of how 
to start building. 
And looking ahead, there will be
 tons of great sessions today, a
nd I wanted to kind of talk ab
out how Progressive Web Apps 
really is, you know, we talked 
about engagement, conversion, we
 don't need to, you know, know 
all the marketing terms in the 
bottom and the Progressive Web A
pps is a term for improving the 
mobile web experience. 
And then, you know, accelerate 
mobile pages, if you are having 
a lot of traffic coming from sea
rch and other platforms, we can 
get users quickly from the site 
to the top of the funnel and we 
will have an AMP and PWA session
 where we will talk about Amp in
stalling a ServiceWorker, transi
tion to progressive web app, and
 how Amp is used inside of a pr
ogressive web app, we get a lot 
of questions about that. r some 
of you, push notephics notephics
 notephicsifications is what you
 can do over the next few months
 to re-engage users quickly, wh
at Carnival did. nd what I want 
to highlight, conversion such a 
pain point, typing is painful on
 the mobile web.  We have done a
 disservice by not trying to do 
more here, we are now.  So 
seamless sign in and one-tap che
ck out are great sessions so you
 can understand, get users into 
the experience, build an engagi
ng experience and make sure that
 they convert and close on them.
So it is about radically impro
ving the overall web experience.
  And it is over the last year, 
we have heard the excite 
mentfrom building and invoivati
ng on the web.  It is a journey 
and it requires constant iterat
ion, probably patience, as we 
are trying to figure out how you
 are going to construct your 
back-end to filt  fit in with th
e progressive web app architect
ure and I hope you see the enor
mous momentum and what people ar
e seeing with success with the b
usiness metrics. 
And speaking of iteration, I spo
ke of building a fridge for my 
son that didn't stick.  I tried 
again, this is a hotel room k
SPEAKER: If you have log-in p
roblems, they are filtering 
through slowly, which leads to 
the first question of the day.  
What is
 Google sign-ins rate limit for 
log ins per second? 
300, 800, 1200, or 20? You 
should have the questions on yo
ur phones now and should pick an
 answer.  Don't forget to submit
, you can submit as many times 
as you would like.  We will take
 a look at how the audience is 
voting. 
This is a live out put of how 
you are all voting, and now we 
have randomized position of all 
of these dials, but it looks 
like one is in the lead, the o
thers 
are doing well, so get your 
answers in, we will close the 
question shortly.  This is 
tense, isn't it? 
SPEAKER: Yeah, we want music so 
tense that people feel like if 
they are in the bottom 50 pe
rcent, they might be executed.
So, let's close 
the question.  , the most 
popular answer was 20.  What is 
the correct a
nswer, as far as we can tell? It
 is
 20.  
We will hit some kind of leave, 
or it makes that for some reason
 So, of everything, I thought it
 would be my goal that would be 
reality -- we will be back 
throughout the day with some 
questions that have scores 
attached to them, that one didn
't, so don't worry about it.
In the meantime, we will go to a
 break SPEAKER: And before we do
 so, we are overwhelmed with how
 many folks have come in today. 
SPEAKER: And log-in requests. 
SPEAKER: Thank you to all of you
 that have come here TOORD 
today, if you are standing at 
this point in time, we have open
ed up the Google developer's 
launch pad nearby, there is food
 and seating.  So if you are s
tanding, find the help desk in 
the lobby area and there is t
ransportation to take you across
 there so you can be more comfo
rtable. 
And as jake concern  said, for 
everybody else as well, there's 
a break.  
SPEAKER: 11:45, thank you 
very much.

So the actual order of things is

will turn to the next speakers, 
which is -- we're going to be 
opening with 
sabin.  -- Sabin Borosay. you, 
I'm a product management for the
 Chrome team working ona 
thentthentication.  As you heard
 earlier in the keynote, 
Progressive Web Apps will reduce
 flows and create engaging user 
experiences.  We have given you 
tools around reliability, and to
 create experiences by adding 
Progressive Web Apps to the home
 screen.  We will focus on 
missing flows: Sign-in and 
payments.  will spend the next 
half hour talking to you about 
how Chrome is helping to remove 
friction from your sign in flows
 by making it easier in a simple
 and secure way.  The first 
step, of course, is getting 
users signed up.  And we all 
know  entering the information 
in long registration forms can 
be frustrating.  This is what it
 looks like when I enter my 
credentials, the stalts confirm 
this.  Half of users would 
rather abandon a service than go
 through another registration 
form.  We have a huge 
opportunity to reduce friction 
in the sign-up flow and drive 
growth and conversion and let 
Chrome helps you do this.  It 
offers auto functionality that 
makes it easier for users to 
fill out the forms f
aster an easier.  Sometimes it 
is ambiguous, it is not true 
which is the user name, the 
identifier, the user name or the
 e-mail address? It is unclear 
to the user, to the browser for 
sure.  But the best thing to do 
with ambiguity is to be 
explicit, and an easy way to be 
explicit here is to mark up the 
forms with auto completely 
attributes and they can work 
perfectly with password auto 
save and it will take a few 
minutes.  now that we have the 
user signed up, the question is,
 how to keep them signed in? 
Maybe like this, there are 
already buttons on the top and y
ou have to remember which one 
you used last time, or if you 
used the user name and password 
and you have to remember which 
password you used.  So as you 
see a lot of things to remember.
  And let me now ask you a quick
 question here: How many people 
in this room have run into an 
experience where they create an 
account for a site and, bam, get
 this message that the account 
already exists? eah, quite a 
few.   as you can see, it is 
full of friction and there are 
so many drop-off points along 
the way.  And
 the stats showed this here: 
According to a study, 92 percent
 of users would rather leave a s
ite than re-set the log-in 
information if they forgot their
 passwords.  That is 92 percent 
of people leaving, think about 
that. And how much is a sign-in 
user worth to your business? So 
a huge opportunity to get all 
those users that are abandoning 
the sign-in screens today to be 
signed in, if we just make 
things a bit easier. For 
example, like this, when the 
user returns to your site, it 
would be better if it they could
 just skip the sign-in form and 
go straight to an engaging and 
personalized experience, and 
that means knowing who they are
e. question is: Why is that so 
hard? Because sign-in flows 
today are limited in ways the 
browser is not.  So leveraging 
to position of the browser here 
is really the key because if a 
user is seemingly new to you, 
they are not new to the browser.
 that's what we are focused on, 
making signing
 in easier in a secure way t
hrough the browser.  We do it 
through an API, the Credential 
Management AP before we dive 
into that, let's assume for a 
moment that we have a really 
dedicated user and they found 
that they are ready for all of 
these possibilities and 
successfully signed into your 
site.   so, are we done now?  
not quite  users typically don't
 stay signed in forever, unlike 
our native apps.  a unique 
challenge that we are facing 
here on the web, the different 
text interfaces and models.  
Think about CSRF or 
click-checking.  So session 
management on the web is really 
hard and, as a result of that, 
they have very different 
requirements for session 
management on the web and on 
native.  And, one interesting 
thing we can do with SWORKers 
-- service Workers so we can 
re-fresh the short link token.  
If you are interested in the i
dea, you can go to the blog 
post.  So there are avenues like
 this to explore for the l
ong-term.  But an easy way to 
handle this is using the 
Credential Management API.  It 
moves users from a state in 
which they are frequently 
automatically signed out into a 
state which they can be 
automatically signed back in.   
good.   it is a web platform 
API, standards-based, and it 
allows the browser to facilitate
 the sign-in process with 
information stored from the 
user, it does it in a 
frictionless FASHZ  fashion and 
works across devices.  We 
shipped the API this year and 
announced it in Google Ilaunch, 
we have seen a bunch of 
developers shipping it like you 
can see here and we wanted to 
look at two common problems that
 we are trying to sort  for this
 API.  So on some sites, 
ecommerce, sign-in is not 
required, it is helpful, but not
 necessary. So, on those sites, 
the Credential Management API 
can automatically sign the user 
in right on the home page.  And 
that is basically what you see 
here indicated with that small 
blue button on the bottom of the
 screen, the toast, and the user
 is being auto-signed in here 
right on the home page.  And, as
 mentioned earlier, we know that
 on the web, sessions often ex
pire very frequently.   within a
 day, sometimes even within an 
hour, 10 minutes, and so that 
means, on those sites basically 
every time the user returns to 
the site they are on a signed 
out state and it requires the 
dedication for the user to click
 on the sign-in button and be 
signed in. We know that most 
services can provide better 
experiences to users if they are
 signed in, but that is not 
always immediately clear to the 
user.  They may not see the 
value proposition of signing in 
right away, it is better if you 
can just automatically sign them
 in right on your home page, 
like I
 mentioned, on any leaf page a 
user will land through a search.
 AliExpress, they have seen an 
11 percent in increase of 
conversion rates for users who 
made a transaction, that is 
users who signed in through the 
API versus users who did not 
sign in through the API.  And 
they have seen some really good 
UX improvements, like an 85 
percent drop in sign-in failure 
on the drop, or a 65 percent d
ecrease in time spent signing 
in. And The Guardian has seen a 
44 percent increase on users 
signed in on two or more devices
 across Chrome and Android.  And
 another common problem that we 
are trying to solve for this API
 is the taskforce managers today
 are not really equipped well to
 remember the federated s
ign-ins, whether  when you sign 
in with Facebook or with Google,
 it means that the users often 
create duplicate accounts, as 
you know, because they just 
forgot that they already had an 
account.   the Credential 
Management API can also help 
here because it can remember for
 the user that I signed in with 
such a federated account.  
Pinterest is a website that 
offers federated sign-in 
options, too, and they have seen
 a 10 percent increase in 
desktop web log ins for eligible
 users after they ship the API 
and a 33 percent increase in 
user engagement.  now, even if 
users switch between devices, 
which is pretty common today, 
and let's say they download the 
native app for the servers, they
 can continue the signed-in e
xperience.  They just need to be
 signed in with the same Google 
account, and we call this 
password smart look-up of 
passwords.  If you want to 
enable the cross platform 
experience, you can do the 
mapping between the native 
website and the app and do the 
smart web passwords APIs for the
 native app.  hand it over to 
show you the Credential 
Management API in
 practice.  
 Thank you, I will show you a 
Credential Management API in a 
demo in a site called polymer 
shop, that we introduced at 
Google I/O 
this year.  
 this is the polymer shop web
website.  Imagine that we are 
going through a guest check-out 
experience and I'm about to 
create an account.  So the first
 thing I should do is to enter 
my e-mail address, so tap on it,
 and now I see my e-mail address
 pop up.  
 the -- the nice thing about 
this, the feature allows me to 
use the e-mail address I have 
put into this browser in the po 
I can just tap to enter my 
e-mail address and enter a 
random password, and sign up.   
now, you will see a pop-up at 
the bottom of the page, asking m
e if I want to store the 
credential information.  It is 
nice.  so, I can just save.  So,
 now my browser remembers my ID 
and password for me.  So, what 
I'm going to show you now is an 
old sign-in in action. to make 
this demo exciting, what I'm 
going to do is to swap this 
device with a 
new one.   see as soon as I tap 
on this icon, I will be signed 
into the same 
  two,
 three.   I'm signed in. 
 ]. So, what happened here is t
hat the credential information I
 have stored to the browser, to 
the other device, was 
synchronized across my Google 
account and propagated to this 
device.  And as soon as I 
learned it on the same website, 
the Credential Management API 
picked up the credential 
information and let me 
authenticate and sign in.   
sometimes you might want to keep
 signed out, in that case, you 
can simply sign out.  That way, 
you will not be signed out for 
the f truly frictionless sign-in
 experience.  If I talk about 
frictionless sign-in experience,
 you must imagine fritative 
log-ins.  As Sabin mentioned, 
like Facebook log-in, or M
icrosoft, yahoo, Twitter, 
GitHub, etc., we have a Google 
sign-in option right here.  So I
 will sign in.  I will sign in 
with a single tap.  What is new 
here is that if you look at the 
bottom of the pagepage, I see a 
similar pop-up show up.  So I 
can store my identity 
information to the browser, like
 Sabin mentioned.  can store the
 federated log-in information to
 the browser.  far, I have two a
ccounts stored to this browser. 
 What happens if I try to sign 
in? Let me sign off again and 
try to sign in by pressing the b
 now, what you see is a dialogue
 asking me to sign in with two 
accounts.  So I can simply tap 
on one of them to get signed in.

 -- you might notice I did not 
type a single letter using a 
software keyboard.  This is 
really frictionless sign-in e
xperience.   let's get back to 
the
 slide.  the benefit of
  Credential Management API, it 
allows for sign-in across 
devices and enables a permanent 
session.   remembers federated 
accounts for me.  And I can use 
account chooser to skip forms 
without typing a single letter 
using software keyboard.  say 
Credential Management API 
eliminated a whole bunch of 
frictions from the sign-in e
xperience, right?  how can you, 
as a developer, bring a similar 
experience to your own website? 
So I'm
 going to dive into that.   
first thing you should do is to 
save credential information to 
the browser.  The forms such as 
sign up, sign in, or change 
password is a great chance for 
users to store their credential 
information to the browser.  So,
 there's a few steps.  First, 
interrupt the form submission, 
then send a request to the 
server using AJAX, then store 
the credential information and 
then update the UI using a 
profile.   moving forward, just 
make sure that your form is 
annotated well using the 
autocomplete attribute that 
Sabin mentioned earlier.   that,
 when the user submits a form, 
prevent default, update, and 
prevent default and interrupt it
 to proceed to the next page.  
Why is that?  the page t
ransition happens, this will 
move to the next page, which 
means that credential 
information user has put into 
the previous page will be lost 
in the
By making the authentication 
call using AJAX, you can retain 
the information in the same page
 while verifyingMake sure to 
create an API on the server side
 which responds with the ATP 
code, so that it can respond 
with the correct -- correctly to
 tell the browser that the 
authentication was successful or
 not.   with a profile 
information
 would be ideal.  So, after the 
authentication, you can store 
the credential now.   doing so, 
make sure that API is available.
  Always keep in mind about the 
progressive enhancement.  
 store the credential 
information, 
instantiate the credentials 
management and then call up 
credentials.store.  If the API 
is not available, you can skip 
this step and forward the 
profile information to the next 
step.  Once everything goes 
well, you can update the UI or 
proceed to the personalized page
 and you're done.   in cases 
where you -- where your website 
has federated log-ins, here is 
what you should do.  So 
federated log-ins, as Sabin 
mentioned, are a concept of s
igning into a website using a 
third-party identity, such as G
oogle, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.
  a federated log-in is based on
 a standard protocol, such as 
open ID connect.  There are two 
benefits of using it, the user 
does not have to remember the 
extra pass word to sign into 
your website, and the second is 
that, in general, the users can 
sign into your website just by 
one tap.  There are a few steps.
  First, authenticate the user 
with the identity provider and 
then store the credential 
information and update the UI.  
So by tapping on the button, you
 will kick start the 
authentication flow.   in order 
to authenticate the user using 
identity provider, we should -- 
you should use the libraries 
provided by many different 
identity providers.  Google, we 
provide Google sign-in, F
acebook, the Facebook log in.  
And I will skip this step, it is
 complex and just assume that 
you get authenticate 
authenticateed and get the 
profile information. nce the 
user is authenticated, 
instantiate an object, called 
federated credential.  In this 
case, you are not storing ID and
 password, you are storing the 
identity of the user signing 
into the identity provider and 
the stream that represents the 
identity provider itself.  and 
icon URL is an option, and then 
call navigator.credential.store.
  The rest of the steps are 
similar to what I have mentioned
 in previous sections, so let me
 skip that.   the most exciting 
part of 
using Credential Management API 
is auto sign-in.  That can 
happen anywhere on your website 
as long as you think it is aFor 
example, top page, of course, is
 a great place to use alt sign 
in.  But some leaf pages, news 
articles, or pages in the 
ecommerce website is a great 
place to enable alt sign-ins. s
o, you get a credential in
formation, and then you 
authenticate the user and then 
update the UI.  Before getting a
 credential, make sure that the 
user is not already signed in, 
otherwise it doesn't make much 
sense, right?  in order to get a
 credential, call 
navigator.credentials.get.  By 
giving it a password as a 
federated option as parameters, 
you can fish by the type of 
credential information you want 
to get.  And by
 giving it 
unmead unmediated true, it will 
not show any UI for asking the 
user to choose from.   it will 
return and define if the user 
has no credential information, 
or there are multiple 
credentials stored, or the user 
is signed
 out. solved, you will receive a
 credential object.  But if that
 is undefined, which means that 
alt sign in didn't happen.  So 
you can just dimiss the whole 
process and pretend like as if 
nothing happened.  And, if you 
didn't get a credential object, 
examine the type and run the 
authentication flow depending on
 the type of credential.  So the
 authentication flow is similar 
to what I described in previous 
sefinally, you can update the UI
 using the profile.   tip I 
should note here is that, if you
 did get a credential but failed
 to authenticate, that is going 
to be a little bit trouble 
because the user sees the blue 
bar popping up saying that the 
user is signing in, but it 
failed if there is no sign of 
the failure, the user is 
confused.  So you should show an
 error message, in this case.   
when the user is signed out, you
 should disable auth in. so, 
sign in the user first, and then
 call 
navigator.credentials.require 
usermediation.  This will turn 
off the alt sign in future.  
when the user is trying to sign 
in, you can show account chooser
 so the user can select the 
account to sign in with.   will 
also count with the 
auto sign in feature back So 
there's a few steps, choose the 
account chooser, and once the 
user selects the accounts, you 
will receive credential 
information and then you can 
secure the user and update the 
UI, finally.  So in most cases, 
this is similar to what I have 
described for auto sign-in.  o, 
by users' explicit action, such 
as typing in on the sign-in 
button, we will show -- we will 
let the account chooser to show 
up by calling 
navigator.credentials.get.  But 
this time, with unmediated:  
This will show the account c
hooser, when the user makes 
multiple users stored or when it
 is signed out.  steps are 
similar to auto sign-in, like I 
said.  But except one thing: If 
the user didn't choose any of 
the accounts, or dismissed the 
accountaccount chooser, that 
means there is no account that 
the user intended to sign in 
with, which means that the user 
wants to sign in with other ac
count.  should show sign-in form
 so that the user can enter the 
other credential information and
 let it The Brothers Chaps user 
sign in and store 
another credential.   described 
a lot of complex stuff, but we 
have documents of this.  So you 
can
 just follow 
G.CO/credentialmanagementAPI to 
follow this API and we are 
working on a more indyin-detail 
document, it will be
 tweeted today or tomorrow 
tweeted with that hashtag.  With
 that, I will hand it over to S
].  Thanks, so we talked about 
session management and how to 
remove friction in your sign-in 
flows by using the Credential 
Management API that we shipped 
earlier this year.  But there's 
one thing we haven't talked yet 
about today, and we would love 
to hear your feedback on that: 
That's the account verifications
 step during sign-up.  When you 
sign in for an account, you have
 to verify the account by 
digging up an e-mail, clicking 
on the verification link, or by 
copying and pasting the OTP 
one-time password from the SMS 
back into the site.  What we h
eard from developers is about 20
 to 30 percent of the users drop
 off at this step because it is 
another thing that adds 
friction.  gives APIs to handle 
this for native apps, and apps 
with these APIs see higher 
conversion rates. So we are now 
exploring whether we can bring 
something similar to Chrome and 
the web, and again, we would 
love to hear your feedback on 
this problem in general, either 
via the feedback form, you can 
see here, or you can come and 
see us in person.  We will be 
around looking forward to me
eting you, thanks.  ]. 
 Eiji and 
Sabine!  earlier, a reminder
reminder, if you are standing 
up, please make yourselves known
 at the desk at the front.  We 
will get across to the Google 
Developers launch pad, and if 
you go, there's a gift card in 
there for you as well.  Jake, 
you are right to doing MCing for
 the rest of the day?  
conferences, you are paid to 
come here, whereas we are paying
 people to leave.   not normally
 how it works. yet, here we are.
  we get on with the next talk? 
Is . e absolutely should. Here, 
to talk about the web of web 
payments, a man some people Call
 Zach Cook. It is 
Zach  Zach Koch!   like to make 
dramatic entrances, I'm Zach, a 
product management on the Chrome
 team and I spend most of my 
days thinking about how we can 
make payments on the web, on the
 mobile web easier, less p
ainful, and all-around letter 
experiences for our 
YURZ.   Users.  I'm excited 
about the Credential Management 
API, especially somebody who 
talks to ecommerce all day long 
and high-engagement and easy 
sign in is critical think that 
registration forms are 
difficult, we will talk about c
heck-out forms.  A lot more form
 fields and a lot more 
questions.  You are going to see
 a consistent theme emerging 
through the talks here today, 
which is that one of --  browser
 help you.  are certain 
advantages that we have as a b
rowser, especially when it comes
 to reducing friction and making
 life easier for users, 
especially around repetitive 
data sets, things that users can
 store in the browsers.  We are 
trying to expose APIs and give 
you tools to reduce friction for
 your users, we saw that in 
credential management and in 
payments.  some activity before 
we go for lunch, which are some 
questions.  question: How many 
people here enjoy the process of
 buying something on the web 
using a mobile
 device? Good, some people.  And
 by and large, no.  We should 
come talk, I love to hear what 
you love about buying things on 
the mobile web and what you 
don't as question: How many 
people can remember all the 
details of their credit card? 
16-digit number? Really, CDC and
 expiration? That is number than
 expected, I gotta be  be hWe 
are still 15 percent, I have 
been doing payments for 18 
months and I have yet to 
remember a credit card number.  
is great.  many people enjoy the
 process of handing overall of 
their sensitive credit card 
information to a random, 
third-party server? ].  almost 
like I'm asking these questions 
in a lead-up to a particular 
point, and there is a point.  
And the reality is that most 
users find payment difficult, 
insecure, scary, and frightening
 and the process of doing it on 
the mobile web particularly bad.
  We have this number, we talked
 about it at I/O as well, and on
 average, we see 66 percent 
fewer conversions on mobile than
 desktop.  And we think that 
there's an answer to that, an 
all around high-friction, the 
difficulty, and issues around 
trustworthyness and security.   
talk about how we are addressing
 those today and how we will 
bring fast, secure payments to 
the web plat ormplatform.   
little too PM-y for me, I 
have a message from inside the 
Chrome team, from saving the 
world from annoying check outs. 
 a joke, the Better Payments 
Bureau a few months ago and it 
became a  good fight against 
annoying check out forms for 
many years, we started with 
autofill, you are probably 
familiar with it.  is my one 
slide on it, not really the 
topic today, but consider this 
my 10-second plea to see, if 
nothing else, leave today and 
set autocomplete types on your 
check out forms. It helps use, 
the users, the browsers, and 
ensures 100 percent accuracy on 
autofill.  not here to talk 
about that today, I'm here to 
talk today about PaymentRequest,
 which is the new API that we 
are building for the web to 
really help solve a lot of the 
problems I have been talking 
about.   before I talk about 
what PaymentRequest is, I want 
to talk about what 
PaymentRequest isn't.  Payment 
is complicates,complicates,ed 
and there's a lot of players in 
the space and I want to 
alleviate any conclusion.  
PaymentRequest is not a new 
payment method, we are not 
trying to make Chrome pay or b
rowser pay or another pay on 
your website.  Our goal is to 
help users pay the way they want
 to pay and do it quickly and e 
are not trying to become a 
gateway or processer or an 
entity that moves money in the 
ecosystem.  We are not trying to
 step on any toes here.  We 
think that the market has done 
an incredible job already, 
players like Stripe and 
Braintree have done an i
ncredible job over the last 
couple years of taking the 
complexity of online payments 
and making it simple.  They 
removed the burden of acquiing 
banks and some levels of PCI and
 put it into an easy-to-use API.
  so, our goal is to ensure that
 whatever we do plays really 
nicely with all of these 
gateways and processors, but 
that is not fundamentally our 
goal to become one.  The great t
hing about these services, 
though, is they focused s on 
developers, it makes your lives 
easier and easier to accept 
accept payments.  But you go 
from nothing to a user to 
everything, and form fills are 
the way that we do this.  
PaymentRequest was fundamentally
 built for users.   it is good 
for developers, too, and we 
think it is easy and we will 
talk about code samples, but my 
goal, I think about users and h
ow we can get them through the 
burdensome flows on mobile 
faster and more efficiently.  
what is PaymentRequest? Like I 
said, it is a new 
standards-based API, and s
tandards-based, I want to 
emphasize that.  We joined the 
web payments working group a 
couple years ago now and every 
major browser is a vendor, we 
have financial institutions from
 around the globe and we are 
trying really hard to build 
something that everyone can 
integrate and all forms cancan 
integrate so browsers can have 
the benefit of it.  We are in 
the early stages of it, but that
 is  when we started to think 
about -- designed what the API 
looked like, we had two goals in
 mind.  The first one, we wanted
 to build a seamless, easy to 
use
 check-out experience on mobile 
so users can minimize typing and
 friction as much possible.  
want to bring secure payments 
into the web platform.  The web 
is one of the last places where 
it is common place to exchange 
your sensitive information to an
 unknown third party.  And even 
though there's an answer to this
 from the payments community 
with regards to tokenization, 
the web did not have an answer 
for it this, which is why we are
 proud to bring Android Pay.   
in the event of data breach, 
users are protected and reduces 
the burden for you as developers
 and merchants.  So those are 
two high-level goals that we h
ad.   again, the idea here, just
 at a high-level, is if you 
think of your traditional 
check-out flow, it looks from 
2-5 pages, and you have some 
where between 10 and 40 form 
fields where you are asked a 
variety of questions: Name, age,
 address, credit card, e-mail, 
expiration. that are doing this 
on their device and they are 
like, nah and maybe go to 
desktop, and maybe not.  And 
Darin wanted talked about the 
growth of mobile and we want 
this to be easier.  The browser 
helps this role and facilitates 
check -out across the highest 
friction point.  take the common
 data and leverage our strengths
 for users to be before I show 
you a demo, I want to talk about
 what types of data is actually 
supported by a PaymentRequest.  
 the first one is probably a 
little bit obvious, but it is a 
form of payments.  So, at the 
end of the day, you need a way 
to actually request money from 
the ecosystem, you need a form 
of payment.  Right now, in 
Chrome, we support two, we 
support credit cards and Android
 Pay.  I put etc. On here 
because the plan is to support 
more, but I will talk about that
 a bit more later. 
 So you always have to request a
 form of payment, you cannot 
call PaymentRequest and not run 
a form of payment, that would be
 weird, and that would be 
request arbitrary user data API.
  the other thing we like to 
request is shipping address and 
shipping options, so for 
physical purchases, you can 
leverage the API to say, hey, 
give me the shipping address and
 there's a dynamic mechanism to 
take the shipping address with 
updated pricing, etc. You can re
quest a phone number, you can 
request an e-mail for sending 
receipts or prompting sign-up 
afterwards and, coming soon, in 
the next couple months, is pay 
your name support.  You can r
equest all of these or none if 
you want.  And the idea is to 
support a broad range of use 
cases out there.  So if you are 
a ride pick up service, you 
probably don't need -- you 
probably don't need everything, 
but you need a location, an 
address, and a name, or if you 
are physical good, you may or 
may not need the payer name 
because you will get that from 
the shipping address.  It is 
flexible and you can accommodate
 experiences as fits your 
business.  really important 
point here is that all of these 
data points can be stored and 
returned by the browser.  So, 
users, by and large, trust 
Chrome to store this data, their
 names, e-mails and credit card 
data.  And so the question is, 
why put users through the burden
 of a form they have to fill out
 manually and you saw Sabin's 
slide about fat fingering and 
the difficulty of keyboard 
typing and those problems are 
multiplied across the platform 
fields.  So if you can save the 
burden of doing that, that is 
worthwhile and PaymentRequest is
 designed to do t so let's go 
ahead and just sort of see it in
 action.   I will switch over to
 a demo here, excellent.  I will
 open up Chrome and I will use 
the exact same shop API, and you
 see it, it auto-signed me in.  
You have to love when a good 
demo goes, right? And otherwise,
 it is the same website, polymer
 shop demo, I will go a little 
bit further and make a purchase.
  I hit the shop now button, you
 know, I definitely don't have 
enough Google sweat shirts, so I
 will buy another one.  So 
standards shop, you will see 
that there's the size and 
quantity, and there are two 
buttons at the bottom, add to 
card and buy now:   That buy now
 is based on feature detection, 
if payment exists, if so, 
leverage it, if not, use rapid 
check out and tap the buy now 
button. And the payment sheet 
slides from the bottom, 
PaymentRequest in action.  You 
have natively drawn UI, but 
populated with data from the 
merchant.  The total amount is t
here, $22.15, it defaults to 
Android pay, if it is available,
 because it is faster and more 
secure. request the e-mail for a
 receipt and I need to select a 
shipping address.  It is 
difficult to ship a sweat shirt 
to someone if you don't know 
where it goes.  I tap on that, 
the sheet goes to full screen 
and the address is automatically
 populated for use.  are the two
 Google offices here, so I will 
ship to the one in San 
Francisco, where I work.  you 
can see that when I do that, the
 shipping options are populated 
there.  And so we have a free 
shipping in California option, 
or the express shipping.those, 
it will dynamically change the 
price.   that express shipping 
changes.  Why would I pay more, 
go back to zero, that makes more
 sense to me.  So I am ready to 
pay, hit the pay button, and you
 see the Android Pay screen, 
that slides up, we are running 
the test, it says unrecognized 
so you wouldn't have it.  And 
because I authenticated in the 
last couple minutes, I don't 
have to do morea authentication
morea a  authentication in 
android pay.  So the transaction
 is successful.  Android Pay, no
 typing, all I have to do is hit
 is select and confirm the 
shipping ad seamless, we are 
really excited about it. [ 
Applause ] just to show you that
 if you don't have Android Pay 
payable, no big deal, we can 
change the form of payment.  If 
I don't have Android Pay, I will
 default to the credit card, the
 visacard  that I have.  I will 
select the address and shipping 
options, and the only keyboard 
we cannot get rid of is the CDC 
input.  I will do 123.  I used 
to do a live credit card on 
this, it did not work for me.   
switched to a demo the same 
concept applies, this is 
client-side, it is all happening
 very fast and pretty great.  We
 are excited about that.   Now 
maybe we will switch back to the
 slides and talk about what it 
takes to make this actually 
happen.  So how do you leverage 
PaymentRequests? Well, it is 
pretty simple.  There are three 
parts to PaymentRequests, two 
are that are required and one 
that is completely optional.  We
 will talk about them in order. 
  the very first one are payment
 methods, we need to know 
basically all the ways that you 
can get paid.  This could be a 
wide variety of things in the 
futurefuture, I accept visa, 
mastermastercard, PayPal,
 etc., as long as people are 
built into the ecosystem.  We 
just launched, credit card 
support Android Pay.  It looks a
 little bit like this.  So we 
pass in this thing called method
 data, and method data is an 
array of objects and those 
objects each have an array of 
supportive payment method.  S.  
So I support credit cards, I 
support visa, mastercard, AMX, 
and 
discoverdiscover.  So we added 
granularity for debit, credit, 
or pre-pay, but for Visa, we 
assume you can accept all and 
don't have a differ e
ngs differentiation.  support 
Android Pay, there's an 
additional key inside of that o
bject, which is the data.  Data 
is a generic object, payment 
method specific.  And different 
payment methods out there have 
different dependencies, 
different things you pass in 
when you instantiate it by 
default.  So Android, you have 
to pass in the ID, what token 
you would like, network or 
gateway, and when a user chooses
 to pay with one of the forms of
 payment, we basically bundle it
 all up and pass it on to the 
payment app.   and then the 
payment app uses that data, plus
 origin and assertions from 
Chrome to verify that the 
payment app is the right one and
 so the payment can continue.  
So it is pretty simple, but the 
idea here is that you throw 
everything you can at the 
browser for ways that you accept
 payment.  if you can accept, l
ike, 100 different ways of 
payment around the globe, tell 
us the different ways to pay.  
If we find the spot in the i 
middle between the ways you can 
get paid and the user can pay 
you and optimize the experience 
for what makes the most  saw in 
the demo that Android Pay and a 
Visa card were available.  What 
if we removed Visa? It would not
 show up, that would not make 
any sense.  And as you go across
 the globe, there's a wide 
variety of ways to pay.  We will
 give the best experience to the
 user to optimize on their 
preferences and defaults and 
what is best for them.  And the 
second bit of data is important.
  Now that I know how I can pay 
you, we need to know how much 
money you want to get paid.   
this is what this looks
 like.  The most important thing
 is this attribute, the two 
parts: The first is a label.  So
 if we customize this, if you 
display total, it is total, it 
can be authorization, donation, 
whatever you want.  And you have
 to know an amount, that is 
composed of the total amount of 
money and the under lying 
currency code.  So the payment 
app that we transferred to knows
 what currency to charge in.  
support display items, so like I
 showed you, when I tapped on t
he total, the line items came 
down that shows you how the 
total amount was reached, we can
 support this.  It is fully 
optional, you can pass in if you
 want, or you can ignore it.  We
 recommend it, it is nice to 
give a high-level overview to a 
user about the things that 
inform the total amount, the 
things like the sub total, tax, 
shipping cost, etc. Less of a 
full itemized receipt and more 
of an o last thing, 
PaymentRequest does not do math.
  We are not good at floating 
point math.  If you pass in -- 
if you have two line items that 
sum to 5, the total says 4, 
we're not going to throw 
anything.  So you are in control
 of this thing, keep that in 
mind.  And by the way, there 
might be use cases where it 
makes sense for those not to a
lign, but by and large I wanted 
to point that ou other point to 
note, transaction details can 
include
 shipping options.  We support 
default shipping options.  We 
only recommend you use this if 
you are confident that your 
shipping options will not 
change, they are not dynamic.  
shipping and it never changes no
 matter what the address is, 
feel free to default populate t 
user address, we recommend wait 
until the user address event and
 you can use that to queer 
against the service to get pr
ices and populate populate this.
  And it can be over written at 
various points.  when I changed 
the shipping 
opisoption, the price and l
isting changed because we re-did
 those population details, so 
you have control over the events
 which is why you have the 
dynamic pricing model.  Don't do
 dynamic shipping opistions 
unless you have  are confident 
they are not going to change.  
the last is the extra set of 
options, user address, shipping 
support, name, e-mail, and 
phone, all entirely optional, 
but definitely an option.  The 
only drop off in the funnel is 
the pointal in the point is 
putting in the credit card.   
friction, there is a drop-off, 
so we recommend taking advantage
 of these pieces. There's a few 
that we support, it is as simple
 simple as passing in some
 bouillons RR.   that I don't 
want shipping, but I want a name
 and phone number, or I want an 
e-mail to send a receipt to, for
 example, it is configurable and
 the idea is to support a  a 
wide variety of use cases.  we 
are having coming soon in the 
next couple months is a shipping
 type value.  It is pretty 
simple, but let's say you are 
buying a pizza.  One does not 
ship a pizza, that is weird, we 
deliver them.  So it is an 
option to specify shipping, pick
 up, or delivery.  We call it 
shipping address in the system, 
but this way in the uI, the user
 would see I want my pizza d
elivered to this address.  Or if
 you are a ride-sharing service,
 you can say pick up at the 
address where you are located.  
That is the value of that 
particular thing.   minor but 
allows us to have a better user 
experience.  we will put that 
together and you have the whole 
experience that I talked about 
or just showed you.  first thing
 we do, we instantiate 
PaymentRequests and we pass the 
method data, the things that we 
support, we pass in the t
ransaction details, again, how 
much money, what currency code, 
what line item items do we want,
 and the optional options. In 
the case of our demo that we 
went through, that is request 
shipping true and request e-mail
 true.  Again, that is optional.
  again, I added the event 
listener to the address change. 
e have two events in the system,
 shipping address and shipping 
option change.  So you can 
receive the event, parse out the
 details, if the user selects a 
shipping address, the event 
fires, you can pull out the full
 shipping address, we don't just
 do the zip code because you 
cannot get fully accurate 
shipping information with a zip 
code.  You get the full user 
address and you can use that at 
that time to call up event 
update with, so it says browser,
 I'm thinking, I need to c
alculate, you can call in the 
back-up APIs and you can 
re1R5U6B8 solve the promise with
 updated transaction details, 
with the options and the error 
that says, we do not ship to 
wherever you are trying to ship 
to.  So that is supported.  so, 
and by instantiateing a P
aymentRequest, there is no UI 
that shows.  That is 
instangsiation.  When it comes 
from the bought 78 bottom, that 
is a call back show.  That 
returns a promise and then you 
have a payment response, that 
has the entire set of data, a 
JSON object, that you r a credit
 card, you know what the under 
lying network was, so Visa, M
astercard, credit card number, C
DC, e  expiration, etc.So 
thinking what they typed in the 
form, you will get it in a JSON 
response.  You will send it to 
the gateway or the server or in 
the case of APIs, directly to 
the APIs for tokenization.  It 
is up to you, it is plain text. 
 the responses, it is important 
to note, are method-specific.  
So, if you Selected Android pay 
as your form of payment, when 
the response comes back, it will
 look like an Android Pay r
esponse.  There's a key and it 
will tell you that the form of 
payment they chose is Android 
Pay and you have to expect that 
the Android details object is 
different than a credit card one
 or some other form of object, 
and that is because different 
payment methods have
 different requirementsr
equirements.   final step, we 
need you to tell us to close the
 UI. When we get the response 
back, we have a loading spinner 
and that is waiting for you to 
come back and let us know the 
result of the transaction.   
highly encourage, but do not 
require, that at the time that 
payment response comes back, you
 try to make the payment.  There
 are use cases where you cannot 
do that, things like 3D S flows,
 etc., but if you can submit, we
 recommend  so you call the 
complete with success, failure, 
or nothing.  This is an 
affordance for the browser to 
do, like, a special UI 
considerations in the events of 
success, a little animated check
 mark or something, it is 
totally optional.  the important
 thing, when the UI closes will 
actually resolve that promise 
and that promise is you cue that
 the UI has been torn down.  If 
you have animations or things 
you are trying to time with the 
close of that, wait for the 
promise to resolve and you will 
be guaranteed that any Chrome UI
 is stripped from the pSo that's
 it, the few experience. In a 
few lines of code,
 you get -- you help the user 
alleviate all of that friction 
and difficulty of typing in the 
annoying form fields.  Pretty 
simple, and With Android Pay and
 the future tokenized payment, 
you reduce the friction with 
CDC, memory, etc. And that is 
possible because the browser is 
the middle man proxying between 
the native apps in the device 
and the website that is 
requesting it.  the last few 
minutes, I want to talk about UX
 considerations in 
forward-looking stuff.  The 
first one is my bold hyperbolic 
statement to say: Kill the c 
that's a bit strong, but it is 
my way of saying if a user is 
coming to your site, or a lot of
 users are coming to the site on
 mobile that only make a single 
purchase, why put them through 
the burden of opening the cart, 
going to the cart, clicking on 
the review page -- them on 
mobile to optimize the 
experience so they can do it 
quickly and immediately.  c
onsider buy now buttons to the p
roduct pages, especially on 
mobile when it makes sense.  It 
does not for all businesses, but
 I encourage you to check the 
numbers to see if this is a 
powerful tool to help your  l
ast: Think progressive 
enhancement, this is a new API, 
it is not always available RLSH 
, you cannot depend on it in a 
cross-browser way yet, so think 
about it if it is not a need 
fall-back flows, etc.  one, we 
encourage you to keep the set of
 list items high-level. Don't 
think of it like an itemized 
receipt, try to keep it 
high-level, sub-total, tax, 
things like that.  If it is 
single-item, you can put it in t
here, but we encourage 
high-level sub totals. And the 
last to consider is that, if you
 already have a user's 
information and you always have 
a credit card on file or some 
way to pay, I wouldn't expect 
you to use --  you have to use 
PaymentRequest, give the user 
the best experience they can, 
that means to leverage what you 
have on file.  If you don't have
 anything and you don't have the
 credit card or it is expired or
 need a new one, consider a  
PaymentRequest a tool to help 
the users.   talked about 
sign-up first but it might not 
always make sense for your 
business.  Maybe your P 0, or 
your most important thing is 
getting the user through the 
check-out flow, and then you can
 request the PaymentRequest and 
 and all you need at the end of 
that funnel to optimize the 
experience for next time is the 
password, and these are tools to
 help you be successful.  a 
quick status update, we are life
 in Chrome at of N 53, we are 
live for about 8 weeks now, it 
is a quiet launch, we had a 
great set of partners we 
launched with, they tested and 
gave us a lot of great feedback.
 is the first browser to 
implement and we are are 
thankful to all of these players
 for their great feedback and 
from it, we are making a lot of 
changes and improvements and 
enhancements to the under lying 
experience.  And so I just want 
to talk a little bit about what 
you can expect to come sSo the 
first one that we are working 
hard on is support for 
third-party payment apps.  As 
you go around the world, there's
 a lot of ways to pay.  In
 India, you have all of these
 wallets, Holland, you have 
ideal -- we have lots of differ
ent ways to pay and we want to 
support this in an open way to 
support users all over the 
globe.  We are finalizing this a
nd hope to have support next 
year. Secondly, we have a lot of
 spec and feature enhancements 
coming, we have shipping address
 I talked about, you will be 
able to cull us within an iFrame
 coming up soon and a bunch of 
other small enhancements and 
improvements.  we also have a 
bunch of UX improvements, we 
added OCR scanning so you can 
scan -- if you don't have a 
credit card, you can scan it 
into the UI.  So there are 
things to make it faster, easier
 for on-boarding flows. nd the 
quick timeline here, we are 
targeting N 56, the January r
elease, as the next big major 
release.  It will have all of 
these enhancements and 
improvements and we are really 
excited about it.  You will 
continue to goat updates along 
the way, it live in Chrome table
 and we would love to work with 
you and get your feedback.  I t
alked about today is online in 
detail, we have integration 
guides, the phones come up --  
then, we also have Android Pay, 
Android Pay is simple with 
PaymentRequest, less than 10 
lines, we do the heavy lifting 
for you.  So a shout-out there. 
 would love to chat with you, 
learn about your challenges, 
ways you can be successful, so 
thank you so much. 
 ]. SPEAKER: I loved that, that 
is so exciting.  It is a 
game-changer!   stuff, so it is 
time --  lunch.  indeed. You 
have options, you can stay here,
 or you can -- if you go around 
the corner to The Grove and show
 your badge, you cannot have 
this one, this is mine, you can 
show yours and get a free lunch.
  You have a few choices there, 
and if you want to take the 
shuttle bus to the Google 
developer's launch pad, you can 
do that as well.  We will be 
back --  if you opted in for 
dietary restrictions, a special 
meal, it will be available 
downstairs in the common room 
behind the bar.  we have pushed 
back this afternoon's session, 
we will be back at 2:00 for Paul
 Irish. And more Big Web  Yes, 
see you then.  [ Applause ].

 Chrome Dev Summit.  
 Hello, everyone!  How is it 
going? Everyone enjoy lunch? , 
okay, what do we have coming up 
-- at the end of the day, the 
last session is the leadership 
panel with people in various 
VPs, product and engineering 
managers are going to be up here
 and answering any of your 
questions.  If you want to get 
them in early, if you ask them 
in the Slack channel, the url is
 on your badges and you can look
 at that.  Should we do web 
quizzing? e we get to it, be 
will have a look at the leader 
board to screen it first.  There
 we go.  will look at who is 
leading the pack.  e we go. 
A-ha.Ohh!  Oh, we are tied in 
first.   you believe it?  people
 have longer
 names than Paul in the
 layoPaul.  should be.  we 
beating any of the --  is, like,
 a 
backgroundbackgr can see 15, 15,
 15 and a bunch of 14se a 
question, the first place is 
shared with an individual that 
is not on the leader board, but 
they should be proud of you want
 to be on the leader board, then
 you do need to check that box 
at the bottom that says appear 
on  we do a question?Do you want
 to read this one out?  of the 
following CSS properties 
triggers layout or when changed?
  backface-visibility, outline, 
opacity, or background image.  
Select all that apply. will look
 at the answers coming through. 
 There's a lot of confidence in 
one of them, 100 percent of 
people is interesting, look at 
that.  One is flittering around 
in the 20 percent mark.   is 
around the 50 percent mark, a 
lot of indecision tto say that 
the audience is not convinced, 
apart from that one, they are 
not sure.  Should we find out 
which is fastest? We will close 
the question in three, two, one.
ER: So we are confident on width
.  Not so confident, but opacity
 -- a lot of indecision around  
That is not surpr does not 
actually change the size of the 
element itself.  will have a loo
k at 
the answers.  Just width of them
 cause a paint or a reHFre-rast
er, but it does not change the 
dimensions of the element or 
does not trigger layouts or 
re.flow. ine animation won't
Okay. meant -- Outlin guess it 
does in outline as well.  Very 
confusing. Width is the only one
 that triggers layouts. t.  So 
the next question I would like 
to do, it is about the next 
speaker.  It is, really.   it is
 not scored.  will be
 for fun.   it activates, c'mon,
 WiFi: You can do it.  There
 we go.   the many Pauls working
 on Chrome, which is actually 
Irish?  Kinlan, Paul Lewis, Paul
 Bakaus, or Paul Irish? 
 knows?  pretty confident on one
 of them.  That is interesting. 
  really sure, looking down the 
list and going, reall all might 
be, or might not be.  This is a 
multiple-selection one as well, 
you are welcome to pick many 
Pauls, all the
 Pauls
.  Let's close it.   So, we are 
saying probably a low transfer 
-- the German Paul to also be 
Irish? That seems relatively 
fair.  Paul Kinlan leading the 
charge at 57 p them who it is 
the.  correct answer is, of 
course, Paul Lewis.  Yes, it is 
true.  I'm actually Irish, which
 means that I have the great 
pleasure of being Irish Paul.  
Introducing the non-Irish Paul 
Irishime, we have to confess we 
have to start calling him Paul 
Lyrish. ughter ]. es and gentl
emen, round of applause, Paul 
Irish
!  ause ]. 
 so Irish, to be honest.  A 
little, not more than that.  We 
good? Yeah.   right.  So today I
 want to talk about debugging 
the web.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;, I want to share 
some of the work that we are 
doing in the Chrome developer 
tools, we have been working hard
 on a lot of stuff.  And I will 
share that with you today.  And 
just sit back for a moment, I 
want to point out that really 
our goal here with the Chrome 
DevTools is we want to maximize 
your productivity as a devel
oper.  We want to make sure you
 are as effective developing 
experiences for the web as you 
want to be. enjoy web 
development because we get to 
craft the experience that 
consumers consume and we get 
bring them joy, and we want on 
the DevTools team to ensure you 
have that joy, too, we want to 
maximize your delight as a 
developer I want to share with 
you a few things today some big 
features that I'm excited about 
and smaller things that are just
 smaller subtle changes, but 
targeting your experience and 
workflow as a developer We will 
go through a few things from 
debugging and authoring 
Progressive Web Apps and then 
some auditing stuff, and we have
 a lot to get through, so we 
will goat into get into it So 
debugging, I'm talki
ng about Java Script debugging. 
 And so it is a really important
 thing and we spend a lot of 
time doing it, so I want to make
 sure that it is good.  So we 
will start out small, this is 
the call stack, the humble call 
stack, this is what it looked 
like about six months ago.  We 
spent so much time here, we want
 to make sure it is good as 
possible.  We did refresh and on
 the right side is some new call
 stack, some changes, no zebra 
striping, the asynchronous hops 
and the synchronous is clear and
 this is where it says you are 
paused, you can see it clearly 
because sometimes you are not 
sear.  Sometimes you pause on a 
break point, other times you 
pause on an exception, it tells 
you what the exception message 
is at the top so you don't have 
to figure out and go into the 
console.  Orio are in an HSR or 
DOM break point, we want to make
 sure it is clear to you on why 
you are paused on execution.  So
 some changes there, and on the 
call stack are some other things
 And now, here I have the dev 
tools fairly -- yep.  Uh-huh.  
good.   is
 great.   dev tools are pretty 
big, we do not always have the 
DevTools maximized on the s
creen, it is squished to the w
indow but we want to be effecti
ve.  This is what the call stack
 looked like a while ago, as you
 reduce the size of the call 
stack, everything is shrinked by
 function name, I cannot read 
them anymore, navigating between
 the call frame when I'm 
debugging is kind of rough.  We 
decided to make this a little 
bit better.  So this is the 
experience now, so as you have 
less screen real estate, we go 
in and we stack the function 
name and the location and when 
we run out of someways  space, 
we elied the location and take 
the text away from that.  So 
whatever screen orientation, we 
are always changing it, it is 
going to be readable and usable 
for you.   again, these are 
small changes but important And 
a lot of us are authoring not 
just in kind of plain old 
JavaScript, but we are using 
JavaScript ES 2016, whatever, 
and we might be using tools like
 babble or TypeScript to deploy 
across a variety of run times.  
 work great with a number of l
anguage features, we used them 
ourselves.  This is the dev 
tools inspecting the DevTools, 
I'm using the black tools to 
view the other one, this is our 
code and some of our layer 
profiler, we use a lot of the 
language features ourselves in 
our JavaScript.  Here, there are
 promises, arrow functions, 
template literals, array of m
ethods, and this enables us to 
ensure that the experience of 
working with 24  the new 
language feature, the debugging 
or the console is great for 
whoever is working with them The
 console itself is a nice thing,
 if you are using babble or some
thing to transpire, what is 
happening here? Just come to the
 console and try out what is 
happening in place here, what 
happens with the features -- and
 here in the screenshot, we can 
see -- I'm using the async await
, you can 
toss in debugger statement there
 And while I'm talking about the
 console, we will talk about the
 console readline.  console read
 line -- I do this?  opening on 
the DevTools on my favorite 
site, example.com.  a good one. 
  console read line is this 
thing here that we type on, and 
so usually we type things that 
are, you know, fairly -- just 
one-liners, but not all the 
time, sometimes we actually want
 to -- a few more than just one 
line that you want to type out. 
And this has been kind of a pain
 before, yeah, you have to hold 
shift enter to avoid -- to write
 in new lines, it has been kind 
of tough.  So I'm going to write
 out, just a function, and as I 
hit enter now, we will 
immediately say  say oh, I don't
 think you are done here.   ]  
now, this -- some folks call 
this a smart return, in fact, 
Safari paved this  the way on 
this one.  We like it, it is 
fantastic.  And now I will finis
h the rest of this, I will log 
out the -- I will enter again, 
we are not done yet.  Add a 
brace, I will 
re-indent that for you, you are 
done, execute that, yeah.  as I 
had that, too, you will see that
 we are matching the braces, 
too.  So very clear brace match
ing and, in fact, this is syntax
 highlighted, that is new.  And 
things like multiple cursors and
 select mix and match, all of 
these features that you -- and 
the keyboard short cuts you use 
in sublime text or whatever, 
they work here.  we use the 
console as a way to inspect 
objects, kind of understand what
 is going on with them.  actu
ally having the completions as 
we type and explore things is 
really important.   on this 
site, let's see.  Document. -- 
yeah, document.head and we will 
look at childNodes really quick 
as I open up the square bracket,
 I do see immediately -- the i
ndices I can use in childNodes, 
I know there are 11, that is 
kind of cool.  I will choose 
one, and one pain point that 
happened in the console before 
is anytime that you have an 
array and you grab something 
from the array and then you hit 
dot and you're like -- why am I 
not seeing, I can't -- it is 
there, and I want the compl
etions and it didn't workays, it
 works now.   so, we are all 
happy. 

 in addition to that, you kind 
of want a little bit more power 
and you have only been able to 
see what starts with what you 
typed.  And so now, if I wanted 
to see what the content is of 
the child node, I type content 
-- text content, yeah, that's 
the text content. 
 So sub string completions work 
now and not just here, but in 
elements panel.  So in case you 
forget something like boarder c
olor, you can type in color and 
you will eventually see where it
 i nice improvements there on 
the console.  Again, small 
things, but right.   you are 
writing some code and, to be 
honest, three lines of code is 
not cutting it, you want a 
little bit more room. go over to
 JS binbin, that is great for 
sharing but you want to play 
around.  The snippets inside of 
sources, you can try things out,
 put in break points, execute 
it.  These are in your Chrome 
profile and in this case I was 
playing with the battery API, 
seeing how much battery was 
discharging and how much I have 
around.  And you have debuggers 
around and if you search help, 
you can see what people have 
created and lots of good finish 
up debugging, this line of codes
  code we are looking at here, 
asynchronous code, we have is 
some promises -- this is a tough
 thing to de-bug.  If I place 
this break point here on line 
16, I pause, like, before any of
 this but there is though  no 
way for me to pause inside of 
the air functions and see what 
is happening inside of them.  If
 I try to pause here, because it
 changed, it doesn't work.  That
 is not great.  We want to make 
sure that debugging asynchronous
 code is as easy as debugging 
synchronous code. we have been 
working on this.  And I'm 
thinking there must be kind of a
 better way.   going to open up 
a snippet that I have here.   
yeah, yeah, okay.  This is good.
   we have been thinking about 
this and working -- let me bring
 that back here.  There we go.  
 working with the V 8 team to 
see if we can improve this 
experience.  So what I have is 
some code and we are going to 
ask the GitHub API for some 
data, we're going to fetch it, 
and then we will turn it into 
JSON and get some stuff and 
hopefully log it out.  And let 
me just try this really quick.  
 well, it looks like
 there's a problem.  Great, 
problems are good. before -- it 
has been pretty hard to 
understand what's going on, beca
use again, I can only pause in 
the very first line of this.   
so now, what I want to do is I'm
 going to place a breakpoint 
here.  In addition to that, we 
have also found all the cand 
candidates along that line of 
code where you can place in-line
 brealause ] right.  Yeah, nice.
   now that we have that, let's 
see -- I'm going to run this 
again.   what just happened, J  
I ran it again and we are paused
 right at the first guy, I will 
let that continue.  All right, 
now, cool.  We are paused 
halfway down the line, right 
after And now, I do see that 
this response up here is there, 
forbidden, that is going to be 
fun to figure out.  And I even 
see the return value, this 
programs, this is  -- promise, 
is this  this is the return 
value of the call here.  So I 
can go forward again and, to be 
honest, it looks like data, 
yeah, is coming back.   problem 
with this demo is that I'm hitt
ing the GitHub API and it turns 
out that, for whatever reason, 
our IP in this building, as you 
can already see, it exceeded its
 rate limit, which kind of b
reaks the demo.  thanks to the 
people that are using the GitHub
 API unauthenticated right now. 
 I have a back-up piece of JSON,
 whatever the payload was, that 
is just 
sitting up here.   how are we 
looking? Let's clear off these

momento, okay,  do have a 
problem and we can
 inspect exactly what is going 
on, I kind of go, we will go f
orward, we are asking for data 
avatar, it does not exist, 
avatar url, yeah, that makes 
sense.  Let me finish this off 
so we don't have to worry about 
it anymore.   uno momento.  All 
right, there we go.  r the url, 
enter, really? ].  did I do? How
 -- o had  hh, ahhh, noooo. hter
 ].   I really -- 
(shocked inhale) there we go.  
So console image, a little 
thing, it just tosss es an image
 into your console.  Why not? So
 to be honest, the 
implementation is down here.  
]. lause ].  right.  Anyways, 
in-line break points, I'm really
 excited about this and I'm 
really introducing a much dev 
open experience for asynchronous
 code, you can break anywhere 
that you need to.  moving on to 
authoring, and we're going to 
start with the front-end and I'm
 going to head back into the 
brows here, we have a PWA that 
we have worked on, Caltrain
 schedule. As you can imagine, 
it shows the schedule for the 
Caltrain.  And now, we have been
 developing this and it is alwa
ys ongoing, you want to make 
changes.  And a typical way of 
making changes, we can try out 
some new colors, and if we liked
 them, you know, usually the 
method is shift selection and 
copy/paste over in your edit 
now, we don't really like this 
workflow, and we think it can be
 better.   previous talks, you 
might have heard us talk about 
features like workspaces, and 
workspaces allows you to bind 
the local development folder 
with the actual site that you 
are looking at in the browser, 
allowing you to save to disk the
 things that you are working on.
  some powerful stuff, to be 
honest, there is configuration 
and if you have tried it, is it 
working? I don't know.  I wanted
 to make sure that it is really 
straightforward and simple.  I 
will come back over to sources 
and clear this out of the way.  
And, so, in sources we see, 
okay, yeah, this is the
 code of the  of the 
ServiceWorker here, I have some 
JavaScript and CSS, I want to be
 able to persist to disk.  The 
new experience is easy  easier, 
I will take the development 
folder, the Caltrain folder, 
drag and drop here and you can 
access that.  And the green 
check marks light up and it 
says, oh, yeah, the CSS of the 
file? Yeah, I know where that 
is, that is right on disk.  Over
 here on the filing system, the 
filer, the configs and the Servi
ceWorker, and everything from 
the sunset work has a check mark
 to it.  that's a nice thing, we
 automatically findute  out for 
you how things map.  In fact, it
 is not just the basics, but if 
you have a more complex set-up, 
like you are transpiling your 
JavaScript or you are compiing 
stats to CSS, that should work, 
too, without configuration.  so 
I could explain how we, you 
know, made it -- I don't, it is 
like magic. ings like, you know,
 this TypeScript, we were able 
to map it back and forth. As 
long as you have a source map 
for the actual compiled code, we
 will figure out where it goes 
and map it so that any changes 
that you have made persist.  So 
let's make a change or so, this 
title could afford to be bigger,
 that's nice.  a little too 
strong, I'm going to change the 
foreground color a little bit, 
and dial it back.  I will get in
 the gray, that's good.  It nee
ds some shadow, I'm going to use
 the new shadow editor. 
 we are laying it out, ohh, that
 is some classy stuff, yeah! 
likeing that!  ].  one thing 
that you might see, this little 
green check, it knows that this 
CSS is actually the one on disk 
and, if I click through to view 
back in sources, we have the 
disk saying, I know that you 
changed the lines right here.  
If I come back over to, let's 
see, my editor, or my terminal 
and I just check my dif, that's 
the diff of the changes that I m
ade.  
 looking good.  And talking abou
t CSS, the original styles of 
this site, Sam was responsible 
for.  I don't know if we will --
 there's a lot of styles here 
and I don't know if we are using
 all of them.  I imagine that we
 have all been in this s
ituation, you are shipping an 
app and you are just like, are 
we even using these? I'm not 
going to try to remove them, 
that is crazy, but I would like 
to know -- ehh?  is hard, the 
browser kind of knows.  Maybe we
 should, hmm. actually, yeah.   
of today, in a canary near you, 
you might find a checkbox up 
like this, CSS coverage.  I will
 try it out and hit record, that
 is it, it is done, I'm going to
 head back to sources and now in
 the CSS we will mark on the 
left-hand side if these styles 
were never used.  actually, this
 is pretty good. 

own here at the bottom, there is
 all of this animation stuff.  
So I just want to verify that 
this is good, the an  animation 
is these little bars that anim
ate out, it looks like there are
 two here.  I wonder if I can, I
 will try and trigger all of 
them.  Switch this over there, 
yeah, that's a few animations.  
 back, and yeah.  Okay. we are 
using all of those -- that, but,
 yeah.  CSS is looking pretty 
good.   excited about this, 
because it gives us much better 
tools to understand whatever the
 code that we are shipping, are 
we actually using?   So some 
good stuff.  okay, coming back. 
 And we talked about 
altogetherin the browser, for 
full-stack developers, we write 
in the back end, too.  And at 
Google I/O, we showed work that 
we are doing for profiling and 
inspection and node bugging to N
ode.js.  We are excited about 
that, but there is more work to 
do.  So we will show a little 
bit of that. oming back to this 
Caltrains schedule, I have been 
working on a small feature to g
et the live position of every 
single train, there's an API for
 it.  I can get the live locatio
n, so -- you can see down here 
at the bottom of my JavaScript 
is, I'm asking my local server 
for the position of a train.  
I'm just polling for it, I just 
started the feature, I'm very 
early on this one.   let's kick 
off the node, right?  we will 
come over here, this guy, and 
what we can do is we can hit 
node dash dash inspect in the 
app and, whew, ignore that for a
 moment.  We get this url right 
here, and this url, we can copy 
and paste it into our browser 
and start debugging.  case, it 
is kind of awkward because, you 
know, I already have a tab open 
with dev tools debugging in the 
front end, it would be nice to 
look at the back-end, too.  will
 allow this to run and I will 
come back over to the sources 
panel. And now when I open this 
up, in ddition to the main 
thread and the ServiceWorker, 
down here is node.  Oh, you are 
running node, aren't you? Do you
 want to de-bug that, too?  
actually, I would be down with 
that.  Good.  So now we are conn
ected to node and I know this 
because I if I switch over here,
 I look at the node context, 
that error that I'm getting over
 here is still also exploding my
 screen over here.   great.   
train is not defined apparently.
  So let's see what's up.   
right.  So coming down, there's 
my app.JS, this is my node code.
  And apparently there is an 
error, and let's just pause on 
exceptions.  It just paused 
right here, train is undefined, 
right, yes, good.   train -- 
train ID, yes, mistake, my bad. 
 Train ID is just train.  And 
now I'm going to hit control and
 S and I think that takes care 
of it.  We will know if it 
starts sending API reque -- it i
s paused.  Who said that?  get, 
like, two extra points on the 
quiz.   yep, good sending API.  
Yes!  Okay.  in fact, coming 
back to my other context, of my 
page, I went from a bunch of 
500s internal service errors to 
200s, and that's what you like 
to see., good.  we are really 
excited about this -- [ Applause
 ].  sure,
 yeah!   gotta clap on the 200s.
  are excited about this because
 this allows us to use the 
single dev tools and speak to 
both the front end and at the 
back end at the same time, k
eeping your attention in one 
place while managing multiple 
contexts.  That is  moving on.  
We've heard about Progressive 
Web Apps today and there are 
some nice tools in the DevTools 
to tackle that, and I will row  
review some of them. the applic
ation, there is some great 
stuff.  In the manifest view, 
shows what is in the manifest.  
If the browser is not sure, 
issues a warning, you will see 
it right here at the top.  And 
then the ServiceWorker pane 
tells you everything that state 
allow you to manipulate in the 
Service Workers and I really 
like this, the clear storage 
pane allows you to unregister 
your ServiceWorker with one 
click, but take care of your 
CacheStorage, your up cache, any
 of your local storage, just 
wipe it out and start fresh, it 
does that all the time.  I do 
want to spend a little bit more 
time on the ServiceWorker panel 
itself and there are two things 
that I want to point out for 
you, really helpful tips when 
you are doing this debugging.  
at the top are some check boxes,
 in the middle, the re-load.  
This is super helpful, you can 
think of it of a disabled cache 
but for the ServiceWorker itsel
f, 
 and you want to make sure as 
you relewd  load it pulls in the
 newer versi ServiceWorker, I 
know you love to intercept, but 
I'm working on my site right now
 and updating my styles in my 
pages JavaScript and I don't 
want you to serve things from 
the cache and the Service Worki
ng, so just chill.  So it will 
allow you to update the content 
without the ServiceWorker getti
ng in the way.  And as you work 
in the tools and find things 
that are, like, hmm, making you 
question stuff, feel free to 
holler at us and see if there's 
a better way to see if the tools
 can see what is going on.  We 
would love to  are a lot of 
things in Progressive Web Apps 
that you have to keep track of, 
the first things is the manifest
 and the ServiceWorker set up 
right away, it is a little bit 
tricky.  We are working on bette
r ways to understand if we are 
hitting all the right marks and 
if there are things that we can 
do to ensure what we are 
building is great.   of that 
work and investment has gone 
into a project called Light
house, it is a guide book for 
helping you turn a web app into 
a great progressive web app.   
only that, it analyzes any web 
page in any website, and not 
only collects performance 
metrics, but helps to identify 
developer best practices that 
you are doing and can make 
things better.  as an example, 
it oddaudits for a number of 
different things, can the user 
be prompted to go to home screen
, splash screen, are you using 
passive event listeners, 
avoiding document write, and 
over 40 audits checking for the 
developer excellence.  the other
 side, it does a great job of 
having performance metrics that 
capture the user perceived 
performance in the most 
meaningful way possible.  helps 
to illuminate what is happening 
when things are slow.  It is 
available as a Chrome extension,
 you can see it a little bit 
over here.  And over here, yeah,
 I can run it from the command 
line, it will just kick off a 
new version of Chrome itself, 
and run all of the same tests 
ther this works well, Lighthouse
 is just a node module and, in 
fact, a number of other tools 
are already using Lighthouse and
 building on top of it.  So feel
 free to check it out like that,
 it works well with a Headless 
Chrome RR in a conti
nuous integration environment.  
If you want to set up regression
 tests for performance or 
audits, you can do that the 
other thing is, we have really 
been happy with how doing these 
checks to see, what, are we on 
the right path, this is working 
out for us.  We want to make 
sure this is even more availa I 
want to show you another new 
thing, I will come over to the 
Caltrain schedule and I'm in the
 DevTools.  Maybe we should have
 it not only as a Chrome exten
sion, but we will open this up 
in more tools and we have a new 
audits 2.0.  This is powered by 
Lighthouse.  And, as I -- I will
 just make this tab -- there we 
go.   going to go ahead, this is
 using the same Lighthouse that 
is in the extension, the command
 line, running on the same 
checks, it is looking for usage 
of document write, blocking of 
style sheets and helping you 
understand what is going on.   
pretty soon, it will give me a 
report, I will be able to browse
 that. Okay, looks pretty good. 
 Fast, the site is fast, good 
job.  , so you are scrolling 
down, and this is -- this is 
interesting.  Check this out.   
opens external links 
using -- we have two sites that 
are external and not using this 
guy.  You have to read about 
this, I saw this, and honestly, 
we really need to do this. So 
this is super -- yeah.  So I'm 
going to fix that, right after 
we get off stage.  I encourage 
you to check this out. And the 
nice thing here is, because this
 is using Lighthouse, it is 
sitting on GitHub and a bunch of
 JavaScript.  If there is 
something you are auditing for 
and want to check, come by and 
check it out, talk to us, if you
 have any ideas, we love to work
 on it with you.   what did we 
say here today?  few things, we 
looked at stronger debugging 
with modern JavaScript and I got
 to show the in-line break 
points.  Mm, love it.  The 
parallel debugging with Node.js 
and the browser at the same 
time, in the single windo CSS 
coverage, defining what CSS you 
are not using and auditing f
unctionality in all the right 
places.  If you are not foll
owing us on Twitter, or yeah -- 
please grab Canary, turn on the 
DevTools experiments if you 
want, and feedback or ideas, go 
to CR bug.  It will be like -- 
do you want to report a bug, 
don't feel feature requests, 
just ignore that and just file a
 feature request, or just like, 
hey, guys, what do you think? 
That is fine, we would love to 
hear from you.  's it from me, 
thank you very much.  
pplause ]. KER: Thank you very 
much, Paul, I love the 
applications tab in DevTools, 
when I was building a website, 
here are the icons, here is the 
ServiceWorker, here is ever
ything.  That is a really great 
 Should we press on with the 
next talk?  should keep us the 
pace.  about  web 
components. r Savage -- I really
 struggled with that
ing in loud voice) Taylor 
Savage. se welcome to the stage,
 Taylor Savage!  plause ]. ER: 
All right.  Thanks, everyone.  
My name is Taylor Savage, great 
intro.  , my name is Taylor 
Savage, I'm a product manager on
 Chrome with the polymer project
 and I'm with Monica to tell you
 all things polymer.  talk about
 where we are with the project 
overall and how web components 
are changing how we do web 
development and we will talk 
about how to take advantage of 
web components to build a 
modern, progressive web app.   
first off, let's talk about the 
mobile web.  We have been 
talking about the mobile web a 
lot at this conference, and 
there's good reason for it that.
 there has never been a more 
important time to have an open, 
de-centralde-centralized comm
unication network where everyone
 can access this information 
from anywhere else in the world.
  You can put this up on the web
 and a user across thethe globe 
is just an url away from 
accessing your application is 
great, but for developers, 
there's a dark side to the 
mobile web.  If you have been 
doing mobile web development and
 you are trying to get the best 
user experience across to the 
users on the mobile devices, you
 know this dark side, which is 
that we are at war with phones. 
 es are our enemy, they are our 
user's best friend and as devel
opers, they are our enemy.  can 
feel like, as we are trying to 
produce the best possible user 
experience, the phones are 
fighting against us at every 
possible turn.  networks are 
vast, there are over (200) 
000-0000 users with a mobile 
smartphone in their pocket to 
access web applications.  a 
large percentage of those users 
are on slow e  expensive data 
connections or not one at all, 
that is not what we have had to 
deal as web developers, where 
you are plugged into the wall 
with a desktop at every le 
devices are everywhere, you are 
a pocket-reach away from a great
 experience on the mobile web.  
That means that mobile phones 
are fundamentally perfo
rmance-constrained.  They need 
to have a tiny little battery 
that can power them all day long
 and they need to not burn your 
hand when you take them out of 
your pocket, so for the battery 
to last all day and to power the
 censorensors and radios and the
 high-resolution screen, it is 
constrained in terms of the CPUs
 it can deliver that are running
 your appliave a lot of 
Open-Source tools available to 
us to create these web appli
cations and p they are diverse 
and powerful, but it can seem 
like more and more the tools 
available to us are continually 
bigger and continually more 
complicated.  ding a great 
mobile web experience is hard, 
it is a little bit like climbing
 Mt.  it is challenging, it is 
expensepense expensive and to do
 it right you need training and 
guidance.  It is a shame, it 
should be much easier to deliver
 experiences on the web to 
users, especially in this import
ant mobile context.  there is 
good news, we have a mantr
a on the polymer project, we ha
ve a philosophy for building web
 applications to make our lives 
easier and to make our users' 
lives better and that mantra is 
to use the platform.  The web 
platform is getting increasingly
 powerful, with new primitives 
like ServiceWorker, web c
omponents, serving mechanisms, H
TTP2, we have more tools at our 
disposal than ever to help us 
deliver a high-quality appli
cation.  It is our 
responsibility and advantage to 
take advantage of what is there 
baked into the browser, sitting 
on the user's devices in their 
pockets in the form of the web 
platf the polymer project
 is the set of tools to help web
 developers take advantage of 
the mobile modern web platform, 
to take advantage of what is 
there on the browser.  The prima
ry feature that polymer the 
library is focused around is web
 componentcomponents, that's an 
umbrella for low-level APIs 
built into the platform specs 
that allow you to create reusab
le components on the web, 
allowing you to
 essentially extend the html 
language and tag that is baked 
like any other.  if you have 
been following the components 
and tags, they have been around 
a while now.   20002 and we
 were over optimistic at the 
speed they would be cross
-browser supported and we worked
 with the other browsers to set 
up the APIs, everyone was on 
board, we just had to work out 
the kinks in the APIs themse
lves. We have turned a major
 corner with the web comp
onents APIs, web 
componentscomponents v1.  It was
 scattered and varied, and 
shadow DOM or custom element 
support was behind or unsup
 web components VURN, the story 
is changed.  All major browser 
vendors are on board with ship
ping shadow DOM.  In Safari 10, 
they shouted on v1 shipped, 
Chrome has on v1 shipped and it 
is an exciting time.  
Html web components -- we will 
come up with a good solution for
 how we will load html. huge 
turning point for web compo
nents.  At Google I/O, I said 
that cross browser web 
componentsis not a matter of if,
 but when.  And they are here, 
with web components v1.  brings 
me to polymer.  So the polymer 
library, the library itself that
 forms the sole of the polymer 
project is a lightweight layer 
on top of the web components 
APIs and it is a way to pull 
together the low-level specs and
 APIs and makes it easy for us 
as developers to build a reusa
ble custom element.  started as 
an experiment, and evolved as 
the specs evolve what are the 
low-level features we need as a 
developer to create the 
re-usable development to extend 
html.  So the last release of 
polymer was in the first 
experiment mode.  And after 
iteration and working on the 
specs and library, the web 
components is pretty powerful.  
1.0 of the polymer library, 
which allowed us to take 
advantage of web components 
today in production apappli
cations without the APIs having 
to be shipped across the 
different browsers pra.  polymer
 has been quietly out for a 
year, and since it started as an
 experience with the web 
components specs, we get the 
question, who is using polymene 
using polymer in the wild? few 
of the companies that are using 
it in production today: Comcast,
 the largest media company in 
the world.  It is used by USA 
Today, the flagship brand of the
 largest newspaper publisher, 
Ing, Net-A-Porter, polymer is 
used by BBVA, one of the largest
 banks in Spain and Latin 
America, by Coca-Cola, the 
largest beverage company in the 
world, Electronic Arts, one of 
the largest game publishers, and
 Predix,
 the software Internet of 
Things, and at Google on some of
 our biggest interfacing p used 
in Chrome in chrome UI products,
 it is used in YouTube music and
 gaming and at the polymer 
summit, it is being used in 
YouTube, one of Google's biggest
 products, is now building the 
next generation of their mobile 
and desktop applications all on 
top of polymer.   there's an 
immense organizational power 
that we are seeing to rely on 
standards-based web development.
 get a seamless frictionless 
sharing of code that we have not
 been able to achieve across all
 different teams on the web 
platform before and we are 
seeing more and more companies 
going in with polymer, web 
components, and web standards-
based development using the 
platform.   a big value prop for
 web components is they are 
interoperable, you can build a 
web components with brows
er-based technology, share it 
with others on your team and 
anyone can take advantage of 
that component no matter what 
their JavaScript stack looks is 
great, but we have big projects 
working with web components and 
big teams that not only want to 
build web components but entire 
applications.  How can I take 
web components and build an 
entire web application out of 
web components? Well, in the 
past, that's the whole point of 
web components, there is no one 
way to build a web application, 
you can choose the tool you are 
familiar with and use that to 
put together web components into
 an application.  That is 
unsatisfying, and what we 
realized is that if you take web
 components, which are one new 
set of web platform primitives 
and you combine them with other,
 new exciting web platform 
features like ServiceWorker and 
http 2, you can have a whole 
that is better than the sum of 
the parts.  And all of these 
features are designed to come 
together and make for a great 
user experience.  so, earlier 
this year, we released the 
polymer app toolbox.  And again,
 the goal of the polymer app 
toolbox was to go beyond comp
onents and show how they can be 
put together with other 
technologies into complete, Prog
ressive Web Apps.  the app 
toolbox includes a set of web 
components for things like layou
t, routing, and rationalization,
 it includes a command tool to 
deploy and build your 
application, and things -- 
ications built with the polymer 
app toolbox are served via the 
purple pattern, a way of using 
http 2 and server push to 
deliver the minimum of what you 
need to render each view of the 
application to the users with 
minimal overhead.  You will hear
 more and more about this purple
 pattern at various talks in the
 summit in addition to the 
components and the pattern in 
the CLI, we want to show what 
you can create when you put 
these together.  We launched 
shop.polymer-project.org that 
uses these components to deliver
 an e-commerce like application.
 an shop that there at the And 
we are seeing the value of these
 polymer app toolbox being used 
by companies to build 
applications.  So take Jumia 
Travel, the Afric
a  division of Africa's large 
ecommerce sity of connections 
are in 2G and there's a chall
enge to deliver a rich, full 
application over the narrowest 
network that you possibly can.  
thanks to the polymer app 
toolbox and web components in 
the purple web pattern, we are 
able to build a progressive web 
app on the polymer web toolbox 
that has twice as fast page load
 on 2G and uses 6 times less 
data to get a fast flow.  And 
this speaks to the value and 
power of web components, they 
are able to build a complete 
prototype of this website in 4 
weeks so they can show it to the
 management and sell it as a 
valuable experience and build 
the application.  So this is 
what we want web components, we 
want them to achieve rapidly 
through production and 
deployment.  We are starting to 
feel the momentum of web 
components.  Web components are 
adopted cross-browser and used 
in serious web applications by 
large production companies and 
here at Google.  And this means 
that it is time to open the next
 door for the polymer project.  
 we are working right now on the
 next major push of the polymer 
library, which is polymer 2.0.  
So we just released the preview 
version of polymer 2.0, it is up
 on GitHub are a few key things 
that we are focused on with  
when we are designing polymer 
2.0, a few features and 
distinctions from the 1.0  first
 is web components v1 support, 
those are the specs that are 
shipped and 2.0 is designed to 
take advantage of these custom 
element and shadow DOM APIs 
baked into the browser.offers 
better interoperability with 
other JavaScript frameworks and 
tools by eliminating some of the
 polymerpolymer-specific abstr
actions that leaked through
 in 1.0.  So the shady take-away
 is that 2.0 is web native and 
it is indistinguishable from any
 other vanilla web components 
that you will build with any web
 components framework or with 
raw, vanilla web compo we don't 
want to leave polymer 1.0 users 
in the test.   things that we 
took away from the 0.5 to the 
1.0 transition is that a trans
ition, even small, is a huge
 pain point for those relying 
it.  So we designed 2.0 with 
backwards compatibility in mind,
 making it as simple as possible
 to be able to transfer a 1.0 
component to 2.0.  And it 
supports hybrid mode, there's a 
way to write a component so it 
can work on polymer 1 or 2.0.  
If you have lots of components 
in your application or in the 
company, you can upgrade one 
element at a time while it is in
 production and once it is 
upgraded to the hybrid mode, you
 can switch from 1 to 2 and you 
can continue to take advantage 
of the 2.0 features, so it is a 
much more seamless upgrade 
process rather than stopping all
 the presses and upgrading ever
ything at once before you put 
the application into produ 0.5 
was an experiment for web 
components, 1.0 allows you to 
use the web components in 
production and 2.0, we can reali
ze the full value of web 
components, which is going web 
native, which is using actually 
using the platform and stand
ards-based cross browser APIs to
 write and ship less code, to 
write elegant and smaller 
applications and to deliver them
 across the mobile web.  And we 
are seeing this use the platform
 mantra bearing outlet in the  
out in the numbers with 2.0 when
 you look at how it actually 
works and is b 2.0, if you build
 a web components with polymer 2
 and you ship it in a browser 
that supports 1 out of the box, 
polymer itself is only 12 
kilobytes, it is small and 
getting smaller and smaller and 
that is the goal with polymer, 
we are not building a massive 
framework, we want it smaller 
and smaller as it fills in the 
gaps in the developer 
experience.   we are just at the
 beginning of the story for web 
componentsand we are figuring 
out the best practices and best 
ways that we as developers, 
teams, as an ecosystem can take 
advantage of the things that web
 components provide. We have b
een building them for a few 
years on the polymer team and we
 have learned a lot.  And here 
to tell you how to take 
advantage of the web components 
in the browser and to build 
killer applications is Monica, 
an engineer on the polymer team.

 plause ].  up, didn't get an 
awesome Paul Lewis introduction,
 I'm bummed about this. thing 
about polymer, it is not about 
the library itself, it is about 
what you do with it and building
 elements.  And what I've been 
thinking about on how to 
structure this talk, I've 
realized that when Taylor said 
that mobile web development is 
hard, the same thing can be said
 about element development, it 
takes a lot of expertise and it 
is hard to put a good element on
 every page you have so it is 
important to talk about it.  
what we have been talking a lot 
about is how to make a good 
element, a fast element, and we 
have been giving talks -- I'm 
not allowed to go back, we have 
been giving talks about that.  I
 have thought about that, and 
there are three people that 
interact with elements.  have 
the people who use the elements,
 who don't want to build a good 
element, they want to use others
 when they are developing a web 
app, we have people who author 
the elements and people who main
tain them.   be authors or 
people that inherited the eleme
nts and don't know how it became
 to be the monsters it is.  We 
need to address their con turns.
  will talk about the people who
 use the elements and give you 
advice on how to architect your 
apps and some tools for people 
that have to maintain those 
elements.  the polymer elements 
team, we
 authored over 130 eleme we have
 used them internally, just in 
the team in over 20 apps and 
this is important to us, the 
shop app, you guys, tha that is 
how we come up with advice for 
other developers and how we come
 up with patterns that you can 
use, and we are also in the 
maintaining side of this, 
polymer elements are used in 
over 500 apps, these are 
internal to Google, they are 
external to the companies you 
heard about before.  we cover 
all of these three dit  diff
erent areas I talked about.  
Let's talk about app developers,
 probably half of the audience, 
you probably want to use a web 
components in your application, 
how can we make this better for 
you? What best practices do we 
have advice that I have is you 
should not look at web 
components as something that are
 new, you know about components,
 you know about the language, 
and web components are not new 
either.  If you used an element 
or button, they are like an web 
component, it is something that 
is put together in a box that 
has an API and you have been 
using them for a long time.   
new is that other people can 
build these web components that 
are just as powerful as the 
input button and you should 
treat them in the same way you 
have been treating  i built this
 to demonstrate the next 
example, I built this dev app 
for the polymer summit, an emoji
 social network where it is like
 Twitter and Slack jammed into 
one.  Instead of being useful, 
the only thing you can type is 
in English and it is translated 
to emoji.  So you can see a 
stream of emoji and I have 
walked around with this physical
 web beacon with a link to it.  
 when I was designing it, I was 
like, okay, cool, let's say I 
never used a web component 
before and I wanted to design an
 app, what do I do? It is the 
same as a normal application, I 
have to authenticate a user, and
 then show them something, a 
giant blob of text and this can 
be a list of other people's dumb
 emoji posts or the amazing 
ability to write your own posts 
because how else will you get 
content in there?  then you can 
dig deeper and deeper in these, 
and when you write the post, you
 translate from emoji to emoji 
and you can link them and see 
the location and all kinds of 
stuff like that.  Once you have 
the idea of what the logical 
components in the application 
are, it translates to web 
components.  plication part is 
the application with fire base, 
this manages the list of e
lements, and then the new post 
and My App are the web com
ponents I built into my app to 
logically structure code around.
  It is easy and the awesome 
part about components, it is not
 new, if you have written a 
component, you can re-factor it 
easily because it does not 
affect the rest of the app, it 
stat there as a stand-alone and 
you get to fix its code.  not 
look scary, it is how you write 
web components, you can have it 
a div equals main screen, but 
you can say main screen as an 
element.  And because web 
components are not new and you 
have been using them in the 
browser, you did not know that 
the input was a web components, 
you should use the new web 
components that you are getting 
from use RSS ers in the same 
way.  In it  the event, you set 
up the properties, the type, the
 value, the min and the max 
length.  When the input does 
something, it fires an event, 
the input event, the change 
event, this isn't new and this 
is exactly what people have been
 doing with their web 
components. go down, events go 
up and you get this magical 
directional data flow in the 
application.  get the giant 
screen at the top, the state of 
the world, and you get the post 
button, you mash on the keyboard
 and the emoji comes out.   the 
app is going to know things that
 not every component knows 
about, for example, it knows 
what channel you are posting to,
 it is go to inform anybody it 
cares about by setting a propert
y with the elements just like 
you are doing with input.  And 
after the keyboard, you fire the
 discussion of it, I have an 
emoji post, does anybody care? 
anybody cares, they are going to
 intercept that event. the same 
can happen if you want to hide 
conditional UI in parts of the 
applicationapplication, you set 
different properties.  What I 
didn't tell you here is you 
should call a public method on 
this element or something like 
that, again, that is not how we 
have been using DOM elements 
before.  We don't call random 
functions on input, we just 
share properties, which leads me
 to my third advice: Use 
properties and non-methods.  You
 might be tempted to use methods
 because JavaScript is keen on 
it, but that is not like how the
 DOM likes to be used, it has 
properties and aterability --  
great if you are using prope
rties, you can use them 
imperatively and you have data 
blinding.  Imagine if you have a
 dialogue, you can call dialo
gue.open it.  You don't need it,
 if there's a property, you can 
say that it equals true.  Once 
you have done this, you can do 
it as a binding some where in 
your code and it depends on some
 other state of the world and 
without writing any JavaScript, 
things will open and things will
 hide as they should because 
that's how properties work.  
roperties on methods, properties
 go down, events go up.  Those 
are the rules.   for app 
 elem
ent mainment maintainers? You 
are inher LTing elements and you
 don't know why they are in the 
state, externally or internally,
 a lot of companies have an 
internal state of elements come 
 and they have to maintain.   
Them.  We have been writing t
ools, and you have heard of 
testing development,
 but you should practice 
fear-driven development, because
 you should be afraid of 
breaking them and the a
pplications, that is your own 
responsibility as a maintainer, 
don't break other's code.  in 
preventing breaking changes, we 
have been using this internally 
and it is a public repo on 
polymer labs and we are are 
fixing it so you can use it, it 
is tattoo, which stands for test
 all the things over and over, 
why not come up with a compl
icated acronym? You are a 
maintainer and you want to 
accept pull requests, you don't 
know what this is going to 
impact.  Look at this dependency
 graph, which is not a real 
dependency graph, they are way 
worse than this.  If you modify 
a leaf at the bottom, unless you
 have the ability to hold all 
the 130 elements in the polymer 
catalog in your head, you don't 
know what change it is going to 
affect, the belaver, it might be
 the ability to be included in a
 custom form or something like 
that, you don't know how many 
elements depend on the change, 
because they go up many levels 
up the tree. And tr tattoo lets 
you specify a branch or hash in 
the element and re-run based on 
that commit a whole suite of 
tests.  case, we make a change 
to an element and make sure that
 all the other tests pass and 
this is great, you have the 
convenience that this PR is not 
going to destroy all of YouTube,
 because we have definitely not 
done that before.]. The other 
thing you should be afraid of is
 perf regressions, it is great 
to have the confidence you will 
not break somebody's 
application, but making it slowe
r is kind of worse because that 
is harder to fix.  We have two 
tools for that.  The first is 
poly dev, a Chrome extension, 
you can run it on any app with 
custom elements and it ranks how
 extensive the elements can  it 
sees on the page are.  It is 
great to oddit the page as you 
are contributing to an app, this
 is great for the app 
developers, as you are fixing 
the app, the performance will be
 as you expect and it is 
important for main TAIRN --  
have a catalog for different 
elements and one of these 
elements that used to be sheep  
cheap spikes to the top, that 
means something bad happens and 
you want to undo the change.  It
 is in the chrome store, you can
 download it and it is awesome. 
 tool is polyperf, and you can 
notice that all of these have 
poly prefix, but tattoo doesn't.
  And this allows you to compare
 the performance between 
changes.  This is an example 
from Steve's talk from The 
polymer summit, and at the 
baseline he has an input 
element, and it costs you an 
element to make 250 on the page 
and he had a ratings element, a 
shitty version and progressively
 faster and three iterations of 
that element for different 
commits and features that you 
are adding to the element.   
this element used to cost 129 
miliseconds and now it is 500.  
Is this change worth it?  you 
are a maintainer, because you 
can go, no, this change is shit
shit, we are merging it.  this 
parallel version is demo-driven 
development.  I cannot look at a
 snippet of code and know what 
that element looks like and how 
it is going to fit on my page, 
tha that is great.   look at it 
on my web page, I want the shiny
 button.  demo snippet lets you 
look at how you would use the 
element, the code, and what the 
element looks 
 bunch of fab buttons, which 
means floating action buttons, 
not fabulous.  That made me 
really sad.  And that is a nip  
snippet and really great, and 
Comcast uses this internally to 
say, these are all the elements 
we have, this is what they look 
like, do we care? And we have 
taken this demo approach to the 
new beta site for the web 
components.org, so 
beta.webcomponents.org is the 
beta catalog where we are moving
 our elements and it supports 
collections and elements and 
curated collections.  You can 
make a collection called fablet 
elements and put web components 
in it, so when people search 
fabulous collections, it will 
come to it.  is the page for 
paper-fob  fab and this is the 
demo, the snippet.  And it is 
not as static as the snippet use
 to be, it is interactive.  You 
can change the contempts tents 
of the button or a style, it 
adds a custom property that 
changes  I can go ahead and do 
that.   now?  have web compo
nents, they are native in the 
browser, polymer 2.0 is around 
the corner, what does it mean 
for you as developers? This is 
called polymer web components 
and you.  talk about the you 
part.   no better time to start 
using web components, use an 
element, I did an emoji rain, it
 makes emoji rain on your page, 
use that, use vanilla elements, 
or your own.  If you use it, 
polish and share it to beta
beta.webcomponents.org s to make
 the web better.  We will help 
you along with it, but you are 
going to make it awesome.  Thank
 you.

 last night.  staying with Alex 
right now while I'm in San 
Francisco, he is such a nice 
guy, a few people are staying 
with him.   got up for the 
bathroom in the middle of the 
door and Alex just sat on the 
landing and built himself a 
force with cushions, because 
every other room in the house 
was occupied.  you had a little 
Alex fort.  3:00 in the morning.
  we will see if his code works

their job.  It really
 is.   We will comeworking on 
the quiz right now? No, we --  
quiz is
 solid now.Off, off. afternoon. 
 I'm Alex Russell and an engi
neer on the Chrome team.  This 
is not the talk I usually give, 
I hope you will bear with me 
through difficult conte I put 
the slide up to talk about 
Progressive Web Apps.b Apps are 
the cull miination of multiple 
years of my team's work, I have 
been working on it for 4 years 
now, and the team that I work on
 having designing and building 
the technology for Progressive 
Web Apps, what you have been 
hearing about in the last couple
 dev summits and today and 
tomorrow and I apologize a 
little bit, but not really.  But
 building and maintaining all of
 that stuff and working on stand
ards for it, it is a full-time 
job. I'm not going to talk about
 Progressive Web Apps today, at 
least not directly.  For the 
past year, I have also been 
working with Tao and her team to
 launch their Progressive Web 
Apps to make sure they are 
high-quality.  And this 
consulting work gives me a broad
 view into the practices for the
 teams building for the mobile 
web today.  And with a few 
exceptions, the booking document
 and.com and the work the 
FlipKart team did, it is hard 
for us to understand how hard 
mobile actually is.  have not 
been making friends in the 
JavaScript framework community 
by saying that thing out loud.  
As the polymer team will tell 
you, this is the PG version of 
the thing I have been saying for
 a year and a half.   some 
really tense meetings, I was 
saying things, it needs to be 
more asynchronous, or look at 
this trace, you need to load a 
lot less JavaScript and 12 K 
sounds great to me, or you need 
to break up your scripts so you 
are not executing this block.  
And they said, we get it, just 
stop telling us what to do and 
start telling us what goal to 
hit.  a break-through in the 
conversation.  And I put my 
finger in the air and I said it 
would be great if you can get me
 something interactive in three 
seconds in a 3G connection on 
first load and interactive from 
a second when I launch the home 
scree the polymers went off and 
went through the stages of grief
, we had some denial, anger, 
bargaining, depression, they sit
 far enough away from me that I 
cannot see them sobbing in their
 cubes and they came back with 
the Purple Pattern that Sam will
 talk more about.   JavaScript 
community has not internalized 
the message to the same degree, 
I'm here to let you down.  But 
we need to get to the bottom of 
what mobile actually means.  
when you see me tweeting things 
like this, this is actually kind
 of desperate.   have spent 
years of my life working in TC 
39 to make JavaScript a letter 
lang  better language
language, I have said for hours 
for accessibility, I have worked
 on features with jake dun and 
and a lot of other folks that 
are predicated on JavaScript in 
the first place.  It is not that
 I hate JavaScript or I think 
you should not be using framew
orks, I don't hate them, but it 
is that we are in the midst of a
 crisis and we don't understand 
how bad that crisis is. did, we 
would have modulated our 
behavior. what I'm seeing when I
 do reviews is almost 
universally bad news, in the 
context of the rail performance 
model quick re-cap of rail: R is
 responding to input in 100 
milise is animate, we only have 
8 miliseconds to do our work, 
when you think about VR, it is 
60 frames per when we are doing 
back ground work, we need to 
break it up so we can respond to
 subsequent input and stay under
 the 100 milisecond budget.  And
 we want to CLEEUT  complete 
&quot;A&quot;s for  action for the users 
in over a second.  If hay  they 
cannot complete it, we need to 
acknowledge it in less than a 
second and give the users a 
sense we are doing something for
 them.  have heard this number 
all day today and Darin had it 
in the keynote, they did the 
work to see what are the rates 
for sites and does performance 
matter, yes, 53 percent of users
 bounce from sites that take 
more than 3 seconds to load.  
You leave money on the table if 
your apps are low.  My 
experience is in performance 
travestys, my experience is not 
an outlier, that same report 
noted the average mobile site 
takes 19 seconds to load.   
Collectively, we are failing.   
more data on this and I don't 
have time to go into it, we are 
going to talk about some of the 
reasons why.  But I think that 
one of the key reasons that we 
are not succeeding today, to put
 it kindly, is a lack of 
understanding and respect for 
how hard mobile is.  If we, as a
 community, understood and 
respected the limits, we would 
be doing better.  No one wants 
to make bad useer expe of that 
is, we're the only platform in 
the world that takes all of our 
desktop stuff with us.  You don'
t take a Java jar that is a swi
nging application and run it on 
the mobile phone, you don't take
 a Mac binary and run it on your
 iPhone.  Everyone switched the 
tools when the form factor and 
constraints changed, we didn't, 
we didn't make the switch and 
the proof is in the puddle and 
the constraints I'm looking alt 
every day.  not the only reason.
  Why are most of the popular 
frameworks and the tools that we
 are using, the tool chains that
 we set ourselves up with, 
unacceptably slow by default?  
our tools producing such abysmal
 results? We are not bad people 
who want bad things for users.  
think, in part, it is that
 you all are actually developing
 on mobile phones.   want to 
understand, who uses Chrome 
DevTools to get the responsive 
view and understand how things 
will look on a phone?  And now 
keep your hand up if you are 
using web page tests for testing
 on real devices.   I like you. 
 Some of you are liars.   hands 
up if you use Chrome: Inspect to
 do real device debugging.   has
 done it more than 
turns out that the dev tools 
simulation is nothing nothing 
like real devices, network and 
CPU, please use them all the 
time, but they are not the real 
thing, not even close.  will 
give you a quick example.
 This is the I/O 2015 website, 
it was leading-edge that we 
launched in Chrome, it was fast,
 on desktop it was fast on this 
WiFi connection.   load is not 
far behind, that starts a nice 
swooping out animation, smooth 
most of the time.  We spent half
 a second in script, well behind
 the budget of getting a good, 
responsive experience and we get
 interactive content in 4 secon
ds, including the long a
nimation.  This is a great 
experience on this device, my 
Macbook pro.  And this, on the 5
 S, this DOM content does not 
load until 5 seconds, and part 
of the delay is due to the 
script eval, that locked up the 
main thread for 2 seconds, the 
execution balloons up to 4 
seconds in total and we don't 
get smooth animations, look at 
the long frames. The content 
does not become interactive 
until 7 seconds.  This is what 
TTI will tell you in White House
 and this is not acceptable:    
we learned that traces from real
 mobile devices are hard to 
master and when I show folks on 
their mobile devices, they have 
the same reaction and I do this 
a lot, they are shocked by how 
slow the mobile actually is, not
 the iPhones on their pockets, 
they don't understand the 
difference between desktop and 
mobile disk in storage and most 
of us are ignorant by how crazy 
mobile networks are in the real 
world.  I think we know at some 
level they are bad but it does 
not begin to cover it.  They are
 so bad.  important to un
derstand the depth of the 
deficit so we can start to adapt
 have been letting down a bunch 
of engineers over the last year,
 hard, soft, just easing them 
into this grief curve, it is 
hard but you have to put in the 
work.  Unless you put in the 
work, the web will not work for 
the next billion users. I say at
 every meeting, the truth is in 
the trace.  So DevTools and 
Chrome Tracing attach to real 
devices, nothing else cuts the 
mustmustard.  It does not get 
you there. is what sits on my 
desk in a typical day, all of 
those phones are less than $300 
new.  s at Congo report that the
 most commonly used phones in 
their market are in the sub-$100
 range, new.   carry most of 
these phones around in this 
balling  bag with me all the 
time and these are some slow 
phones.   carry them because I 
have no faith that anything on 
Chrome in the desktop is going 
to be like the real world unless
 I put it on the phone in 
emulateed  3G.  trust it.  And I
 don't trust the marketing 
numbers from phone vendors of 
these have flash-based storage, 
and script should not run 10 
times slower on my Nexus 5 S 
than my Macbook pro.  That is 
not a 10 X difference and there 
is no reason for that.  we just 
looked at these numbers, we 
would not understand what is 
going on.  If you think the $700
 iPhone in your pocket is what 
people are going to be adopting 
in the next couple of years, you
 are dedelusional.  
average set average price of 
phones are going down, not going
 up because they are buying new 
phones.  ide coverage is getting
 slower and you need to test 
that realityreality so we do not
 build what Bruce Lawson called 
the western mobile web.  is what
 we put together this year, it 
tests a bunch of graphics 
performance and
 it is JavaScript-bound.  Chrome
 ties or beats Safari
 in most case bench mark on the 
Chrome as Nexus 5 S.   as Nexus 
5 S is, I can get it running 15 
percent faster.  15 percent for 
one change, what did I do? 
 magic?  are all adults here, I 
think it is safe to admit that 
magic isn't actually a thing.   
I used a little bit of science 
and I added a make shift ice 
pack to the bottom of the phone.
  [ Laughter ].  got this idea 
from my colleague who has been 
optimizing this bench mark and 
we have been seeing massive 
variance across runs.  What is 
going on here?  that computers 
are just a bunch of wires, they 
have resistance and voltage and 
dissipate heat.  That same 
process generates computation 
and it also generates excess 
wattage in the form of BTUs.  So
 a chip built on the same 
process with the same 
architecture and the same number
 of transistors that dissipates 
more power and turns it into 
heat is the chip that does more 
math and doing more math is how 
you go faster.  it comes to 
competing, power equals power 
and power is heat.  the  the 
square on the thing, that is the
 heat sync sync and the jop  job
 of the heat sync is to 
dissipate the heat coming on top
 of the chip and that is on the 
top of the assembly for the chip
 with a little layer of thermal 
paste between it, so there is no
 air gap.  That would cause a 
thing that would explode and 
break the chip.  There's a fan 
running over the fax, extracting
 the heat that is dissipated out
 and the desktop or a high-end 
laptop can dissipate 60 watts on
 your load.  This is what that 
looks like, and I don't know 
about you, but I have not had 60
 watts dissipating more than 
once.  this is the key reason 
that mobile phones don't run as 
fast as desktops or laptops.  
These chips cannot get rid of 60
 watts without burning your 
hand.  we will look inside the 
guts of one of these phones, 
this is the remains of the Nexus
 5 S that I used daily for a few
 years, it gave up the smoke a 
few years ago and I dissected 
it.  And unlike the GPU, it is 
on different sections of the 
board, but the whole system of 
the chip lives on the under side
 of this, that thing is the powe
r supply.  On the flip side is 
the entire system on a chip.  It
 has an aluminum heat spreader 
like this.  When you flip it 
over, I took the shield off, 
that is all.  And the CPU module
 is not visible on this board, 
it is sitting underneath that 
Samsung-made RAM chip.  To get 
heat off of the CPU, it has to 
go through another chip and then
 through the casing of that chip
 and then to air and then to a 
thin aluminum thing to spread 
some of that and out what? The 
screen? Two separate layers of 
poly carbont plastic on the 
back, and that dissipates heat 
1,000 times less efficiently 
than aluminum and they can 
damage the circuitry and then 
the smoke escapwonder what I did
 to mine.  the designers saw 
this coming, they are putting in
 voltage and frequency scaling 
into chips for more than a 
decade and they are enabling 
features that allow OS
es to turn off cores entirely.  
This is my paper from 2011 and 
reads like a prophecyprophecy of
 an experience we are carrying 
around in our phone, the silicon
 in our devices is not available
 to be used thanks to the
 therm the thermal constrain 23 
 if you could have a heat sync, 
why don't they exist I get a 
bulky phone? ery contains 10 
watt hours of power.  Think of 
that in terms of the light bulb,
 you have to keep it lit for a 
couple of minutes if you can 
drain the battery quickly, if 
you don't, that causes the batt
eries to explode, don't try.  
Not a fun experiment at why 
mobile phones are slow, we 
cannot dissipate power, we 
cannot carry power. That battery
 has to deal with all sorts of 
stuff, it has to deal with a CPU
 and the GPU and the WiFi radio 
and the bluetooth radio and the 
NFC radio and the cell radio and
 the screen, and the touch 
digitizeer.  It has to power all
 of that stuff and keep you sati
sfied for a day's worth of use 
on a single charge on coming 
that cannot keep that bulb lit 
for more than a couple minutes. 
 of these phones are using 
big/little architecture and that
 means they are moving from 
high-power cores to low-power 
very aggressively.  These are 
called schedulers and all 
systems have them and they are a
 bit over the map, the thing to 
understand about them is that 
your phone probably is not using
 symmetric 
multi-processing.  Not all of 
the cores are at the same voltag
e all the time.  They are at 
different level the phones that 
you probably have is a global 
task scheduler that moves the 
work around.  And systems that 
do that management is hard to 
tune
 and use a lot HURestics to do 
it.  And it anticipates you 
doing work, some have heuristics
 for applications, it powers up 
the big core and that launches 
quickly.  looks nothing like the
 web workload, that today is 
tapping on the url, I'm waiting 
for the network, and maybe the 
core is scaled down again, and 
then the content XHSS  comes in 
and then we are processing is. 
The web is not aligned with the 
way that mobile phones to work, 
our workloads don't work with 
their workl
 Do you remember the light bulb?
  the reason you should not 
remember the numbers you are 
seeing in bench marking, the 
idea that your mobile phone CPU 
is as fast at the desktop CPU, 
you are going to get scaled and 
throttleed and things will move 
to a low-power state as 
aggressively as possible.  That 
is not how the world works.  We 
do not spin up as much as we do 
on desktop.   this looks a lot 
different, I will not talk about
 the differences in caches and 
pipeline depth and all of that 
matters -- you get what you pay 
for in a mobile phone.  And the 
Macbook propacks a 100 watt 
battery, that's the maximum 
amount that you are allowed to 
carry on to a plane, a design 
con  constraint.  Because of the
 heat sync and the fan, they can
 dissipatedissipate 40-60 watts 
of the cores are powered down, 
and that down at the bottom at 8
 cores but if you have four 
working for you at any given 
point in time, you are lucky 
CPUs are not what they thought 
they were, when would a hardware
 vendor opaque a number in  
maybe the pressure in devices 
don't allow us to, on the 
browser side, trade away space 
for it  speed.  So maybe we can 
get something back there, ther
e's a solid-state flash devices 
on a Linux OS if you are running
 Android, right? Who has heard 
of the term MLC flash?  I think 
it is, 
like, 10 people.  That is what I
 expected. That is multi-level 
chips and they are chips on top 
of chips inside the same package
 and that is how you make stora
ge cheaper.   it is a primary 
reason why the Nexus 5 S gets 
400 megabytes a second of read 
throughput and Mac book gets 2 
meg  megabytes a second.  You 
want to distribute reads and 
writes to as many different 
chips as possible.   for getting
 data is constant, you are 
running the controller in front 
and it distributes the memory to
 the chips.  Physical space is 
at a premium and so is power and
 vendors are consolidating the 
chips as much as possible, using
 fewer and fewer memory for that
 crip, which means
 lower parallel reasoning and 
low performance.   get the 
benefit that my
 Macbook pro does on a mobile d
evice, and flash systems have n
ot caught up.  What you should 
think about the medium mobile 
phone having is spinning disk 
from 2008.  Think of it that 
way, that's a good parallel.   
that is kind of
 a bummer, spinning metal.  If 
it that makes you sad, the state
 of mobile phone networks will 
make you wish that disks were 
the problem you actually had.   
remember 
Grigorik's high performance 
browser networking, I recommend 
it and it gives the bits from 
your server to your phone.  I 
recommend it.  If you spend some
 time with it, you will get to 
where I got to, which is that 
mobile networks hate you.  These
 are crypt nite to what this was
 built on, sell networks joy 
 gyrate from milisecond to 
milisecond.  transition one 
subtype to another at one time. 
 hot linking assumes the 
networks for the duration of the
 page, Guiyou Huang r know how 
that breaks down in practice, at
 least those of us who are using
 public transport, riding cars 
or use phones a good entry point
 and these are
 references into why these 
networks hate you so much, they 
do a lot. And what is really 
killing you is the variance and 
the volatility in the network 
substraight.  Isn't LTE going to
 save us? Maybe.  performance of
 LTE users compared to the year 
before, these networks are 
getting s fact, the variance in 
mobile networks is so massival 
that it feels it a farce to call
 it 2G or it alling  -- 3G.  is 
par for the cour
se in the U.S. but wrong in 
other markets, especially when 
you think about how many 
carriers throttle things even 
further down.  The same network 
type means dozens of different 
things for your users. these 
gigs in the house, think the 
band width delay product can 
bring you down and pthis this 
can eat your transport speed for
 breakfast.   mobile, this is 
worse than that.  And as Illya 
said reasonabilityly, a 4G user 
isn't a 4G user most of the time
 and they transition from high 
to low power states across cell 
locations, they do a lot of work
 to ensure that what  we don't 
see what is happening under the 
covers, but that creates 
variance.  When the users try to
 connect, they are in the 
low-connectivity or the low 
power state. he control power 
protocol determines how the 
connection is made.  For users 
on low power states, it takes 
seconds to start the hand shake 
at the physical layer to start 
transmiting data.  If you want 
bits in 3 seconds, you are in a 
tough spot.  You cannot send the
 headers down the wire until it 
is complete and consider heading
 the JavaScript to the mix.  The
 http archive is showing that 
this puts almost a megabyte of 
uncompressed script on the pages
 today.  On these networks and 
CPUs, this is a res  recipe for 
disaster.  No wonder that useers
 have the feeling that the 
mobile web is slow think there's
 a reason to feel sad about 
this, the tools and techniques 
we brought from the desktop era 
are not serving us.  make 
Progressive Web Apps, we need to
 do things differently, load 
less code, at the right times, 
and let the browser do work for 
us whenever possible.  
 platform isn't a nice to have 
on the mobile, it is the way to 
go.  Sam will go into the depth 
of the crisis we are in, but if 
you are using a popular 
JavaScript framework in the most
 naÃ¯ve way, you are failing by 
default, there is no sugar 
coating this.  Today's 
frameworks are mostly a sign of 
ignorance, privilege, or both.  
 can fix the ignorance, when we 
make better choices and avoid 
the slow be 
 by default loads. then they get
 a fast UI and the subsequent 
interactions are fast because 
they paid the cost up front. But
 many developers find that this 
is kind of slow, it feels slow 
to use.   once everything is l
oaded, it is great.  As you saw 
earlier, JavaScript on phones 
makes it slower.  It is 
single-threaded and we cannot 
use the pre-load scanner to grab
 the resources if they are built
 on the script, we cannot build 
on DOM or parse CSS. 
 You are betting the  the farm o
n a phone that is throttling in 
a low power state. ill move to
 isomorphic rendering, is there 
a different term for this? So 
the idea is to run JavaScript on
 the server, the same on the 
server as the client and then 
you send down a pre-computed 
snap shot of the html that you 
send and then you log the bundle
 and hope it works out. And 
unlike a mac
book pro, this works pretty 
well.  But with folks with 
lesser connections, the main 
thread lolocks up all the same 
and on the finishes, the content
 is displayed but it is not 
interactive.  And folks think 
that you are scrolling this 
stuff, but scrolling is an 
interaction.  If I cannot put my
 finger down and type on your 
UI, it isn't loaded.  It is 
broke right.  What we really 
want is progressive interact
ivety, and this is what the Purp
le Pattern that Sam will go into
 deliversshould only load the 
code that you need right now, 
for the apps that you are 
sending to users, and combined 
with service workers, it is 
possible to achieve this without
 bundling, this is when we take 
this seriously.   this is the 
polymer team that we released, 
you can shop it right now, and 
here it is running on a desk.
 BROWSER.  IT ONLY TAKES A FEW 
HUNDRED MILISECONDS OF SCRIPT.  
THE NEXUS 5 S, THE SAME WIFI 
CONNECTION.  THE APP SENDS DOWN 
AN AN  APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF THE
 SCRIPT SO WE GET A MINUTE AND A
 HALF OF SCRIPT OVERALL AND 
THANKS TO USING PUSH IN CONTRAST
 TO THE MAJOR BUNDLING, MOST 
LOAD WITH TINY EXECUTION SLICES 
SO THE SCREEN IS INTERACTIVE.  
THIS IS WHAT THE SCREEN LOOKS 
LIKE AND IT IS DIFFERENT IN A 
GOOD WAY.   OTHER THING THAT THE
 PURPLE PATTERN ADDS IS THE 
SERVICEWORKER.  YOU MIGHT THINK 
THAT SERVICE WORKERS ARE ABOUT 
HANDLING OFFLINE AND WHILE IT 
ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT, IT 
MATTERS BECAUSE IT LETS YOU 
DELIVER RELIABLE PERFORMANCE 
BECAUSE YOU CAN DELIVER THE 
TOP-LEVEL RESOURCE FROM THE 
CACHE, YOU CAN IMPROVE 
PERFORMANCE WHEN YOU USE SERVICE
 WORKERS THIS WAY.   SO THIS IS 
A CHART THAT ERIC
 BIDALMAN GATHERED AND FROM THIS
 DARK GREEN SPIKE, WHEN THE 
SERVICEWORKER IS ACTIVE, THE 
DISTRIBUTION OF LOAD TIME LEADS 
TO THE LEFT. AND THIS IS WHAT 
FASTER LOOKS LIKE. I HAVE SEEN 
TEAMS LOAD SERVICE WORKERS TO A 
NETWORK FIRST APPROACH, DON'T DO
 THAT.  PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.  
USE THE PURPLE PATTERN AND THE 
TOP-LEVEL APP WILL NEVER DEPEND 
ON THE NETWORK.  IF YOU CAN DO 
THAT, YOU WILL NOT COMPETE WITH 
NATIVE APPS ON THE EXPERIENCE 
YOU DELIVER.  IF YOU SAW DARIN'S
 KEYNOTE THIS MORNING, YOU WILL 
SEE THE CNET TECH TODAY PWA.  IF
 YOU DON'T DO THAT, YOU WILL 
NEVER MATCH THE PERFORMANCE.   
RECENTLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
AUTOMATE THE WAY THE 
SERVICEWORKER IS INSTALLING, YOU
 HEARD ABOUT LIGHTHOUSE, AND 
PLEASE PUT IT IN YOUR CLI, PUT 
IT IN YOUR CONTINUOUS 
INTEGRATION SYSTEM AND LET IT 
TELL YOU HOW YOU ARE DOING.  I 
THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT 
MOBILE IS MUCH, MUCH HARDER THAN
 WE UNDERSTOOD TO BE.  TO 
COLLECT GOOD APPS IN THIS ENVIRO
NMENT, WE NEED TO CHANGE THE 
OUTLOOK, OUR TOOLS, AND MOST OF 
ALL, OUR PRIORITIORITIES. THE 
FASTEST WAY TO GET IN TOUCH WITH
 THAT, THAT GROUND TRUTH IS TO 
TEST ON REAL HARDWARE.  IF YOU 
DON'T ALREADY HAVE A 
CIRCA-2014 ISH ANDROID PHONE, 
BUY AN MOTOG 4.  IF YOU CAN USE 
ONE OF THESE AND CHROME INSPECT 
ON DEV TOOLS, YOU WILL FIND YOUR
SELF IN TOUCH WITH HOW IT FEELS 
TO BE AT THE MEDIAN.  IF YOU 
CAN, GET SOMETHING WORSE, THIS 
IS AN ANDROID 1 FROM LAST YEAR, 
YOU PROBABLY CANNOT BUY ONE.  
GET SOMETHING WORSE IF YOU CAN, 
AND IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD THOSE, 
SELECT FROM THE LIST OF REAL 
MOBILE DEVICES THAT ARE SITTING 
IN A RACK AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO 
TEST THE URLS.  AND USE THE 
PURPM PATTERN AS MUCH USE CAN.  
TELEMETRY ARE POTENT WEAPONS ON 
YOUR ABILITY TO ENSURE YOU ARE 
DOING THE RIGHT THING.  I WANT 
TO APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A BIT OF 
A DOWNER TODAY, I'M USUALLY 
TELLING YOU ABOUT THE GREAT EXPE
RIENCES YOU CAN DELIVER, AND 
THAT IS TRUE, THERE IS GOOD 
NEWS, MODERN WEB TECHNOLOGY 
MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD GREAT
 EXPERIENCES, BUT IT INVOLVES 
RADICALLY MOVING OUR DEFAULT 
TOOLS. YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THE 
ELBOW GREASE YOU WILL HAVE TO 
PUT IN, BUT THE CHALLENGE IS 
MUCH LARGER THAN YOU PROBABLY 
THOUGHT IT WAS.  NOW THAT YOU 
KNOW, I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE 
FOLKS IN THIS ROOM AND ON THE

THIS TO MAKE GREAT EXPERIENCES.

ON THEIR PHONES.  MANY TIMES 
DOES THE

 SPECIFICALLY MENTION JAVASCR
IPT? S 0, 1, 18 R

 ANSWERS, 36, AND 5.  SO TWO 
MORE POPULAR ANSWERS THERE.  
SHOULD WE LOCK IT IN? 
? THREE, TWO, ONE -- THE LOW 
NUMBERS, THE CORRECT ANSWER IS 
-- YEAH.  BODY HAS GONE TO THE

 OUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE THAN 
ONE.  S GO FOR -- I QUITE LIKE 
MY JAVASCRIPT -- DOES EVERYONE 
LIKE JAVASCRIPT RESTRUCTURING? I
 DO.  DO THAT.  HERE WE GO.

 OR ERROR.   THINK WE WILL TRY 
TO COPY AND PASTE THE TEXT
 -- YES, ARE YOU SUITABLY ASHAME

 NOT PASSING AN OBJECT IN AND 
TRIES TO DESTRUCTURE THE OBJECT 
THAT DOESN'T EXIST, ERROR HAPPEN

 SUMMIT.  I'M ON THE SECURITY 
TEAM AND MY COLLEAGUES AND I ON 
THE SECURITY TEAM ARE ON A 
MISSION TO BE HONEST WITH THE 
PEOPLE USING OUR SOFTWARE ABOUT 
THE CONNECTIONS SECURITY.  AND 
WE NEED THE HELP OF YOU ALL, THE
 DEVELOPERS IN THIS ROOM, TO DO 
THAT.   FIRST WAY THAT I'M GOING
 TO ASK YOU TO HELP US OUT IS TO
 DO A LITTLE THOUGHT EXERCISE 
WHERE YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE 
SHOES OF AN AVERAGE WEB USER.   
PROBABLY NOT A DEVELOPER, MAYBE 
SOMEONE WHO IS EVEN NEW TO COMPU
TERS OR NEW TO THE WEB, AND IF 
YOU ARE AN AVERAGE WEB USER, 
LOOKING AT THIS BOX WHICH IS 
WHAT CHROME SHOWS WHEN YOU SET 
UP AN UNSECURE HTTP SITE IN 
CHROME TODAY  IF YOU ARE AN 
AVERAGE WEB USER, WHAT WILL THIS
 BOX SAY TO YOU? IT HAS THE 
NEUTRAL ICON.  SO IF YOU ARE 
SEEING THIS, WHAT WOULD IT SAY 
ABOUT THE WEBSITE YOU ARE 
VISITING? AS AN AVERAGE WEB 
USER,
 YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T REALIZE 
AN ATTACKER SITTING BETWEEN THE 
WEB BROWSER, THE COMPUTER AND 
THE WEB SERVER CAN READ ANY DATA
 THAT IS PASSING BACK AND FORTH 
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU. BE 
SENSITIVE DATA, LIKE PASSWORDS, 
CREDIT CARDS, HEALTH CONTENT, 
ALL OF THE STUFF THAT YOU 
PROBABLY DON'T WANT AN ATTACKER 
SITTING BETWEEN YOU AND THE 
BROTHERS CHAPS  WEB SERVER TO 
READ.   AS AN AVERAGE WEB USER 
LOOKING AT THIS OMNIBOX, YOU 
PROBABLY WOULDN'T REALIZE THAT 
EVEN THOUGH THE OMNIBOX SAYS 
EXAMPLE.COM, THAT'S NOT WHO YOU 
ARE NECESSARILY TALKING  
INSECURE HTTP, YOU COULD BE 
TALKING TO ANY ATTACKER THAT IS 
IMPERSONATING EXAMPLE.COM.  THAT
 IS PROBABLY PRETTY UNINTUITIVE 
TO THE AVERAGE USER WHO LOOKS A 
THAT OMNIBOX AND SEES EXAMPL 
THIS AVERAGE WEB USER WOULD NOT 
REALIZE THAT ANY ATTACKER 
SITTING BETWEEN THE COMPUTER AND
 THE WEB SERVER CAN TAMPER 
CONTENT BETWEEN THEM.  THAT 
CONTENT CAN BE TO INJECT ADS, TO
 INSERT FAKE OR MALICIOUS CONTE
NT, OR TO TRICK THE USER INTO 
DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING MALWA
RE.   IF THIS WAS YOUR SITE, 
WITH THIS ATTACKER MODIFYING OR 
TAMPERING WITH YOUR CONTENT, 
THIS IS VERY BAD FOR YOUR USER, 
THEY ARE PROBABLY GETTING A POOR
 USER EXPERIENCE, THEY MIGHT 
EVEN BE TRICKED INTO DOWNLOADING
 MALWARE, AND IT IS BAD FOR YOUR
 SITE, IT IS BAD FOR YOUR BRAND,
 YOUR REVENUE, YOU ARE NOT 
DELIVERING THE LEGITIMATE, GOOD 
USER EXPERIENCE YOU WANT TO 
DELIVE THIS RISKS ARE REAL, THEY
 HAPPEN EVERY SINGLE DAY IN 
COFFEE SHOPS, WIFI, ISPS 
INJECTING ADS, SOFTWARE LIKE 
FIRE SHEEP THAT MAKE IT EASY TO 
PASSIVELY SNIFF ON UNENCRYPTED 
SESSION COOK  COOKIES.  THESE 
THINGS HAPPEN, THEY ARE REAL, 
AFFECTING USERS, AND THE WAY TO 
PROTECT USERS FROM THAT IS TO 
USE HTTPS. E RISKS ARE WHY WE ON
 THE CHROME SECURITY TEAM ARE ON
 THIS MISSION TO FIX THIS UI, 
WHICH WE DON'T THINK AS BEING 
PARTICULARLY HONEST, OR 
FORTHCOMING, ABOUT WHAT IS  IT 
MEANS TO USE INSECURE HTTP.   WE
 PLAN TO DO IN THE
 FUTURE IS NOT THIS SORT OF 
NEUTRAL PRESENTATION, BUT A PRES
ENTATION THAT DELIVERS A WARNING
 TO THE USER, THE RISKS THAT 
THEY ARE USING BY USING INSECURE
 HTTP.   IN THIS TALK, I'M GOING
 TO TELL YOU ABOUT OUR MISSION 
TO USE THIS -- TO GET TO A PLACE
 WHERE WE CAN USE THIS WARNING 
UI TO BE HONEST WITH OUR USERS 
ABOUT THEIR CONNECTION SECURITY 
AND HOW AND WHY YOU AS 
DEVELOPERS SHOULD HELP US WITH 
THAT.  Y, I'M GOING TO BE 
TELLING YOU ABOUT SOME 
NEWLY-RELEASED METRICS, ABOUT 
THE HONEST STATE OF HTTPS IN THE
 WORLD TODAY, AND THOSE METRICS 
WILL HOPEFULLY HELP MOTIVATE WHY
 AND HOW YOU AS DEVELOPERS SHOUL
D HELP US MOVE THE WEB TO A 
PLACE WHERE IT IS HTTPS BY 
DEFAULT, IT IS GOOD FOR YOU AND 
YOUR USERS, THE SITE, AND THE 
WEB AS A WHOLE AND FINALLY, I 
WILL PREVIEW SOME UPCOMING 
CHROME UI CHANGES THAT 
ILLUSTRATE OUR STRATEGY WHICH, 
IS TO GENTLY PROD DEVELOPERS 
LIKE YOU INTO ADOPTING HTTPS 
WHILE EASING OUR USERS INTO THE 
IDEA THAT HTTP IS PROBABLY NOT 
WHAT THEY WANT TO BE
 USING.  HE SPIRIT OF HONESTY, 
I'M GOING TO START BY TELLING 
YOU ABOUT A SECTION THAT WE 
ADDED ADDED LAST WEEK TO THE 
GOOGLE TRANSPARENCY REPORT.   
GOOGLE TRANSPARENCY REPORT, IF 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEFORE, IS A
 COLLECTION OF ALL SORTS OF 
INTERESTING AND USEFUL DATA 
ABOUT GOOGLE AND THE INTERNET AS
 A WHOLE AND FOR MOST OF THIS 
YEAR, WE HAD A SECTION ON THIS 
TRANSPARENCY REPORT THAT IS 
DEVOTED TO HTTPS.  VERY 
INTERESTING DATA, BUT UNTIL NOW,
 IT IS FOCUSED ON HTTPS SERVICE 
AT GOOGLE, GOOGLE TRAFFIC, AND 
TOP SITES.  TRACKING THIS DATA 
HAS BEEN PRETTY ENCOURAGING.  
LAUNCHED THE TRANSPARENCY REPOR
T, THE HTTPS SECTION OF THE 
TRANSPARENCY REPORT IN FEBRUARY,
 WE HAVE SEEN 12 MORE OF THE TOP
 SITES ADOPT MODERN HTTPS.  THIS
 IS NOT NECESSARILY THE FULL 
PICTURE, WHAT ARE THE TOP SITES 
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR 
PEOPLE USING CHROME EVERY DAY?  
WHY, LAST WEEK WE RELEASED A NEW
 SECTION IN THE TRANSPARENCY 
REPORT THAT RELEASES DATA ABOUT 
HTTPS USAGE AS CHROME USERS SEE 
IT.  ONE OF THE MILESTONES THA 
THAT WE PASSED RECENTLY, YOU CAN
 SEE HERE ON DAVING  DESK STOP 
PLATFORMS, CHROME USERS LOAD 50 
PERCENT OF THEIR PAGES OVER 
HTTPSHTTPS.  THIS IS A BIG TREND
 AND WE ARE HAPPY ABOUT THAT, 
HTTPS USAGE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT A 
PERCENTAGE OF WHAT CHROME USERS 
LOAD ARE SUBTLEY INCREASING.  WE
 WANT A FASTER INCREASE, BUT 
SLOW BUT STEADY? WE WILL TAKE IT
 AND ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT 
IS NOT THE PERCENTAGE OF PAGES 
LOADED OVER HTTPS, BUT THE 
PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT AS YOU 
CAN SEE FROM THIS GRAPH, THIS IS
 AN EVEN MORE OPTIMISTIC WAY TO 
LOOK AT IT.  CHROME USERS SPEND,
 ON DESKTOP PLATFORMS, 75 
PERCENT OF THEIR TIME OR MORE ON
 HTTPS.  WE DON'T NECESSARILY 
KNOW WHY THIS IS FOR SURE, BUT 
USERS PROBABLY SPEND MORE TIME 
ON SITES LIKE GMAIL, FACEBOOK, 
OR PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS THAN 
WHEN THEY ARE GOING AROUND FOR 
NAVIGATION, CLICKING A LINK, AND
 ON THE WEB.  USERS SPEND MOST 
OF THE TOP ON HEAVY-DUTY APPS 
THAT USE TOP SITES SUCH AS HTTPS
 WANT TO MAKE A NOTE ABOUT 
ANDROID USAGE, THAT IS THE GREEN
 LINE AND THE OUTLIER AT THE 
BOTTOM AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHY 
THIS IS FOR SURE, BULLET  BUT 
ONE HYPOTHESIS WE HAVE, ON 
ANDROID, THIS SERIOUS WEB BROWS
ING ON G MAIL, FACEBOOK, THAT 
STUFF USERS ARE DOING IN APPS.  
SO FROM CHROME'S PERSPECTIVE, 
THEY ARE 
SEEING NON-HTTPS TRAFFIC AND 
WITH HTTPS, THEY TEND TO DO IN 
APPS THAT MAKES SENSE AND AS THE
 WEB IS MORE AND MORE ENGAGING 
AND YOU BUILD AND GAIN TRACTION 
ON PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS, WE HOPE
 TO SEE THIS LINE CONTINUING TO 
GO UP AND CATCH UP WITH DESKTOP.
   THIS IS GREAT NEWS, 
DEVELOPERS LIKE YOU ARE ADOPTING
 HTTPS.  YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING 
WHY, WHAT IS DRIVING THIS SLOW 
BUT STEADY INCREASE IN HTTPS 
USAGE? BE BUT I WANT TO PULL OUT
 A FEW THINGS THAT YOU HEAR OVER
 AND OVER AGAIN ANECDOTALLY FROM
 DEVELOPERS THAT ARE TRANS
ITIONING THEIR SITES TO HTTPS.  
 MODERN BROWSERS LIKE CHROME, 
FIREFOX, AND OTHERS ARE RESTRI
CTING USAGE OF POWERFUL FEATURES
 OVERRES ARE ALREADY NOT 
AVAILABLE IN IN SECURE HTTP AND 
SOME WILL BE RESTRICTED IN THE 
NEAR FEATURE, LIKE PAYMENTS AND 
CRECREDENTIAL APIS AND ALL SORTS
 OF THINGS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT 
TODAY TO BUILD A PROGRESSIVE WEB
 APP IS ONLY AVAILABLE OVER 
HTTPS SO WE ARE NOT DOING THIS 
TO BE MEAN, WE THINK THAT IT 
MAKES SENSE AND THAT IS THE BEST
 THING TO GIVE OUR USERS MORE 
CONTROL OVER THEIR PRIVACY AND 
DEVICES AND DATA.   I THINK THIS
 IS EASIEST UNDERSTOOD WITH AN 
EXAMPLE LIKE GEO-LOCATION.   IF 
A WEBSITE WANTS ACCESS TO MY 
LOCATION, AND IF I GRANT THEM 
ACCESS TO MY LOCATION, I'M GIVI
NG THEM INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE 
I LIVE, WHERE I WORK, WHERE I 
SHOP, WHERE I GO TO THE DOCTOR, 
WHAT I DO ON MY WEEKENDS, ALL 
SORTS OF THINGS THAT IS PRETTY 
PRIVACY-SENSITIVE INFORMATION 
FOR A PRIVATE WEBSITE TO HAVE.  
 BE OKAY WITH SHARING MY 
LOCATION WITH A WEBSITE, BUT I 
CANNOT MAKE A MEANINGFUL 
DECISION UNLESS I KNOW THE 
WEBSITE I'M TALKING TO WHICH IS 
WHAT HTTPS GIVES YOU, YOU DO NOT
 HAVE ACCESS TO THESE FEATURES 
UNLESS THE USER KNOWS WHICH 
WEBSITE THEY ARE TALKING TO.   
AS I SAID, CHROME IS NOT THE 
ONLY BROWSER DOING THIS. AND ONE
 EXAMPLE OF THIS IS FIREF POST, 
THEY ANNOUNCE THAT THEY ARE R
EQUIRING HTTPS FOR ALL NEW 
FEATURES.  SO BROWSERS ARE PRETT
Y MUCH UNITED AROUND THE HOPE 
THAT IT MAKES SENSE THAT IF YOU 
ARE GOING TO GRANT ACCESS TO 
PRIVACY-SENSITIVE INFORMATION OR
 A POWERFUL FEATURE, THE USER 
SHOULD KNOW WHICH WEBSITE THEY 
ARE GRANTING THAT ACCESS TO.   
THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE REASON 
BEHIND ONE OF THE DRIVERS FROM 
HTTPS ADOPTION, WE ARE HEARING 
IT FROM THE DEVELOPERS.  EXAMPLE
 OF THIS IS THE BBC WHICH CITEED
 THESE RESTRICTIONS ON FEATURES 
WHICH IS WHY THEY MOVED THEIR 
WEBSITE TO HTTPS THIS YEAR AND 
ANOTHER CONSIDERATION BEHIND THE
 SLOW BUD STEADY INCREASE IN 
HTTPS USAGE IS PERFORMANCE IS 
GETTING BETTER AND BETTER EVERY 
DAY AND IT IS NO LONGER THE B
OTTLENECK IT ONCE WAS 10 OR 15 
YEARS AGO.  WHAT YOU ARE SEEING 
IS A WEBSITE BUILT BY ONE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES, IT IS CALLED 
ISTISFASTYET.COM.  AND THIS 
TELLS YOU ABOUT ALL OF THE 
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS AND 
ENHANCEMENTS THAT ARE COMING OUT
 EVERY DAY WITH HTTPS AND IT 
TELLS YOU TO TO CONFIGURE THE 
SERVER WITH THEM AND WHICH 
SERVERS SUPPORT THEM.  SO IT IS 
A GREAT SOURCE OF INFORMATION 
ABOUT HTTPS PERFORMANCE I WANT 
TO DRAW PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO 
HTTP2, WHICH IS THE NEXT VERSION
 OF HTTP.  AND IT OFFERS A SUITE
 OF WEB PERFORMANCE 
IMPROVEMENTS, IT IS CRITICAL IN 
THIS TALK BECAUSE HTTP2 IS ONLY 
AVAILABLE IF YOU ARE ALSO USING 
HTTPS.   WHAT WE HEAR FROM DEVE
LOPERS IS THAT IN THE CASE THAT 
THEY DO ENCOUNTERENCOUNTER SOME 
PERFORMANCE HIT WHEN THEY MOVE 
TO HTTPS, IT CAN OFTEN BE MORE 
THAN OFF-SET BY THE PERFORMANCE 
ADVANTAGES THAT THEY UNLOCK, 
USING THINGS THAT ARE ONLY 
AVAILABLE OVER HTTPS, 
LIKE HTTP2.   THESE ARE SOME OF 
THE THINGS, THE RESTRICTIONS ON 
POWERFUL FEATURES, THE IMPROV
EMENT IN HTTPS PERFORMANCE, THES
E ARE THE FEATURES OF WHAT IS 
DRIVING THE SLOW AND STEADY 
INCREASE OF HTTPS ADOPTION.  BUT
 WE STILL HAVE A GAP TO CLOSE 
AND WE NEED YOUR HELP DOING THAT
 BY ADOPTING HTTPS ON YOUR SITE 
SO WE CAN GET AS CLOSE AS 
POSSIBLE TO HTTPS EVERYWHERE.   
WE NEED THAT, WE NEED TO BE AS 
CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO HTTPS 
EVERYWHERE IF WE'RE GOING TO GET
 TO THE PLACE WE WANT TO BE, 
WHERE WE ARE HONEST WITH OUR 
USERS ABOUT CONNECTIONS  POINT 
HERE IS THAT, IF WE WERE TO, 
TOMORROW, TURN ON THIS WARNING 
STATE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE WHERE
 WE DO THIS KIND OF SCARY, RED, 
DANGEROUS WARNING INDICATOR ON 
INSECURE HTTP, IF WE WERE TO 
JUST TURN THAT ON TOMORROW, IT 
WOULD PROBABLY BE A LITTLE BIT 
COUNTRS WOULD SEE IT EVERYWHERE,
 THEY WOULD SEE IT ALL THE TIME,
 THEY WOULD LEARN TO IGNORE IT, 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO IGNORE IT TO 
USE THE WEB, AND THEY KIND OF 
GET TRAINED TO BASICALLY JUST 
NOT SEE IT.   THAT'S NOT WHAT WE
 WANT.  WE WANT IT TO BE THE 
CASE THAT INSECURE HTTP IS A 
PRETTY RARE OCCURRENCE, SO RARE 
THAT WHEN THE USER ENCOUNTERS 
IT, WE CAN SHOW THEM THIS WORK
 -- WARNING, THEY WILL PAY 
ATTENTION, THEY WILL NOT BE 
CONFUSED AND THEY WILL 
UNDERSTAND THE RISKS OF THE 
SITUATION THEY ARE IN WHERE THEY
 DON'T HAVE ANY GUARANTEES 
AGAINST ATTACKERS READING THEIR 
CONTENT OR INJECTING MALICIOUS 
CONTENT OR ANYTHING THAT I 
TALKED ABOUT IN THE BEGINNING OF
 THE TALK SO WE ARE ASKING YOU 
TO IMPLEMENT HTTPS IN YOUR SITE,
 IT HELPS YOUR MISSION AND OUR 
MISSION AND THE USERS TO BE MORE
 EDUCATED AND TO HAVE ACTIVITY 
ON THE WEB LESS INSECURE.   THIS
 CAN BE OVERWHELMING, AND THAT 
IS WHY WE AT CHROME AND GOOGLE 
AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE 
MOBILIZING A LOT OF SUPPORT AND 
INVESTMENT AROUND HELPING YOU 
TRANSITION YOUR SITE TO HTTPS.  
 OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT IS 
BECOMING CRITICAL IN THIS 
MOVEMENT IS CALLED LET'S ENCRY
PT.  S ENCRYPT IS A CERTIFICATE 
AUTHORITY, A CERTIFICATE BEING A
 CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROOF OF IDENTITY
 TO USE HTTPS, TO PROVE THAT 
YOUR SITE IS WHO YOU SAY IT IS. 
 IF YOU SAY YOU ARE EXAMPLE.COM,
 YOU GET A CERTIFICATE PROVING 
THAT AND THAT'S WHAT GIVES USERS
 THE GUARANTEE THAT THEIR 
BROWSERS ARE TALKING TO THE REAL
 EXAMPLE.COM HISTORICALLY, 
GETTING SERSER  CERTIFICATES HAS
 NOT ALWAYS BEEN EASY OR FREE.  
BUT THANKS TO SITES LIKE LET'S 
ENCRYPT, YOU CAN DO IT FOR NO 
MONEY AND THEY CAN DO THE 
AUTOMATIC CREATION AND RENEWAL 
OF YOUR CERTIFICATES.  WE THINK 
THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOUR 
INFRASTRUCTURE GOING FORWARDS, 
CHROME MADE A LARGE DONATION TO 
LETS ENCRYPT BECAUSE IT IS A 
CORE PART OF THE PROCESS OF 
BUILDING A WEB APPLICATION THAT 
THEY HAVE COME TO DEPEND ON.   
IN CASE YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME 
THAT LET'S ENCRYPT IS HERE IS 
STAY, YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE 
NUMBERS.  THIS IS A CRITICAL 
PART OF INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE 
THAT IS REALLY GOING TO CHANGE 
THE WAY THAT PEOPLE DO HTTPS, IT
 ALREADY 
HAS.   INTERNALLY A LITTLE BIT 
MORE AT CHROME AND AT GOOGLE, 
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT HTTPS 
SOMETIMES WORRIES DEVELOPERS IS 
AD REVENUE. IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
 ABOUT THIS CONCERN BEFORE, IT 
MIGHT SEEN RANDOM, WHAT DO ADS 
HAVE TO DO WITH HTTPS? 
CONNECTION IS THAT WHEN YOU MOVE
 YOUR CITATION TO HTTPS, YOU 
HAVE TO MOVE ALL OF YOUR 
CONTENT, ALL OF YOUR THIRD-PARTY
 RESOURCES, INCLUDING ADS, FOR 
THE SITE TO WORK PROPERLY 
DEVELOPERS ARE OFTEN WORRIED 
ABOUT HAVING TO MOVE THE SITE TO
 HTTPS, ALL THE ADS TO HTTPS, 
AND LOSING THE AD REVENUE FROM 
ADS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OVER HTTP
 TO HELP ALLEVIATE THIS CONCERN,
 ALL GOOGLE SOURCE ADS ARE 
ALREADY SERVED OVER HTTPS SO 
WHEN YOU MOVE TO HTTPS, YOU WILL
 NOT HAVE A REVENUE HIT FROM 
GOOGLE SOURCE ADS BECAUSE THEY 
ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE OVER 
HTTPS.  THIS IS BACKED UP BY 
DEVELOPERS IN THE WILD, THE 
WASHINGTON POST MOVED TO HTTPS 
RECENTLY AND SAW NO HIT IN 
REVENUE FROM THEIR GOOGL
E-SOURCED 
ADS.  HER GOOGLE SERVICE THAT 
PEOPLE SOMETIMES WORRY ABOUT 
WHEN MOVING TO HTTPS IS LOSING 
SEARCH RANKING.  ANYTIME YOU 
MAKE A LARGE CHANGE TO YOUR SITE
 LIKE THIS, YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE
 YOU FOLLOW THE PROPER STEPS TO 
MAKE SURE YOU MINIMIZE THE 
DISRUPTION TO YOUR ORGANIC 
SEARCH TRAFFIC THESE ARE SOME OF
 THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE,
 DO THEY DO IT ALL AT ONCE, A 
LITTLE BIT AT A TIME, WHAT FLUC
TUATIONFLUCTUATIONS SHOULD THEY 
EXPECT, AND WHAT DO THEY DO WITH
 THE SITE MAPS AND HOW DO THEY 
TELL GOOGLE THEY ARE MOVING TO 
HTTPS AND ALL OF THOSE SORTS OF 
THINGS.   IN THIS SPACE IS 
EXPANDING AND IMPROVING UPON D
OCUMENTATION AND WE REALLY LIKE 
TO HEAR FROM DEVELOPERS ABOUT 
HOW -- WHAT THEIR QUESTIONS ARE 
SO WE CAN ANSWER THEM PUBLI TWO 
FAQS, I RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE ALL 
THE TIME.  THEY ARE JUST LISTS 
OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE WITH 
VARIOUS, STRAIGHTFORWARD PRACTI
CAL ADVICE ANSWERING QUESTIONS 
FROM THE PREVIOUS SLIDES, AND WE
 HAVE A WEB FUNDAMENTALS GUIDE 
THAT WALKS YOU THROUGH THE 
PROCESS OF SETTING UP, CONF
IGURING HTTPS, PERFORMANCE TUNIN
G, AND HOW TO HANDLE YOUR 
TRANSITION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE
 OF GOOGLE SEARCH RANKING.  
 WAS ABLE TO MOVE TO HTTPS WITH 
MINIMAL DISRUPTION TO THEIR 
SEARCH RANKING. WE HOPE WE 
IMPROVED THAO  THE DOCUMENTATION
 TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THAT THIS 
IS NOT A TRAUMATIC THING FOR 
YOUR SEARCH RANKING, IT REAL
LYTIENT  SHOULDN'T BE AND 
NEAREST AND DEAREST TO MY HEART,
 I CAN SPEND A TALK TALKING 
ABOUT WEB PLATFORM AND BROWSER 
TOOLS WE ARE BUILDING AND STYL
IZING AND EVANGELIZEING IN OTHER
 BROWSERS TO HELP USERS LIKE YOU
 MOVE TO HTTPS.   IS ONE ASPECT 
I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON, THE 
DEVTOOLS SECURITY PAN LPANEL.  
IF YOU OPEN UP YOUR SITE IN 
DEVTOOLS, YOU CAN FIGURE OUT IF 
YOU HAVE DONE IT RIGHT, IF YOU 
MADE ANY MISTAKES IN YOUR TRANS
ITION, AND IT WILL HELP YOU 
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW
 YOU CAN FIX
 THEM.  E TOOLS ARE WAYS THAT WE
 AT CHROME AND AT GOOGLE WANT TO
 GUIDE DEVELOPERS INTO USING 
HTTPS ON THEIR SITES.   
SIMULTANEOUSLY, WE ARE PLANNING 
TO START EASING USERS INTO THE 
IDEA THAT HTTP IS BAD, WE WANT 
TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE ENOUGH 
DEVELOPERS ARE USING HTTPS SO WE
 CAN WARN USERS WHEN THEY HAVE A
 LACK OF CONNECTION SECURITY ON 
INSECURE HTTP.  WE DON'T WANT TO
 JOLT THEM INTO THAT WORLD, WE 
WANT TO EASE THEM INTO THIS 
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HTTP AND
 BAD.  
 IS THE NEW UI TREATMENT THAT WE
 WILL BE USING FOR SOME INSECURE
 HTTP SITES IN CHROME 56, WHICH 
GOES TO STABLE IN JANUARY.  YOU 
CAN SEE THAT WE ARE STILL DOING 
A NEUTRAL INFORMATIONAL ICON,
 BUT WE ARE ADDING THE 
NOT-SECURE TEXT TO EDUCATE USERS
 WHAT IT MEANS TO USE INSECURE 
HTTP.  AND WE WILL BE 
SPECIFICALLY LAUNCHING THIS FOR 
HTTP PAGES THAT HAVE PASS WORDS 
OR CREDIT CARD INPUTS ON THEM.  
 OUR GOAL HERE IS TO USE 
PASSWORDS AND CREDIT CARDS AS A 
SIGNAL IF A USER IS IN A 
SENSITIVE SITUATION WHERE THEY 
WANT TO BE CAREFUL WITH THEIR 
DATA AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO WARN
 THEM ABOUT THE RISKS OF 
INSECURE HTTP.   THIS FEATURE IS
 STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND I WANT
 TO IS STRESS IT IS SUBJECT TO 
CHANGE, YOU CAN TRY IT OUT IN 
CHROME CANARY TODAY AND WE WOULD
 LOVE FOR YOU TO DO THAT, TO 
REPORT BUGS, SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE
 BROWSING THE WEB WITH THIS 
FEATURE ON, I FIND IT 
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT IT IS 
LIKE, A GLIMPSE OF BROWSING THE 
WEB IN THE FUTURE AND TO TRY IT 
OUT ON YOUR SITE IF YOU ARE NOT 
USING HTTPS SO YOU  CHROME 
CANARY, GO TO CHROME://FLAGS, 
AND FLIP IT TO THE OPTION THAT 
SAYS ABOUT PASSWORDS AND CREDIT 
CARDS ON THE HTTP PAGE.  SO YOU 
CAN PUT THE BROWSER ON YOUR WEB 
OR YOUR SITE, AND WE ARE DOING 
AND DETECTING WHEN A PASSWORD OR
 CREDIT CARD FIELD APPEARS ON 
THE PAGE AND TRIGGERS THE NOT 
SECURE OMNIBOX.  SO TRY THIS 
OUT, TRY OUT YOUR OWN SITE IF 
YOU ARE NOT HTTPS AND IF YOU 
FIND THE USERS ARE SEEING THE 
NOT SECURE WARNING COME JANUARY,
 MAYBE YOU WILL USE HTTPS AND WE
 HOPE THIS INCENTIVIZES USERS TO
 MOVE TO HTTPS AND BUILDS THE 
ASSOCIATION IN USERS MINDS 
BETWEEN SENSITIVE DATA AND THE 
LACK OF SECURITY IN HTTP.   
FORTUNATELY, IT IS NOT JUST 
ABOUT NEGATIVE INDICATORS. WE 
HAVE STICKS AND WE ALSO HAVE 
CARROTS.   YOU DOWNLOAD CHROME 
55 BETA, WE ARE ALREADY USING 
THIS SECURE -- THIS SECURE CHIP 
FOR SITES THAT ARE USING HTTPS. 
  IT IS NOT JUST THAT YOU WILL 
GET A NOT SECURE WARNING IF YOU 
HAVE A PASSWORD OR CREDIT CARD 
ON HTTP.  IF YOU ADOPT HTTPS, 
YOU GET A SHINY BADGE NEXT TO 
YOUR SITE TELLING USERS YOU ARE 
USING A SECURE CONNECTION.   WE 
HOPE THAT THIS PROVIDES SOME 
INCENTIVE TO ADOPT HTTPS IN 
ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER 
BENEFITS YOU GET, FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY 
BENEFITS YOU GET FROM THE USERS 
AND THE ABILITY TO USE POWERFUL 
FEATURES, LIKE GEO LOCATION AND 
SERVICE WORKERS THAT YOU GET 
WITH 
HTTPS.   THAT'S THE GLIMPSE OF 
THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.  THESE 
SECURE WARNINGS FOR SECURE SITES
 AND STARTING TO SHOW NOT SECURE
 WARNINGS, WHICH IS CLOSER TO 
HONEST TRUTH ABOUT HTTP FOR SOME
 SITES IN CHROME 56.  WE HOPE TO
 GET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO A 
PLACE WHERE THE WEB IS AS CLOSE 
AS POSSIBLE TO HTTPS EVERYWHERE 
SO WE CAN BE FULLY HONEST AND 
TRUTHFUL WITH OUR USERS ABOUT 
WHAT INSECURE HTTP 
MEANS WE ARE CONSIDERING DOING 
IN THE FUTURE IS P PICKING UP
 MORE AND MORE SIG  SIGNALS, 
FIRST FOR CREDIT CARDS, AND THEN
 WHEN A USER IS INCOGNITO, AND 
WE CAN MAKE MORE OF AN ASSUMPTI
ON THAT THE USER IS IN A 
SENSITIVE SITUATION AND WARN 
THEM AGGRESSIVELY ABOUT THE 
INSECURITY OF HTTP UNTIL WE GET 
THE WORLD THAT WE WANT TO BE IN.
 THE THEME OF MY TALK TODAY HAS 
BEEN HONESTY. THE NEW 
TRANSPARENCY REPORT METRICS SHOW
 AN HONEST PICTURE OF THE WORLD 
WHEN IT COMES TO HTTPS USAGE, IT
 SHOWS THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE
 RIGHT DIRECTION, WE HAVE A SLOW
 BUT STEADY INCREASE, BUT WE 
NEED YOUR HELP CLOSING THE GAP 
BY ADAPTING HTTPS ON YOUR SITE, 
WHICH IS GOOD FOR YOU, YOUR 
REVENUE, BRAND, USER EXPERIENCE,
 PRIVACY, SECURITY, AND FOR THE 
WEB AS A WHOLE, THE WHOLE 
ECOSYSTEM, BY HELPING US GET TO 
A POINT WHERE WE CAN BE HONEST 
AND TRUTHFUL WITH THE PEOPLE 
USING CHROME ABOUT THEIR 
CONNECTIONS SECURITY.  K YOU, 
AND ENJOY THE REST OF THE
 SUMMIT.  
 THIS IS OFF TO A GOOD START.  
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?  GOOD.  .  
SO THIS ISN'T JAKE.   IT IS TIME
 FOR A BREAK, BUT, WHAT WE 
THOUGHT WE WOULD DO IF YOU WANT 
TO GET A DRINK OR DO WHATEVER, 
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME 
LIVE-CODEING, WHICH NEVER GOES 
WRONG, OBVIOUSLY.  CHALLENGING 
LENGING THE DEMIGODS IS A GREAT 
IDEACAN SEE HOW MY DAY IS IN T
ERMS OF BUGS.  BUT WE ARE ADDING
 A SERVICEWORKER TO A SITE TO 
GIVE EVERYBODY AN INSIGHT INTO 
HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS 
OF
 PUTTING A SERVICEWORKER ON TO A
 SITE.  YES, THIS IS WHAT WE 
HAVE BEEN DOING ONCE A MONTH, WE
 HAVE BEEN BUILDING THINGS 
BEFORE WHERE WE HAVE BOTH A 
ROUTER, WE HAVE CON DIMENDS IN 
AND NAVIGATION TO A DIFFERENT 
SITE AND WE HAVE TO USE THAT AND
 WE HAVE TO MAKE IT OFFLINE CAP
PABLE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN 
THAT, STAY.  ARE GETTING SET UP 
OVER HERE,
 AND SO -- THE KIND OF THINGS 
YOU SHOULD EXPECT OF US -- 
 ARE ON.  IF YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS DURING THIS, YOU CAN 
GO TO THE CHROMIUM DEV SLACK AND
 YOU ASK ASK THEM IN THE MAIN 
CHAT AREA THERE.  I'M GOING TO 
BE WATCHING THAT AND I'M GOING 
TO INTERRUPT HIM. 
 ME AND PROBABLY MAKE EVEN MORE 
MISTAKES.  WE WILL GET STARTED, 
YOU SEE THE THING THAT WE HAVE 
BUILT A WHILE AGO, IT IS A 
WEBSITE WITH NO IMPORTANT 
CONTENT, BUT YOU GET NICE 
ANIMATIONS.  WHEN YOU GO TO A 
DIFFERENT SITE, YOU CAN SEE THAT
 WE ARE ONLY REQUESTING A 
PARTIAL, A SINGLE LINE OF HTML 
THAT IS SWAPPED IN FOR 
TRANSITION MAGIC AND THAT'S WHAT
 WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE
 WORK OFFLINE.  S NOT GO 
FULL-SCREEN.  SO THE FIRST THING
 I WILL DO, I WILL REGISTER A 
SERVICEWORKER.   A FAST TYPER, 
I'M DONE.  CHEAT!  YOU BIG OLD 
CHEAT,  I WILL START WITH A 
STREAM VERSION.  YOU -- IF 
SERVICEWORKER AND NAVIGATOR, WE 
WILL TALK ABOUT THAT.  IS 
PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT.  SO IT 
PATCHES THE NAVNAVIGATOR TO THE 
SERVICEWORKER CALL.  YOU WILL 
CONTROL EVERYTHING -- 
EVERYTHING. YES. RIGHT. AND, AS 
YOU WERE.   VERSION STREAM I DO 
BECAUSE IT IS A NICE PLACE TO 
FORCE A RE-LOAD OF THE 
SERVICEWORKER.  SO, THE 
SERVICEWORKER FILE IS GOING TO 
BE CHECKED IF IT HAS CHANGE, IF 
IT IS 
BYTE-EQUIVALENT, IT IS NOT GOING
 TO BE RE-LOADED.  IF IT IS 
CHANGED -- YOU CAN SET THE CACHI
NG ON THE JAVASCRIPT CACHE 
BROWSER, WE WILL GO AND GET A 
NEW VERSION OF THE 
SERVICEWORKER. 
 YOU CAN BE STUCK WITH THE 
SERVICEWORKER VERSION FOR 24 
HOURS.  WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 
THAT YOU ARE SERVING IT --  
EXAMPLE, WE HAD THE SCHEDULE FOR
 THE CHROME DEV SUMMIT.  IF YOU 
WERE STUCK FOR 24 HOURS ON THE 
SERVICEWORKER --R: [MULTIPLE 
PEOPLE TALKING].  THE FIRST 
THING THAT WE WILL DO ON INSTA
LL, IT LOOKS THE SAME -- I US
UALLY DO A SKIP WAITING IN 
 SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR
 IT TO SHUT DOWN, WE WILL TAKE 
OVER IT IMMEDIATELY WHICH IS 
WHAT WE WILL DO IN  WE WILL TALK
 ABOUT THE LIFE CYCLE.  SO WHEN 
THE SERVICEWORKER IS DOWNLOADED,
 IT GOES THROUGH INSTILLATION 
STEP.  I THINK -- THERE'S A GOOD
 ARTICLE ABOUT THAT.  THERE'S A 
BRAND NEW ARTICLE ON DEVEL
OPERS.GOOGLEDEVELOPERS.GOOGLE. 
ON FUNDAMENT WILL FIND IT AND 
POST IT INTO THE SLACK IN A 
MOMENT.   BASICALLY, IT TALKS 
THROUGH THE LIVE CYCLE.  YOU 
HAVE AN INSTILLATION STEP, WHEN 
THE SERVICEWORKER IS FINISHED I
NSTALLING, IT WILL ACT EVALUATE 
AND ANY CLIENTS ARE 
DISCONNECTED AND AVAILABLE.  
GOING TO CLAIM ON MY CLIENTS.  
SO THE SERVICEWORKER IS ACTIVE 
NOW, BUT IT HAS NOT TAKEN CARE 
OF THE OPEN TABS, IF YOU HAVE
 MULTIPLE ONES.  IF YOU HAVE AN 
EXISTING SERVICEWORKER, YOU ARE 
KICKING OUT THE OLD ONE AND 
SAYING I'M THE NEW ONE, I WILL 
HANDLE IT.  ON-FETCH, THIS IS A 
PATH ROUTE.  I WILL RESPOND WITH
 THE FETCH. 
 SO I'M BASICALLY DOING ANY 
OFFLINE LOGIC THE PAGE DOES, I 
WILL DO THE NETWORK AND PASS 
BACK. 
 SO IF WE RE-LOAD, THE 
SERVICEWORKER IS INSTALLED, THAT
 IS GOOD, AND WE SHOULD SEE 
EVERY REQUEST TWICE, IF THE 
WEBSITE DOES A REQUEST FOR THE 
SC VIEW FILE AND IT DOES THE 
FETCH DOWN HERE AND WE HAVE THE 
SERVICEWORKER IN BETWEEN THE 
WEBSIS WORTH POINTING OUT, THAT 
LITTLE COG, THERE, IS THE THING 
THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.  AND 
ALSO -- U HAVE  FROM 
SERVICEWORKER, THAT IS A GOOD 
THING TO WATCH OUT FOR.  THE 
SERVICEWORKER AND THE 
SERVICEWORKER DID THE  COMMON 
WAY IS TO DOWNLOAD THE FILES 
THAT YOU KNOW THE USER IS GOING 
TO NEED ON INSTALL.  THAT'S WHAT
 YOU ARE GOING TO DO.  SO YOU 
WILL DEFINE AN SS ARRAY, THESE 
ARE THE FILES THAT WE    YOU 
ARE, LIKE, TODAY YOU ARE THE 
KING OF SNIPPETS.  LONG HAS THIS
 TAKEN YOU?  PRACTICEED, I DID 
IT IN 11 MINUTES.  I DID NOT 
REALIZE
 THEY ARE SNIPPETS.  ARE DONE 
WITH SNIPPETS  THERE IS NO 
SEMICOLON ON THE END OF THE 
ASSETS DECLARATION -- IT IS 
AWKWARD, IF THE LINK WAS 
SWITCHED ON, YOU WOULD HAVE A 
REAL ISSUE.  NOW I -- WE ARE 
GOING TO -- THIS IS INTERESTING.
 ARE GOING TO WRITE ASYNC 
FUNCTION, OH, YEAH.   NOW 
EVERYONE KNOWS WILL RUN 
SYNCHRONOUSLY FOR THE QUIZ. YES,
 UNTIL I DO THE CACHE IS OPEN, 
STATIC.  YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN 
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.  ASYNC 
FUNCTION, THINK ABOUT IT AS A 
FUNCTION. IT IS ACTUALLY A
 FUNCTION -- JUST SO WE ARE ON 
THE SAME PAGE.  ARE MARKING IT, 
IT IS AN AMAZING FUNCTION.  
INSIDE ASYNC FUNCTIONS WE CAN 
USE A WAIT AND WE WANT TO DO IT 
BECAUSE IT IS COOL AND THAT 
MEANS THE FUNCTION CAN RETURN 
THE PROMISE.  SO EVERY IN HERE 
WILL BASICALLY BE RE-WRITTEN 
INTO A PROMISE CHAIN, BULLET  
BUT IT IS MORE READABLE NOW.  
HAVE AN ASYNC FUNCTION, OPEN THE
 CACHES --  OPEN THE CACHE AND 
DO IT INSIDE, AND NOW WE CAN 
JUST WAIT FOR IT AND THIS IS THE
 SAME, BUT WE WILL PUT IT INTO A
 VARIABLE.  READS
 LIKE SYNCHRONOUS CODE, I WANT 
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE -- BUT 
UNDER THE HOOD, IT IS DOING 
THIS.  IS ANOTHER WAY THAT WE 
CAN DO CACHE ADD ALL ASSETS, WE 
CAN DOWNLOAD ALL OF THE ASSETS 
IN THE ARRAY, PUT IT IN THE 
CACHE, AND RETURN THE SKIP 
WAITING SO THE PROGRAM 
 PROMISE THE RETURN WAITS IS IN 
SET-UP AND ALL OF THEM ARE GOING
 TO HAPPEN.  WE CAN CHECK THAT 
THIS WORKS BY RELOADING THE 
PAGE, AND NOW THE SERVICEWORKER 
--  GOING TO WRITE A LOT OF 
ASYNC FUNCTIONS, IF WE GET THESE
 TWO AT THE END, THE 
PARENTHESES, SHOUT.  WE WANT TO 
INVOKE THIS FUNCTION RIGHT AWAY.
EWW!   THOUGHT THAT WAS 
INVOLUNTARY.  SERVICEWORKER, AND
 NOW WE DOWNLOADED ALL THE FILES
 AGAIN.  REMINDS ME, WHEN WE DO 
THESE, IT IS NOT PRODUCTION 
CODE.  NOT SAYING YOU ARE 
WRITING BY CODE, A A SENSE IN 
WHICH WE DO THIS STUFF TO KIND 
OF SHOW THE APPROACH THAT YOU 
TAKE, THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY, 
JUST TAKE THIS, COPY AND PASTE 
AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO.  IS 
IMPORTANT.  MENTIONING.  THAT WE
 HAVE THINGS IN OUR CACHE, WE 
KNOW THAT EVERYTHING FROM OUR 
FOLDER IS GOING TO BE IN OUR 
CACHE 100 PERCENT, WE ARE 
DOWNLOADING IT ON  AND THIS IS 
WHAT I WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
 IN OUR
FETCH.   CAN YOU RE-LOAD THE 
PAGE AND SHOW THEM THE CACHE ON 
DEV TOOLS? WE HAVE ALL THE 
ASSETS ON THE  WE HAVE THE 
STORAGE AND ALL THE FILES ARE ON
 HERE, AND THIS IS 
USEFUL TO SEE
 --  MARRIED IT BECAUSE THE 
ASYNC FUNCTIONS ARE IN CANARY, 
THERE ARE BUGS --  FACT THAT IT 
WAS AN OKAY  SO NOW WE ARE IN 
THE ON FETCH.  IF THE REQUEST IS
 FOR SOMETHING IN STATIC, I 
DON'T
 WANT TO B IS WHAT I KEPT FROM 
DOING IS PAUSING THE URL.  

EVENT.REQUEST.URL
 IS THE REQUEST URL AND I WILL 
ATTACH THE MAIN THING TO THE 
EVENT WITH A PARSE URL, A NICE 
URL OBJECT.  I CAN DO NOW IS 
EVENT PARSE URL PATH  DON'T ADD 
THAT TO THE SPEC, YOU ARE GOING 
TO FEEL AWKWARD.  IT STARTS WITH
 STATIC, I WILL GIVE IT SPECIAL 
HANDLING AND RESPOND WITH THE 
CACHE EVENT MANAGEMENT REQUEST. 
 LOOKING FOR THE CACHE EVENT 
MANAGEMENT YOU WILL RESPOND 
WITH.  WE ARE INSTALLING THE 
ASSETS, WHEN YOU GET A 23E67 
FETCH FROM THE PAGE, I WANT 
WHATEVER URL, IF IT STARTS WITH 
LESS STATIC, WE WILL FIND IT -- 
ER:ORD  OTHERWISE WE WILL FETCH 
IT FOR NOW.  AND ALL THE 
SERVICEWORKER REQUESTS SHOULD 
DISAPPEAR.  I WILL RE-LOAD ONCE,
 WHICH WILL TRIGGER A RE-INSTALL
 OF THE SERVICEWORKER.  AND ALL 
OF THE SERVICEWORKER EEQUESTS  
BOTTOM REQUEST THERE IS THE 
SERVICEWORKER TRYING TO DO AN 
UPDATE FOR A NEW
 VERSION -- 
 IT IS T FOR SOMETHING WE DON'T 
HAVE AN ACCOUNT, OR AN INDEX OF,
 IT GOES WITH THE NETWORK AND 
JUST GIVES IT BACK TO THE 
BROWSER AND THEN IT DISAPPEARS, 
WOO  WE DO NOT SAVE IT ANYWHERE.
  THIS IS THE IDEA, WE HAVE, HOW
 MANY IS IT, THE 5 ASSET, IF I 
REQUEST SOMETHING NOT IN THERE, 
WE FETCH IT, AND THEN IF WE ARE 
OFFLINE, WE DON'T HAVE IT FOR 
NEXT TIME.  THEN WE'RE GOING TO 
CHANGE.  I LIKE TO WRITE 
FUNCTIONS FOR THE DIFFERENT 
CACHING STRATEGIES.  SO I'M 
GOING TO DO AT STALE WHILE WE 
REVALIDATE.   WE GO.   WHAT THIS
 MEANS IS -- IF WE HAVE 
SOMETHING IN THE CACHE, RETURN 
IT RIGHT AWAY, EVEN IF IT IS 
STALE.  AND IN THE BACKGROUND, 
FETCH IT FROM THE SERVER AND UP 
AT THE CACHE.  WE SEE THIS ON 
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES WHERE 
THEY KIND OF GO, HERE'S ALL THE 
POSTS THAT I'VE GOT STORED, 
ENJOY THOSE, MEANWHILE, I WILL G
O OFF AND GET THE LATEST SET OF 
POSTS.  WHEN I HAVE THOSE, BAM, 
I WILL UPDATE MY COLLECTION FOR 
 NICE THING ABOUT THE STRATEGY, 
YOU ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO DO B
OTH.  YOU ARE GOING TO DO FETCH 
AND CHECK THE CACHE, YOU NEED 
BOTH IN EITHER CASE.   WE'RE 
GOING TO --  IS ASKING ON THE 
CHAT, DO YOU KNOW IN THE CHAT, 
IS THE CHROMIUM DEV SLACK.COM, 
WE ARE IN THE GENERAL CHANNEL.  
SOMEONE IS ASKING IF THE CODE 
WILL GO INTO GITHUB, IT WILL.  I
 WILL LINK IT IN THE CHAT, WE 
HAVE A UI ELEMENTS SAMPLE REPO 
WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS WE BUILT, 
ALL THE STUFF THAT WE BUILT, ALL
 THE SUPER CHARGED STUFF SO FAR 
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK THROUGH. 
WILL BE THERE AND I WILL ADD 
AFTERWARDS SOME C5U79COMMENTS.  
I WILL NOT DO IT NOW. WE HAVE TO
 FIGURE OUT WHAT TO RESPOND 
WITH.  THIS IS WHAT I WILL GIVE 
TO YOU, TRY TO GET THE RESPONSE 
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND NOTHING 
ELSE.  CAN WAIT UNTIL -- 
RESPONSE SHOULD BE FASTER HAVE 
TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN RESPOND WITH AND --  
HAVE EVENT, RESPOND WITH, AND 
WAIT UNTIL.  SO RESPOND WITH 
EXPECTS THE PROMISE THAT RESULT 
OF THE THING THAT IS GOING TO BE
 GIVEN TO THE BROWSER AS THE 
RESPONSE OF THE REQUEST.  ARE 
GOING TO RESPOND WITH THE FETCH 
WHICH WILL RETURN A PROMISE AND 
THE CONTENT OF THE THE THING 
THAT IS FETC RESPONSE  AND WAIT 
UNTIL KEEPS THE SERVICEWORKER A
LIVE IF YOU WANT TO DO FURTHER 
WORK, OPENING AND PUTTING STUFF 
INTO THE CACHE.  OTHER WISE THE 
SERVICEWORKER WILL BE KILLED 
BEFORE YOU SAVE IT.  IS AN 
IMPORTANT PART OF SERVICEWORKER 
WORK, THERE IS NO PROMISE GIVEN 
OUR NOTION, SORRY, I SAID 
PROMISE, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE 
THAT THE SERVICEWORKER WON'T BE 
SPUN DOWN.  SO ONCE, SAY FOR 
EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE LOADED THE 
PAGE. 
 IS OPEN, IT CAN BE SPUN  SO THE
 BROWSER WILL SAY, I NO LONGER 
NEED THE SERVICEWORKER, GET RID 
OF IT.  THIS IS CANCELED BECAUSE
 DEV TOOLS IT CACHEED.  GOING TO
 SHUT DOWN THE SERVICEWORKER, 
BUT BECAUSE DEV TOOLS IS 
ATTACHED, WE NEED TO INSPECT 
WHAT HAPPENED --  YOU NEED TO 
LOG AN OBJECT FROM THE 
SERVICEWORKER, IT IS GOING TO BE
 KILLED BECAUSE THE CONTEXT IS 
GONE.  THERE'S A SERVICE FROM 
THE CHROME PEOPLE TO US.  THIS 
IS A WAY OF SAYING, DON'T SHUT 
DOWN THE SERVICEWORKER YET, I 
HAVE SOME STUFF TO DO, WHICH IS 
PUTTING THINGS INTO A CACHE.   
RESPONSE WITH, NO.   WITH -- WE 
WILL JUST WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE 
RESPONSE IS. 
 RESPONSE, IN THIS CASE, IS 
GOING TO BE A 
PROMISE.ERASE. 
 THIS IS A FUNCTION THAT TAKES 
AN ARRAY OF PROMISES AND GIVES 
BACK WHATEVER PROMISES SETTLES 
FIRST.   YOU HAVE TO FETCH, YOU 
LOOK IN THE CACHE, AND THEN YOU 
WILL SAY, DON'T CARE, PICK ONE. 
  OF THE TIME, I WOULD EXPECT 
THAT TO BE THE CACHEED VERSION 
SPEAKER: YES, HOWEVER, IF WE ARE
 OFFLINE, FETCH REJECTS AND 
PROMISE.ERASE DOES NOT CARE IF 
IT IS REJECT OR A FULFILL, WE 
WILL RETURN WHATEVER SETTLES 
FIRST.  SO IF WE ARE OFFLINE, 
FETCH IS IMMEDIATELY GOING TO 
THROW.  I'M OFF-LINK AND CAN DO 
ANYTHING AND THE PROMISE WITH 
ERASE, HERE IS THE 
REJECTED PROMISE, HAVE FUN.  SO 
I WILL PUT A SNEAKY CATCH TO THE
 FETCHED VERSION AND SAY IF YOU 
ARE GOING OO  TO REJECT, TURN IT
 INTO THE CACHED VERSION,
 THAT IS VERY CHEEKY NOW WE HAVE
 TO THINK ABOUT THIS.  IF THE 
FETCH REJECTS, WE WILL GET THE 
RESULT OF THE CACHEED VERSION, 
WHICH CAN BE A RESPONSE, BUT IT 
CAN ALSO BE UNDEFINED WHICH IS 
WHAT CACHE'S METRIC RETURNS IF 
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THE 
CACHE.  WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, IF
 THE RESPONSE IS NOT VALID, SO 
IT IS UNDEFINED, I'M GOING TO 
RETURN THE FETCHED VERSION.   
THIS COVERS ALL THE POSSIBLE 
OUTCOMES, BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE 
TO THINK ABOUT, THERE'S A WAY, 
IF WE ARE ONLINE, THE CACHE 
COULD RESULT FIRST BUT COULD BE 
UNDEFINED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE 
ANYTHING IN THE CACHE AND WE 
WANT TO WAIT FOR THE NETWO NEED 
TO WAIT FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE 
NEAT AND TIDY, FETCHED AND 
CACHE.  IF THE FETCHED VERSION 
DEFINED ITSELF OFFLINE AND GOES 
TO THE CACHEED VERSION AND THE 
CACHEED VERSION GOES TO THE 
FETCHED VERSI WE HAVE A POP WIZ 
 QUIZ?  MIGHT HAVE A QUIZ CAN 
REJECT -- WHEN YOU ARE OFFLINE, 
IT IS GOING TO REJECT.  SO IT 
WILL RESPOND WITH FIRST, I'VE 
GOT NOTHING.  
 IS -- 
(CAPTIONER
 TAKING BREAK)
BREAK).  WILL NOTICE THAT SAM IS
 HERE, WE NORMALLY INTRODUCE THE
 SPEAKER AND WALK AWAY, BUT WE 
THOUGHT WE WOULD HANG AROUND 
UNTIL SOMETHING GOES ON THE 
SCREEN AND THEN WE WILL 
INTRODUCE SAM.  SO YOU LOGGED ON
 THAT LAPTOP, YOU KNOW PAUL 
IRISH'S PASSWORD.  YOU ARE GOOD 
BUDDIES.  I WOULD NOT SHARE
 ARE YOU FEELING CONFIDENT?  
THIS TIME THINGS ARE ON THE 
SCREEN IN FRONT OF ME, THAT'S A 
PRETTY GOOD START.  YOU ARE 
READY? YOU ARE GOING TO BE
 OKAY.
KER: WELCOME ON THE 
STAGE, SAM
 SAKOVI, EVERYONE!   I WANT TO 
TALK ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO 
BUILD A SUPER FAST WEB EXPERIENC
E, AND TO DO THAT IT WILL 
REQUIRE YOU TO PLAN FOR YOUR 
PERFORMANCE.  HERE IS MY PITCH, 
YOU HAVE BEEN IN THAT MEETING 
ROOM WHEN THE MANAGER OR BOSS 
ASKED YOU, DOES THIS SITE WORK 
ON MOBILE? YOU THINK, WELL, SURE
 IT WORKED ON A SMALL SCREEN 
SIZE ON MY DESKTOP AND I WROTE 
SOME CSS SO THE THINGS SCALE, SO
 THIS WORKS ON
 MOBILE.   THAT MENTALITY HAS A 
FLAW, AND THE FLAW IS THAT THE 
MOBILE WEB IS NO LONGER THIS 
SUB-SET OF THE WEB YOU THINK OF 
THE END OF YOUR DEVELOPMENT, IT 
IS SIMPLY THE WEB AND YOU SEE 
THIS THROUGH THE NUMBERS.   
TRAFFIC HAS OUTPACED DESKTOP 
TRAFFIC SINCE 2014 AND IT WILL 
CONTINUE TO GROW.  SO WHETHER 
YOU LIKE IT, THE VISITORS THAT 
ARE VISITING YOUR APP, THEY ARE 
NOT ON A
 DESKTOP COMPUTER.  BUT YOU AS A
 DEVELOPER, YOU ARE LIKE, THAT'S
 FINE, SAM, BECAUSE I HAVE A 
MOBILE PHONE IN MY POCKET, YEAH,
 JUST RIGHT HERE.  I'M GOING TO 
TEST MY WEBSITE ON THIS, AND 
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT, AND I 
WILL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED 
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING YOU TOLD 
ME TO DO.  BUT THAT IS NOT 
COMPLETELY COMPLETE, THAT IS NOT
 THE RIGHT APPROACH.  THAT PHONE
 THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR POCKET IS
 A $600 PHONE, IT IS THE BRAND 
NEW PHONE, YOU'RE A DEVELOPER 
AND WANT THE BEST THING, SO YOU 
HAVE THE BEST THING.  BUT THE 
PHONE THAT YOUR USERS HAVE? THEY
 LOOK LIKE THIS, AS ALEX TOUCHED
 ON, THESE ARE THE LOW-END 
PHONES THAT YOU GET FOR FREE 
WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR A CELL 
PLAN, THEY HAVE A GIGABYTE OF 
RAM AND A SINGLE CORE.  WE SEE 
THE NUMBERS THAT BACK THESE UP. 
 THE AVERAGE ANDROID DEVICE, 
THEY HAVE ON AVERAGE A GIGABYTE 
OR LESS OF RAM.  SO
 NOT GREAT.  AND THIS HAS 
PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS.   LOAD
 TIME IS 19 SECONDS, SO FROM 
GOING ON THE URL TO THE BROWSER 
TO LOADING ON THE PHONE AND 
BEING INTERACTIVE, THAT IS 19 
SECONDS THAT YOUR USERS HAVE TO 
WAIT.  NOW, YOU HAVE SEEN THIS 
GRAPHIC BEFORE, I'M SURE.  BUT 
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK 
ABOUT.  , THE WEB THAT WE ARE 
SHIPPING TODAY HAS A 19-SECOND 
AVERAGE LOAD TIME AND THE USERS 
EXPECT, WHEN YOU JUST ASK THEM 
CASUALLY, THEY EXPECT A PAGE TO 
LOAD IN TWO SECONDS.  AND MOST 
USERS, IF THAT SITE TAKES LONGER
 THAN THREE SECONDS, THEY WILL 
LOAD THE PAGE.  SO THE WEB APP 
YOU ARE DELIVERING RIGHT NOW, IF
 IT TAKES LONGER THAN THREE 
SECONDS, YOU ARE THROWING AWAY 
HALF YOUR TRAFFIC.  WE HAVE 
19-SECOND LOAD TIMES, WE ARE 
SHIPPING EXPERIENCES THAT DON'T 
MATCH WHAT USERS WANT.   HOW DO 
WE ALIGN THE WEB THAT WE'RE 
BUILDING TODAY WITH WHAT USERS 
WANT?  THAT, I THINK IT IS 
IMPORTANT WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT
 IT TAKES TO LOAD A WEB PAGE, 
FROM WHEN YOU ISSUE THE REQUEST 
TO WHEN THAT PAGE LOADS IN THE 
BROWSER AND YOU INTERACT WITH 
IT, WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN WHEN 
YOU HIT GO AND IT SHOWS UP? I 
HAVE TAKEN THE NETWORK STACK AND
 EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN 
BETWEEN AND SIMPLIFIED IT DOWN, 
IT IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT IN 
THREE PHASES.  AND THE FIRST 
PHASE IS, REQUESTING THE PAGE.  
AND THE SERVER GETTING THAT PAGE
 AND THEN SHIPPING BACK AN HTML 
DOCUMENT TO YOU.  AS I 
ILLUSTRATED FOR YOU ALL, THIS IS
 WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.  YOU GO TO 
THE WEBSITE ON THE PHONE, IT 
HITS THE SERVER AND THE SERVER 
GENERATES A DOCUMENT AND IT HAS 
TO DO PROCESSING WORK TO FIGURE 
OUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEND TO
 YOU AND IT SHIPS THE DOCUMENT 
BACK TO THE BROWSER AND THAT 
REQUEST HAS TO GO ACROSS 
CELLULAR TOWERS AND FIND IT'S 
WAY FROM THE INTERNET TO THE 
COMPUTER THAT IS R IT HAS A TRIP
 BACK.  AND THAT ROUND-TRIP COST
 ON MOBILE PHONES, THAT IS REAL.
  HAVE THE DOCUMENT, THE SERVER 
RESPONDED.  SO THE BROWSER HAS 
TO DO SOME WORK NOW, WE HAVE TO 
PARSE THE HTML AND FIGURE OUT 
WHAT IS REQUIRED ON THIS PAGE 
FOR US TO SHOW IT.  WE HAVE TO 
FIND THESE CRITICAL ASSETS, AND 
ONCE WE HAVE DONE THAT, THE 
BROWSER SAYS, I NEED THIS 
JAVASCRIPT FILE, THIS STYLE 
SHEET AND THESE TWO IMAGES AND 
WHEN I HAVE THAT I WILL DRAW 
SOMETHING YOU CARE ABOUT.  BUT 
WE ISSUE REQUESTS FOR THOSE AND 
THEY GO OVER THE WIRE, THROUGH 
THE CELLULAR TOWERS, ON TO THE 
SERVER AND THE SERVER FIGURES 
OUT WHAT WE ARE SENDING TO YOU, 
THE SERVER RESPONDS BACK AND 
THIS TAKES SOME TIME.  OUR HI-PR
IORITYHI-PRIORITY RESOURCES, 
MADE THE CONNECTION TO GET THE 
DOCUMENT, AND NOW IN MY FAVORITE
 PHASE, THE PARSE AND EXECUTE 
PHASE.  WE HAVE THE ASSETS THE 
BROWSER IS NOT SHOWING YOU YET 
BECAUSE IT HAS TO COM  COMPUTE 
WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES LOOK 
LIKE WHEN THEY ARE COMBINED 
TOGETHER. SO WE HAVE THE HTML, 
THE JAVASCRIPT, THE CSS THE 
JAVASCRIPT COMPILES SO IT CAN BE
 EVALUATED BY V 8, ADDS SOME DOM
 TO THE PAGE, THE JAVASCRIPT 
RENDERS, TAKES THE STYLES, 
CALCULATES THE POSITIONS OF THE 
ELEMENTS, LAYS IT OUT AND 
DEPOSITS LAYERS AND THEN YOU END
 UP WITH A BEAUTIFUL PAGE. THIS 
IS JUST THE LOADING PHASE, THIS 
ISN'T INTERACTIVE YET.  THIS IS 
JUST GETTING SOMETHING ON THE 
SCREEN.   RIGHT.  GIVEN ALL 
THAT, I THINK THAT IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT
 THIS NETWORK PHASE, IF WE'RE 
GOING TO OPTIMIZE ONE LAYER, TO 
START, THE NETWORK SEEMS LIKE A 
GOOD OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE'RE 
ISSUING A REQUEST TO THE SERVER,
 THE SERVER HAS TO RESPOND AND 
WE ISSUE MORE REQUESTS AND 
THERE'S A REAL COST HERE. SO 
WHAT I DID, I TOOK THE POLYMER 
SHOP SITE LIKE YOU HAVE SEEN 
TODAY, AND I PUT IT DOWN LOCALLY
 AND MADE CHANGES TO IT.  
STARTED OUT WITH A PRETTY SIMPLE
 BASELINE, I DIDN'T BUNDLE THE 
ASSETS, I HAD INDIVIDUAL ASSETS 
FOR EVERYTHING, NOT ONE BIG 
BLOB, I SET UP AN HTTP2 SERVER 
AND I SIMULATED A 3G NETWORK, 
AND BY SIMULATE, I HAD A 3G 
NETWORK I TESTED THIS ON, SO WE 
HAVE REAL-WORLD ME WILL TAKE A 
LOOK IN DEVTOOLS AND GET A FEEL 
FOR WHAT THIS IS
 LIKE.  
 HERE IS THE SHOP ON THE LEFT 
AND THE RECORDING THAT WE DID B
EFORE, AND SAVE THIS OFF.  SO 
YOU WILL NOTICE THAT I HAVE THIS
 PANE UP HERE, YOU MIGHT NOT BE 
FAMILIAR WITH THIS, AND THIS IS 
THE NETWORK VIEW.  AND THE 
NETWORK VIEW IS HIDDEN AWAY 
UNTIL YOU CHECK THIS BOX AND 
THEN YOU SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL 
WATERFALL OF ALL THE THINGS THAT
 ARE GETTING DOWNLOADED AND YOU 
MIGHT BE SAYING, WHAT IS THIS 
GRAY LINE? I HAVE NEVER SEEN 
THIS BEFORE OF COURSE, YOU HAVE 
NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE, THE PATCH 
LINE DID IT YESTERDAY AND I HAVE
 IT RIGHT HERE SO WHAT THIS 
MEANS, THIS GRAY PART, WE ARE 
WAITING FOR CONTENT, WE HAVE NOT
 GOTTEN ANYTHING, THE REQUESTS 
WENT OUT AND WE HAVE NOT TAKEN 
ANY ACTION YET.  YOU CAN SEE 
THAT IN THIS CASE, IT TAKES 1500
 MILISECONDS UNTIL UNTIL WE GET 
A RESPONSE FROM THE SERVER AND 
WE ARE DOWNLOADING THE CONTENT 
AND WE ARE REQUESTING FROM THE 
OTHER FILE, THE SHOP APP, THIS 
IS THE APP WRAPPER AND HAS A 
BUNCH OF DEPENDENCIES THAT WE 
ALL NEED TO DOWNLOAD AND HAVE A 
BUNCH OF DEPENDENCIES THAT WE 
ALL NEED TO DOWNLOAD AND THEN WE
 HAVE A BUNCH OF -- YEAH.   SO, 
ALL OF THIS RESULTS IN A PAINT 
THAT TAKES AROUND 5500 
MILISECONDS.   SO 5 SECONDS, 5.5
 SECONDS FOR THIS, ON -- ON A 3G
 NETWORK, IT IS NOT TERRIBLE, IT
 IS NOWHERE NEAR THE 19-SECOND 
AVERAGE.  SO WE E ARE STARTING 
OFF FROM SOMETHING THAT IS NOT 
HORRIBLE.  AS A DEVELOPER, WE 
CAN SEE THAT CLEARLY THERE'S 
SOME ROOM HERE FOR IMPROVEMENT. 
 I'M JUST HOLDING DOWN SHIFT 
HERE IN THE TIMELINE, AS I DRAG 
I CAN MEASURE HOW LONG.  SO 5500
 MILISECONDS ROUGHLY BETWEEN THE
 FIRST BY THEN THE SERVER AND 
RENDERED SOMETHING ON THE 
SCREEN.  AND SHOP, WE HAVE 
SOMETHING UP HERE, BUT IT IS NOT
 USEFUL TO THE USER UNTIL WE 
HAVE CONTENT, THIS IS THE FIRST 
MEANINGFUL FRAME, THE FIRST 
PAINT, WE GET THE RESOURCES AND 
THE BROWSER EXECUTES JAVASCRIPT 
HERE AND WE DECIDE TO 
 NO BUNDLING, 3G, 5500 
MILISECONDS UNTIL FIRST PAINT.  
 WILL LOOK AT TECHNIQUES THAT WE
 CAN APPLY HERE TO DRIVE THAT 
NUMBER DOWN.   I DON'T KNOW IF 
YOU HAVE HEARD OF THIS REALLY 
COOL FEATURE IN CHROME, LINK REL
 PRELOAD ALLOWS YOU, AS A DE
VELOP DEVELOPER, TO SAY I KNOW 
THE THINGS THAT MY PAGES ARE 
GOING TO NEED BEFORE IT IS 
DISPLAYED AND LOADED AND IT WILL
 TELL THE BROWSER WHAT THOSE 
ARE.  AND THE BROWSER WILL SEE 
THIS AND SAY, I WILL DOWNLOAD 
THESE, AND AS A DEVELOPER, SOME
THING IS GOING TO REQUEST THESE,
 SO START.  SO THE BROWSER WILL 
DOWNLOAD THESE, SIT THERE, AND W
HEN THE BROWSER ISSUES A REQUEST
 FOR THEM, IT WILL SAY, I HAVE 
THIS.  SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIT 
THE SERVER AGAIN SO I TOOK THE 
SITE, WORKING OFF OF THE BASE 
WITH NO BUNDLEG GOING ON AND I 
LOOKED AT ALL OF 
THE ASSETS BEFORE WE DID THE 
PAINT AND LINK LOAD, PRELOAD, 
AND WHAT THE EFFECTIVE OF THIS 
IS ALL RIGHT.   SO THIS LOOKS 
QUITE DIFFERENT.  S NOW VERY 
FLAT, WE NO LONGER HAVE THIS 
STEPPING EFFECT OF DEPENDENT 
RESOURCES ON DEPENDENT RESOURCES
 THAT EVENTUALLY REVOLVE INTO A 
PAINTED PAGE, INSTEAD WE JUST 
HAVE A FLAT LINE OF THINGS, IT'S
 LIKE, HEY, NETWORK, JUST GRAB 
ALL THESE, THANK YOU.   THEN 
WHEN WE HAVE THEM, WE END UP 
WITH THE PAINT.  SO FROM THE 
FIRST BYTE HERE, TO THE FIRST 
CONTENT FILL FRAME, WE ARE DOWN 
TO 3300 MILISECONDS, SO WE CUT 
OUT TWO SECONDS BY AVOIDING THE 
NETWORK WORK OF HAVING DISCOVER,
 DOWNLOAD, DISCOVER, DOWD  
DOWNLOAD AND FLATTENFLATTENING 
THAT OUT AND WHY WOULD I HAVE A 
SITE THAT IS 
DAISY-CHAINED LIKE THAT WITH 
THESE CONTRIVED RESOURCES?  BUT 
ON YOUR SITE YOU ARE DOWNLOADING
 FONTS AND JAVASCRIPT.  IF YOU 
ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BUILD T
OOLS, YOU PROBABLY HAVE LAZLY
-LOADED JAVASCRIPT FILES, AND 
THOSE ARE LATE DISCOVERY 
DOCUMENTS.  YOU CAN USE LINK 
LOAD PRELOAD TO SAY, START 
DOWNLOADING THESE BECAUSE I NEED
 THEM AND THEY CAN BE A REAL, 
MASSIVE WIN ALL RIGHT.  WE ARE 
DOWN TO 3.3 SECONDS ON A MOBILE 
NETWORK, WHICH IS GOOD.   ARE 
GETTING CLOSER TO THAT 2-SECOND 
TIME THAT PEOPLE WANT, BUT WE 
AREN'T QUITE THERE.   WE STILL, 
WE HAVE THAT COST, THAT IS KIND 
OF CRAZY.  WE HAVE THE INITIAL 
CONNECTION COST, WHICH IS 5 S
ECTIONS, WHICH IS INSANE.   THEN
 ONCE WE FINALLY GET A BYTE, WE 
ARE SPENDING 1.6 SECONDS 
DOWNLOADING THIS DOCUMENT AND WE
 ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF 
THIS NETWORK AT THIS TIME, 
PLEASE GIVE ME THE HTML 
DOCUMENT, THANK YOU, I'M 
RECEIVING.   IT.  IT IS A WASTED
 OPPORTUNITY, IT WOULD BE NICE 
TO JAM REQUESTS IN HERE AS WELL.
   OUT, THERE'S A SOLUTION FOR 
THIS, CALLED H 2 SERVER PUSH.  
HOW DOES THIS WORK? WHAT IS 
THIS?  WELL, IT IS THE BASIC 
IDEA THAT YOUR PAGE, WHEN 
REQUESTED FROM YOUR BROWSER, IT 
HITS THE SERVER, IT OPENS THIS 
CONNECTION, THE SERVER, WHILE IT
 IS RESPONDING WITH HTML, SAYS I
 KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO NEED 
THESE ASSETS, I WILL PUSH THEM 
TO YOU, YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR THEM,
 THE BROWSER HAS NO IDEA THEY 
ARE COMING BUT A  AS THE SERVER,
 I KNOW THE WORLD.  TAKE THEM. 
AND WHEN YOU NEED THEM ON THE 
CLIENT SIDE, THEY ARE ALREADY 
THERE.   COMPARED TO THE 
PREVIOUS APPROACH THAT WE ARE 
DOING, WHICH WAS TWO ROUND 
TRIPS, WHICH WAS GET THE 
DOCUMENT, SCAN THE DOCUMENT, 
REQUEST ALL OF THE CRITICAL 
ASSETS AND THEN WE CAN PAINT.  
HIS CASE, THE SERVER IS PUSHING 
THE ASSETS TO US, CHANGING WHO 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT.   NOW, 
YOU ARE PROBABLY LIKE, I READ A 
BLOG POST ABOUT H 2 PUSH, AND 
THAT BLOG POST TOLD ME LOTS OF T
HINGS THAT WERE NOT SO GREAT 
ABOUT H 2 PUSH.  AND I PROBABLY 
READ THAT SAME BLOG  LET'S TALK 
ABOUT THEM, BECAUSE THAT IS 
IMPORTANT, TOO.  2 SERVER PUSH, 
IT IS NOT CACHE AWARE.  WHAT 
DOES THIS MMEANS THAT THE SERVER
 DOESN'T HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT THE 
STATE OF YOUR CLIENT.  IF YOU 
VISITED THE PAGE BEFORE AND YOU 
HAVE THESE ASSETS CACHEED, THE 
SERVER WILL SAY I WILL PUSH 
MAIN.JS AGAIN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
 KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT AND THE 
CLIENT CANNOT CANCEL IT AND 
CAUSES NETWORK CONDENTION AND A 
REAL COST TO YOUR USERS, BECAUSE
 YOU CAN PUSH EVERYTHING YOU 
WANT AND THE BROWSER IS JUST 
GOING TO TAKE IT.  SO NOT GREAT.
AN ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN YOUR PAGE 
QUITE A BIT AND THE SECOND IS 
THAT H 2 PUSH DOES NOT HAVE 
RESOURCE PRIORITIZATION.  WHAT 
DOES THIS MEAN? THE BROWSER 
NATIVELY IS SMART ABOUT WHICH 
THINGS REQUEST, , THIS IS 
CRITICAL, THIS IS NOT, IT 
OPTIMIZES FOR NETWORK ACTIVITY. 
 H 2 SERVER PUSH, IT IS LIKE A 
BULLY, TAKE ALL OF THIS.  AND 
THE BROWSER IS LIKE, I WILL TAKE
 THIS.  IT IS NOT SO G THERE'S A
 SOLUTION FOR THIS, WHICH IS 
KIND OF THE FIRST P IN PURPLE: 
IT ALL REVOLVES AROUND THIS ONE 
IDEA.  IT IS THAT H 2 SERVER 
PUSH, PLUS A 
SERVICEWORKERSERVICEWORKER IS 
LIKE THIS NIRNIRVANA, A MAGICAL 
THING, IT AVOIDS THE DOWN FALL 
OF H 2 SERVER PUSH.  SO LET'S 
UNDERSTAND THIS ON THE FIRST 
LOAD, THE BROWSER REQUESTS TO 
THE SERVER, THE SERVER PUSHES 
THE CRITICAL ASSETS AND DELIVERS
 THE DOCUMENT, THE DOCUMENT IS 
SCANNED BY THE BROWSER AND THE 
BROWSER SAYS, I HAVE THE FILES, 
MAKE THE REQUESTS, YOU PUSHED 
THEM TO ME, I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
 THE NETWORK, GREAT.  AND NOW ON
 THE NEXT LOAD, YOU HAVE INSTA
LLED THE SERVICEWORKER AS 
REPRESENTED BY THIS BEAUTIFUL, 
GREEN SQUARE WITH THE LETTERS S
W.   PAGE YOU GO TO, YOU GO TO 
THE PAGE, BUT IT DOESN'T EVEN 
HIT THE SERVER.  IT HITS THE 
SERVICEWORKER, THE SERVICEWORKER
 INTERCEPTS THIS REQUEST AND IT 
SAYS, HEY I HAVE INDEX AT HTML, 
HERE YOU ARE, AND YOU WANT THE 
ASSETS, TOO? I HAVE THEM CACHEED
 AS WELL AND YOU ARE NOT OPENING
 A CONNECTION TO THE SERVER.  
YOU HAVE NOT OPENED A CONNECTION
 TO THE SERVER, THE SERVER CANNO
T PUSH YOU THINGS THAT YOU DON'T
 NEED.  SO BY COMBINING H 2 
SERVER PUSH PLUS SERVICEWORKER, 
YOU CAN GET ALL OF THE BENEFITS 
OF THAT FIRST LOAD WITH H 2 
SERVER PUSH AND AVOID THE 
MAJORITY OF THE DOWN FALLS OF 
GETTING PUSHED ASSETS THAT YOU 
ALREADY HAVE CACHEED.   REALLY 
GOOD.   LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT 
WHAT SHOP LOOKED LIKE IF WE 
ACTUALLY USED H 2 PUSH.  AND 
THIS IS THE DEFAULT THING THAT 
THE SHOP SITE ACTUALLY USES, 
WHICH IS REALLY AWESOME.   HERE 
WE ARE, WE HAVE THE SITE.  THIS 
TIMELINE LOOKS REALLY DIFFERENT,
 LIKE, REALLY -- REALLY DIFFEREN
T.   IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE STILL 
PAYING THAT REALLY HIGH COST 
HERE TO GET THE INITIAL PAGE, WE
 ARE SPENDING 800 MILISECONDS OR
 MORE INSIDE OF THAT INITIAL 
REQUEST AND THEN WE SEE THE VERY
 INTERESTING SORT OF 
REPRESENTATION OF WHAT'S GOING 
ON.  AND WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS 
THE FILES BEING PUSHED TO YOU 
FROM THE SERVER.   NOW, THESE, 
IN REALITY, ARE PROBABLY BEING 
PUSHED OUT HERE, BUT RIGHT NOW 
IT IS SHOWING RIGHT HERE, WHICH 
IS FINE.  SO WE LOOK, WE SEE, WE
 HAVE ALL THE ASSETS WHICH ARE S
TICKING AROUND, MARKED AS LOWEST
 PRIORITY, ALL RIGHT. AND THEN 
WE SCROLL DOWN, THIS IS THE 
WRAPPER, THE ROUTE ELEMENT, THE 
SHOP APP HTML, THE MOMENT THIS
 IS FINISHED RIGHT HERE BEING 
DOWNLOADED, WE FIRE OFF ALL OF 
THESE REQUESTS AND YOU WILL 
NOTICE THE REQUESTS ARE REALLY 
FAST, 63 MILISECONDS, 78 
MILISECONDS, 72 MILISECONDS.  
ARE WE DOING THAT?  IT JUST SO 
HAPPENS THAT THESE ARE THOSE 
ASSETS RIGHT HERE.  WHEN WE 
REQUEST THEM, THE NETWORK SAYS, 
DO I HAVE THIS? GO INTO THE 
NETWORK STACK OF CHROME.  
NETWORK STACK OF CHROME SAYS, 
YES YOU DO, THEY ARE IN MY CACH
E, PLEASE TAKE THEM.  AND THAT 
ENDS UP FOR MAKING FOR A SUPER, 
SUPER FAST E WE CAN SEE FROM 
FIRST BYTE HERE TO WHEN THE PAGE
 RENDERS, WE ARE UNDER 2 
SECTIONS, SO WE ARE FROM 5.5
  5 SECONDS TO 1.3 ON A 3G CONNE
CTION WITH NO SERVICEWORKER 
INSTALLED. THAT IS IMPRESSIVE 
WHAT DID WE LEARN?  LOAD 
PRELOAD, WHAT IS THAT GOOD FOR? 
GOOD FOR MOVING THE START OF 
DOWNLOADS EARLIER DURING THE 
PAGE PARSE, SO IT CAN INSTANSH
INSTANTIATE THE REQUESTS BEFORE 
IT NEEDS IT AS A DEPENDENCY AND 
H 2 PUSH, IT CUTS OUT ONE TRIP 
TO THE SERVER.  SO YOU WILL 
SAVE, AT MAX, ONE FULL ROUND 
TRIP.  AND THAT IS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE MEASURING 
YOUR SITE AND FIGURING OUT WHERE
 TO OPTIMIZE, YOU WANT TO 
OPTIMIZE THE BIGGEST COST.  SO 
IF YOUR LATENCY THAT EXISTS FOR 
A ROUND TRIP IS YOUR BIGGEST 
COST, CONGRATULATIONS, BECAUSE 
YOU ARE IN A MINORITY BECAUSE 
THAT IS AMAZING AND H 2 PUSH IS 
PROBABLY YOUR SOLUTION WE HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT THE NETWORK, COOL, 
WE KNOW HOW TO GET OUR ASSETS TO
 OUR BROWSER QUICKQUICKLY AND 
HOW TO GET THE FIRST PAINT, 
FIRST MEANINGFUL PAINT QUICK.  
AND THAT IN THE FIRST FRAME IS 
ONLY PART OF THE STORY, THE REAL
 INTERESTING BIT, IN MY OPINION 
IS GETTING TO INTERACTIVE AND 
THE COSTS FROM MODERN WEBSITES 
TO INTERACTIVE, IT IS OUR FRIEND
, JAVASCRIPT, JUST SITTING 
THERE.  YOU NEED TO EXECUTE AND 
PARSE ME AND ON PHONES, THAT IS 
SLOW.  TO UNDERSTAND HOW SLOW 
THIS IS, WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT
 JAVASCRIPT DELIVERIES S HAVE 
BEEN LIKE IN 2010, WE WERE 
SHIPPING 110 GIGABYTES OF 
JAVASCRIPT.  TODAY, WE ARE 
SHIPPING 4 TIMES OF THAT, 4060 
KILOBYTES OF JAVASCRIPT ON EVERY
 PAGELOAD THERE'S A COST THERE, 
A COST TO SHIPPING THIS PARSED 
CODE.  IF WE LOOK AT SOME OLDER 
DEVICES, AN iPhone 4, NEXUS 1, 
THE PARSE TIME FOR 300 KILOBYTES
 OF JAVASCRIPT IS FROM 300 TO 
500 MILISECONDS, HALF A SECOND. 
  THE USERS WANT THAT PAGE TO 
LOAD IN TWO SECONDS.   YOU ARE 
LOOKING THIS AND SAYING, SAM, 
THESE ARE ANCIENT PHONES, A 
TERRIBLE GRAPH, NOT APPLICABLE 
TO ME.  THE PHONES YOU  YOUR 
USERS ARE ON ARE THE OLDER DEVIC
ES, SIMILAR TO THE PHONES LISTED
 HERE, BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR 
CONCERNS.  I HAVE A CHART FOR 
NEW PHONES!  800 MEGABYTES OF 
JAVASCRIPT, ON A NEXUS 5, I LIKE
 THAT PHONE. 6, WITH THE LATEST 
OPERATEING SYSTEM, WE ARE AT A 
SECOND OF PARSE TIME.   THERE'S 
A COST HERE, USERS WANT IT IN 
TWO SECONDS, YOU ARE SHIPPING A 
MEGABYTE OF JAVASCRIPT, ALL THAT
 TIME IS GONE.  SORRY, YOU LOSE.
  TRY AGAIN.   RIGHT.  SO WE 
WILL MEASURE THIS BECAUSE I CAN 
TALK ABOUT NUMBERS AND WE CAN 
TALK ABOUT GOALS, BULLET I FIND 
IT REALLY HELPFUL TO TAKE 
SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS THE 
REAL-WORLD.  SO I FOUND A COOL 
LITTLE APP, A BUDGET APP THAT 
USES TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU ARE 
FAMILIAR 
WITH. WEBPACK REDUX, THAT SOUNDS
 FUN.  SO LET'S LOAD IT UP
 HERE.   IS OUR APP, LET'S CLEAR
 THIS OUT.   IS A REALLY GOOD 
BUDGET APP, I'M GOING TO SAY, 
WHAT DO I WANT TO BUY? CAT FOOD,
 THAT IS GREAT.  I SPENT $100 ON
 CAT FOOD, I GOT THE FANCY KIND.
  I'M STRUGGLING WITH MY GUITAR 
AND THE TRADER JOE'S FOOD.  SO 
LET'S RECORD -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- 
LET'S RECORD A PROFILE HERE AND 
AS YOU HAVE HEARD TODAY, WE CAN 
ENABLE THE CPU THROTTING, NOT A 
REAL DEVICE BUT IT GETS IT 
SLOWER.  THIS IS ON A MACBOOK 
AIR, AND WE WILL DO -- THIS WILL
 MAKE IT SLOWER, NOT ON THE 
MOBILE PHONE AND LOOK AT THE 
JAVASCRIPT COST.  SO WE WILL 
RELOAD, IT COMES IN, HERE WE 
ARE.  MY FRIEND, ALL OF OUR 
FRIENDS, REALLY, JUST THIS 
CHART.   , WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? 
, RIGHT HERE WE SEE THAT WE HAVE
 THIS BULK OF YELLOW, THIS 
GOLDENGOLDENROD COLOR, THAT'S A 
GREAT SIGN, WELL, A BAD SIGN, 
JAVASCRIPT EXECUTING. AND WE ARE
 SPENDING THIS FRAME, 421 
MILISECONDS HANDLING THIS, WHAT 
IS THE COST HERE? WHY IS IT 
TAKING SO LONG? SO I CLICK ON 
THE FRAME, IT GIVES ME A 
BOTTOM-UP VIEW OF THE JAVASCRIPT
 HERE.  AND YOU CAN ZOOM IN AND 
SEE 140 OF THE MILISECONDS IS --
 IS T, OBVIOUSLY, T!  OH, T. DID
 I -- UGHTER ]  NOT REALLY SURE 
WHAT THAT IS, BUT WE CAN FIND 
OUT WHAT T IS.  AND LOOKING AT 
THIS CODE REALLY ISN'T USEFUL.  
I CAN --  THERE'S T.  HELLO, T. 
  DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THIS 
IS.   I KIND OF KNOW WHAT IT IS,
 IT IS ACTUALLY THE SORT OF 
MODULE LOADER THAT WEBPACK USES.
 STRANGE IS THIS DOESN'T LOOK 
LIKE A VERY EXPENSIVE PIECE OF 
CODE, IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING 
THAT IS EXPLICITLY SLOW.  SO IT 
LOOKS LIKE THE NUMBERS THAT ARE 
REPORTED TO ME IN DEVTOOLS ARE 
LYING TO ME OR NOT ACCURATE.   
IS ASSOCIATED HERE, BUT I DON'T 
THINK IT IS ACTUALLY HERE.   I 
REALLY THINK THAT IT IS PROBABLY
 PARSE TIME, IT IS PARSING THE 
JAVASCRIPT JUST FROM SOME 
EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE HAD.   WILL
 START HERE, WE HAVE THIS T 
FUNCTION, AND I WANT TO SEE THE 
PARSE COST.  I KNOW THAT I CAN 
STEP DOWN INTO ABOUT TRACING AND
 CLICK THE CHECK BOXES AND R
E-LOAD IT, IT IS HARD AND IT 
CONFUSES ME.  SO WOULD IT BE 
NICE IF THERE WAS A WAY WE CAN 
SEE THE V 8 METRIX INSIDE OF 
DEVTOOLS? I AGREE.  IN CANARY, 
WE HAVE AN EXPERIMENT, V 8 
INTERNAL METRICS ARE NOW IN 
TIMELINE, WHICH IS EXCITING.    
SHOTS ARE GREAT, DEMOES ARE 
BETTER.  SO LET'S HAVE A DEMO, 
GREAT.  ENABLE THE CPU
 THROTTLING AGAIN AGAIN, 
AWESOME.
 739 MILISECONDS THAT TIME.  
RIGHT.  WHERE IS OUR COST?  THAT
 IS DIFFERENT.  PARSE FUNCTION. 
 THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, PARSE 
FUNCTION, COMPILE CODE LAZY, 
COMPILE FULL CODE, COMPILE 
SCRIPT, FUNCTION CALL-BACK, 
THESE SOUND LIKE NATIVE V 8 RUN 
TIME THINGS.   AND WE CAN GO 
INTO WHY THIS COST IS THERE, BUT
 THERE'S A LOT OF BLOG POSTS 
THAT DESCRIBE HOW TO OPTIMIZE 
AND THIS GIVES YOU A STARTING 
POINT SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE 
PARSE COST OF YOUR WEBSITE.     
PARSE TIME -- THAT'S PART OF IT,
 BUT YOU HAVE PARSE TIME BECAUSE
 YOU ARE
 SHIPPING JAVASCRIPT.  WHEN YOU 
ARE SHIPPING JAVASCRIPT, IT IS 
EASY WITH NPM TO ENABLE EVERY
THING, IT WORKS. SO IT IS IMPO
RTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU S 
RELEASED THE WEBPACK BUNDLE 
ANALYZER AND THIS SHOWS YOU 
WHAT'S IN YOUR BUNDLE, YOUR 
WEBPACK PUNNEDAL, YOU CAN E
XPLORE THE MAP, YOU CAN SEE THE 
TREE AND BUNDLE SIZE AND YOU CAN
 FIND OUT WHY YOU HAVE THREE 
VERSIONS OF JQUERY ON THE PAGE 
TO IMPROVE THINGS AND FOR THOSE 
OF YOU USING BROWSER 5, THERE'S 
A SIMILAR TOOL CALLED DISK WITH 
A SUNBURST CHART, WHICH IS 
BEAUTIFUL.  I'M HAPPY WHEN I SEE
 THIS.  I'M ABLE TO FIND THIS 
INFORMATION.  AND SO, OKAY, YOU 
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE 
SHIPPING, YOU ARE SHIPPING LESS 
CODE, IDEALLY, BUT YOU ARE STILL
 HAVING THAT PARSE COST AND YOU 
HAVE TO THINK, WELL, THE ONLY 
WAY TO SHRINK PARSE TIME IS TO 
SHIP LESS PARSE CODE.    HOW DO 
I SHIP LESS PARSE KEYED  CODE? 
I'M SHIPPING JAVASCRIPT AND I 
WANT IT TO BE PARSED.   THERE 
ARE TWO TECHNIQUES THAT ARE EASY
 TO DO.  THE SCRIPT TAG, IT HAS 
THAT TYPE ON IT.  IT IS THAT 
SOURCE.  YOU CAN CHANGE THAT 
TYPE TO BE WHATEVER, AND IF IT I
S INVALID AND THE BROWSER 
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT, 
IT WILL DOWNLOAD THE SCRIPT FILE
 FOR YOU, BUT IT WILL JUST SIT 
THERE.  YOU CAN TYPE INERT, TYPE
 POO EMOJI, IT WILL WORK AND YOU
 WILL GET THE SCRIPT TAG.  SO I 
HAVE SOME IDLE TIME, I WILL TAKE
 THE CONTENTS, PUT IT IN A SCRIP
T TAG, THIS GIVES YOU CONTROL 
OVER WHEN THE PARSE TIME 
HAPPENS.  SO IDEALLY NOT AT THE 
INITIAL BOOT-UP EXPERIENCE.   IS
 YOU CAN ALSO HAVE ANOTHER SCRIP
T TYPE WHERE YOU WRAP THE CODE 
IN COMMENTS.  YOU SHIP IT IN 
JAVASCRIPT AND YOU SHIP THE 
COMMENTS OUT AND THE CODE IS NOW
 EVALUATED.  SO SOME TECHNIQUES 
OF MANUAL SHIPPING OF INERT CODE
 WHICH HELPS YOU TO AVOID THE 
PARSE COST WHICH, , WHICH IS 
NON-TRIVIAL WOULD IT BE NICE 
THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THIS IN MY 
FRAMEWORK OF CHOICE? THERE ARE. 
 THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN 
LISTENING AND SOLVING THESE 
PROBLEMS FOR YOU SO IT IS MUCH 
EASIER TO DO THESE THINGS, 
ANGULAR TWO SHIPS WITH LAZY MODU
LE LOADING BY DOUGH  DEFAULT.  
YOU CAN DO PER-ROUTE JAVASCRIPT 
DOWNLOADS, AND POLYMER HAS 
PER-ROUTE SORTING, IT IS AWARE 
OF YOUR PAGE AND YOUR ROUTES, I 
KNOW THIS BUNDLE IS FOR THIS 
ROUTE AND THIS BUNDLE FOR IT 
THIS OTHER ROUTE AND  AND THESE 
ARE FOR WHEN YOU NEED THEM AND 
WEBPACK HAS AGGRESSIVE SPLITTING
 PLUG-IN TO ADD REQUIRE.ENSURE 
AND IT BUILDS A DEPENDENCY GRAPH
 OF THE REQUIRES SO WEBPACK WILL
 SAY, I WILL SPLIT THIS 
JAVASCRIPT BUNDLE, THIS ONE, 
THIS ONE, AND YOU GET LIKE A LOT
 OF JAVASCRIPT FILES ARE GREAT 
BECAUSE ARE REALLY SMALL AND YOU
 CAN CONTROL WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD 
THEM, WHICH IS SO AWESOME.   
RIGHT, SO WE LOOKED AT NETWORK, 
WE LOOKED AT JAVASCRIPT AND DEV 
TOOLS AND VISUALIZING IT AND 
MEASURING OUR COST.  AND SO WHAT
 I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH?  
HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN TODAY,
 IT IS A MOBILE WORLD.   HAS 
NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO 
TEST ON REAL DEVICES, NOT THE 
ONE ON YOUR POCKET, THE ONE THAT
 YOUR USERS ARE EXPERIENCING 
YOUR WEBSITE WITH.  AND, IT'S 
NOT JUST TESTING ON A MOBILE 
PHONE, BUT TESTING ON A MOBILE 
NETWORK, NOT THE WIFI IN YOUR 
OFFICE.   TO GO, GET A 3G 
NETWORK, HERE, I'M ON A 3G NETWO
RK, WHAT DOES MY WEB APP FEEL 
LIKE? IS IT SLOW? I SHOULD FIX 
THAT AND GIVEN WHAT YOUR USERS 
VISIT YOUR SITE ON, IT IS 
CRITICAL THAT YOU OPTIMIZE FOR 
NETWORK UTILIZATION, BY USING 
TECHNIQUES
 LIKE SERVICEWORKER, LINK REL 
PRELOAD, HTTP2 PUSH, THESE 
THINGS CAN GET SUPER FAST 
PRE-LOADS, AND ON RE-LOAD, IT IS
 INSTANT BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
SERVICEWORKER SITTING THERE AND 
FINALLY, MY FAVORITE, IT IS THE 
JAVASCRIPT PARSE COST.  
 THAT YOU SHIP HAS A COST 
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE EVALUATED 
EVALUATED.  SO WHEN YOU SHIP IT,
 PARSE TIME GOES UP.  THERE IS 
NO WAY TO AVOID IT.  SO YOU SHIP
 LESS PARSED JAVASCRIPT.  THE 
END RESULT OF ALL THREE OF THESE
 IS YOUR USERS HAVE A 
BLINDINGLY-FAST WEB EXPERIENCE 
AND EVERYONE WINS.  THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH. 

 You did well.  Well, our next 
speakers are here to talk about 
predictability.  So expect the 
expected: Please welcome to the 
stage, it's rick and 
Robert.  
 Hi, everyone, welcome to our 
conversation about predic
tability.  First things first, 
we are rick andRick and Rob, 
which sounds like two cops on 
stake-out.  But just go with it.
 the opportunity to put together
 this slide and I got 
the  -- which picture I should 
use of rick
Rick.  This is the best picture 
I can
Rick, I'm the team of engineers 
working on the web platform.  
Robert, and this is the worst 
picture of me on the internet.  
Don't check the things that 
we're going to talk about today,
 what is
 predictability? You have heard 
things about new features and 
things that are progressing on 
the web, but what we believe we 
are covering today in this talk 
is the most important thing, 
having a reliable platform for 
developers.  If we don't have 
that, we don't have anything.   
web developers love the web, 
right? Well, so and so, right? e
 are still a number of issues 
and challenges that developers 
come across.   we want to be 
honest about this: This is an 
up-lifting talk at the end of 
the day.   want to be honest 
about this, the web does have a 
problem.   cross-browser has 
historically been really hard 
and it has a had been of 
challenges and with 
inconsistences between different
 browsers, interoperability 
between different platforms and 
devices and all that.  So we 
want to make it better for you 
so you have one joint web 
platform.  So thereats that's 
when we started the 
predictability project six 
months ago.  you have been 
working with square wheels so 
far, we will make this our 
responsibility to make sure it 
is if  good for you and expected
 is  so you can spend your time 
on it put our most neutral 
people work Gg on that, I'm 
Swedish and Rick is Canadian and
 you can complain a lot to us 
and we will say we're sorry.  [ 
Laughter ].  are seeing a theme,
 and we have a lot of Canadians 
on our team, so this is not a 
coincidence.  the main areas we 
will go through today is how 
Chrome is trying to improve 
predictability for developers, 
what we are doing to make things
 better and more predictable and
 how we work with other web 
browsers to make sure it works 
the same way across the board.  
This is not just about us, but 
the web and how we do things 
together  together.  Having 
browsers fight is a waste of 
time, the important thing is the
 web and how you can improve the
 platform as well.  want the web
 to just work for develops -- it
 shouldn't be that hard, but
 there are five main areas where
 we want to address this: 
 want to make sure you fight the
 platform less.  Less need for 
platform specific code tasks, 
where you used to have things 
you work and then it stops 
working, you have no idea 
what happened, and then getting 
rid of polyfills and shims to 
cover interoperability.   then 
we want to make sure we don't 
ship accidental regressions.  
When we dep riicate features, we
 want to understand what we are 
doing and how will this cost 
affect you, not just, yeah, I 
never liked this API.  We want 
to know what is going to happen.
  want to be more, more open 
about interventions and Rick 
will cover interventions in his 
part, but giving you the option 
to solve issues when that 
happens.  things do fail fast in
 the world and when it does 
fail, it will be both fast and 
obvious to you.  You will not be
 surprised and have no idea when
 the fail happened and you will 
have quantified data and 
analysis to make sure that we 
know that when we cancel 
different features, we have the 
numbers to back it up.  this 
number going to affect deve
lopers? And giving you a more 
coherent platform, making sure 
that the features work well 
together, we want to give you 
this passion.  Looking in their 
areas, they love the 
 scary, but still love.  work on
 the web might have been hard --
 you might still have some 
issues, but moving forward, we 
want you to look back, you know,
 when it was hard and just laugh
 it off.  You are going to be 
happy because working with the 
web is going to be a breeze.  
That's where we're goin go into 
into more into detail about 
that, we have the amazing Rick. 
Thanks, hopefully that will give
 you an idea of what the vision 
is for predictability.  It is a 
big dream, but I want to get 
more concrete for a minute.  It 
has been part of Chrome's missi
on, , as you heard Darin say 
this morning, to make the web 
better, not a collection of 
browsers that behavior similarly
 and we realized over the past 
years we have more to do here.  
and foremost, we need to 
collaborate better with other 
browser vendors.  Part of the 
reason this project exists is we
 saw how hard Mozilla and 
Firefox are working to get them 
to use what they built, and even
 if that required copying a 
crappy web kit in Chrome, it was
 inspiring and wanted us to do 
more in this space.  There are 
all sorts of ways we are working
 in this past year as a browser 
community.   not going to go 
into details here, it is boring 
here.   are a huge part of this,
 we invest a lot in the 
standards process and care a lot
 about them.  And how we do 
browser development changes, we 
are constantly filing backers 
and doing collaborations on test
 suites.  It is very different 
today than a few years ago.  the
 area you probably care more 
about, it is really important 
that we do a better job of 
listening to you.  And honestly,
 this is why I'm here. hoping 
this will be the start of the 
conversation, hopefully some of 
you will grab me afterwards and 
complain about what makes the 
web hard for you. this is 
important, I think the web is 
unique in that it is the 
commons, we own it collectively,
 no one controls it, it is a 
marketplace of shared ideas that
 compete against each other and 
in that 
marketplace it is essential that
 the partners are talking and  
to and understand each  best way
 for you to tell us that we're 
doing something bad is to file 
bugs against us.  Blink is the 
engine, the web engine under 
Chrome, Opera, and Samsung brows
er.  I will talk about blink 
buttons in our engine.  we have 
spend  spent a lot of time -- if
 you file a bug, it will go to a
 QA team and once we verify 
there's a bug, it will go to the
 engineerings team and we have 
complete coverage of the bugs so
 there is someone responsible 
for checking with the bugs, 
working on what is important and
 getting fixes.  you can see 
from that, over the past year 
for the first time ever in the 
history of our project, we have 
consistently closed more bugged 
than we have opened, which is 
always a great place to be in.  
]. you.  
 here are some stats, I just 
picked September, bugs filed in 
September by you all.  These are
 bugs filed by the wizards, 
chromium commiters.  There were 
300 filed in September and 93 
percent of those have been 
reproduced and routed to an 
area, that's what we mean by 
triage, they are on a team's 
plate to deal with.  2/3 is 
resolved in some way.  It is not
 uncommon, we agree that it is 
not a bug in Chromium, it is on 
the website or framework or it 
is a duplicate of anot 16 perc
ent of the bugs that were filed 
in September have turned into 
fixes that landed in the code 
that are shipping in Chrome.  
There is more to be done, but I 
think this is good. is a signal,
 if you file a bug on us, the 
right people will say it, pay 
attention, and something will 
happen.  I think it is worth 
your time.  other signal that is
 available to us is our stars, 
you can see in the bug tracker, 
there's a star next to the 
issue.  If you are signed in and
 you click on that, that means 
you care about the bug, you want
 e-mail updates, and we use the 
number of stars as an important 
signal in prioritization.  And 
it is not the only signal we 
use, but if you look at the 
stats for the top starred bugs, 
we fixed 2/3 and that is for the
 lifetime of the project, and 
what you did in the past year.  
means the fix has landed, some 
of these were not actually bugs,
 or some of them -- yeah, were 
other things. in fact, I'm 
particularly proud, if you look 
at the top 60 starred bugs of 
all time in Chromium for all 
platform bugs, we shipped 9 of 
them in the past year.  Many of 
these things that you care 
about, there are two on the list
 with three-digit bug numbers, 
these were filed day the day the
 project opened in 2008.  We are
 a little slow getting to them, 
but we are on top of it now.  we
 are better at involving and 
listening to all of you in terms
 of new API design.  Google now,
 when we work on new features, 
we will initiate new platform 
features in a  process that we 
call 
incubation that starts with use 
cases, vet that the use cases 
makes sense and the ideas we 
have for them solves the use 
cases, and we do these in the 
open, via the web incubatr 
community group, all of these 
are on GitHub.  Look at the repo
sitories there, there are 
problems there we are trying to
 solve and draft specs.  We 
would love for you to file 
issues and tell what you think. 
 it is time to ship a new API, 
this is an important time for 
us. 
 It  it is the mission to push 
the whole web forward, but what 
risk will this be because it is 
Chrome-only.  We are happy to 
push things hard, but we really 
try to get feedback from the 
other vendors. see on the Chrome
 status page, the colors under 
each of the browser vendors 
represent what signal we have 
for them, you can click and get 
links.  n was shipped in Firefox
 and is on the road map as a 
priority that they intend to 
work on, and sometimes it is 
part of the web ever at this 
stage, we get a ton of feedback 
from other browsers, Microsoft 
and Mozilla, in particular, and 
we discuss this in public and if
 they don't like it, we will 
delay shipping things to resolve
 outstanding issues.  right, and
 then even before an API ships, 
it will show up behind this 
experimental web platform 
features flag, you can go to 
Chrome flags and experimental 
web features and play with the 
APIs coming up.  have Chrome 
Canary, updates daily, so you 
can try out the bleeding edge 
stuff, file a bug, and see how 
it changes day by day.   right, 
the third main area where I 
think we have gotten better over
 the past year is we now have 
better tools and processes for 
minimiing breaking changes.  how
 many of you have worked on a 
site where new stable version of
 Chrome came outer  out and you 
have an emergency because 
something is broken on it? Don't
 be shy.  Not as depressing as I
 feared.  I'm sorry, I apolo
gize.  We definitely don't want 
to do, but I can't promise that 
we are never going to do that.  
It is incompatible with the goal
 of pushing the web forward, the
 only way to break it is to not 
move and we want a
 good trade-off here and we are 
good a at minimizing those c 
this highlights how things 
should go when they are working 
well.   this was in September, a
 developer noticed that they 
were just using Chrome dev 
channel and noticed on their 
site, the imput type equals 
range element was not workinging
 correctly and they figured out 
it had to do with a CSP they are
 using, the most important thing
 is, when they are filing the 
issue, they told us it was a 
regression and it used to work 
in Chrome 53 and that was an 
important signal for the QA 
team, the team said great, we 
will do a bisect, search between
 chromium builds and identify 
the commit that broke this 
website and that happened in a 
day, the next day, the team 
identified that and they found 
one particular chromium commit. 
 So we know who to assign this 
to, we can make progress right 
away and one possible fix is to 
revert that change.  This cults 
out the uncertainty we have in 
the regression process, we don't
 have to do a bunch of 
deg-bugging to figure out why 
the site is b introduced the 
September, and within the 
release, there was the fix and a
 flew beta release and by the 
time Chrome 54 hit stable, the 
fix was in there and they did 
not affect any users.  This is 
how regressions happ23  if you 
look at the bug fixes, you will 
see that the numbers are more 
promising, 100 percent of bug 
regressions have been triaged, 
and 46 percent had a fix landed.
  unfortunately, breaking 
changes are not just about 
accidental regressions, we 
believe that it is important, in
 order for the web to be able to
 move forward, we believe it is 
important there is some way to 
shed the mistakes of the past.  
believe this is something that 
we want to be carefully and 
thought  thoughtfully, we want 
to take it seriously,
 we don't want to brake websites
 as a result of this.  anytime 
you are thinking that we should 
break some functionality 
intentionally in the web, the 
first thing we do is collect a 
bunch of data.  So the security 
team said, look, geo location 
API returns a precise position. 
 When users say yes to that, we 
don't think they understand that
 yes I know I want this site to 
know where I am,
 they don't want everyone who is
 sniffing the network traffic to
 know where I am -- so the geo 
connection should be that the 
user will hit reject if they are
 not on an encrypted conne if 
you are in an anonymous geo 
location, we will send it back 
and 90 percent is in an 
anonymous location and 10 
percent accounts for the page 
views.  We weigh the views and 
in this case we decided that yes
 it was worth the cost to break 
this scenario, and so we have a 
console warning in dev tools to 
say, warning, you are relying on
 something that will stop 
working.  We have these from 
APIs, so you are relying on 
these and not on dev tools, and 
they have a date for schedule 
for removal, but when there's a 
warning and we have a blog post 
that there will be a break in 
change, we will rip it out, and 
then we have a canary dev and 
beta stable and if there's comp 
plaints we can reevaluate before
 it affects a bunch of users.  
it is still really hard to build
 a website that provides a great
 user experience while being 
built out of components you 
don't control, adframes, 
inetworks, third party scripts. 
 this isn't new, browser vendors
 make a trade-off, they mediate 
between the browsers and users. 
 All browsers have heuristics in
 them that say, when will I 
allow this to succeed and when 
will I say, no no.  And on the 
one hand, we want the platform 
to be predictable, but finding 
the right trade off for these 
things is t
 about how we approach these 
trade-offs.  formalize the 
concept into an intervention, 
something that minimally breaks 
existing behavior in the browser
 in order to get some substan
tial user benefit.  Good 
interventions should be 
predictable, you know when it is
 going to happen, it can be 
standardized, it is avoidable, 
if you are following best 
practices, like using https for 
anything that is privacy 
sensitive, then you will not be 
impacted at all, it is only for 
things that we consider legacy, 
it is 
trams parent and we are 
collecting data from the field 
so we can understand the 
cost/benefit of the 
interventions and strengthen the
 health of the web.  will give 
you a concrete example, in 
Chrome 52 we ship a
 throttling iFrame.  There was a
 lot of CPU for updating 
animations of ads that were not 
visible.  That's silly and how 
the web was designed.  And so we
 did a bunch of investigation 
and looked at what other 
browsers did in the space and we
 shipped a new version in 52 
that show a bunch of power 
improvements.   usage went down 
by 50 percent, some cases, 90 
perce when we shipped it, to 
this day, we have not had any 
site reported broken by this.  
There are theoretical 
possibilities when it could have
 been, but this was a huge brow
ser benefit for little cost.  
there's a theme that we are 
trying to do more to protect the
 top document, the main 
application, from I frames that 
may not be well's behaved.  We 
are including timers, we are 
working when that is breaking, 
we want to mitigate that before 
we ship that.  And again, we are
 designing all of this in 
public, we think it is import
ant, this is about the web, 
which nobody owns.  We think it 
is important to have the trade 
offs be public discussions 
SWEERKS have the WICG -- we have
 the WICG and if you are 
impacted, then you can give 
feedback on the design.  So we 
would love your feedback here on
 you can file bugs on Chrome 
again.  right.  Back to R to 
amazing? I called you amazing. 
this.  ].  okay.   to the 
high-level guy.   of course, 
part of the predictability is 
also working with developer 
feedback and listening to you.  
And the three main areas are, of
 course, hearing what you have 
to say, acknowledge the issues 
you are facing and understand 
the different challenges you 
have and getting information 
from you, getting data, use 
cases, and all of that to make 
things better.  
 And one part has been improving
 the bug listserv for chromium 
Chromium, and the bug listeners 
is to have a web-developed focus
 and when you file a bug, we 
will have a team fixing that 
issue.  So right now, you go to 
web developer, you have a few 
choices and you can dig deep or 
describe your case.  Whereas 
before, it was a long list of 
all of these were irrelevant to 
you, so we are trying to make it
 easier for you to go down that 
path.  also want to talk about 
services like browser stack, 
where you can quickly get screen
 shots from many different b
rowsers and devices, even what 
you don't have, to see what it 
is like across the board.  So 
you can test your stuff and see 
what it is like in IE 11, 
compared with Opera 12.15 and 
what about the iPhone 6, does it
 work there as well.  So it is 
an easy way to get an impression
 and a perspective of what it 
should be across the board.   
also, interestingly, they offer 
the way -- the way that you can 
use your browser interactively, 
so you can pick one in that list
 and you can try in Safari or 
Chrome or IOS, so browser stack,
 and soft labs, we recommend c
hecking those out to get a good 
overview.  filing a good bug or 
starting or contributing to an 
existing one is definitely the 
fastest one to get an issue 
fixed so we can resolve the 
challenges you are facing.   
also as part of this in our 
website, we are launching a new 
feedback section, where we will 
service a number of ways for you
 to give feedback and also 
getting involved earlier on and 
try out new, different things as
 well.   any browser, it is 
being handled by bugs -- things 
that are not working or feature 
requests also want to teach you,
 or to help you, in how to file 
a good bug.  of information 
here, how you best described 
your issue to make sure it is 
resolved and how you can create 
a minimized test case and host 
it some where so you can share 
it with us.  we also want to 
foster discussion, we want you 
to be able to talk with each 
other because you never want it 
to be, like, the poor developer 
coder that disappeared and was 
never found again.  So the main 
idea, and we have some 
information on the feedback 
section, is just about sharing 
information -- people, or share 
this --  silent on your own 
won't help anyone.  So please 
take part and contribute. also, 
as Rick was talking about, many 
of the bugs being filed are 
between our engineers and 
between different browser 
engines.  Everything in web 
development is driven by bugs so
 we want it to be easier for you
 to find bugs and see what it 
looks like, but we want to 
present the web as one platform,
 we don't want to hunt down 
every bug in every tracker 
everywhere, we want to present 
it in one interface.  So I 
started to thing about how we 
can do that, we are Google, so 
we like the idea of searching 
for stuff.   it in one 
interface. I presented my ideas 
to Eric Bidelman on the team, 
described what I wanted, had a 
few questions, and we started 
hacking.  And we nicknamed this 
the BBS, the browser bug 
searcher, and this was bliss and
 fantastic and the way it should
 be.  as part of the new 
feedback site, we have the BBS 
as well.   got the help and 
input from other vendors as 
well, how to interact with their
 trackers and getting 
information from them as well.  
why it is so important to search
 for existing bugs, last month 
alone, with blink, 20 percent of
 the bugs filed were duplicated
uplicates.  Please search before
 you file something, but it is 
better to file a bug than to not
 file a bug.  If it is a 
duplicate, it is not the end of 
the world.  Make sure to share 
your information.  do you want 
to see a demo? We will try to do
 a shak demo.  ].  yet.  I appr
eciate it, but
 no.  
SPEAKER: So, how do we get this 
here? Perfect.  Thank you.   
also like that they were kind 
enough to make the cursor 
really, really big for me here. 
 we get it -- I have a nice view
 here, at least.   the idea is 
that you go in here, into the 
new feedback section of the 
website, and you would have this
 field and then you can 
immediately start searching for 
something.   what you are prese
nted with is a list of all bugs 
across all bug trackers, so 
where they are reported across 
web kit, chromium, and also 
Missoula as 
well, all the browsers.  see the
 current state of the bugs, are 
they resolved, fixed, or new or 
filed.  So just get an overview 
of what is  then you can also 
easily page between difficult 
results here, or you can choose 
to see all the results.  And 
also, in this separate page, for
 instance, if you want to filter
 only a couple of trackers, you 
can do it as well and compare 
those as well.  
 you can just
 fade out and fix the issues so 
you can see what is working r is
 cool, right? Now you can really
 clap. 
 plause ].  had a back-up
 video.   also, I want to say, 
tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 PM, 
we will have a break-out session
 about web predictability and it
 is the only session where you 
can come there and complain as 
much as you would like. ].  and 
whine and tell us about your 
biggest issue, because we need 
to fix this.  We need to make 
this as good as possible for 
you.   summarizing all of this, 
we are really trying to treat 
the web as one single platform, 
the way it should be.  It is one

questions.  we go: Of the latest

Okay, get your answers in, last

 in. Interesting.  That's how 
you voted.  Confidence was high 
on IE.  is the oldest of the 
browsers there, people thought 
it was a fairly old thing.   So 
it is dep reicated, it shouldn't
 be there --  might be in f
irefox but not edge, which is 
interesting.  Let's look at the 
answers as they appear.   in all
 of them.  You can marquee 
yourself on all of  of the web, 
you can always marquee.  You

c'mon up.  Go and take
 a seat.   known as browser

 Greg Simon, Alex Komoroske, 
Dimitri Glazkov, and Grace Kloba
, principal engineer.  So we 
will see what question -- I have
 not looked at these yet.  I 
hope they are good.   so 
question one: How many html tags
 are in the html spec?  wrong 
question for me --  many. 
]. Maybe. y too many. should 
say, we have some microphones 
set up.  We have one here, we 
have one here, and one over 
here.  If you want to ask a 
question live for the panelist 
here, this is something that you
 can do.  And I mean, we have 
someone being very brave.   not 
going to ignore that, should we 
take a question from the 
audience straight away?  going 
to be --  we get that microphone
 on to hear the questi you go.  
is going to be a very specific 
one for such a big panel, but it
 hits close to home.  It has to 
do with messageing across Google
 as a whole and how it affects 
Chrome hangouts. I use it 
personally, in business, and the
 app versus the extension has 
been shifting and fluxing and 
the extension has broken, we 
pulled it out of GitHub because 
it was pulled out of Chrome, a 
docking feature, a decision that
 came out of a lot of places 
that affected a lot of users and
 it seemed like it didn't need 
to happen as a break in change. 
 Can you tell me about the 
process and how that comes in 
the Chrome ecosystem.  nobody 
from 
the panel on hangouts.  can take
 the API in question.  In this 
case, there was an API designed 
for hang outouts.  When you 
build an API for a first-party 
application, it is hard to build
 one that will last the test of 
time. And the question is, do we
 really try to make this thing 
work well, even though we have 
-- it was only built for a 
specific application or do we 
move beyond it? The decision was
 to move beyond it, it was not 
something we can build in a 
solid fashion.  would like to 
lead on from that question a 
little bit more, the things we 
promote here, being progressive,
 accessibility, working in all 
browsers, and that is something 
we don't see something across 
the websites that Google 
actually produces. Is there 
something that we can do there, 
are there efforts there, is 
there something that we can 
change? Dimitri, from a -- like 
a Polymer standpoint, is that 
something --  I would love to 
see that changed.  I think that 
Google does need to play a 
larger role in the Progressive 
Web Apps ecosystem and it does 
need to get on this train, this 
train is moving, Thao was tellin
g us all about it.  I'm doing 
all I can to make that happen, 
and you all can help me with 
that, too.  you know, that's 
also a call for help.  SFLNCH
LTSSPEAKER: So we will do the 
live ones.  We don't have many 
of  question is about promises, 
I know that you have been very 
happy about promises, and I find
 it 
horrible. ].  the next few sente
nces, are you going to say the 
word observable?  think it is 
stuck between two difficult 
promises, one being -- trying to
 make them simpler, not having 
mastered call-backs, and the 
other trying to have, like, 
battle execution like promise 
all and it ended up being 
native, it is really, really 
complex at this
 given point and why are these 
two objectives taken in this and
 complicated? It has two object
ives and it has not met b used 
async awaits, where you feel 
like you are writing a 
synchronous function, but you 
are using promises, have you 
found that helped the problem?  
saying, you know, you are saying
 that from a mastered 
call-backs, because you have 
then -- it makes it easier, it 
doesn't necessarily, right? I 
think the problem seems to be 
that, if you -- if you really 
try and build that, you are 
having a sequenceable execuYou 
don't really have the, then, the
 structure that you would 
normally do in the sesequential 
execution.  most of the time 
when you are having [Multiple 
people talking] multiple 
execution, you suggest doing, 
like, promise all, building the 
structure, and you have lost the
 whole structure anyway.  You 
have to re-think the whole 
thing, right? So it is more of a
 --  Seth Thompson speaking from
 V 8, but we also have Alex R
ussell, who is on TC 9, he is 
speaking to that, probably 
better than anyone here unless 
they have something to say about
 that.  Alex Russell is a good 
one to speak to about about 
that.  a developer, if it is e
asy, you should look at it from 
an end result.  Maybe it is easy
 for you, you are designing the 
system -- That is good feedback.
  of the questions up here, I 
think that it popped up every 
time we have done the panel, are
 there plans or discussions 
about making Progressive Web 
Apps discoverable along side 
native apps? It is interesting 
that that gets a round of 
applause, if only there was a 
discoverable platform on the 
web.  If only one company would 
step forward -- [ Laughter ] -- 
and make such a thing.  But 
people like their -- Yes, there 
was not enough clapping, I don't
 think. 
].  all seriousness, you can 
look at app stores as almost a 
failure that the web had that 
piece, they were necessary 
because there was no way to get 
these things and on mobile, some
 users expect it to be there.   
expect, if you tap a link, it 
will load up that experience.  
So it is an interesting other 
source, I am interested to see 
as we evolve in these things how
 we can do in the space and it 
undermines the strength of the 
url.  you are in an ecosystem 
today, todayit is important for 
you to quack like a duck, you 
need to behave like other playe
rs in the ecosystem.  with the 
home screen option that Darin 
was talking about today  today, 
as these things fit in more and 
more like apps, the users will 
bring in more and more of these 
concep had a games portal, that 
was their app and they wanted to
 mint other apps, you want to 
grab another app, it is great to
 have the flexibility to have an
 app that can mint other apps 
and we have nice things, to put 
paths and scopes in urls and 
sub-domains so we can look and 
deliver those types of things.  
PWA that delivers a set of other
 PWAs, you can go to them and to
 the home screen.  s like a good
 idea.  will get yahoo to build 
one.  Thao, do you see this from
 part ners wanting this feature?
 What makes you want to be in 
the store?  discovery overall, 
why not have both platforms be 
at your diz  disposal in terms 
of discovery?  for most people, 
they understand that the web is 
great, it has the power of reach
 but having another pros  police
 to have your progressive web 
app be able  available is 
additive in terms of discovery. 
 And especially, if people are 
in a mindset and what they do, 
they click on -- the place or 
the icon or the app store to 
discover content, it is giving 
people as many opportunities to 
find your stuff.  So on mobile 
device, it is the place called 
the app store.  to some extend, 
what we shipped for the add to 
home screen first, that has been
 a journey and we are not done 
yet.  question from the 
audience.  Jake talk about strea
ms, my question is two-part.  I 
have seen that Google is not 
building for a single browser 
but for the web, what is 
stopping it for inferenceing 
Chrome and IOS to have 
ServiceWorker, or Safari to have
 ServiceWorker? And the second 
is to expanding to the add home 
screen part, is it possible to 
have a direct link saying add 
home screen when we search for 
web apps and we know we have a 
manifest already? So we can add 
the home screen from the link, 
is it challenging? Why is that 
not happening? Well, the first 
part is, what can we do about 
Chrome and what more can we do. 
 Grace, do you want to take this
 one?  think for the IOS for the
 ServiceWorker, we --  are very 
limited. Yeah, the thing is, we 
have to, like, we are using the 
web view and we don't have a lot
 of choices.  What we can do, we
 can influence the wide view.   
means all the apps, the browser 
app, the IOS so they can enjoy 
it.  And the important thing for
 us, demonstrate how it works 
well in Android and we need you 
to build the app and using the 
ServiceWorker and the user can 
see the difference, benefit, and
 the hopefully that is can 
influence the change making 
faster changes in Android 
because of the ServiceWorker, 
you are an iPhone user, the web 
is slow and if you are an 
Android user, the web is fast?  
representatives here, it is 
great for them to show up at the
 event and Mozilla and all of 
these other folks.  So I don't 
know if we have a polymon for 
them, you cannot catch them -- [
 Laughter ] -- but you can find 
what you want from  we will talk
 about benchmarks, that's the 
ultimate benchmark, my website 
runs faster for users on this 
platform versus another.  That 
beats any synthetic bench mark 
out here.  there is another 
question out here, before coming
 back to people on microphones. 
  ask two parts -- Yes, it was 
about add home screen from the 
search space staticly because we
 know they have manifest JSON on
 them. the search results page, 
we are looking into that with a 
search team.  Yeah.  to see that
 soon, thank you. you. So, how 
might users' expectation of the 
security model change when a web
 app is launched from the home 
screen, Parisa? Do you want to 
take this one? Should it do all 
the stuff that a native app can 
do? feels like a native app 
SXRSH  and I worry about this, 
there's a different model for a 
native applications, whether pon
  on a phone or computer, and 
the web. And I think -- we have 
an opportunity to merge that 
experience and actually make it 
more immersive between native 
applications and the phone.  But
 most users don't understand the
 security model differences, and
 you shouldn't need to.  Most 
developers don't necessarily 
need to and you have native
native apps and websites asking 
for permissions and users don't 
know which is which, as we 
evolved the UI between these two
 things.  Was the question 
specifically asking -- Yes, are 
there any things that we would 
grant, if the app was added to 
the home screen that we wouldn't
 if there was a website, is 
there anything that we would 
infer?  thing we do is full 
screen.   is already happening 
today that you do get, you get 
the Durable Storage on things 
like this.  So there is a lot of
 things that are already 
happening that, you know, add to
 home screen is such a strong 
signal from the user that they 
want to engage with the site 
that we sort of do have some a
ffordances.  But as you pointed 
out, it is an interesting line 
to walk. nk of it as, this is 
less secure, but you are getting
 more capabilities
 and with those and risk of a 
looking at auto-
granting the notification when 
the user goes to the home screen
 flow.  this feels like the app 
-- and Android users get the 
push notification by default.  
don't always want to ask, ther
e's a tendency to say, we should
 always ask for permissions, 
people are desensitized to ask 
to grant permissions and then 
you lost any security benefit 
that question was going to be 
asked.  there's a lot of work 
that we are doing to find the 
balance for any capability and 
the more powerful it is, the 
more thought we put into where 
that balance is.   think there's
 a non-security aspect, too, 
when you type on this, should it
 feel like a web page, should it
 feel like an app, and somebody 
in the audience, or definitely 
earlier in the audience, they 
had taken a native android app 
and put it to a PWA and going 
through how it was basically 
perfect fidelity, other than the
 fact they could not affect 
screen brightness for this one 
scanner piece.  And as I'm 
sitting there, I remember a 
couple years ago, the web can't 
do this, it can't do this and 
you are talking about the screen
 brightness is the one thing 
left it can't do.  Kind of like 
--  So thank you so much for 
building these great experiences
 and I really do feel like, when
 my kid goes up and taps on this
 icon, he really doesn't know 
what technology and definitely 
shouldn't care what is going on.
  lot of people don't know and I
 think that is awesome, I think 
you want to enjoy -- you, yeah, 
you shouldn't need to care.  
what you said before about 
people not understanding the 
security model, that is true.  
One thing that terrifies me 
about native apps is making web 
requests. As developers, it 
ternies me that native apps, if 
you have anything in your house 
or company, you don't need to 
put it behind a pass word 
because internal, they can read 
and write from that.  that 
paranoia allows us to have 
low-friction, if you type a 
link, it goes to a different 
domain that is part and parcel 
to the security model we are 
developing.  start to feel like 
the security model is a trigger 
word for this panel. Yes. ].  
couple more questions from the
 audience.  seems you are 
encouraging developers to go 
towards PWAs versus chrome 
package apps, which is what my 
company has been developing for 
several years now and jumped on 
it when you introduced that.  So
 there's a migration strategy 
and not all the APIs that you 
need are there yet.  We are 
talking to Darin and there is 
hope for that, but there is 
something in the education area 
which is that these are usually 
Chrome books or some kind of 
device that is managed.  So what
 is the strategy for, let's say,
 a school district to be able to
 push these applications to a 
set of devices tha that are 
strictly managed?  are going 
with Chrome apps, who wants to 
take that?  was not an easy 
decision and we care a lot about
 the open web and the linkable 
web, the ability for people to 
be exposed to lots of diverse 
experiences reltivally easily.  
 definitely -- there's a number 
of gaps between what was 
possible in Chrome apps and 
there's quite a difficult 
security model in Progressive 
Web Apps.  And for that case, we
 can imagine how that would work
 and how we can push an icon and
 that icon is pushed and we 
fetch and boot up the 
ServiceWorker in an off-screen 
tab to fetch the things it 
needs.  We really want to hear 
feedback from people like you 
from the gaps like that that are
 in place to make sure that we 
address them and offer the best 
solutions we can.  what it's 
worth, it does not seem like 
anything but a technical problem
 we should tackle.  This problem
 is relevant in many appli
cations, for example, the next 
billion users where you have 
offline a lot and you might need
 to resort to peer to peer 
swapping of progressive web 
applications.  a world like 
this, and how is that different 
from what you have described, 
except yours is a slightly 
different application of the 
same type of technology.  I see 
this as a possible thing.  the 
end of the day, Progressive Web 
Apps work great on desktop as 
well and there is nothing 
stopping us from it fleshing out
 the details so the enterprise 
management features of Chrome OS
 and so on work well for pushing
 PWAs.  want one more thing, how
 can we give feedback to Chrome 
team for things like this? For a
 lot of shopping sites and stuff
 like that, it seems like a lot 
of people who are in that space 
you can feed off of, for 
education, it is a different 
market and it is very narnarrow.
  love getting feedback from all
 developers, everything we do is
 Open-Source.s a reason for 
that, when people are on various
 mailing lists, when we anounc
eed the change on the blog, 
there's a feedback for a mailing
 list and this is a great 
example of something we should 
just do. you. 
 evening, as the web 
applications goal is to make the
 user experience better and the 
applications native, right?  
user uses the application for 
most of the time, the debugging 
matters and I'm great that we 
have debugging tools to identify
 where the problems are in 
Chrome, but what tools do you 
give to the developers, or where
 are the areas the developers 
should concentrate
 in 345ER78consumption?  biggest
 bug we have as
 developers -- who is going to 
fix it?  have invested a lot of 
effort in trying to understand 
memory usage ourselves inside of
 Chrome, this year and I think 
that -- I don't know if you are 
feeling it, but we definitely 
know our graphs are all going 
down in terms of memory 
consumption.  And I think that 
the actual developer appearance 
is -- it is hard, you are right,
 and Greg is one of the pioneers
 of this back in the day where 
he went and engaged with the 
Gmail team and built them a 
little bot that runs Gmail for, 
what, 72 hours?  days.  it is 
hard, I agree, it is hard and we
 are sorry that this is not 
working to theed  today.  We 
will get there, this is one of 
the our of our focus areas.  is 
an iput of 
low-end devices.  trying to 
capture some of the memory, 
using the DevTools today, when 
you are running the website, you
 can capture the memory snapshot
 and see where the memory -- at 
least run it into Chrome, and 
maybe run it into exactly your 
code, but you can see where the 
memory goes.  you can, just like
 any good program, you can pay 
attention to how many references
 you are keeping.  It is easy to
 understand in the code you are 
writing yourself, but all it t
akes is one reference to pull 
the whole world with you.  So we
 will tackle lot of this on the 
server side, you will run a pool
 of 5 workers and once memory is
 so high on it, you kill it and 
re-start it.  ing my agenda 
here, but are  I want to look at
 navigation transitions.  In 
Gmail if you are clicking on 
e-mail e-mails we can do 
re-loads and if you can do it 
fast you have that sort of 
tear-down.  you are -- Exactly. 
 And this is a good one, the ne
xt question.  have unease about 
polymer, it seems weird for a 
browser to advocate a specific 
framework, should it [Off-mic 
comments] new APIs or does it 
make sense for a browser to push
 a framework?  think of it not 
as a framework, but a mix-in.  
the trendy thing to do is to 
claim your framework is not a 
framework [ Laughter ].  will 
talk about Progressive Web Apps 
and many popular frameworks and 
there are many ways to build 
Progressive Web Apps well and we
 are excited to see what other 
communities are doing.  And the 
thing about polymer, there's a 
gulf between browser engineers 
and web developers and it is 
weird , when I joined the team, 
it was surprising to me --  are 
C + + coders. Yes and one of the
 reason that the polymer team is
 a part of Chrome, it Chrome, it
 helps us to test out
 web components and see what is 
as close to the platform as 
possible.  And to me, it is a 
way for us to explore what you 
could do if you tried to keep 
this [Off-mic comments] as 
possible.  And frameworks add a 
ton of value, they can explore 
concepts way faster than we can 
in browsers and standards and 
they have an important place in 
this.  will take a couple 
questions from the audience, the
 font size is being made very 
big on this one.  I think a lot 
of people are asking it.  lot of
 people use Chrome on desktop.  
Huh, we are e
release it on desktop as well. 
comments].  in all seriousness, 
we get this request a lot.  It 
is -- on mobile, it is easier to
 imagine what is operates like. 
mobile, you tap on icon on the  
the home screen and it goes full
 screen.  In desktop, you have 
multiple operateing systems, you
 have task bars, launchers, f
ull-screen things, tags with an 
existing window, is this a 
separate application or in 
chrome, there's a lot of 
interesting questions to reason 
through.  We want to do it, but 
it is a lot more stuff -- 
questions.  I'm excited that 
Microsoft, a few months ago, 
announced in a blog post they 
are exploring Progressive Web 
Apps in desktop. How far can we 
go down electron, how far can we
 get down that route, launching 
without tabs?  go in and say, on
 a chrome book, add to shelf and
 it launches in some window, on 
Windows, you can say add to 
desktop and so on.  This does 
not work as well in 10, it was 
true when they were doing chrome
 package apps, we do not have 
the flexibility to do it 
distinct from the browser.  But 
on the web it works well and 
Chrome books. 
 of the great things about the 
web, it stretches and gives a 
responsive design and access to 
all of these different things.  
And I've seen sudden, you know, 
productivity type companies that
 go in on mobile and leave 
behind the desktop applications,
 this is what I live in all day,
 I use it for work and it makes 
sense to fix the desktop side.  
So as we grow out, the PWA side 
works beyond mobile.  will take 
questions from the audience.  
spoke a minute ago between the 
gap of what is available in 
Chrome package devs and the 
distribution model and other 
APIs, in the education space, my
 company has built things in the
 education space for those APIs 
and they are not likely to have 
standards impplemented before 
the end of the Chrome web store.
  What do you think about a 
compromise of getting the APIs 
into standard Chrome extensions 
we can message as opposed to -- 
they were only in chrome 
packaged apps, Chrome cereal and
 app and things like  is in the 
paradigm security model and that
 works for those kinds of APIs, 
we love this feedback, and the 
APIs and use cases are important
 to you.  work with the 
extensions team and they expect 
that there is probably going to 
be increasing needs for 
extension APIs.  the existing 
ones removed with that same 
security model would be awesome.
   -- and the had  team --  said
 security model. would be 
helpful, it is a small team.  
You know -- what would be 
helpful is to know what the most
 important things are, I can't 
remember who gave a talk on it, 
but via feedback so we can know 
how to prioritize things.  have 
managers working on that today
Okay. Thanks.  we would like to 
ship the APIs on native web as 
fast as we can, but we need to 
be careful.  It is difficult to 
unship things from browser.  gap
 of functionality means that 
there is going to be no 
functionality until when the 
Chrome web store goes away and 
the APIs don't show up as 
standard APIs, right And that's 
one of the reasons we want feedb
ack, we want to prioritize that 
transition.  my question is 
about HTML imports, they are 
mentioned a couple times today, 
but and maybe it is just me, but
 I sense less optimism than I 
have from you in the past.  Do 
you think -- are you hopeful 
that html imports will be 
supported by the browsers they 
way they are today? Dimitri, we 
have discussed this.  as the 
proud father of h it  tml 
imports.  don't seem that  cool 
and primitive and it did advance
 a field in homodularity on the 
web.  And I do believe there is 
interesting among browsers to 
implement something like imports
 and the latest proposal I have 
so far was called html modules, 
taking the semantics of ES 6 
modules and transplaint it to 
something that looks like html 
imports.  Folks have been 
receptive, but right now the 
biggest blocker is shipping and 
getting the ES modules out in 
the wild and trying to 
understand how this will 
actually work.  of the saddest 
things ever is to figure out -- 
this is the first time --  week,
 this week, you are going to say
 something that is the saddest 
week ever.  looking forward to 
this. [ Laughter ]. 
  of the saddest things in the 
last 30 minutes is we are not 
sure what the performance 
modules of these characteristics
 will be once they had  are 
available because they are brand
 new -- and even those these 
modules are used primtivally in 
the developer's web systems 
environments, we have not done a
 good analysis of these modules.
  And until we have a running 
code in the browser, that is 
step one, and once we have 
something good and what is the 
next steps, we will start 
thinking about the html module 
precise timing of all the things
 we are loading across the wire 
when they are ready and the 
other things blocking on them, 
when I joined the team, just 
crazy complicated. A lot of this
 was intuition in the beginning.
  And I think, right now, we are
 like -- if you look, if you 
look at what Sam was talking 
about and what Alex was talking 
about, we understand the space a
 lot better.   in a way, my 
answer today would be no, html 
imports will not survive the way
 they are, but there will be 
something like it that is 
better. Thanks.  is next?  am.  
a few years ago, at Google I/O 
it was showed that Chrome tabs 
in app switcher are treated like
 every other app, that is no 
longer the case, is that ever 
going to come back, is that 
gone, what is going to be 
replaced?  this is in the 
android
 run time when they introduced 
the document mode is to go into 
the system.  And we adopted -- 
we first adopted from the app 
perspective, but when we started
 to get into the wild and then 
we realized that a lot of other 
apps are adopting that model and
 for Android, some of the major 
Samsung devices, they don't have
 the quick affordance, the butto
n is not available there.  So 
then a lot of users cannot find 
their tabs.  And, based on that,
 like a feedback, it is a 
decision because we run this in 
the wild for, like, over a year.
   there was -- we are collec
ting a lot of feedback coming 
back.  We changed back, bullet 
we are  but we are going to 
evaluate.  If you are looking at
 today's Chrome, you are going 
to run the new -- if a tab is 
opened by another app,
 we actually will put in the 
Android recents.  you are using 
Chrome as a browser, the other 
tab will stay in Chrome.  If 
they are using -- the spoke 
model, they are using Twitter 
and they click the link, just to
 view the content and that will 
show up as an individual 
document, and then when they hit
 it back and that will just go 
disappea about
 user expectations.  With that 
model, every site you visited, 
even if it is accidental, or 
that celebrity gos  gossip site 
you are not proud of -- proud.  
the model we are at, a lot of 
users a tapping around to a 
couple places they don't intent 
 tend to come back to and that 
feels like a website.  And now 
when you have a stronger 
connection to this, you say, no,
 please promote this to be 
something that is treated like 
an app.  And so this is like us 
exploring this space, figuring 
out what works for users, 
developers, and trying to find 
out the right mix for all of 
that. Yeah, we introduced a 
feature, Chrome custom tabs, a 
while ago that has seen rapid 
adoption and prior to that, some
 folks were flirting with using 
web view for tracking content in
 their experience.  What we 
found with Chrome custom tabs, 
they don't want to [Off-mic 
comments] app into the browser 
because the users are lost and 
don't know how to go back into 
the app. And so this makes it 
easy to pop back into the app 
you are in.  It works well for 
the hub and spokes style of 
browsing.  about you, I have 
seen this more and more, not 
only do you have some is 
experience  the experience where
 the browsing that is happening 
outside and inside of Chrome and
 that led us to this model, if I
 launch chrome, I want to find 
my tabs and the activities and 
the tasks I was doing there.  
And the way we can evolve the 
task management is in Chrome 
around that notion.  We cannot 
evolve the tang management of 
the OS, in many ways, we are 
saddled with the old versions of
 android concern and some 
hardware did not provide a 
convenient affordance.  look for
 us to do explorations in the 
task management space.  voice, 
show me the celebrity  [ 
Laughter ].  is a genuine story,
 when I started at Google, I 
realizeed that every story I 
tell involved a bathroom and a 
toilet.  This does as well, I 
went to the urinal and the next 
person by me was wearing Google 
glass, and I said, okay, glass, 
take a photo, and he went, dude.
ghter ].  ughter ]. ve a 
question from the  is about page
 performance, earlier we talked 
about PWA and mobile performance
 and the need for having less 
JavaScript and less parsing.  A 
lot of websites for this one 
megabyte of DOM size, but the 
rest of the megabyte comes from 
the advertisements.   challenge 
we have on many websites is page
 performance, I can go PWA, 
offline, and we have
 users 2 G, 33G, and are there 
guidelines that say, we don't 
recommend you to put heavy ads, 
you have the amp ad, you only 
allow certain types of amps to 
work so the pages are faster.  
What are your guidelines to make
 sure that the ads don't affect 
the main page flow and it 
doesn't impact the user? Is .  
is a complex series and there's 
a lot of moving parts and we are
 digging into it in a number of 
levels.  particular, we are 
looking alt  at ways to isolate 
the performance from the page.  
And we have implemented a few 
APIs into a few standards like 
IntersectionObserver that makes 
what what we are doing much more
 FAENLT  terms of 
IntersectionObserver, a lot of 
them are using flash to measure 
poZISHZ.  we
 are using heuristics, this is 
much more efficiently and we are
 disabling small flash plug-ins,
 which you see on desktop.  we 
are looking at making targeted 
interventions, roll-back the 
clock, remember pop-up blocking?
 This is browsers intervening to
 help, move the ecosystem to a 
better model.  You can argue 
whether that worked and the 
point is, things that we are 
talking about here are ways that
 we get involved and another 
example we are talking about, in
 the standards group season is 
blocking synchronous script 
around injecting the documents 
outright.  A lot of times these 
ads will document one script, 
another one and then you get an 
awful saw-tooth pattern.  We are
 exploring ways to say that is 
not okay, you don't need to do 
it that way and we will break 
that.  on 2 G connections, we 
will ignore or not wait for t
hat.  And if you open dev tools 
on a page that does that 
behavior, if you are on 2 G, we 
will warn you, we will intervene
 to change this  situation, like
 rick and Robert came on stage 
and said this we want to be 
predictable, and then we say, we
 are going to break you 
randomly.  you do the bad 
things.  you don't know hot  
what they are, it looks  hear 
this loud and clear, this is a 
really hard problem.  --

can have an attribute on an 
iFrame to set up limits on it, 
it is earl  early days and 
attribute the origin or the 
iFrame -- Yes, because the 
iFrame can load no longer than 
three megabytes.  the page is 
loading in 5 seconds, next is 
16.  So you cannot monitor what 
comes in and what goes  the odd 
 audie sure  curious, for inside
 perspective on the seeming 
contrast between Android instant
 apps and that side of the 
house, versus the Chrome team --
  should SPEAKER: I
 should ask -- I'm asking half 
the group here, what is your 
perception of the internal 
dynamics there?  I go? Well, I
 think that there is nor 
surprise the android team is 
investing in snaps and we talked
 about friction and how that is 
such a problem.   so there are a
 path to try to figure out
 how to bring instant loading 
apps.  And there are security 
challenges -- Size.  the reality
 is, we are -- we are all 
thinking about the same sort of 
ideal model, one where you can 
happen on an experience very 
easily, discover the experience,
 and as a user retain that 
experience and re-engage with 
that and that act of retaining 
grants powers.   full-screen, 
tomorrow it is notifications.  a
 user, you discover content 
within the context of the 
browser, or in the case of 
instant apps, and similarly 
within the browser, you are 
following URLs and as a user you
 might retain it and that makes 
a transition you are keeping on 
the device.  You are converging 
on a similar model for computing
 and there are similar differenc
es between web That takes us 
nicely to a good, nice, last 
question and that's what is the 
best way to convince my 
management to jump on PWAs? It 
is the management that has the 
money.  just makes sense. 
Customize, if you think about 
iteration and updating, I 
imagine that developers can sort
 of capture the cost of being 
able to update and evolve 
whatever product or selves  
service they have and how 
challenging that is on native 
apps.  example of that is The 
Big Quiz, knowing how to re-ins
tall an app.  a native app had 
the same problem that we had t
Yes.  in all seriousness, we had
 a number of case studies that 
THOO covered in her talk, a lot 
of the things about the user 
acquisition costs, for example, 
these are powerful people making
 the business decisions in this.
  I'm starting to see 
Progressive Web Apps as a term, 
it is coming up in press 
articles, in conferences, 
marketing conferences and other 
places.  Imagine at some point 
if you know the technologies and
 you built a prototype and know 
what it looks like for your 
company, at some point somebody 
in your business will say, what 
is this progressive web app 
thing? And you will say, this is
 an example of what it would 
look like.  best thing you cando
  do -- today, people are not 
experiencing Progressive Web 
Apps on a daily experience and 
it is hard to imagine your site 
inside, or what your site should
 look and feel like and how it 
can be better.  West Elm is such
 a great example, they built a 
demo first, and they did early 
beta and then public and then 
they will move it over.  Once 
you see something so amazing, 
you don't want to go back and 
you need that demo, you don't 
need to take the entire site, 
just a couple APIs and you will 
make it immersive and engaging. 
 you can take 20 percent and 
build a demo or prototype Make 
it real, concrete. people are 
saying, home screen icons? When 
they see it real, that is very 
different.  note to end on.  Can
