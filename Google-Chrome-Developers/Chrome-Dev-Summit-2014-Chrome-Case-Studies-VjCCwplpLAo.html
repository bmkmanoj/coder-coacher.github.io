website last year and it was amazing and
but like any project of this so it has
loads of challenges so material design
is really good for apps but sites are a
bit more of a challenge because it
doesn't have much to say about those I
had to step in kind of look at the spec
and go how does this work for a site you
know so I'm looking at the spirit of the
thing I'm looking at the details trying
to figure out from all the other
material design things I've seen how to
actually make it work for a site and in
the end I feel like I got there I feel
like it does look like a material design
site but at the same time there is a
bunch in there that probably isn't in
the spank when I got to building the
site I knew that the animations are
these card takeovers were going to be
really hard to do at 60 frames a second
so I ended up coming up with a new way
of doing it and that way was to take the
first position of the card the last
position of the card and then using
transform and opacity changes to reverse
the end position back to the start
sounds a bit bizarre but then when you
switch on transitions on transform and
opacity and you let it play forward it
plays cheaply because these are just
done by the GPU and so on I call it flip
because its first last invert play and
it was the way that we got from hey this
is not going to run at 60 frames a
second tooth yes this pretty much does
run at 60 frames a second and that for
me was really satisfying around the
office we would often talk about the
site and the new things that were coming
into the platform that we thought hey we
know we can throw these on and they
would really add a lot the first one
that I wanted to add on for sure with
service worker because I knew conference
Wi-Fi is normally pretty you know week
and it was slightly better at chrome dev
summit than anywhere else I've been but
all the same service worker there for
offline and this was before any of the
new stuff like push notifications that
was great so that went on we added on
theme color because that was really nice
on chrome on Android again as you change
the sections just the theme color
changes that was really great and then
the last thing was to add a manifest
file so that you could save this thing
to homescreen it would always
in portrait mode and those three things
combined actually made it feel really
integrates to the platform that all new
and really sort of a great opportunity
to showcase those technologies I love
sharing the process that i go through
with developers so for me it was never
about build something and then forget
it's always about build something get
the source code out there so that others
can look at it and and figure out how
you actually solve particular problems
but in my case I was also able to stand
up at chrome dev summit itself and say
the site that you've all been using is
available now and here's the process
that I went through to get there here's
the the journey that I went on so all in
it's like this kind of package of
technologies and ideas a source code and
just sort of hopefully an inspiring
thing that lets people go you know what
actually I didn't think about the web
like that and now that I am I can see
the possibilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
