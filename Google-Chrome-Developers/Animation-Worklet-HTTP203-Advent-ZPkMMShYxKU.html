we know it's December it is in December
that's Christmas yes so I thought for
Christmas we could like talk about we
want to do for 2018 and you can ask me
questions about the things that I want
to do okay so something that I'm excited
about is animation brooklet animation
worklet okay now what's a worklet
worklet is like a worker like a
potentially off threat thing yes but
it's more like wait and something if we
can easily and cheaply instantiate like
a piglet is a smaller Pig a worker it's
a smaller worker right okay I understand
now an animation what's that actually I
know but what there isn't how does that
fit inside of worklet so you know how
you and sometimes you end up like doing
javascript in a raft just to make
complex animations or have something
stick to your finger like drag and drop
things with like transforms like I'm
NATIVE where you scroll the faying and
header so it goes up these ten things
those would go in the worklet because
the work trip would be called on every
frame work let's count access Dom no but
we have like special thing is like proxy
elements so you can still transform them
and like with the fast GPU operations
like transform opacity but only those
things
oh okay so it's just the things that can
be composited exactly it basically runs
on the composer technically that's not
true but might as well think about it
that way so you can manipulate where
things appear on-screen it's really fast
and you can do really fancy fancy things
okay so what can I do that in response
to you can do it in response to time
because that's how animations work but I
it's true in response to scroll so that
can have frame perfect scroll linked
effects so you could do things like a
high D bar it disappears or a header
that grows when you scroll down or like
an object it rotates when you scroll
down so you're getting the scroll
position in and you didn't have access
to a series of elements or something and
you can just do do what you want with
them yeah okay and then with time you
just give it like I want to do an
animation for 20 seconds and you just
get the frame but it's very similar to
the web animations API where you define
timelines and keyframes on these
timelines and then you can basic
say on this time I want to be at this
point depending on where you are on the
scroll timeline or the actual time time
time line line and time line line line
with animations animations bang on I
want to talk about the web blocks API go
is that like warlocks no so it's like
look like mutex locks and stuff yes
what correct what what what how</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
