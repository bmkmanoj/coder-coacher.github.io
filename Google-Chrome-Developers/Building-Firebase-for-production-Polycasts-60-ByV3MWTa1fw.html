welcome back to polycast so today on the
show we're gonna be wrapping up our tour
of polymer and firebase by taking this
project that we've been working on and
integrating it with the polymer build
library so that we can build it for
production so follow me over here to my
laptop and we're picking up where we
left off last time so we've got this
project that we created we can we can go
ahead and maybe set up our server so you
just like preview this thing okay so we
can go to our terminal here we can run a
firebase serve you know in Bagan the
submit this you can see it very surf
that'll start up a local server just so
we can you know see what working on okay
so this is where we left off last time
we had this kind of like to-do list
thing that we were building it kind of
looks like a mess right now because we
you know we added messaging we added a
bunch of other weird stuff to it so the
design is like totally wacky but
whatever it has the features that we
want for our application and today we're
just gonna cover how we you know bundle
all the code together so we can launch
it up on to firebase hosting in my
project the first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm going to create a polymer and GS on
file based on an inside of this file
we're going to tell polymers build
library about the entry points to our
application about our application shell
and about any other sort of like extra
dependencies that we want to package up
for our build so I've gone ahead and
actually just save this puppy out and
I'll bump this up a little bit so you
can see what we've got here so we've got
this entry point which is our public
index.html file that just tells polymer
build hey this is we're gonna start our
app and we've got our shell which if you
recall is our my app element so
everything that we've been working on so
far has been kind of contained within my
app now if you're using something like
the purple pattern and you had
additional fragments you could add those
to this polymer JSON as well so those
would be views that you were like lazy
loading over time in our case inside of
my app we've actually just got all of
our views just displaying right here so
we've gotten my login my new it's my
subscription etc so we don't have any
fragments or anything like that we're
just gonna tell it about my app and I'll
bundle that up the last field that we
have here is our extra dependencies so
these are things which were not
rinsing as HTML imports so polymer
itself is not referencing these things
but these are files that we do know that
we need to include in our build we want
to make sure they get copied over so
this is things like our manifest.json
the firebase messaging service worker
which we talked about in our last
episode and our web components light
polyfills right so we're gonna tell it
to copy these over as well okay so that
will instruct to the polymer build
library what copy the next thing we want
to do is create a package JSON file and
actually install polymer build itself so
make a package JSON and I'll just pop
some stuff in here so I just called it
you know my project for now you can name
it after or whatever you want give it
whatever version you want we're gonna
include a little NPM build step here so
I'm just gonna include a build step
that's gonna run gulp for us and we'll
get to that in just a bit the main thing
we care about though are these dev
dependencies down here at the bottom so
a few items that we're gonna pull in
we're gonna pull in this library called
Dell which will allow us to sort of like
clean up our build directory every time
we're about to do a new build
we'll pull in gulp and notice that we're
using version 4 here and then these last
two a merge stream and ply log these are
just for debugging polymer build as
you're using it or our merge stream is
for merging your streams ply logs for
debugging and Palmer build we're gonna
pull in the the latest alpha version
which is 0.6 0 alpha probably by the
time you're watching this episode 0.6
will be out already but I want to go
ahead and use it now because it's a
little bit easier to use some previous
versions of polymer build so we've got
that ready we're gonna run npm install
and i've actually already got all these
things installed in my node module so we
don't have to wait for it to download or
anything the next thing we want to do is
create a go p-- file file a yes and what
i'm gonna be doing here is i'm going to
be using gulp and the palmer build
library directly instead of using
polymer CLI itself now if we use polymer
CLI on this project we just ran polymer
build it actually would do a pretty good
job of building everything but it's
gonna create some additional things like
a like a serviceworker and it's gonna
kind of put it in sort of a weird place
because right now polymer builds the the
CLI service worker is not programmable
for the output directory that's
something that they're gonna probably
change in a future version of the CLI so
we don't have these like weird vestigial
files like laying around
stuff like that we're just going to use
polymer build directly we're gonna tell
it exactly what we want it to build so
we're gonna do that inside of the sculpt
file and I've actually gone ahead and
and pre-written the sculpt file because
there's a fair bit of code in here we
can walk through these piece by piece
just so you sort of like understand what
is going on here at the top of our gulp
file we're just pulling a few items that
you know we'll we'll need for doing work
like setting up our paths
palenko merge car streams deleting files
and things like that this is all
something like typical boilerplate where
it gets interesting is when we get down
here to like polymer JSON right so we're
actually going to require polymer JSON
we're pulling our polymer JSON file so
that we have it in gold we're gonna pull
in the polymer build library and we are
going to pass it our polymer JSON file
when we instantiate it so that way it
has some configuration and they're going
to tell it that we want our build
directory where it outputs everything
can be build / bundled so this is gonna
take everything that's in our public
directory right now and put it in build
/ bundled / public then have to find
this little helper here because the the
gulp fella we're gonna create is going
to be maybe a little atypical from most
cult files that you've seen it's going
to be basically one build function
that's gonna have a promise chain and
there's gonna be a few places we're
going to wait on some streams from
polymer build so we've got this wait for
function right here all this does is it
returns a promise and it listens for a
streams and/or error event and either
resolves or rejects the promise this is
gonna be very helpful for our build
function and an inside of the build
function itself we're gonna kick off
polymer build now the public build
library if you recall from from our
episode on writing your own generator
using the polymer build librarian and
the custom generator init function
plumber build library takes all of your
HTML imports it looks at the CSS and um
it looks at the chase and um it looks at
the HTML and it extracts each of those
into its own file stream and you can run
transformations on those stream so if
you want to do CSS minification you want
to do a JavaScript like uglify or
something like that you can after it has
split apart those streams and then once
you've done those transformed it rejoins
everything for you so what we're gonna
do is we're going to start off by
calling this jell function we're gonna
delete the build directory if there's
already something inside of it we'll
just clean it out so we can start fresh
and they're just going to work through a
little promise chain
so we're gonna create a source stream
using the polymer build library what
it's going to do it's going to look at
our entry point for application it's
gonna look at that my app HTML file and
it's going to figure out all the HTML
imports that it references and it'll
treat all of those as sources so I'm
going to create a stream for that we're
gonna tell it to you split the HTML
that's how we create the CSS the J s and
the HTML streams and here is where you
could run any sort of transforms you
wanted to so for instance if you were
using something like uglify you could
then pipe one of those streams to uglify
you would use the gulp if library to
check the file extension so if it's a
JavaScript file might be to puggle if i
its a CSS file like pipe it to CSS slam
you know HTML pipes to HTML I'm in a
fire at Sarah right so I'm gonna comment
these out for now because I don't have
these libraries installed just yet but
I'm gonna leave these here on and and
when I put the code up on github these
will be here for you so if you want to
add your own gulp transforms you can so
that'll be all of our source files and
then we've also got a separate step
where we work through all of our
dependencies so this is stuff that's
living in like Bower components or
whatever if you want to uglify those or
CSS slam those you can as well so that's
gonna create two streams sources and
dependencies and then we're just going
to merge the two streams together well
we'll have a little console log here as
soon as we start getting some data out
of the stream that just tells the user
hey we're analyzing these streams if we
want to do bundling we can pass it to
our polymer project bundler so we're
gonna pipe all those streams and a
polymer that's what's going to go
through and basically run vulcanize on
your behalf and sort of put everything
into the the my app file if you do
additional things here do like if you
wanted to add like prefetch links and
stuff like that you could explore doing
that with your own transforms and lastly
we're just gonna take everything and
we're gonna pipe it to the build
directory which if you remember is a
build slash bundled we set that up at
the top of the file and then we're just
going to use this wait for helper
function to wait on the build stream so
after it's done processing all of our
files this promise will resolve and I
can move down to the very last step in
the promise chain we're just going to
console log out to the user hey
everything is done well resolve that one
last promise and then that's it for our
gulp test that's our entire build
process for our polymer site the last
thing to do is just to set this as our
default builds done for gulp
should be off to the races so let's open
our sidebar here and let's give it a
shot
so open our terminal up and we will run
I'll make this a little bit bigger so we
can run gulp or because I added in my
package JSON file I added a build script
we could also run npm run build either
one of those should work so we run that
and we should start seeing those those
console logs coming out so it's deleting
the build directory it's analyzing our
build dependencies then it tells us that
the build is complete we go back to our
text editor and I mean look at our build
directory you can see now we've got
inside a bill bundled I've got all our
project files it copied over things like
our firebase messaging service working
because we added that two extra
dependencies and if you look at my app
dot HTML you can see that it's sort of
munched all the code into this file so
it ran vulcanized for us which is great
the last thing we can do is we can
preview this using the firebase server
the one change we need to make there is
we'll go to firebase JSON for hosting
we'll tell it that we want to look at
build / bundled / public save that go
over to our terminal so we run firebase
surf and I'll tell us that it's serving
build bundle public click on localhost
5,000 and here you go here is our
bundled project and we can verify that
it's the bundled version by opening our
our network panel clearing everything
out hard refreshing the page and you'll
see that instead of requesting like tons
and tons of HTML imports for all of our
dependencies we only really see a couple
HTML imports I think we actually only
see my app dot HTML I'm gonna look at
the source for that you can verify that
it is the vulcanized version so at that
point the only thing you have left to do
is to run firebase deploy and your site
is ready to share with the rest of the
world so that about covers it for today
