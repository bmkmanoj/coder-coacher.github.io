you're going to see a lot of in this
course those technologies are the fetch
API and promises promises make
asynchronous programming much easier the
fetch API is a replacement for xml
httprequest built on promises in this
example we're getting a JSON file
parsing it and capturing any exceptions
that occur this is much simpler than
writing a collection of event handlers
and simplifies code reuse the key here
is the venn function it takes a function
reference and waits for the previous
operation to complete before calling the
function if any errors occur it
transfers execution to the catch at the
end we're going to use a lot of
anonymous functions in this course you
can use the same function declarations
you've always used or use the new es2015
fat arrow syntax to declare a function
the new syntax takes a list of
parameters on the left the equals
greater than arrow and a code body on
the right take a moment to look at this
shorthand as we will be using it
frequently using fat arrow functions
lets us rewrite the first example more
concisely we call fetch pass the result
to a function now we catch any
exceptions with the second function that
probably went by quickly so take a
moment to try these in your browsers
console they work in most modern
browsers but check your favorite source
for fetch and promises support open the
browser's console and type in this quick
fetch sample it gets index.html in the
local directory and shows the result try
it with and without an index.html file
you can find this sample in the core
technologies lab folder under 50 text
let's try to sample it retrieves a JSON
file just change the file name to animal
stock JSON and the response decoder from
text to JSON all over case this time it
fetches animal JSON which is in the core
technologies folder and decodes the JSON
and that's it don't worry if that was by
quickly we'll take a deeper dive into
and promises in a bit please take a few
minutes and experiment with these
examples before moving on to the
serviceworker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
