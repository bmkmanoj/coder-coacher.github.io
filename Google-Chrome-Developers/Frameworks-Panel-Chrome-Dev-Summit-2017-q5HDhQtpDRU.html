healthy relationship between browser
vendors and web developers and framework
authors and their users are often at the
forefront of trying to find a healthy
balance between D X and UX so today we
thought we'd bring along a few folks
from frameworks libraries and their
users to have a chat about what a better
future could look like so joining us on
the stage we first of all have Andrew
Clark from reacts Andrew next up we've
got Jason Miller from reacts
we have Steve Orville from the polymer
team Rob Wormald from angular Tracey Lee
from this JavaScript and rxjs Chatty
Tala from glimmer and ember Shawn Larkin
representing PJs and web pack also
Google the tech lead of amps and finally
Alex Russell from the chrome team lover
of frameworks all right let's sit down
so thank you to everyone that managed to
get their questions in today we have a
very special prize for the best question
courtesy of Alex the very best questions
day gets a very average Moto G for phone
that's gonna stay over here for now
awesome so let's let's get into it
very first question that came in was
which features if any would make your
life as a framework author or user
easier if they were added to the
JavaScript language or web platform more
broadly Jason you want to start us off
sure so there's been some stuff going
around recently about a proposal called
Dom change list and I think one of the
end games of this spec is basically a
way to serialize a set of mutations to
the Dom one of the end results of this
would be we can start to run more
application code in a web worker web
workers have existed for a really long
time and are strangely underused in our
community so it's a primitive that
whether it's polyfill they're
implemented in browsers once we've got
some of these things in place we can
start to offload a lot of work off of
the main thread and reduce jank on
mobile so that's like a huge thing that
I'm hopeful for what do you think it is
about web workers that have like stopped
them from getting as much traction as
they could they're scary
also you know by default when you
construct a worker you have to give it a
URL
and it's it's pretty easy like get a
blob URL for an inline string but it's
not like the default behavior so for
where there's like a task lit API that
might be proposed to solve that that
would be another huge feature so that a
framework shipping could instantiate a
worker with some code in it and that
wouldn't be a weird thing I'd that would
be expected so okay so web workers Rob
on the angular side did you have any
opinions about that I know that angular
is historically been trying to invest in
web workers yeah I would second the the
Dom changeless API would be amazing for
us like I think we could put it in
tomorrow and it would be it would be
ready to go so that'd be a big one and
then observables would be the other big
one that we'd like to see angular
developers using a ton of that they seem
to really enjoy it it would be nice to
not have to ship that code and not pay
for those bytes and I think it opens up
a lot of interesting things on api's
like intersection observer and mutation
observer I look at those and go those
are kind of perfect for the sort of
thing we're talking about so those would
be the big two for me is there something
specific other than having to ship it
like solve this problem in user lands
that stripping observables and a browser
what would bring I could probably talk
for like an hour about that I think for
me that to me it's kind of the same
thing that we went through from
callbacks to promises when we got a type
and you get a thing you can pass around
and treat like a real thing I feel like
we need the same thing for events right
and that's more or less than observable
is for me is that get a handle on the
thing get what pass around tree like an
object and it really changes how you
think about doing complex event things
drag-and-drop all these really
highfalutin animation stuff we all want
to do this interaction stuff I think
becomes much easier when you have a
primitive for handling really what's
delivering you okay shadows I was
curious what from the the glimmer and
Ember side do you feel is missing so
again the changeless stuff we actually
have like a straw man like
implementation of this in the glimmer VM
a lot of the work that we're doing on
the glimmer side is instead of compiling
like a template like how vast majority
of these frameworks authors you know
projects do what we are trying to do is
compile templates directly into like a
bytecode format and so the changeless
proposal is more
kind of a line with that because the
whole idea is that you would build up
all of the operations that you need to
like manipulate the Dom that's a typed
array you can transfer that across you
know different workers and everything
like that and then apply it on the main
thread so yeah I think that change lists
or something like the change list would
be I think great okay so we've got
change list
can we just ship that now I think yeah
you do change list plus worker dumb
there you go change Alex do any opinions
on change list no it's very straight
thinking butter for its year like Tracy
we so observables were mentioned I know
that in the rxjs community observables
are a big thing there as well jiminee
takes on you know our art our observable
something browser vendors for seriously
be taking a look at baking in I totally
think so I mean I know there's a tc39
observable spec happening and hopefully
that moves somewhere and just earlier
Rob was talking about hopefully how are
you guys gonna champion adder I think we
made it we're looking at it so hopefully
that land soon observables uh in the
browser but I think if we're able to
sort of start getting those types of
things to happen that are sort of more
native than what's gonna happen is I
think hopefully the ability for people
to use our excuse and the learning curve
is a little bit less daunting yep
awesome
malte so I was I was curious from the
amp side other other capabilities you
feel are missing so what I would like to
say because I've ever mentioned workers
for like what browser windows could do
is hear us like we all talk about
workers the developer experience and dev
tools isn't great yet so if you could
invest in the future and say like maybe
in the air people actually use workers
but then have the dev tools already been
good that would be amazing I also have
like something am doesn't really need it
but I think everyone kind of wants this
which is just really good week Maps so
they launched a feature called weakness
that's not actually what you usually
would consider this so just having like
a cache they can put stuff in and maybe
it's still there but you know not
considered by average collection like if
you build something like relay or
you know even Redux I think everyone
kind of wants this and it's not you know
been coming and that's really sad okay I
saw Alex Brother grinning at this uh so
Steve it's curious did you feel out
there any capabilities missing from the
platform that would benefit folks that
are writing you know applications using
web components or polymer yeah I mean I
think I definitely a second that
JavaScript API is that are mentioned and
I mean we think a little bit more about
the Dom here and just say like you know
there's tons of cool stuff that we run
into when rendering that I think would
be nice to add to the platform
specifically stuff like you know a lot
of the stuff that the native elements
can do that we can't do in custom
element land there's cool stuff that
like the dialog element can do that we
can't do render stuff on top of other
things in input element of course a new
infinity stuff be awesome to deconstruct
that and really add that to our tool kit
you know so that we can use that as
developers and anything from the react
side yeah things that the browser can do
that frameworks can do API is that
expose that I think we're always
exciting to us our favorite our current
favorite API browser API is request idle
callback that is we use it Abed
everywhere that's kind of core to how
we're thinking about basically what our
goal is with react right now is did
everyone enjoy that image async feature
that y'all talked about what if you
could make any component async and just
make any of your components stop
blocking the main thread so scheduling
primitives like requests on a callback
there's a really cool proposal I think
the what WG I always get the different
things confused but there's a really
cool proposal proposal called async
append which i think is a very
interesting problem space this basically
lets you build up this tree of Dom
whether using react or whatever you
could mainly create this and they
synchronously appendant into the Dom you
get a promise that says once all of the
layout and everything that's been done
by the browser and then once the promise
resolves you can decide when you want to
actually commit that change or actually
flush the changes it's really cool
reading that document cuz it's kind of
just a description of what we're trying
to do with react as well but that's the
type of thing that react can't do or a
framework can't do is all unless we
implement layout which
but realistically for now we can't do
that so that those are the kinds of a
few guys that we get really excited
about so we thought we saw some
convergence on Dom change list is a sync
append something that any other flavors
we see lots of nodding and fingers and
alex is also happy yeah that's great
okay we've got we've got some
convergence on this that's great let's
let's move on to another questions so
folks are wondering what criteria should
you use if you're trying to select the
JavaScript library or framework to build
a new application today and given that
he's just written a blog post about
performance budget so I was curious on
Alex's take on this and then everybody
else's you might get a different answer
depending on who you ask
today I work in Chrome I used to work on
frameworks and working on a browser
means you represent the user and so I
wind up representing the users interest
in a lot of these conversations and the
way I see people constructing
applications today is incredibly well
suited to the computers and networks
that we were building and using about
five years ago six years ago right
networked computers that were had
reasonable and good stable latency fast
pipes copious CPU relatively small
screens compared to the amount that
you've had to paint so that's not the
world we live in today mobile is much
much much much much much much much much
much harder than any of that ever was
the latency on the networks are terrible
the types are smaller and variable and
so you know we've been working with lots
of partners for a lot of years and our I
think the way I would think about this
is frameworks take some amount of your
headroom how much Headroom do you have
is the next obvious question and I think
you have if you're gonna be building a
framework based site you've got about a
hundred and thirty kilobytes on the wire
jeez it so when you're selecting a
framework I think one of your primary
question should be how much of that
hundred and thirty K that you need to
stuff all of your Styles all of your
critical Java scripts all of your data
all of your markup templates application
logic everything has to
130 kilobytes how much of that is your
frame were taking is a question you
should ask so one thing I was curious
andrey about this you're staring at us
now right next to me one thing I was
curious about from the react side so we
obviously see like a lot of applications
being started today that are targeted at
mobile using reacts and and you know
they're making a bunch of ecosystem
choices about you know using Redux etc
do you think that folks understand the
costs of the ecosystem pieces they're
using when it comes to trying to target
mobile is this the scenario that need do
I think people understand this problem
um probably depends who you talk to one
like downside I guess of the react
ecosystem historically relative to the
way maybe ember or view I think for you
does a good job with this is that we
have like resisted the frameworks like I
know you put frameworks and libraries in
the title we've resisted like the
frameworks label for a long time because
react was designed to kind of fit into
the architecture of Facebook like from
four years ago five years ago so in the
beginning like we never built like react
apps as like single page applications we
were building like little little tiny
views all over a larger server rendered
app so the first people that built like
server rendered applications were like
way out ahead of us so we never like
provide our own route or we never
provide our own solution for data
fetching so I think what to the extent
that people don't care about this enough
and there may be in the reactive system
I think that's kind of a consequence of
that and the future I think with things
I create racked up and really cool
projects like next j/s gatsby that are
starting to give a more framework
holistic approach to how you're supposed
to do service workers or server-side
rendering which is I think is really
exciting untapped area still or data
fetching or whatever I think that's
going to be a really exciting important
area in the next year or so well is it
one thing that you touched on was things
like next Jas being a good place to
maybe so you see that as being a good
place for us to try to finding perhaps
well it paths for people that are trying
to you know deliver applications on
mobile did you see what was the word you
said well let well it passed
okay I don't know what that is an
opinionated path for folks well lit lit
okay yes
like a cowpath okay I respond to animal
metaphors okay yeah I think that think
we have resisted track taking like super
strong opinions on things especially
because the infrastructure use of
Facebook is not we don't really use
webpack even though we think web pack is
really great so we've resisted giving
too many opinions but I can see us like
shifting more in that direction there
are a lot of things like server-side
rendering streaming service at rendering
data fetching the data management code
delivery like Sam was talking about
earlier there's a lot of these things
that are really the same problem space
or overlapping the problem space that we
don't have a great way of like pushing
our solution or our vision of what that
should be because we don't control like
a framework II framework so that's why
next and stuff really excites me in the
reactor base because they are offering a
little bit more of this than I think we
will maybe start to dip our toe even
further than create react up in the
future that's awesome Jason so pre axis
is in a similar spot with respect to you
know technically being a library what is
your take on this yes I'd say if you're
if you're making a technology decision
about how you are going to structure
your applications if you're picking
something important like your view
renderer but what you want to know is
when I'm finished this and I ship my
version one how large is it going to be
if you're picking a library you probably
need to look at what the what the rest
of the options you have are in that
library space so if you're going with
react you need to say okay how how large
is a common router do I have a decent
selection there you know for the various
CLI tools or server-side rendering tools
like next what is the end result of
those kind of ecosystem you know
approaches because at the end of the day
if you end up going with next the size
of react may not even have that much of
an effect on your bundle it's more the
size of next that you want to be
concerned with and so it like even if
you're not doing server-side rendering
or next or Gatsby or whatever look at
the common CLI tool look at the
boilerplate you're gonna use and see if
there's like a metric you can derive
from that not just the library yeah
let's
let's switch up topics let's talk about
Interop so framework Interop
webcomponent Interop has been an
interesting hot topic in the community
thank for a while Tracy I was curious
what's your take on this
there spec to be like is is it important
for frameworks to interrupt together if
you've got teams that are working in you
know react and view and practice cetera
is is that important as a thing for
friend developers I think you look at a
lot of large companies who just do
JavaScript so a lot of companies try to
say okay I'm just gonna go the ember
route I'm just gonna go the reactor
I'm just gonna go this route but then
you have a lot of people who just have
sort of disparate teams who try to say
okay I have this angular app what's the
you know what's this what's the library
I'm gonna build with all these
components and do I stick react in
angular or or what do i do there so I
guess it would be nice I mean I think
it'd be nicer for some developers and I
think that there are a lot of solutions
especially in the corporate world that
people have sort of stuck together it'd
be nice that those were sort of more
forward or maybe maybe you guys can come
up with solutions to do that or maybe a
web tech can solve all the problems
Tracy put you on the spot shot what is
what is web packs but what is your take
on on framework Interop you know I think
one is the biggest so okay I'll speak
from experience what we do at Microsoft
so we have over 98 products that ship in
production that use webpack but no
single one is the same and one of the
biggest initiatives that is taking a
significant amount of time is trying to
unify some sort of component library or
system I think some of the biggest debt
that companies struggle with and even
one like Microsoft is that we have to be
able to move fast add features but then
as platforms change or features are
added or new frameworks you know crop up
we want to be able to take advantage of
these technologies but in a way that can
still be agnostic and provide interrupts
between teams so like I have my own
opinions
and you know I think view is really
gonna blaze the trail in terms of how we
might see kind of a generic statically
analyzed kind of rosetta stone for lots
of different frameworks to consume
components and you know Jason I've
worked on it a couple times yeah so you
know he's already has a his a loader
powered by web pack that's already
taking a view component and importing it
into a pre AK project and it worked so I
mean I there's a huge amount of you know
opportunities for lots of people to
explore so Jason I was actually curious
you've you from the pre-act side of
viewpoint of you've you've kind of been
interested in web components support I
think that pre acts been been doing a
decent job of looking at Interop you've
also been again working with Sean on
ideas around you know how can we take
inspiration from things like the HTML
imports approach that you know libraries
that polymer heavily been using and
bringing to other frameworks could you
talk a little bit about your opinions on
what the future director that I look
like sure so for me a part of the hip
part of the win here is we essentially
have a compiler model right that the web
is obviously a target we write code for
but it's also a target we compile code
for not just with web assembly and these
types of things but even just compiling
to JavaScript but if we if we take a
look at the way that we're using these
compilers and we try to model our input
after existing specifications like if
you have a compiler that takes in
something that is essentially a
serialized web component write an HTML
file with JavaScript CSS and a template
in it that's an understandable
independent layer you don't need to know
how whatever the framework that renders
it at you know after compilation works
you could just sort of know how web
components works and if the framework
adequately implements slots then you
know if you know how web component slot
works then you know how this file works
I think that Shawn had mentioned rosetta
stone I think that's a good analogy for
this if we can start to converge at
least a little bit on what a component
looks like right across all these
different technologies what is the
substrate that they're all built on then
we can start to kind of you know cross
compile between them you know you could
write a user interface components
library with you know beautiful CSS and
encapsulation and some behaviors and
then come
I went to whatever framework you're
currently using and it won't matter you
know ten years from now you could
compile it something else mm-hmm
Steve I'm curious about your take on
this there's there's the cross
compilation idea and then there's you
know just having everything work
magically at runtime
what does we take on the shapeless
pressure I mean as you guys probably
know webcams are web components are kind
of designed to solve this problem so a
little bit makes me slightly sad that
you know it's everybody is not just
gravitating towards towards it on the
other hand I think you know the
technology is evolving it's taking a
long time and I think it's getting there
and hopefully we will evolve it still
and make it a satisfying answer to this
issue I think one of the places that
polymer has seen a lot of adoption
actually is in you know big corporations
where they just have this polyglot of
different stuff and they just need a
technology that works without you know
wherever the Dom is gonna work and this
is really where something like that
webicon is shine and i think this is
something where like as now that this is
kind of the year of the web components
specs being implemented what widely you
know I hope there will be more interest
among the other frameworks here
and I think there's there's I want to
give a shout out Taylor didn't talk
earlier to you to the custom elements
everywhere that Rob Dodson has done
which is I think that we took a little
bit for granted the fact that hey we're
the platform you know everybody's just
gonna work with us and I think you know
it's like to a lot of you know different
approaches this is sort of a scary
concept that now an element in the
platform can be anything it can be
whatever and I think this is partly
incredibly powerful because it's sort of
this democratic process of the cream of
the crop can rise and and you know but
at the same time it's also like but that
thing could do anything it's kind of
scary do I really want to use that and
this is where I think the approach
between custom elements everywhere is
really interesting because it kind of is
this idea that you know this the
framework authors and the community of
developers making these melons really
have to meet in the middle you know and
establish best practices such that you
know it makes sense do these use these
things all together and we can all
benefit so hopefully that happens Rob so
angular has been investing in trying to
improve their Interop with custom
elements and web components in general
for the last well what's what's your
take on this
so I kind of feel like the Rosetta Stone
that the Sean was talking about I think
that's what a custom element is I think
that that that is and I don't think this
group of people would agree on many
things right completely I guess the
group but I do think that we've all more
or less landed on this idea that there
are events and there are props or
property whatever gonna call them right
we all kind of an API that if you squint
it's more or less the same
so to maybe make your ear a bit better
today a little bit better like I can I
can say that our team has decided that
you know we've we've always consumed web
components that was a day one design
decision in angular
I talked to enough big companies I'm
sure you know companies that that Palmer
in that have these very disparate
ecosystems have a dozen different
frameworks I think it's very sad as a
web developer that everybody has to
rewrite the date picker and every
framework that exists right if I do one
thing as I wept of like somebody who
works on on the web now we can just
write one date picker that's awesome and
then if you some everywhere I'll just
quit right so so from our perspective
right angular is a is a framework II
framework as you said right we we do try
to solve a lot of these problems and so
for us it's you know I think our bread
and butter is these big applications
every likes to build but for me would be
great if angular components could be
spit out as web components right it's
it's a thing you look at it and it's a
no-brainer and so six weeks ago we
started really looking into this I've
been complaining about it for eighteen
months I said to Alex Russell when I
joined Google that we're gonna make this
happen and finally it's happening so
you'll be able to write an angular
component and spit it out as a custom
element and I think that the most
important thing about that the kind of
crux to all of this custom element stuff
is that nobody has to know anything
about how the component was implemented
to make it work because everybody in
this room already knows how the Dom
works right and if that becomes the
common API well talk to it doesn't
really matter what happens inside of the
component right we can all have this
rosetta stone we can all talk and we can
write one date picker and everybody can
be happy right
so on on that note it sounds like
there's there some some interesting
convergence on the rosetta stone a stone
idea I'm curious from the react
perspective what's what's reacts take on
what components yes we have a slightly
different take web components are really
cool I think they definitely solve they
solved the encapsulation problem and
they solve the consumption problem where
you should be able to consume a
component have to learn fifteen
different ways to consume a component
and surely you can wrap any react up in
a web component stuff not that hard the
question is whether or not we should
replace like react components as a
primitive for building your application
with just writing a bunch of web
components and on that note we're not as
convinced because we use I could be
wrong but I think another selling point
for web components is that perhaps it
obviates the need for a virtual Dom or
for us to have to manage your own like
like parallel and memory representations
of your view and on that on that part
web components don't solve that for us
so because we use our internal instances
not just for encapsulation but we use it
for memorization we use it for you know
computing changes we use it for
scheduling that's the big one
I don't know if you all have heard of
this recent effort we had to rewrite
react but we're moving in direction with
react 16 and going forward where we're
gonna have a sync by default rendering
and what this means is we need to be
able to do well we're gonna do all of
our rendering work inside of requests
idle callback basically and in order to
do that you need like this double pass
kind of rendering system where you have
two phases one async render phase where
you do most of your expensive work it's
all in request idle call back or maybe
in the future it's on a web worker or
whatever and then you have a
synchronization phase where once you can
compute all of your mutations into a dom
changeless maybe you can sing
synchronously flush all of them all at
once and that's the type of architecture
which we're really excited about there's
a lot of cool features that you can put
on top of this but it's not really
possible without implementing
your own data structures so we're like
thumbs up on web components but we don't
think it replaces the need to have our
own data structures alex ribbony takes
on this yeah I mean so um full
disclosure Dimitri glazkov Alex
komoroske and I started the project at
Google that sort of started the web
components effort um we're sorry
apologize you know catch me later buy
you a beer
I don't think what components actually
have any bearing on whether or not you
should have a virtual Dom right that's
virtual Dom becomes an implementation
detail about how your component decides
to handle getters setters attributes
setting and all the stuff web components
as an implementation give you a surface
area that everybody knows as Rob says so
you can just reuse the date picker from
wherever and then how you want to handle
that question about how state gets
handled inside of your component is now
up to you it doesn't do any global
coordination so I think this is one of
these places where web components
disaggregate a bunch of things that
frameworks used to do frameworks have
traditionally taken a bunch of different
different responsibilities between
ensuring compatibility across the Dom
giving you a component model in the
first place making sure that those
component updates are coordinated in
various places doing data distribution
and event handling and web components
sort of disentangle a couple of those
and leave you with a few of those
problems they don't solve everything so
a few those who still have to happen um
and it's interesting to see how the
various frameworks are sort of
reorienting themselves now the web
components are kind of a thing so yeah I
think you know I think I've seen lots of
people you know sketch es is doing this
great work where they're using virtual
Dom inside of custom elements which is
super cool there may be using pre-act
internally which is you know not
removing a virtual Dom but it does leave
that global coordination question open
cool and uh sorry I just gonna say it
just a sentence on the on the interrupt
thing just go back a little bit um I
just wanna I'm gonna sound like a broken
record but what the thing that we've
found this interesting about interrupts
is is this coordination problem at
Facebook we use react everywhere but the
other framework that we use is
server-side rendering
and if you think about it both of we
have this system called big pipe
the thing about both of these are
asynchronous systems and it becomes a
really interesting problem how to
coordinate to incres a synchronous
renderers so that things are popping in
on the screen at different times okay
and circling back to malta amp is one of
the largest consumers of custom elements
I'm kind of curious on your take about
his Rob's so I I just had this
conversation with a product manager
saying hey we didn't they take her an
amp and I'm like oh my god that again
and but we ended up doing was taking the
air BnB react datepicker
using its pre-act so it's not actually
like 60 kilobytes and putting into
custom element and because it works fine
like empties air being the date picker
and and that is like I'm worried or
worried about the people like put all
these massive frameworks and these
little encapsulated things I think we
need to understand that just because
something is great than the interrupt
level and we don't have to make a new
date picker doesn't mean we don't even
application framework no on the other
hand like amp right now it doesn't
actually allow you to write code in any
other framework
um so interrupts is a bit awkward but I
think what our goal is is in the long
term that you could just use you know
react to render this stuff that you want
to change and add document runtime like
I think the current state is not where
we want this to be that's just you know
the thing we could implement in fall of
2015
switching gears up that we we are
running a little bit over that's gonna
take one or two final questions what
impact is webassembly going to have if
any on javascript frameworks and
libraries Chad do you have any takes on
those so I think webassembly is kind of
interesting there's certain things I
really like to talk today basically it's
not a replacement for JavaScript if
there's in places where you need the
performance I think it will play a
larger part of you know maybe not you
know every day developers writing it but
framework authors may you opt into
writing in a little bit of C code to
maybe eke out a little bit of more
performance this is like some things
that were experimenting with with
glimmers and very high critical
performance scenario as we want try to
eke out as much as possible you got
enough performance as possible
awesome Jason did you have any other
takes on webassembly I just something
that came I'm like a total webassembly
knew but somebody came up over lunch you
laugh yeah I know the API it's about it
also I wouldn't trust myself to write
native code no so but one one
interesting area that got touched on was
for something like a polyfill for a
really performance critical feature
having the ability to write at least
parts of the polyfill and webassembly
could be really compelling we were
talking about Dom change lists if
there's you know difficult Asians or
something that needs to happen in there
or the creation of that that array
buffer if that's better done in C and
web assemblies available why wouldn't
you do it it seems like it'd be powerful
there yeah so our final question is is
not strictly going to do with api's but
we had a question around you know what
can we as a group do to improve
diversity in open source which i think
is a really important topic and
something that I personally love to see
us make some traction on Tracy
I was interesting your take on this and
you know I think there's there's a lot
of really great programs out like as I
made Google developer group organizer
and there's a woman tech makers
initiative that happens and it's a
really great way to sort of you know
bring woman developers together and give
them a safe space to learn I think if
you talk to women across women and just
everybody in general but some women
because I'm a female if you talk to a
woman in general you know everybody has
varying ideas of acceptance and
inclusion and what it should be and what
it shouldn't be so I think you know not
really forcing your opinions on women
but just giving them a way for you know
them to contribute the way they want to
I think which is also encouragement in
general I think in our industry you know
we have this diversity problem and a lot
of companies are looking for these
senior developers where when
you actually look at our industry you
see a lot of junior female developers
coming in and what we need to do is sort
of somehow figure out a way that we're
able to encourage these unit developers
so that we can build senior developers
and I think that's the biggest problem
right now that's the biggest disconnect
we have I agree with that Shaun you also
this is a problem that you you have some
thoughts on yeah I mean like if it
wasn't for open source I wouldn't be
here I'd still be like in tech support
or you know like just to you know doing
whatever and so it's like and thanks to
you know a little bit of my privilege
what why does this have to be a unique
story for for just you know myself
like we should be able to not only
elevate the opportunities for every
single person to be able to receive the
same blessings that many of us have just
by being involved and passionate about
something and so one of the things that
were you know that we've seen is that we
have specific outreaches for webpack not
only that's ban gender or race but even
just countries like we have initiative
called webpack Africa that we're
starting and a gentleman named prosper
if you haven't met him where's your
raise their hand maybe he's at he's back
there somewhere
he's helping lead that organization and
their goal was we need to prepare people
for the web for the next billion people
and so it's like that means that we
could have the opportunity to elevate
somebody to a whole new life opportunity
for the next million contributions or
developers and so like we want to find
as many as possible to essentially
elevate or provide more opportunity so
that these success stories don't have to
be unique they don't have to be rare
on that note we are out of time
please join me in giving a hand to all
of our panelists who are very kind
enough to take time out
