the show I want to talk about a little
thing called content security policy or
CSP
CSP is a JavaScript model designed to
prevent attack vectors in your
application in particular one of the
things that CSP outlaws is the use of
inline scripts in your HTML now if
you've been working with this in calmer
land for a while you might realize that
presents a bit of a problem because we
often design our elements with inline
scripts we'll put a little HTML on the
top then we'll put a little script in
the bottom and that'll be our elements
definition import right there so how do
we make sure that our elements are CSP
compliant well to do that we're gonna
use a little tool called crisper now
crisper is gonna do the work of
extracting our JavaScript out of our
element definitions so that way it can
work in a CSP environment and this is
really important if you're doing
something like building a chrome app or
using something like Cordova or even if
you're gonna use like a transpile tool
like battle to take your es6 code and
turn it into es5 now today on the show
what I want to do is show you how you
can get crisper up and running in your
application I'll start by showing you
the command line version of crisper and
then we can move on to how you can use
it in a build tool like gulp now to
start from the command line the first
thing that I want to do is just npm
install - G crisper so this is gonna do
a global uninstall of crisper and give
me that binary command so I can use it
anywhere I want in my my terminal or my
application once this is squared away I
can take a little starter project that
I've created here just as like a demo to
show off what we're gonna do I've got a
import file right here called elements
HTML and that's just pulling in a few
elements from my elements directory now
what I wanted to do is bundle all this
together and then extract the JavaScript
out of it to do that I'm going to first
create a distribution directory to hold
all of my my content once its output
from the tools I didn't wanna run
vulcanize which is our concatenation
tool it's gonna concatenate all of our
elements together into one big bundle
and then we can pipe the content from
vulcanize over to crisper so that way it
can take that one big bundle and split
it into HTML and JavaScript do you do
that I'm gonna use a little pipe
character at the end of my vulcanized
command
- crisper and tell it where I want the
HTML to live which is gonna be
elements.html until it I want the
JavaScript to live in elements dot J s
now it might seem a little weird to run
vulcanize and to tell it to inline
scripts and then run a whole separate
tool just to pull all those scripts out
again but we're actually doing here is
we're making sure that if our elements
depend on external javascript files we
can fetch all those files we can bundle
them together so we're not creating a
ton of HTTP requests and only once
you've got everything bundled together
will we extract the JavaScript into a
single bundle so this is again just to
kind of help us cut down on the number
of requests in our application now once
i've run this command i can go check out
my disk directory inside of here i've
got two files elements.html if i look at
that it's got the mark-up for my
elements but at the top i've also got
this elements of J's file that elements
J's file is all that code that CRISPR
pulled out from our application and
looking at that we can see that we've
got all the JavaScript for polymer and
if we scroll down the page we've also
got all the JavaScript for our little
elements that we've created x foo and X
bar and anything else that you might
have in your application so this is
great we've got Chris we're working in
our app but you know it's kind of a
bummer to run these things from the
command line every single time you want
to do a build or a deploy of your
application it'd be a lot better if we
could actually combine this with a build
tool like gulp so to do that I'm gonna
go back to my terminal
I'm gonna run NPM install gulp crisper
and I'll wait and await
okay so we've installed crisper for gulp
what I'm gonna do now is go to my gulp
file and this is a little gulp file that
actually started in a previous episode
when we're talking about vulcanize and
what I'm gonna do is just slot crisper
in right after the vulcanized task I'll
say crisper equals required gulp crisper
and then because gulp lets us you know
pipe the output of one task to the next
I can just rename this task to build and
actually pipe the output from vulcanize
right into crisper and then pipe all
that to my disk directories and really
that's all you gotta do to add crisper
to your build process it's pretty easy
I'm gonna go down and rename the task in
my default task from vulcanized to build
and then I can switch over to my
terminal
I can run gulp
and uh now I'm done I go back to my
application I look at my dist
directories and I've got elements HTML
and elements jas up at the topic and see
I've got my script file there and
elements HTML almost j/s all JavaScript
from polymer all the JavaScript from my
elements good to go so if I was going to
deploy this to something like Cordova or
a chrome app I'd be set and you know
there's a lot more that we can do with
CRISPR like I mentioned we can use tools
like babel to transpile code we could
use you know CoffeeScript and other cool
things so I'm gonna try and cover some
of those in a future episode if you've
