summit 2016 everyone I finally was able
to track down Alex Russell after giving
an amazing presentation yesterday we're
here backstage kind of winding down the
day but I did want to ask Alex a few
questions about his talk on progressive
web apps yesterday it was about building
really fast progressive web apps is that
right yeah I sort of spent some time
going through the real world constraints
of mobile devices because the way mobile
phones work is actually very different
in terms of the capacity and
capabilities CPU disk network they're
all fundamentally different than the
what we're used to on desktop so what do
you think about like the devtools
emulation like is that enough to test
just as a developer like I go in there
use the tools but I should be actually
testing on real devices yeah uh devtools
is getting a lot better about its
fidelity with mobile so for instance
you've had the network throttling in
devtools for a while but we're adding
CPU throttling now and that gets you
closer still but javascript execution on
a phone is often ten times slower than
it is on desktop and if you aren't
testing on a real device on a real
network on a representative network it's
easy to miss the things that can really
destroy the performance of the
experience that you're trying to deliver
I know there's other things like like
script parsing performance like all
these things add up over time Sam
saucony had a really awesome
presentation on that as well while I
have you here I do want to talk about
service worker since you're one of the
you know the spec authors a service
worker you've been working on it a long
time there's a lot of great stuff in
that in that API surface area what's
kind of coming and in the next couple
months it gets you really excited about
things that are changing yeah two things
I'm extraordinarily excited about
streams watch Jake's talk catches blog
posts streams are transformative for the
performance of mobile applications when
you're using service workers and
something that we're calling navigation
preload basically the ability to not
wait on the serviceworker to start up
before we go to the network for content
potentially so this is going to speed up
a bunch of the biggest sites on the web
that are using service workers today
awesome so your serviceworker is going
to get that much faster streams going to
make everything better will definitely
hit up Jake for some questions on that
later all right guys we're going to sign
off for now please join us on YouTube
and hashtag chrome dev summit on twitter
thanks
lot
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
