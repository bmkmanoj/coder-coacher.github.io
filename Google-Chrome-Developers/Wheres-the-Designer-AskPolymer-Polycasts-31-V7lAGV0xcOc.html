back to ask polymer the show where you
send in your hashtag questions and we
answer them our first question today
comes from Frank who asks will the
designer tool be back in polymer 1.0
that's a great question a lot of people
have asked me about it you might
remember the designer from some of our
older talks it was originally built as
kind of a proof of concept of what you
could possibly do with web components
and the original designer was never
really a production ready thing I'm
happy to say though that in one day we
are working on designer 2 if you will
but when I've asked the team for the the
ETA all they said was it'll be a long
time so we're working on it we're gonna
make it an actual production ready thing
but it might take a while for it to come
out so thank you Frank for sending in
that question all right our next
question comes from Dominic who asks can
you talk a little bit about the Safari
support for polymer so that's a really
great question what recently happened is
the WebKit folks have announced that
they've just landed support for shadow
Dom in WebKit nightlies so you can check
out this blog post over here to read
more about that but that means is
polymer should in the very near future
start running a lot faster in Safari
when that finally ships in their stable
version so hopefully things are gonna be
improving there really soon thanks for
that really awesome question Dominic
alright our next question comes from Rob
res who asks can I create a data binding
imperative Lee so that's a really
interesting question it's one that a few
people have sent me on Twitter I asked
the team about this and they said that
even though this is kind of a often
requested feature it's not something
that's currently supported in polymer
and when I asked why they said maybe
because they want to focus on polishing
the core features before adding any sort
of like additional fanciness like that
so for the moment that's not supported
not saying it won't be supported someday
but at the moment no you have to do
everything declaratively alright our
next question comes from Danny who asks
should an element import all of its
dependencies or can you just take those
imports and put in an elements HTML file
so that's a really cool question and
a lot of people are confused about this
because you can put stuff in an
element's HTML file and I'll seem like
the app continues to work but generally
as a best practice we recommend that any
element have all of its dependencies
imported at the top of its definition
and mainly because this ensures that
those other elements have loaded before
your element tries to register and and
use them people also wonder you know
does that possibly impact performance
but the way HTML imports are written all
of those additional imports even if
there are duplicates they will actually
be deduplicated so there's no
performance penalty there and if you're
using vulcanized it's only going to add
those imports once and it'll do it in
the right order so the best practice is
always have your elements import their
dependencies and you should be good to
go okay our last question comes from
Jose who asks can you declare Styles in
an iron media query and if not like
what's the point of the iron media query
element so that's a really good question
I know when you first see that element
it's a little confusing and not quite
sure how to use it but the idea with
iron media query is that it's mainly
meant for data bindings so if you need
to change an attribute or a property on
some other element when your page is at
a smaller screen size you can do that
using that element you know this is the
kind of work that you actually can't do
with CSS you would probably have to
write custom JavaScript to do that the
iron media query element just gonna let
you do that in a nice declarative
fashion so thank you Jose for sending in
that really great question so that's it
for today thank you everyone who sent in
those excellent questions if you
yourself have a question you can leave
it down in the comments or you can ping
us on a social network of your choosing
at hashtag ask polymer as always thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you next time
who asks can i declare Styles this
totally impressed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
