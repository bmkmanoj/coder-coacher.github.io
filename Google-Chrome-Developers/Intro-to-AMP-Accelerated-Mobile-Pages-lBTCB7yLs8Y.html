you expect rich graphics smooth
scrolling fast animations and
transitions all loading quickly and the
good news is that on a platform and
browser level we're making a lot of
great progress towards faster smoother
websites the bad news however is that
even with these improvements a lot of
websites still won't magically turn into
speedy experiences I mean think about it
for a second you had a bus station and
click on a link in your Twitter feed you
wait five seconds you wait ten you keep
thinking it must be amazing content if
it takes so long to prepare and write
then you get pulled back into reality a
full-screen interstitial asking me to
buy sunscreen I please like me dialog ad
set to scratch from the content and make
the page so small you can't even scroll
in as if that was enough a bunch of
competing analytic script in the
background at party hard every second
and kill your phone's battery or maybe
the analytic scripts just want to stop
the phone from suffering and put it out
of its misery quickly I really don't
know in all seriousness though all of
this wouldn't be such a big deal for the
publishers of those sites if you were
just willing to continue to suffer but
you don't your view is about the current
state so few is that you either don't
bother and click off and study suggests
a 40% of users drop off after just three
seconds or decide to install an ad
blocker clicking off is a lose-lose
situation you are frustrated because you
didn't get to read the article your
friends post it and publishers are
frustrated because they didn't get a
chance to show you other great stuff and
relevant ads to help pay to create that
free content and ad blockers might work
for you as a reader but hound the
business model of many publishers that
depend on ads to help pay for the
content offered but here's the thing
publishers obviously don't purposely try
to slow down pages they add all of these
extras to try to increase the
monetization of their site and attract
more and more readers to help keep the
site on business and then they end up in
this tough spot where they feel they
need to decide between improving the
user experience or focusing on
monetization and user acquisition these
overloaded user unfriendly websites
aren't a new problem and some have tried
to come up with solutions the first
our walled gardens that lock you to a
specific content distribution platform
now you have to implement a custom
solution for every single platform and
your content cannot be discovered to
search engines or linked to from other
websites by by open web or you could
create a native app and lose even more
advantage the web offers like effortless
entry without install or easy
distribution of content not terribly
attractive either we felt this was a
problem in need of a simple and elegant
solution a new way to implement an issue
a beautiful streamlined wicked fast
content web pages without all the extra
clutter it is built on the openness of
the web and doesn't try to replace it it
allows everyone to participate and
collaborate that publishes platforms and
developers all stand behind and benefit
from that's half short what accelerated
mobile
the EM project dramatically improves the
performance of mobile sites on the web
often to the point where their load
appears to be instant it's an open
source initiatives I realize on existing
web technologies and is built in
collaboration with many different
partners many technologies today come
with super complicated build processes
but not so with amp in fact an amp page
is just a normal HTML website with a
couple of restrictions and extras no
build process no extra step because of
that it doesn't require a lot of
additional work unlike having to build
custom apps and products for a myriad of
platforms and social outlets in fact if
your website doesn't use custom
JavaScript and is mostly static you
probably don't even have to create a
second version of it for amp every amp
document includes the MJS JavaScript
library that delivers optimum
performance by adding and validating a
few important rules in your markup when
looking at an amp document the biggest
difference you see is that some elements
like the image tag are replaced with
custom elements that's done to ensure
staying in Fastlane in two critical
situations first it allows MJS to
control the entire load chain and
prioritize certain elements and requests
over others in practice this means that
most third-party content and elements
below default
I'll load it after the main content
arrives so your users can start reading
as soon as possible
second ms custom properties strictly
require the width height or other aspect
ratio defining attributes to be set this
way MJS knows exactly how your page will
look like before any assets are loaded
and can layout the page in advance this
prevents the famous flash of unstyled
content the ugliness of a half loaded
website that then starts to jump around
by loading more stuff as well as the
need to re-render and do additional
layout calculations a browser tasks that
can be very slow every single limitation
addition to amp documents is carefully
designed to amp up the speed of the page
to 11 and implement rail a user
experience focus performance model but
the chrome team came up with and because
MJS comes with a built-in validator a
locks to the console the insurance
developer stale
as plain as nothing is more frustrating
than the speed regression you're
discovering month later on an end page
the content is always King and the user
experience is Queen no compromises if
you now say wait a sec sounds great for
users but how does this help publishers
consider this users love fast content
and amp allows platforms like Google
Twitter Pinterest or LinkedIn to know
for a fact that this content is fast
which they can then promise to users in
return if I know it only takes me five
seconds to read that article I do it
much more often with many more articles
I'm happy the platforms are happy
because I'm happy and the publishers is
happy because they get to show me more
content and just like that everybody
wins
