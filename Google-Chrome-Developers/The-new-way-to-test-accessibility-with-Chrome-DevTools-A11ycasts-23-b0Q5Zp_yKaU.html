welcome back to the alley cat show today
I'm really excited to talk to you
because I want to show you what just
landed in chrome dev tools version 60
that is the new audits panel so follow
me over here to the laptop want to bust
up in my dev tools it's a little site
that I've been working on and if you if
you haven't opened the dev tools and a
little while when you open it you might
actually see something like this so I'm
going to I'm going to run a little magic
command here to make this show up so if
you if it's your first time opening the
dev tools since chrome 60 landed you
just updated your version you'll get
this little what's new panel that shows
up and here we see a number of new items
that shipped in chrome 60 the one that
we are interested in is the new audits
panel which is the sort of like preview
report cards that we're seeing over here
on the right so if you click on that
link it will take you to the help page
which talks a little bit more in depth
about what the audits panel is and how
it works but so the general gist of
things that under the hood it's using a
program called lighthouse which checks
your site for a number of different
things so performance progressive web a
penis accessibility and other best
practices so you run that it's going to
give you this report card and you can
dive into each of those subtopics and
see if you have little areas that you
need to improve a lot so in my site what
I'm going to do is I'm going to close
this I'm going to click on this new
audits button right here and I'm going
to you see we got this sweet lighthouse
logo I'm going to click perform an audit
and there's a number of optional things
you can turn either on or off
I'll just have everything turned on for
this first pass run the audit and you'll
see that a lot of stuff starts happening
the second you click that button
so what lighthouse is doing under the
hood is it's checking the responsiveness
of your site so you'll actually see it
does like mobile device simulation does
network throttling so it'll it'll see
how your device does on my 3G or how
your site does on offline right so a lot
of interesting stuff they're turning off
CFS what does it look like then and also
testing a number of accessibility topics
now under the hood the way we are
testing accessibility is we're using the
act core library and if you remember
from previous episodes acts as a super
useful
we'll made by the folks at EQ which will
test a bunch of different accessibility
issues on any site if you if you haven't
seen this episodes by the way I will
leave links to them down in the show
notes you can catch up there but yeah
basically the lighthouse program works
off of axe core and now it's just
natively part of chrome dev tools so now
that the the report card has come back I
can see my score here and now I have not
tried to make the site a progressive web
app so I'm getting a very lowly 45 on
that issue but I think I'm interested in
today is accessibility so right now I'm
scoring a 91 which is not bad but we
could improve things a little bit so
clicking on that I can see where I've
got a few topics that I could tune up so
the one that I'm interested in is here
where it says image elements have alt
attributes or that they're missing
basically so I can click on this little
drop down and I'll explain a little bit
more about the error and how I can go
about fixing it but if that information
is still not clear we've also got a
little bit of learn more text so you can
click that to open up a doc and I'll
tell you in sort of even more detail
like you know why it's audit important
and how do you fix it what I think is
probably the most interesting and
exciting part of this whole experience
is if you click on View failing elements
here is sort of the the magic moment I
can see this element right here or if I
click on it it'll actually open it over
in my dev tools elements panel so that's
really one of the cool things that we
get from integrating lighthouse directly
into dev tools itself this ability to
serve hop back and forth between panels
so I can see now I've got this image
here I can right-click on it and say hey
let's scroll this into view alright cool
so now it is easier to inspect and know
exactly what I need to work on so yeah
I've got this this teapot here and I
know it's missing some alt text so easy
to fix all swap over to my code editor
I'll say like alt a vintage tea pot with
tea cups something like that I go back
to the page refresh and let's try and
run our audited to see if we have
cleared up that error so performance
audit this time I won't do all the other
audits so I won't do like you know
progressive web app or best practices or
whatever I'm just going to do my
accessibility checks it'll run a bit
faster so that's going to happen
okay so the results are back and I've
now got a 94 in accessibility I scroll
down a little bit and I can see that
yeah I still have a few issues but I
have resolved that missing alt text
error so yeah that about covers it for
today if you want to learn more about
the audits panel or lighthouse I will
include some links down in the show
notes also feel free to leave me some
comments down below as well or you can
hit me up on a social network of your
choosing
as always thanks so much watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
