fairly complex animations on supercharge
some might even say unnecessarily
complex so for example do remember the
slips which we built at the polymer
summit 2016 it looks pretty neat right
but what is actually happening whenever
you find one of these animations on the
web it can be interesting to see how the
animation was done but sometimes the
code is obfuscated and it is not really
obvious to see what is actually
happening and what is just sleight of
hands and your dev tools if you open dev
tools so you can open the context menu
on the right and take a look at the more
tools menu there's a couple of things in
there that you might not know dev tools
had one of them is the layers panel set
the animation speed to 10% and adjust
the perspective on the layers panel so
you can see the individual layers from
the side if you now play the animation
it becomes crystal clear what animation
is happening and in what order
pretty useful right so there you have it
some of the less discoverable features
and dev tools can prove quite useful
thanks for watching and see you next
time
one more if you do one more okay so the
deal is I need you to subscribe or watch
the latest supercharged video or they
won't let me go home
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
