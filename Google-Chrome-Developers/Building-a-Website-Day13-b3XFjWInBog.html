two also known as give the people what
they want in bonus round one I showed
you that we added notifications of the
site I said let me know if you want to
see the back end code and virtually
every comment in YouTube was like shows
the back end code now okay all right
well far be it from me to prevent you
from seeing the code you wish to see at
the moment the code is not on github but
who knows by the time this goes out it
may well be I just needed to do a bit of
tidy up and just generally look through
it and just make sure there's no nothing
in there like there's I'm sure you can
imagine there's things like a wharf
secrets and stuff like that for actual
authentications I just need to make sure
that none of that's actually gonna go
out unexpectedly so am I just tell me a
little bit longer to just get through
that because I do actually have a bunch
of stuff on at the moment there you go
excuses come as standard right let's
look at some code since that's what
we're all here for that's a really good
little motion right okay so to think
about the server side of sending push
notifications there's two parts that you
need to sort of think are firstly
there's them the master and then there's
the workers probably in correct
terminology i would call them slaves but
there we go i'm calling them workers so
you can see on screen i have the the
index that the thing is actually going
to run first of all and it uses nodes
cluster module which is really helpful
in this situation and what it does is
the first process the first node process
to run this code will be considered the
master and so I assign it the the role
of Master and then the everybody else is
assigned the role of worker and you'll
see what that means in a moment so
basically I requiring whichever role
you've been given and then I tell that
one to in it so both of these modules
the master and worker both have an in it
so I can just call it and it'll be fine
so let's look at master first of all
master is it has
really kind of two jobs one is to spin
up an express server so that there's an
admin interface which looks like let me
show you that looks like this and you
can see that we've got all the various
sessions and then there's the generic I
want to send any event updates it's not
the prettiest thing in the world but
it'll do the job just fine and dandy so
it spins that up as an express server
and the other thing it does is it
maintains a list of all the messages
that need to be sent so in the back end
when we click on the button and I'll
show you the code for this in a moment
when we click on the button that says
okay tell everybody the keynote starting
it puts the this here actually can see
this in queue here pushes the task on to
the task list and it will wake up the
workers to go and actually do that work
and we'll come back to that in butter
moment so most of this is not let
exciting perhaps let me just say where
where's where's a good place to Adam it
the in it you nearly that I called it
creates the workers as needed which will
have a look at animal and also in its
the server so the create workers as
needed function is here and I basically
look through the number of existing
workers which at the start will be zero
and then I figure out the total work
account minus the number of that we've
already got so if the work account is
right up at the top and it's based on
the number of CPUs available that means
that if I say you have a machine with
eight cause I take one off the length so
I basically assign one cpu to being the
master and running the expressive and
then the remaining seven would go to
running workers if I had 32 cores 32
CPUs it would be 31 for for the workers
and one again for the process the master
and I I default it to four so there's
even if I have a machine with one CP I'm
just going to run for workers and then
once at least a minimum of five node
processes so that's how that works let's
have a look at the server code because
there isn't
most of it's sort of what you'd expect
its kind of standard Express stuff
although what I do right the start where
are you I actually load the sessions
Jason from the site and I pass that
through to the admin renderer in order
to actually where are you ray in the
admin section to actually render the
admin so I get the sessions and then i
render the the admin section with that
and then that just that's just
handlebars just stepping through those
objects or works just fine when we
actually send a message let me go into
the the code for that this is in the
subscriptions area area it's the it's
ping and it takes the keys which is done
here yeah i'm using the web push library
which will link to in the notes i said
that in the last episode and i don't
think we did but i think we will this
time i'm using the web push library from
node and you can ask it to generate
vapid keys vapid is the cross browser
encryption keys that you need if you're
going to send a payload to devices and
it means that you can deal with Google
Cloud endpoints if your subscribers are
using Chrome or Mozilla endpoint if
they're using Firefox and vapid is the
cross browser way of you know encrypting
your payload and so you want something
really that generates vapid keys for you
because doing encryption on your own is
not that much fun and this does it for
me so i can create vapid keys and the
other thing you'll see around the code
here is there's this d s which is the
data store i'm using a google cloud data
store to store all the keys and the
subscriptions and everything else you
could just as well use mysql you could
just as well use MongoDB whatever
back-end data store you would make sense
in my case I'm running on google cloud
so why not use that makes perfect sense
and it is very convenient for me so when
we do ping we've already got the keys
because I generate those once at the
start and I store those in the data
store so that I'm not generating new
keys every time you want to have the
same keys keys the ID is the the it's
the slug the dev summit /schedule /
keynote blah blah blah because when
we're in the back end we can sort of
send to you know though say for example
those people and so that the ID that
target if you like is those the message
that we want to send will be the same
thing I it mostly likely be the slug or
it could be if it's the general send an
event update it'll just be some free
text or some emoji or whatever it needs
to be and then there's a link back to
the massive so I do a kind of dependency
injection when I in it the server you'll
notice here I pass in a reference to
master here so that it can it can ping
back ok so for argument's sake let's say
we've got a thousand endpoints
registered okay across a whole range of
sessions this retrieval filters them
down by those who just want to say get
the keynote or just get Jake's session
on the future of Service Worker stuff so
we filter those down and we get back a
bunch of endpoints and for each of those
endpoints as I mentioned it there is an
n Q function in the master and we pass
through both the keys the endpoint and
subscription and the actual message that
we want to send and then in my case I
also log the number of people or the
number of endpoints that we've pinged so
I can we can see in the back end oh this
one definitely went to like 300 people
or went to however many people don't
know how many it's going to be right so
the master thank you I mentioned it
before it put all it does is it pushes
the task on to an array so the master
has this global array of messages that
need to be sent it steps through all the
workers that were created and it pings
them it just sends this pink message
which will cause them to
wake up and then there's a bit again
there's a bit of liking for me just to
kind of go with the job started yeah
right now we get to talk about the
workers there on the other side of this
so our as I said our master is it's got
two jobs one is to maintain this this
queue and when we send we just basically
populate this queue so we let's say we
had a thousand endpoints 100 people
wanted the keynote so we'll fill this
array and it'll have a hundred entries
in it at this point and we ping the
workers to wait to wake up the on
message is where that then kicks in if
it gets a ping and it is sleeping it
wakes up and we call process next hit
next tick process next tick which is
kind of like set immediate or set
timeout 0 but it's a bit its proper neat
and tidy it's not set set timeout 0 it's
actually a night though there's a is the
proper node way of doing it is the best
way to say and they've optimized it's
not just like set timeout 0 it's
properly done apparently to call this
request task up so the request task
where are your is up here all that does
is it calls this send function which you
can see they're basically posts back to
the master and says I want a task please
so the Masters woken them up each of the
workers is going to come back to the
master and say I want a task please
which you can see down here on the on
worker message if they say I want a task
please we pop one off the end so you
strictly speaking might wanna on shift
and take the front of the queue I don't
I just pop the back off the queue I'm
hoping it you know doesn't matter really
ultimately the queue will get depleted
one way or another and it sends that
back to the worker says here's a task
for you one task off you go and do it so
the worker will when it's got a task oh
yeah you see if there is no task for it
to do the queue is empty the worker goes
back to sleep okay and we'll wait for
the next ping before it tries again but
assuming it gets given a task it sets
the vapid keys
it had from way back when and there's
also a URL that you give it the I
default the TTL to 30 minutes if for
some reason the message is you know like
a sessions about 30 minutes I think I
don't think we've got any more than 30
minutes if for some reason you don't
pick up that message in 30 minutes it
doesn't feel right to be like hey the
keynote starting now if the keynotes no
longer running so I'm hoping that that
will just mean that the message will
expire and we don't over notify and bug
people when they don't need to be
bothered and then we call the send
notification which is again a
convenience method on the on that
library which is brilliant and you give
it the subscription which will contain
the endpoint and the key some more keys
the message that you wanted to send and
if there's any issues at all I just kill
the worker and there is a in the master
if worker is killed there we are on exit
and on disconnect it will come back and
it will try and recreate any worker so
say for example for whatever reason we
had eight workers and four of them were
killed then we would create four new
ones here to kind of replenish and
always bring us back up to the correct
number so it's it's good and that works
just fine as well so what else do we
need to show you or do I need to show
you in the worker so hopefully based yes
hopefully at this point we've managed to
send a notification and then we go back
and ask for another task so as each
workers getting to the end of its task
it goes back to the master and says have
you got any more work for me eventually
that key will be depleted and the work
will say oh I've got nothing I will go
to sleep and it all then wait until it
gets the ping from the master saying oh
there's a new job for everybody let's
get through this now I like this
approach because of the fact that I get
to control the number of workers if i
decide to deploy something with 32 cores
or 16 cores or eight cores or four cause
it means that I get to decide how many
workers there are and how you know well
they'll always be one for the master
process
but this for me is good because if I
feel like this is going to be bursty I
could be like okay just spin up a load
of workers and just they can churn
through the queue they can go at the
same time concurrently or parallel eyes
they're different things they are and i
forget the difference in definition me
but they run at the same time when we're
splitting the workout and that's that's
under my control as to how many of those
there are can just have one i can have
as many as I need and that means it
works out really well for me so there
you go that is the the back end code it
is in JavaScript for those of you
wondering why it's in JavaScript and not
in Python there's so that for legacy
reasons the site is in python has and
it's always been in Python since I first
did it four years ago three years ago I
don't know I guess three years ago and
it's just always been in Python and
that's not a big deal but this I wanted
to keep separate I wanted it on its own
separate thing as a separate almost
service that I can spin up and spin down
for chrome dev summit independently of
the site so it felt wrong to me to have
something that is both serving the site
and handling notifications because if
pushing notifications if it sort of
becomes CPU intensive for whatever
reason I didn't want to jeopardize the
site serving in that process so it felt
like it just kept them separate and that
all works out well for me and the other
main thing and it is not insignificant
is that the web push library for node is
really good it's incredibly convenient
and it does the things you need it
generates the keys it will encrypt a
message for you and it will send it to
the endpoint the three things you really
need it to do are the three things it
will do just perfectly so the fact that
it's a well-tested robust library for
actually doing the push messaging
combined with fight that things like
express are really nice as well just
meant it was a very easy fit to do all
this bit in JavaScript cool I hope by
this point the code is on github if it
is you'll be able to find it probably
there'll be a link in the description
below
brilliant who knows if there'll be
another bonus round I don't know it
depends on how much more I get done
before chrome dev summit itself speaking
of which don't forget that you can
subscribe to the channel and as the live
stream goes live you'll get that
notification you can get actual
notifications we have talked about this
before dunno if you know you can get
those on the site so if you want to
subscribe to a particular session I
don't have any sessions this year but if
I did you could subscribe to that but
you can subscribe to someone like Jake's
he's got a session and I have it on good
authority that it's going to be another
good one from him but they're all gonna
be good so you should subscribe to all
of them good right thank you very much
for joining me once again take it easy
and I'll cut you maybe in another one of
these
