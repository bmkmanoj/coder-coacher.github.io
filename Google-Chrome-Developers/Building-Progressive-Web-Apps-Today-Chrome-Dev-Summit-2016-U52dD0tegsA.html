shout out to Katie O Connor on our
marketing team who put together that
video
she's a really terrific table really
reflecting kind of the state and what we
want everyone to be building today so
I'm tell Tran I lead global product
partnerships for Chrome and the web
platform team so that's just a fancy way
of saying I basically get to talk to all
you guys and talk to a lot of different
companies and sites about being early
adopters of all these new awesome web
technologies so it's great to hear from
Darren and get a state of where chrome
is and the overall web platform and now
I get the opportunity to tell you more
about progressive web apps and what's
happened over the last year so I did a
lot of reflecting the last couple of
days no no not about the other stuff but
but really about kind of where were we
last year at the same event and so I
wanted I went back and looked at some of
the tweets coming out because the
Flipkart team had just launched their
progressive web app we're really like
kind of pioneers in this space there's a
lot of buzz and excitement about what's
now possible for the web I really want
to echo Darren's sentiments about the
emerging markets really leading the way
here in terms of constraints leading to
a lot of innovation but I would say I
was a bit nervous about the success and
I didn't know whether it was going to be
specific to Flipkart the region will
progress the web apps actually extend to
other verticals and markets and I wasn't
sure if this was going to be a hot thing
for like a minute and then it would just
get like shelves away and so it got me
thinking a lot about toys so this is my
son and so he recently got a you know
refrigerated got a you know gift of like
refrigerator food and wanted me to build
a refrigerator and so I spent two hours
painstakingly going through building
custom shelves so that every single
piece actually fit so all the pieces
actually fit across all of these shelves
and I think most parents in the audience
would know that most toys lasted about a
week because it literally got shelved
and empty and he didn't really play with
it anymore
and it I wondered would progressive web
apps actually have the same fate so
would was the Flipkart progressive web
app a unicorn and thankfully that wasn't
the case
and so Flipkart continue to invest in
progressive web app technologies
actually just did a big refresh of their
site they also extended it to their
desktop and they've got tons of learning
this past year is a battle-tested
progressive web apps in fact they just
went through big billion days which is
the biggest shopping event of the year
for them in India and last year the
event was app only because they had shut
down their mobile web site and this year
with the Flipkart light experience back
in the web experience back they saw as
much traffic on the web as much traffic
on the web on mobile as they did on
desktop so it completely affirmed their
commitment to bringing the web back on
mobile and I think beyond Flipkart and
an aggressive web app so what we wanted
to see if we were sorry to see momentum
in the overall marketplace we started to
see that progressive web apps
organically came up as a topic at
various conferences so a lot of articles
about progressive web apps I have a
Google Alert letting me know every time
someone mentions progressive web apps
sometimes I get flooded and I want to
point to kind of three articles that
really illustrate that progressive web
app is actually broadening across all
industries so Smashing Magazine wrote a
beginner's guide to progressive web apps
a few months ago Business Insider wrote
about how pwace are blurring the lines
between mobile and web and then more
recently marketing land which is
targeted at digital marketers talked
about how the purpose of web apps could
be kind of the next biggest thing and so
it was really terrific to see that you
know both developers and marketers are
all interested in these technologies so
Darin talked about the importance of
your web audience being a worldwide
audience and we've seen tremendous
interest from developers globally after
a progressive web app dev summit in
Amsterdam this past June we held viewing
parties across the world and so these
are folks who actually came after it
came to actually watch together with
other Googlers and with other developers
in the region 17,000 developers showed
up across 35 countries to showing the
enormous momentum and excitement for
wanting to build with these new
technologies and my favorite tweet was
that there was a viewing party in
Bangladesh with
over 300 attendees they were so inspired
that they actually formed a human PWA
and then tweeted this out so definitely
my favorite tweet of all time so we're
seeing global interest some sights large
and small across many interesting
industries building progressive web apps
and so I wanted to kind of take a moment
here and just kind of talk to you about
kind of what exactly is a progressive
web app and then really tell you real
life partner stories so that you can
kind of maybe get inspiration for how
you want to go about approaching it at
your respective companies first of all
it's amazing to see the term progressive
web app take a life of its own we really
view it as a shared definition across
the entire web ecosystem and it's great
to see folks in the community continue
to contribute to what is a progressive
web app and so we wanted to offer kind
of our definition but obviously evolve
it to what makes sense for your site and
ultimately it's about radically
improving the web user experience
probably to saw this in Darin's hoc way
we want to make sure you understand that
your pwace are first and foremost about
improving your user experience making
sure it's fast reliable engaging for all
users and a common question I get is
wait does that mean I have to build a
native app a PWA and a mobile site and
the answer is no your web experience to
just become your progressive web app and
so that also means that your forget web
app should be index and crawlable just
like any other web site we've also
gotten a lot of questions about this as
well and so I wanted to just note that
we just posted an updated blog post from
webmaster central blog where we talked
about you know updated guidance on
building indexable progressive web app
so definitely check that out he just got
posted yesterday and so we want to let
people know that building building
progressive web apps is a journey and so
we wanted to just maybe offer up some of
a framework for how to think about
building a progressive web app because
people said I'm saying oh gosh it feels
so inaccessible this is like there's so
many things I have to do and so we
wanted to say you know think about it as
a journey you can start off with a
baseline with things like HTTP or web
app manifest file and a few other things
and then continue to add on more and
more features over time and so an
exemplary one is about pushing your site
to add more features get even faster
loading times provide a more reliable
experience offline and and even on flaky
networks so the good news is that you
don't have to track all the stuff cuz we
actually heard your feedback and we're
put together a baseline and exemplary
checklist of things to test and fix it's
on developers.google.com slash web
you're going to hear that over and over
again because we're really trying to be
better about having a central Google
resource for building on the web and
Aaron already talked about lighthouse
tool and so really think about it as
your personalized guide for a site to
becoming more progressive we're
continuing to invest in lighthouse and
it will get better so with the checklist
lighthouse along with testing on real
hardware devices your should be on your
way to shipping a great PWA so i'm not
going to spend this talk going into
detail about serviceworker and like all
the various api is there a ton of great
advanced sessions about that but I now
want to dig into the impact of
progressive web apps and why it's a big
deal for your users and your business so
we've worked I've had a really fortunate
opportunity to work really closely with
a number of partners across the globe
it's been awesome to have folks actually
share stats because they want to kind of
contribute back to the ecosystem and
talk about the awesomeness of what
they're experiencing after they ship
their progressive web app so I want to
run through a few progressive web apps
and different stages to really
illustrate the diversity of approaches
regions and industries so Darren talked
about Alibaba which is the world's
largest b2b marketplace
there so the scale which they're
operating is huge and he went over how
they saw a 76 percent increase in
conversions so I want to add one more
detail because conversions is great but
you really want to make sure that users
are coming back to your site time and
time again and so I want to talk about
how they saw an increase on iOS of
monthly active users as well a bump of
30% on Android and so the higher
increase on Android could probably be
attributed to the fact that their open
rate on web push notifications is
comparable to their native app again
just increasing their overall reach of
your user base and housing com is this
major growing online real estate
platform in India so seeing incredible
activity and innovation coming out of
India with flip car and then start
like housing embracing progressive web
apps and like most startups housing is
obsessed with how to efficiently acquire
users to gain market traction this is
probably not something that developers
think about but I bet you your marketing
team is thinking about how to bring in
new users and how much they cost and so
housing took a look at how much they
were spending to acquire an app download
versus getting user to come to their
mobile website so the first set I want
to offer is that cost them about $3.75
to get users to download and an Android
app how much do you guys think it's
costing them to get users to their
mobile website 75 cents 80 57 cents so I
want to pause and want to observe the
difference here and how much cheaper it
is to get your user to your mobile
website so maybe we're saying well you
know app users are usually more loyal so
it may be worth it but for that single
app download you can reach 53 mobile web
users so that's 53 potential
reengagement opportunities and housing
is operating with millions of users so
obviously trying to get more users to
the website efficiently is a no brainer
yeah people should take pictures of this
and send it to your marketing team but
it's not only about getting users to
your site experience you want them to
make sure that they're getting a really
good user user experience once they
arrive so housing was seeing faster page
loads as well as increasing conversions
and the housing folks are actually here
to traveled in from India and are giving
a talk tomorrow morning so definitely
check it out I believe it's the second
talk of the day so now I want to turn to
West Elm you know we've seen a lot of
adoption in other parts of the world and
so we're starting to see more and more
here in the US and so West Elm is this
modern furnishings company and it's on
its way to doing about two billion
dollars in revenue just a significant
portion of that is actually coming from
online they don't have a native app so
they rely on the web to deliver the best
user experience possible and as you can
probably see with community from your
own habits you're seeing a growing
number of users shopping on mobile
devices so we're gonna Q so I'm actually
going to demo an early beta that
they just launched yesterday so I
already have it on my home screen and so
one of the key principles or tenets of
them launching this was that they wanted
it to be a hugely immersive experience
and so here you're dropped right into
this vessel experience you can scroll
everything's super smooth you see the
navigation on top they took a lot of
cues from social applications so it's
highly visual so I can tap in here see
how smooth everything looks and I
actually want to go through an example
of when I showed my sister a desk I just
bought from from West Elm and so instead
of me kind of searching I just look and
say oh well I can just go ahead and just
tap I look at furniture
I see Home Office desks and as I'm
scrolling through I see oh there it is
there's the desk I had purchase and this
is actually how I showed my sister the
desk
I bought very much like a magazine like
experience and so this is the type of
user experience that we're hoping all of
you are inspired to build back to sites
and so this is where you know focusing
in you know we talk a lot about
performance and making sure that your
site is super fast but I think we really
think the Westin was a great example of
how to rethink your user interactions
for today's audience which is about
casually consuming and being inspired by
things maybe the user is not going to
purchase every time they come to your
site but but maybe they want to come
back and just browse in their few
moments where they have some downtime so
you can check out their early beta that
URL there now when I kind of now turn to
Latin America so info Bay is one of
Argentina's first major major
digital-only outlets it's a top
publisher with a strong presence
throughout Spanish speaking Latin and
we're actually starting to see growing
interest in Latin America for all these
new web technologies infobase primary
motivation was speed and delivering news
to users as quickly as possible and it's
no surprise 65% of their traffic is on
mobile and so they took inspiration from
the Washington
a progressive web app demo from IO and
they started working with the post team
and leveraging the Washington Post CMS
to really roll out their progressive web
app and we're seeing that the info base
article pages are loading in less than a
second
they're also caching content for offline
experience and so similar to what you
saw with what's the C net demo from
Darin you know this is really about a
smooth reading experience and really
what news should be and be resilient to
flaky networks as well and then I want
to talk to you about lift so we see an
adoption with v-tail and publishing
sites and it's great to see another use
case here so for those who are
unfamiliar lyft is an on-demand ride
on-demand ride-sharing network
it was app only for a long time and so
they wanted to make sure they could
reach users across all platforms and
obviously we've seen that reach and user
acquisition are critical so they rolled
out an M site I think there was an
article about rolling out their M site
for the first time a few weeks ago it
wasn't a PWA yet but it's just an M site
just to test the waters and they had
some internal metrics that they were
looking at and after a month they saw
five times more vibes than expected
coming through their mobile web so it
turns out that people are probably
wanting to book rides even before
they're able to download an app so
here's a gift of their user experience
and so after they saw that initial kind
of success with their M site they went
all-in and said you know we're gonna
invest in mobile web we're gonna build a
progressive web app and so their goal
right now is to achieve feature parity
with their native app so they launched
in preview yesterday right lift calm and
a team will continue to iterate and add
more and more features over time and so
this is about making sure they can
deliver a great experience for all users
regardless of what platform you're on
and so and they didn't want to actually
have people download app if they didn't
need to and yeah I want to point out
that they're trying to achieve feature
parity by also dramatically reducing the
download size they were gracious enough
to share some of their stats around you
know 17 megabytes for Android you see
the bump in iOS there and their
progressive web app is less than one Meg
and so the lift team has asked
here and we'll kick off tomorrow morning
with housing as a deep dive into how
they're building a progressive web app
and the benefits of being able to deploy
updates and experiment quickly for the
web so the the kind of the file where I
want to talk about stats a little bit to
make my trip so we're going back to
India
and making sure is the largest one of
the largest travel sites in India and
this is what's interesting here is the
make my trip folks really start digging
into kind of differences in user
behavior between the Navy native
experience and the mobile web experience
and so so for those of you unfamiliar to
India market like up to ninety percent
of users will uninstall the app in six
months and so for an infrequent purchase
like travel it can be hard to remain on
the user device so after being in a
market for a few months so they shared
some insights about what they're seeing
in terms of their user base first of all
half of their bookings on their
progressive web app are same day
reservations and not only are they same
day reservations but this number is
actually 30% higher compared to their
app users turns out that these are
generally last minute users they just
want to book right away and they prefer
to do so on their mobile website you
probably are experiencing the same thing
like when you want to get something done
you just want to get it done you don't
want to have to wait for for a download
and the other fascinating stat is that
in taking a closer look at first-time
visitors it turns out that their
progressive web app users or booking
three times more on their first visit
and so this really shows the web is
great at fulfilling the immediacy of
intent which is in this case resulting
in more bookings and so they're also
seeing that the destination cities of
progressive web the destination cities
are much more widespread for progressive
web app users versus native app users
indicating that people might be booking
once they arrive on site and they just
want to get a booking done as quickly as
possible
so really terrific staff and really kind
of giving us insights into the different
user behavior and so you know they're
gonna they still have a native app
experience and that will address and be
great for a specific audience and then
they're also building a great
progressive web app experience and so I
just wanna make sure
that you know I talked a lot about a
bunch of these companies seeing world
wide adoption and now I wanted to spend
it just a couple of minutes talking
about how to get started so you know
have an idea what you should be building
and you can see that it can have high
impact on your business but the toughest
part is figuring out how to get started
especially if you're part of a large or
Gore you need to deal with a lot of
legacy issues and so you have to take a
look at your different user experience
and figure out what you want to tackle
first sometimes you you can tackle the
entire site sometimes you can do a
section like scenic tech today they did
they end up shipping a progressive web
app for a section and if you're a larger
brand sometimes it's easier to start
with a smaller site to become familiar
with the technologies and then extend
out to your flagship so here I want to
walk you through a journey that The
Weather Channel has gone through of the
last year and I think many of you will
relate so weather comm is a top 20 site
here in the US delivering billions of
forecasts around the world across many
many platforms and weather's really
focused on innovation and new
technologies and became really
interested and seeing you know how they
could build a much better mobile
experience so their journey started
about 18 months ago where they had to
diligently roadmap what they need to do
and knowing that it will take time
they're a major site operating in almost
200 locales and so they had to
prioritize I think most of you are
figuring out how to prioritize
transition HTTP right now or if have not
already done it and we have a great
session later talking about HTTP 2 as
well and so it wasn't easy with ads and
analytics but notice it was starting to
get easier as more third parties we're
prioritizing HTTPS as well and then in
April they actually rolled out web push
notifications across 30 languages what's
significant here it's actually now 62
languages so they've continued to expand
what's significant here is in the first
three months of rolling out web push
notifications whether saw a million
opt-ins so they provided the same set of
notifications as their app users for the
web but now they're reaching a whole new
audience with web push notifications and
more recently they started looking at
integrating service workers and
transitioning more of their sites over
to progressive web app given the u.s.
site was more complex and with more
legacy they decided to tackle their
international sites first
and have now rolled out progressive web
apps in 178 countries seeing growing
traffic in China India and Mexico and
the weather team is constantly trying to
improve their overall experience and
they've been happy enough with working
with these technologies and seeing some
gains here that there are planning to
expand to a progressive web app for
their flagship us site in 2017 and I
think I really want to tell the story
because I think we hear a lot about well
I can't do it in the next three months
we can't figure out how to prioritize
but I think given some some of you who
will have legacy sites like you need to
take a step back and kind of roadmap out
what how long it's going to take and
what it's going to mean it's not
something that's going to be done
overnight think about it as a journey
and so I want to kind of maybe walk
through kind of the approaches to
building progressive web apps and you
know I've offered up a diverse set of
site to her you know at how they start
building PW ways and so we started just
noticing patterns and how people are
approaching it right so some folks are
lucky enough to just build new from the
ground up and transition their
experience almost immediately some
people want to ship a beta to kind of
test and experiment
rolling out to a small percentage of
traffic with the intent of transitioning
their main site over over time and then
some people are able to actually build
on their existing experience so
integrating api's indirectly and so
housing and CNET are actually two
examples of where they were able to
build new experience from from the
ground up and I think they are you know
that that's about that was the right
approach for them housing for the whole
site seen it for a subsection of their
site and for the beta you know as I
talked about with the demo with West Elm
you know they couldn't transition a site
right away it was gonna be and it was
tough to describe what this experience
could be like so even before they got to
a beta they actually built a demo and
then they showed it to their senior
leadership and so now they are going to
move to a beta early beta by the end of
the year then a public beta next year
which is a great path and then they'll
start to kind of move their site over
over time and left again is an early
preview this week and they'll continue
to integrate iterate and bring more and
more features to their PWA and as far as
existing size I already talked about the
The Weather Channel but make my trip
actually started first with their hotels
section of their site and then they
expand it to flight and now they're
going to continue to add other sections
to bring in to kind of the progressive
web app fold and so there's no right way
or wrong way to to build a progressive
web app I just wanted to offer kind of a
framework as you're kind of going back
to your teams and saying okay section
whole site new beta existing just that
you can get the conversation started in
terms of how to start building and so
looking ahead there's going to be tons
of you know great sessions today I want
to kind of talk about how progressive
Web Apps really is you know we talked a
lot about kind of engagement conversion
you know we don't need to know like
other marketing terms at the bottom but
kind of think about progressive Web Apps
is kind of this term for just improving
your mobile web experience and then you
know accelerate mobile pages it's also
great if you're having a lot of traffic
coming in from search and other
platforms it's a great way to get users
quickly to your site from the top of the
funnel and we're going to have an amp
and PWA session tomorrow morning where
we'll talk about amp installing a
serviceworker to transition to a
progressive web app as well as how amp
is using is being used inside of a
progressive web app that we get a lot of
questions about that and for some of you
push notifications it's like the the one
thing that you can do over the next few
months that's perfectly fine you're able
to reengage users so quickly like what
carnival did in and what darren went
through and then two things I did want
to highlight which are actually after my
talk this morning conversion is such a
pain point typing is so painful on the
mobile web and we've done ourselves a
disservice by not trying to do more here
but we are now and so seamless sign-in
and one tap checkout are going to be
great sessions where you can basically
just understand you know you're you know
get users into your experience build an
engaging experience and then make sure
they actually convert and and close on
them so it's really about radically
improving the overall web experience
this over the last year we've heard from
so many of you the excitement for
building and innovating on the web and
again this really is a journey and it
requires constant
raishin probably patients as you're
trying to figure out how you're going to
kind of construct your back-end to like
fit in with like the progress of web app
architecture but it's worth it and I
hope you see that today by just seeing
the enormous momentum and what people
are seeing in terms of success with
their various business metrics and so
speaking of iteration I talked in the
beginning of building a fridge for my
son that didn't really stick so I did
try again
so this is actually a hotel room key
because I was traveling a few months ago
and he was really upset that he couldn't
be in the hotel room with me and so I
built I took a shoebox and then I put a
little hotel slit and then he was able
to I bought my hotel key and now he uses
it every single day he literally closes
his door puts in the key card beeps and
it lets himself into his hotel room and
so he does it every night he's been
doing that every night for the last few
months and so with that I think that's
your inspiration for building great web
experience that people will want to use
every single day thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
