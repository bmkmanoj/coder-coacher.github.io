of news at Google and in my job I spend
a lot of time working with publishers
and partners around the world and it's
such a pleasure to be here at i/o with
so many of you here in this beautiful
and exquisite space you know not
surprisingly I'm someone who is I've
wanted to be on this stage my entire
life and as you've probably noticed I'm
not 27 so what's the lesson in that
don't give up don't ever give up Google
as you know is applied great focus on
people to use Google to discover your
content and your brand's we continue to
evolve our understanding of users and
their intentions and interests and then
connecting those users to the highest
quality third-party content and services
we're proud of our symbiotic
relationship with publishers and
enabling users to benefit from your
products
it's the web's rich ecosystem of
knowledge that allows products like
Google search to have relevance and
value and it's the open platform of the
web that allows publishers to easily
reach out to new audiences in that sense
I believe that Google and publishers
share a common cause we both desire a
rich and open ecosystem for media
distribution today we all have
smartphones in our pockets Smart TVs and
our living rooms and increasingly
computers on our wrists in our cars
woven into the very fabric of our lives
people come to Google billions of times
each day to fulfill their daily
information needs whether that's
catching up on the presidential election
finding nearby concerts or if you're me
discovering a recipe for a new cocktail
primarily these needs are fulfilled on
mobile in fact more Google searches take
place on mobile than on desktop the
mobile momentum as you all know is only
increasing by some projections the world
will have 5 billion people accessing the
Internet by 2020 5 billion people from
the coffee farmer in Kenya to the
high-school student in Tallinn to my
geekier friends here in this space with
a half a dozen smart devices we're
building search to meet their daily
needs we want all of these users to have
a great search experience so that they
can discover and engage with your
content if you're a publisher search I'm
guessing is probably a pretty important
source of traffic as the next billion
come online it's only going to become
more important but before I tell you
about all the things that Google can do
today let's take a step back and
remember how Google started remember
1998 you probably had one of these
sitting in your house you'd go to
google.com on this monster machine type
in a few words and you'd get links to
relevant websites at the time the
experience was truly magical the world
of information at your fingertips and
today that experience is still magical
we recognize that mobile is
fundamentally different than desktop one
can't simply port the same desktop
experience over to consumers phones the
needs of our users and their mobile
behaviors are so different today how
many of you have been on a desktop or
laptop since arriving at i/o maybe in
their hotel room you used your laptop or
on your flight here now think about how
many times you've checked your phone
today on average people check their
phone 150 times a day among those of us
in publishing or tech it's probably even
more we twitch with stolen glances at
our phones lured back to the device for
another convenient burst of digital
activity these shorts
add up we spend a hundred and seventy
seven minutes on our phones every day
almost three hours that means we're
having mobile sessions that average more
than a minute long more than 150 times a
day in these short sessions are
productive in the past year alone
websites in the United States have seen
a 29% increase in mobile conversion
rates we've completely rebuilt search
for this mobile always connected world
people want answers
instantly we're no longer sitting at
desktop computer surfing the web for
hours on end
now we're whipping out our phones in the
lunch line at the airport or while
watching TV we're searching for things
that are happening right now and using
many new types of devices let me share a
video that gives a quick glimpse into
Google's evolution over the past 17
years please run the video we're trying
to name Google we actually went through
thousands of the name of the company has
now become its own verb in the
dictionary let's Google looking Google
it the Google on the Internet simple
letters on a plain white page being able
to do searches in any language about any
country when you're putting in a
question they finish your question
before we have been working on
organizing the world's information our
goal is to digitize all the books say
Google announced Gmail email for
everyone for free Google is nothing the
entire world to make it more accessible
to people everywhere goal is jumping
into the mobile market Android was built
as an open platform for everyone to use
and build on this is crow it's a faster
safer browser for the open web Google is
unveiling what they call the knowledge
graph we needed to understand the world
the way you and I do as objects and
relationships between objects today
Google got another useful feature with
Google map we are providing you with
answers before you've even asked what if
my favorite cards is the one that shows
traffic data for your commute
to and from work think about how far
Google is evolved from the ten bluelux
we asked ourselves how can we assist you
right when you need it
okay Google call the Walker Art Center
it's not just desktops phones and
laptops anymore okay move it use it you
open and then that opens up on it
it watches with displays car consoles
with this way
okay Google let's go to the aquarium how
can we help you get things done in first
few steps as possible okay cool ok ok
Google show me my photos of Lucas with a
pumpkin but we have to remember we have
a long way to go this is just a tip of
the iceberg
it's been a fabulous 17 years we've
completely rebuilt search for this
mobile always connected world and we've
come a long way both in our abilities
our features and the way Google looks
Google has a few new moves to go along
with its new look and let me call out
just several recent launches with our
stories to read cards in Google now we
suggest new stories based on the readers
content contexts and interests since
many of the next billion users will be
on slow 2g connections we created
searchlight to ensure that users on slow
networks still get a great search
experience searchlight by the way uses
90 percent less data than standard
search results we also started using
mobile friendliness as a ranking signal
for mobile search results now searches
can more easily find high-quality and
relevant results that support great
mobile experiences whether it's our
election experiences or our health
results over the past few years we've
launched new features that feel right at
home on a mobile device and that's just
a start although the device landscape
has changed search plays the same role
it did in 1998 understanding a user's
intent and presenting the best possible
content you just have an increasing
number of needs needs that can be
answered by the content and services you
provide we're creating the tools and
features that we believe will help users
and publishers make the most of search
in this new world if you attended IO
sessions over the past few years you may
be familiar with features such as app
indexing the now API the voice messaging
API these features drive new ways of
discovery whether it's directing organic
search traffic to your app or reaching
users with third-party now cards today's
session is all about the new ways Google
can
help you grow your audience and your
business we'll discuss how you can
preview fresh real-time content in
search to drive discovery and reach
we'll show you how we're leveraging
accelerated mobile pages in search to
provide blazingly fast experiences for
all the great content you build when
your site surface is in search we want
you to be sure it loads instantly
because if it doesn't abandonment
increases and opportunities are lost and
finally we'll show you the new tools and
reports we've built to help you measure
impact and results let's talk about rich
previews in search of hazard a guess
that you're familiar with the image on
the Left standard search results since
the very beginning of search these blue
links have been incredibly effective at
driving discoverability of your content
and the growth of your business you
probably already know that by including
structured data appropriate to your
content your site can enhance its
presence on search and go beyond the
traditional blue links in this example
what was once links to recipe websites
is now much more visual much more
engaging
we call these Rich Snippets with simple
markup you present a more compelling
visual result with reviews images and
more when you look at these results
side-by-side it's clear that Rich
Snippets are much more enticing
to the user more enticing means more
clicks or traffic Rich Snippets help
users make more informed decisions with
a greater likelihood of user
satisfaction and deeper engagement with
your site it's a win-win situation
users get much more engaging search
experiences publishers get increased
discoverability and traffic to their
sites but we want to use markup to make
your content even more engaging to users
we want to take it a step further we're
beginning to roll out a new format rich
cards which makes your evergreen content
even more prominent on results pages
rich cards further enhance content
previews on search results pages if
you're in the kitchen desperate for your
next sugar hit and I'm always desperate
for my next sugar hit a quick search for
dessert recipes will get you a nice
swipeable carousel of mouth-watering
possibilities remember what I mentioned
earlier in these short bursts of digital
activity there isn't much time to grab a
users attention the more visual and
engaging the content the better for a
user like me I want to be seduced by
that lemon cupcake image and that recipe
I want to tap on it I want to bake it I
want to eat it a digitally driven burst
of culinary activity what are rich cards
first rich cards are built upon rich
snippets it's a further evolution of the
same idea previewing richer content on
search is good for publishers and good
for users instead of just links were
able to surface information about events
recipes and movies in a highly
compelling highly visual fashion just
like Rich Snippets rich cards use
schema.org markup to help enhance the
previews of a site's content a rich card
is a compartmentalized template of
information that can take on multiple
forms depending on where they're
displayed let's walk through a few
examples let's say you're waiting for
the subway on the meet on the way to
meet your best friend
who's a movie buff she's annoyingly
smart we all have friends like that
if you need to learn something about
great movies so you can be reasonably be
paired for the intense debates that
always happen when you hang out
you type best movies of all time into
search on the left you see standard
search results with links to relevant
sites that have top movie lists there
may be some great information on those
sites but you're not sure you can hear
the rumble of the approaching subway
train so you have very little time to
get smart now let's look at the right
side you can see results with a rich
card from Time Out New York City
you get a nice visual carousel with
previews of the listed movies lots of
visual temptation you've never heard of
Ingmar Bergman's persona
it seems impressively deep and
intellectual maybe your friend hasn't
either you tap on it and off you go to
the timeout in New York City website the
Eastridge cards can take on many
different forms let's say you have a
cooking website first you're rich cards
can appear as a part of a list of
recipes from multiple sites for example
if you search for pasta represent
recipes you might find mac and cheese
variations from Epicurious calm and the
New York Times I love mac and cheese and
I'm hungry for a taste test so I'll do
both second you're rich cards can also
appear as a list of recipes from just
your site on the right all of these
tempting waistline expanding recipes are
from the Food Network of course
tap on a recipe go to that site start
cooking users are coming to Google
billions of times each day with queries
just like these when a publishes content
appears in more places in richer more
compelling forms discovery opportunities
increase and those who click are more
likely to have a stronger intent to take
action to cook that recipe to an
attendent event to subscribe to a
premium feature today the rich card
program is open for recipes and is being
tested for movies in the future will
expand to many other categories of
results as well creating a rich cards is
simple and only requires structured data
markup markup your recipe pages with
recipe schema movie pages with movie
schema you get the idea
many of you have already done this
markup on your pages and then you add
item list markup on the list page that
contains all the recipes or movies we do
recommend that you submit a sitemap
containing the marked up pages through
the google search console this will also
help increase the discoverability of
your content
we're just getting started in this area
and we'd like to thank the publishers
who participated in early tests the rest
of the effort of course just made us
hungry for more we're eager to expand
the previewing of rich content
throughout search users are coming to
search for more than just recipes movies
or events they're also searching about
things that are happening right now and
I mean right now as in right this moment
not hours ago not 15 minutes ago under
the current model publishers have to
wait for Google to index your content
that means the freshest content isn't
reaching users at the moment that
matters most take a look at this chart
of searchers during this year's NFL
Draft at the start of the draft queries
peaked and remained high throughout the
event
these users reacted to the live event
and came to search looking to find fresh
information maybe they're on their couch
watching the draft on TV or sneaking a
look while sitting in a meeting at work
looking for the latest draft news this
is not unique to sports fans people are
coming to Google for real-time info
about all kinds of things the Oscars the
elections and of course
breaking news during the World Cup
searches related to the World Cup peaked
at over 20% of all search volume people
come to Google to find information about
what is happening now that led us to
think how can we surface real-time
results more quickly and satisfy those
real-time spikes in queries the question
kicked off the development of our
real-time indexing efforts instead of
waiting for your content to be crawled
and indexed publishers will be able to
use the Google indexing API to trigger
the real-time indexing of their content
users get access to real-time results in
search and publishers increase their
discovery and reach its an exciting new
area and we're just getting started
we've launched a pilot within the next
few months
and we'll roll it out to more publishers
over the next year as you know better
than I do it's not enough to simply
appear on the search results page to
grow your business you need users to
engage but far too often users are
experiencing pages that are awkwardly
slow loading we know people abandon slow
loading sites and those occasions end up
being lost opportunities plain and
simple
what publisher can afford that in fact
40% of people abandon a website that
takes more than three seconds to load
with every millisecond users have to
wait for a page to load they're more
likely that they'll give up and simply
go someplace else the experience of
reading content on the web today can be
painful we've all had these bad
experiences there's a slow loading web
page heavy pages - trying to do way too
much when the network connection or the
device simply isn't up to the task you
can almost feel the page straining under
the weight of the data sucking the life
out of the battery and bringing your
phone's processor to its knees all you
can do is wait and wait and wait and
then there's that page with the sticky
scroll you start to scroll you get
nothing
no buttery smooth scroll for you your
finger isn't strong enough to scroll
that page in the last but not least that
page that seems to fully load you think
it has and you're happily reading along
when all of a sudden a late loading ad
or some other component pops in shifting
the content you were trying to read off
screen someplace all you wanted was a
compelling read but apparently the page
thinks that you wanted to play hide and
seek an effective user engagement
strategy I don't think so
it was challenges like these
that were at the core of the initiative
that we together with three dozen
publishers and tech companies started
last fall
call the accelerated mobile pages
project the amp project is an open
source initiative that embodies the
vision that publishers can create mobile
optimized content once and have it load
instantly everywhere to the benefit of
their user experiences their business
models their destinies it's been amazing
to see so many people so many companies
come together and build a solution that
would improve the mobile web experience
for everyone not only publishers but ad
tech companies analytics companies
discovery platforms CMS providers during
the development of the project
competitors came together in the same
room and collaborated on a common cause
it was really inspiring to see this is
the way it had to be we felt it was
important that a solution be driven by
the industry not just a single player
this way everyone is invested everyone
can share their expertise and we can
learn from one another in order to
achieve the best possible outcome let me
share a video that I think captures this
collaborative spirit of the project
let's check it out those of us when we
first started playing with the web that
the great thing was that you could you
could surf you go to one site read
something find a link there click you're
off to another site is the single
greatest driver of innovation that we've
ever seen
thanks to smartphones everybody has
internet in their pocket but the mobile
web is really at odds with what
everybody does on the web which is surf
and browse and that should all be fast
and easy
right now it just isn't so this thing
which should be a source of utter wonder
is a source of frustration waiting
waiting not letting me scroll now it's
later people bounce so if the LIF the
page doesn't load within a couple
seconds they move on to the next page
that is the worst possible outcome for
everyone involved so Google together
with dozens of other publishers and
technology companies sat down is trying
to find a solution for this and our
solution was the amp project amp
is a fantastic industry collaborative
approach to make mobile web faster
you'll see the benefits of a LAN page
when you first go to one the first thing
is instant speed the next click is only
sort of like one little scroll away more
people will see us most people will see
our apps more people will be able to
read our content we love the ability to
style our own pages there's a great
opportunity for us to really look like
our brand feel like our brand with this
sort of open philosophy that it's
unfettered and unrestricted and you can
do pretty much anything you like with it
publishers can maintain control over
their own destinies control over their
own products control over their own
business models and the best way to do
that with an engineering project is to
make it an open-source project we feel
like it's really important that there's
not a gatekeeper between a publisher and
them reaching their audience the success
of the a project is not going to be
based on the leadership of one it's
going to be based on the leadership of
many you have a program that is common
to others you work together to find a
common solution so that's like all of
the sudden everybody jumping in and
doing stuff and then something comes out
which is great something that we've
needed to do for a very long time as an
industry this is the spirit of the web
at its best just give it a try show up
with a github page read the
documentation see what it would mean for
your pages we shouldn't be fighting over
what a hyperlink is anymore it's time to
figure out how to tell the best stories
you know those of us involved with the
amp project are involved in many regrets
because we love the web
and we want the web to be as vibrant and
healthy as all of us know it can be we
wanted to be fast and furiously
compelling we want to make the web great
again
it's really as simple as that can we
make the web braid again who was that
guy if some of you might have noticed
that a couple of people in that video
have moved on to impressive new
opportunities I think of that as another
demonstration of the power of amp to
accelerate careers ape is very easy to
use if you haven't tried it and its
underpinnings should be familiar to
anyone creating web content today we've
invited a lot of familiar friends to
this party amp HTML is HTML with a
couple of extra twists and tricks
javascript plays an instrumental role
via the amp javascript library and
within sandbox components that you can
build CSS continues to be at your
disposal for styling and we brought
smart caching into the model amp is
based on web technologies and web
principles we didn't want to turn our
backs on what makes the web the web we
didn't want to build entirely new
technology stacks instead all it took
was some imagination to smartly
rearrange the existing bits that were
already there simply stated it's just in
time loading of data just in time
processing of components just in time
rendering of pages and to be clear amp
isn't just about instantly surfacing
content on Google search or other
discovery platforms it's about building
fast elegant websites when we bring it
all together we find that an amp page
loads four times faster and uses ten
times less data compared to a non amp
page and that doesn't include the added
performance benefits when smart caching
and pre-rendering are brought into the
equation
like I mentioned earlier amp is an
open-source project the activity and
engagement we've seen has been
tremendous and inspiring over seventy
three hundred developers have engaged
with the effort there have been over
nineteen hundred code submissions from
developers the project has put out 88
releases so far about two releases per
week not bad for a project that's about
eight months old the velocity has been
incredible and I thank each and every
one of you who've helped to make that
happen from discovery platforms like
Twitter line Pinterest CMS providers
like WordPress and Drupal the dozens of
analytics providers and ad networks it's
been great to see the momentum behind
amp but the proof is in the adoption the
adoption curve is remarkable
we've seen a hundred and twenty five
million amp documents in our index from
over six hundred and forty thousand
domains from every corner of the globe
and it continues to increase every day
just like many publishers Google is also
making good use of amp earlier this year
we launched amp'd news carousels within
Google search on the mobile web and that
makes it easier than ever to get
discovered on Google search with amp'd
news carousels users can not only read
instantly loading articles but swipe
between articles that also load
instantly now I'm not a rocket scientist
but I know that we can't expand the
amount of time in the day but we can
help users consume more content in the
time they do have we're now expanding
amp both within search and across other
Google properties like the recently
launched Google News and weather app in
the United States edition over the next
several weeks we'll be rolling out the
amp experience to the iOS and Android
Google search apps as well and we'll
continue beyond that we're also working
to bring amp to new types of content
we've just started to experiment with
combining rich cards in amp when you
combine the two uses
in incredibly rich and fast experience
users can tap on your rich card and view
a recipe instantly they can preview more
recipes instantly by swiping left or
right within the carousel thanks to the
instant nature of amp we're launching
this experience first with recipes and
plan to support many other content types
soon ample also be part of the real-time
indexing effort that I talked about
earlier now let's take a look at the
tools we built to help you measure the
results of the features I've talked
about search console helps you monitor
and maintain your site's presence on
Google search if you haven't done it so
far we strongly recommend you verify
ownership of your site in search console
it provides many tools to improve the
search experience for your content we've
added a new report to search console
that will help you understand you have
implementation errors in rich cards
it'll even suggest which cards can
benefit from additional markup to use
the tool just log in to search console
and select the rich card report the
report will show you the overall status
for your site in this case you can see
the site has done a fine job and they
don't have any invalid cards they do
however have many cards on the site that
can benefit from marking up more fields
we mark them as enhance Abell cards the
report will also show you examples of
any errors down to the specific field on
a specific URL it can also guide you to
the updated structured data testing tool
the structured data testing tool allows
you to run a live test on your pages
this can highlight all the errors and
enhancement opportunities you have on
your cards this is one of the most
popular tools and is incredibly useful
for stamping out problems before they
occur you can even simulate how your
card will actually look on the search
results page by using the newly added
preview functionality it was highly
requested and it should make the tool
ever more effective
the IMP project by the way also provides
a mechanism to validate imp files in
search console we surface amp errors in
your crawled amp content to make it
easier for you to address any fixes this
includes the structured data
requirements for amp features like the
top stories carousel we also recently
launched an amp report that shows
impression click and CTR data for just
your amp content you can try the feature
today by simply logging into your search
console account go to the search &amp;amp;
Analytics report and filter to amp for
search types you can even compare how
imp metrics stack against other search
features like your search result links
amp is Benna a very fast-moving
initiative as I noted and we want to
thank the many amp developers who have
contributed not only valuable feedback
but code and helped us tweak the tools
I'm talking about here as the project
evolved for some hands-on experience
check out the sandbox we have members
from our developer relations and product
teams to answer any and all questions
and show you live demos that was a lot
to cover in a half an hour so let to
take a moment to recap what we talked
about today we talked about how you can
preview richer content in search for
increased discovery we announced our
efforts in real-time indexing to help
connect users with the most up-to-date
content you offer we showed how amp can
drive blazingly fast consumption across
the mobile web and how we're working to
bring it to new surfaces and new content
types
and finally we walk through the new rich
card and amp reports and the updated
structured data testing tool to learn
more check out these sessions that deep
dive into the event individual topics
and again if you're interested in
getting some hands-on time with these
tools what a review documentation please
stop by our sandbox and that you can do
any time during the rest of i/o
Google search looks completely different
from 17 years ago and that's the point
and as you heard yesterday and Sundar's
keynote google is continuing to evolve
all those search may look different
content discovery is still at the core
of everything we do whether that
discovery comes from the search results
page or the interfaces of the future
such as the Google assistant or a low or
Google home we want to make sure that
integrating and growing with Google is
as easy as possible definitely stay
tuned as we'll have much more to
announce as more and more features and
capabilities move from concept to
reality as I mentioned at the beginning
I believe Google and publishers share a
common cause I'm excited to see so many
people come together to ensure that the
next billion users can experience the
same magic in universal access to
information that we've all enjoyed over
the first 25 years of the web's history
I thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
