web team at Google in the first video I
spent a lot of time talking about how
progressive web apps are fast integrated
reliable and engaging in this video I'm
going to focus on integration so that
users can interact with your app in the
same way that they do with all of the
other apps on their device I'm gonna
focus on how you can get your app on the
home screen using the web app manifest
then how you can use the new payment
request API to simplify payments I want
to start by talking about the center of
the mobile users world the home screen
80% of users have intentionally moved
apps to their home screen up 5% from
last year the top factors for this
decision include how often they use the
app providing easier access the interest
in that kind of app and interestingly
how the logo looks on their home screen
you've been able to add a bookmark URL
on the home screen for quite a while but
the user experience has left a lot to be
desired it's deeply buried in the menu
which isn't always visible and on
smaller devices you had to scroll within
the menu to even find it then unless the
user was on the home page of the app the
link will go to wherever they created
the bookmark imagine bookmarking a
specific photo on a friend's Instagram
feed then every time you launch the app
from that bookmark it started on that
photo the bookmark title and icons
weren't easy to change and finally there
was no expectation from users that the
app would work offline many of those
issues can be solved with the web app
manifest the web app manifest is a
simple JSON file that you link from each
HTML page and tells the browser about
your app it gives you the ability to
control how your app appears to the user
on the home screen or in areas
where they expect to see apps what URL
the app should start at and how it
should look when launched when using the
web app manifest your web app can
control the rich presence on the user's
home screen with a shortened app name
and a variety of icons for different
screens you can also define a splash
screen that is shown when the browser
spins up and is shown until the first
paint happens it's automatically built
from the background color name and icon
the manifest is also where you define
the core URL for your app the starting
point for any app want you can also
control whether you show the URL bar you
can be launched in full screen mode and
control the screen orientation for
optimal viewing I use this in an app
where I display a piano keyboard
landscape helps me make better use of
the screen real estate that I have
finally on Android progressive web apps
behave like other native apps switching
within the task switcher the theme color
the app bar color representing this app
is also controllable the manifest is
supported by chrome on Android Firefox
and opera plus Microsoft has indicated
their support for it in the edge browser
unfortunately for Safari on iOS you'll
still need to use the traditional meta
tags so this is great but we still need
to fix that deeply buried Add to Home
screen action in some cases the browser
will automatically prompt the user or
provide an indication to the user that
they can add the progressive web app to
their home screen the criteria for when
the user is notified differs between
browsers in order for chrome to show the
Add to Home screen banner it looks for
three criteria first the app needs to
include a manifest that includes at
least the name short name start URL a
192 by 192 pixel or larger icon and have
a display property that includes
standalone fullscreen or minimal UI
this define
the core app level experience and tells
the browser exactly what to add to the
homescreen what the splash screen should
look like etc second it needs to have a
serviceworker that provides a level of
offline support we need users to trust
that these apps will work reliably no
matter what their network connection is
like and finally we don't want to prompt
users in a case where it's going to feel
spammy chrome checks to make sure that
the user is engaged so why are these
seemingly arbitrary requirements
necessary well we feel that progressive
web apps should offer a promise to the
user that they'll be fast integrated
reliable and engaging let's talk a
little bit about web payments the
majority of online shopping today
happens on a mobile device you can book
a flight order groceries clothes almost
anything and most of what's happening is
happening on the web in fact 66 percent
of mobile purchases are made on the web
rather than in native apps but sadly
conversion rates on the mobile web tend
to be lower compared to the desktop
mobile conversion is about one third
thought of desktop we need to fix this
we need to make the checkout flow and
payments easy consistent and seamless
today unless you have an existing
relationship with a site making a
purchase means filling out a checkout
form most of the problems that lead to
abandonment can be traced directly to
that form users have to manually enter
the same information every time they
checkout name address billing address
phone number pick a shipping method etc
it's slow and tedious now some sites try
and make this experience better by
splitting across multiple pages but for
users the experience is inconsistent not
only that but every site has its own
data entry and validation process and
different payment methods can
complicate the form even more our first
step to solving this problem has been
autofill the browser uses a number of
heuristics to determine what each
element is for and then automatically
fill it in with the users information
when it works it's magical but it isn't
perfect and sometimes it puts the wrong
information into the wrong element
autocomplete attributes are a
standardized way for you to explicitly
tell the browser how it should populate
a given form field the browser doesn't
have to guess anymore it knows exactly
where to put my first and last name my
address and so forth by using the
standard autocomplete attributes
accuracy is dramatically improved and
users are able to complete forms about
30% faster the nice thing about it is
that you don't need to change the
element ID name or anything like that so
it won't affect your code at all you
simply need to add an extra attribute in
this example we're collecting credit
card information the browser knows
exactly what each field is for and
autocomplete can work its magic we have
a list on web fundamentals of the more
common autocomplete attributes if you
want to see the full list you can find a
link there to the spec with every single
attribute autofill gets rid of the
manual nature of data entry and makes it
much simpler for the user however it's
still fundamentally based on the same
kind of existing checkout flow entering
a lot of data usually in multiple pages
the web checkout process needs to be
reinvented the current checkout
experience presents you with a form to
fill out every single time for users
though the ideal experience would be
that when it's time to buy they just by
site should be able to focus on creating
an amazing and engaging shopping
experience without worrying about
optimizing a long checkout form this is
where the new payment request API comes
in when it's time to pay the user just
Paes it's a w3c standard to eliminate
forms for users and standardizes payment
collection for sites it allows us to
request payment information and more
with a single API call the browser
simply acts as an intermediary
collecting the information we need in a
consistent way then returns a JSON
object to us with the results that we
can then use to collect the payment
let's see how it works when the user is
ready to checkout they click the
checkout or Buy Now button which invokes
the payment request API where you
specify what data you need and show the
payment request UI within this UI the
user can quickly provide the necessary
information for example shipping details
if you need them the shipping method
again only if you need it and their
payment method the payment method can be
credit cards or one of the apps that are
installed on their device such as
Android pay and finally they click pay
and it's time for you to process the
payment information the payment request
API is designed to be flexible and fit
your payment flow if you only need
payment info no problem if you need
payment and shipping it can handle that
too it's supported today in Chrome and
both Microsoft and Firefox are actively
working on it
to be clear the payment request API is
not a new payment method we're not
trying to build a Chrome pay or become a
payment processor gateway or anything
like that
you still need to collect the payment it
just simplifies the information request
then returns a JSON object with the
results with the payment request API
checkout forms are eliminated making the
entire checkout process lightning fast
and since the browser is actually taken
care of collecting the payment
information from the user we go from end
taps to one tap let's take a look at the
checkout flow using the payment request
API to show the checkout flow we need to
create a new payment request object
and pass three parameters payment
methods transaction info and a set of
options we need to tell the payment
requests all the ways that we can get
paid for example what credit cards we
accept and if we accept Android pay or
not the transaction details include the
core details of the transaction how much
money what currency and what list items
you want displayed keep those line items
fairly high level it isn't meant to be
used as an itemized receipt and finally
keep in mind the payment request API
doesn't do math so you'll need to add
everything up yourself adding shipping
methods is optional by default payment
requests will only return payment info
and for some merchants that all they
need but you may need more setting these
options allows you to customize the flow
and collect the info that you need for
your flow we're now ready to show the
payment request interface with the dot
show method the browser then determines
the intersection of payment methods
supported by the site and payment
methods that the user has and shows the
payment interface once the user hits pay
the dots show method responds with a
promise returning a payment request
object the payment response object
contains everything needed to submit a
payment for credit card payments the
response is standardized and contained
cardholder name card number expiry month
expiry year card security code and
billing address for non credit card
payments for example Android pay the
response will be documented by the
provider we can then send that
information to our payment processor to
collect the payment the UI will show a
spinner while this request takes place
then once the payment has been collected
the complete method tells the browser
the payment is complete and allows the
app to notify the user of the result and
close the payment interface and that's
it
you now have a seamless easy-to-use
checkout experience okay quick summary
make it easy to complete forms by
providing the right set of autocomplete
attributes that enable autofill
progressively enhance your checkout
experience with the payment request API
and of course there are plenty more ways
that you can provide an integrated
experience for example if you're a media
app using the media session API to show
what's playing and handle media related
events from the user using the
presentation API to cast to the screen
of a presentation device sharing content
to other installed apps via the native
sharing widget and more as you build
your app remember users expect to be
able to interact with your app in the
same way that they do all of the other
apps on their device check the
description for links to the slides from
this video and some of the other links
that I shared up next we'll dive into
service workers and the key concepts
behind building reliable experiences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
