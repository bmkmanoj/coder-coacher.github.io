Thompson and I'm a product manager on
the web platform team I work on v8 and
dev tools and web assembly and today I'm
going to talk a bit about JavaScript and
v8 and webassembly - so what is v8
well v8 is an engine it's part of Chrome
and it runs javascript in web pages so
the v8 team has a simple mission it's
right here it's to speed up real-world
performance for modern JavaScript and
enable developers to build a faster
future web so really there's just two
things we care about we care about
making JavaScript fast that's already on
the web and then we care about making it
easier to write performant JavaScript
and that's things like our language
efforts and standardizing new parts of
the Xmas crypt language so what is what
do we mean by real-world web like what
is the real world web well
the real world web is different for
everybody it's whatever sites you are
most likely to visit whether it's the
onion New York Times pictures of cats
these are the things that people browse
most frequently so in our testing or in
order to try to benchmark v8 and and
come up with a workload to drive our
optimization strategies we wanted to
make sure we understood what this real
world what web was and what the
performance characteristics of it were
so we set out to pick a variety of sites
we call them internally just top 25
sites they're not necessarily the top 25
and the Alexa ranking but they're
they're trying to be a representative of
variety of different types of sites
different content and most importantly
from around the world
fun fact internally we actually use
Taylor Swift's Web Twitter page as the
Twitter example so so there's a variety
of sites we we use and the reason we
have ended up here where we're actually
measuring the performance of v8 against
real webpages is is not sort of obvious
it took us a while to get to this stage
where we're actually using real websites
to measure performance here's a here's a
simplified history of of how we measured
performance on v8 the first error sort
of at the very beginning most JavaScript
VMs used micro benchmarks to measure the
performance of code now micro benchmarks
test individual language features in
isolation so you might run a loop to
push an element to an array 10,000 times
that's a micro benchmark it just tests a
rate push now this is fiest for a while
but we quickly realized that measuring
things in isolation in a vacuum didn't
necessarily yield performance
optimizations that translate it to real
applications or real code bulkier code
so the next era was really static test
Suites things like octane you might
recognize the name of that benchmark
now octane is more representative than a
micro benchmark because it includes real
code octane includes a Gameboy emulator
actually and a ray tracer so this is
real code that the people have written
but benchmarks like octane are static so
we have an updated octane since we
released it and in addition not all
websites run rate tracers so as I
mentioned earlier you know Taylor
Swift's Twitter page does not have a ray
tracer embedded on it so this third
arrow was necessary because we realized
in addition to the previous workloads
that we use to measure performance we
needed we needed something that was even
closer to what users found when they
browsed every day another way to think
about this is that the sophistication of
your performance measurement strategy is
probably inversely correlated with the
distance from your target so if you're
starting out and optimizing a
performance problem and you
our four or five or eight times slower
than where you need to be a quick and
dirty workload like a micro benchmark
could be all you need to just close the
gap a bit but as soon as you start
hitting or getting closer and closer to
your target or closer and closer to the
optimal performance of something the
importance of how representative your
workload is raises drastically and
that's why we find ourselves you know
moving beyond an era where micro
benchmarks sufficed and even static test
Suites like octane and trying to measure
against real websites so what what sort
of insight do we glean from measuring
websites
well we instrumented v8 so that we could
see where it's spent time this is where
it spent time in the v8 engine when
loading the following websites for
example we've run more websites as well
but but this was just a sampling and you
can see here that we have a really
detailed insight into what parts of the
compiler and what parts of the VM
contribute to the load time of pages
like this and this helped us change some
assumptions we made about where we
should spend our time you can see here
that a lot of websites run compiled
JavaScript or at least a lot of websites
take you know a portion of the the
actual load time running compiled
JavaScript and there's a bunch of other
parts of the VN j'en that contribute
even more to the total page load so this
was an insight that came from moving
beyond static benchmarks and from
looking at actual websites and has
really driven our optimization in the
last year or so so I'm happy to announce
actually that we've improved the median
page load for the top 25 for these top
25 websites we measure by 5% which in
some sense seems like a small number but
if you think about how long chrome has
been optimizing page loads and if you
multiply that savings across every time
that somebody around the world access is
one of these sites 5% is huge it's a
it's a large incredibly large savings
and the improvements on some pages were
even higher than that median Facebook
YouTube Wikipedia Instagram and
discourse also big performance
improvements and most of these came from
improvements in the runtime and in the
parser not necessarily our optimizing
compilers and I mentioned that that
static test suites were you know not as
representative as real webpages but
sometimes they can be useful and in fact
we look at all of these types of
workloads when we're when we're working
and the speedometer benchmark even
though it's a static test suite actually
Maps quite closely onto these real wild
websites because what it's doing is it's
measuring the performance of frameworks
things like react angular ember and we
were happy to see that the performance
work we did for the real web sites
correlated to super domitor and so as of
in the last six months we've improved
speedometer performance by 15 to 25
percent depending on the device so
that's performance but there's many
aspects to you know making JavaScript
run efficiently on a computer or a phone
and in particular the memory consumption
of v8 matters a lot especially on
low-end devices so these are memories
with less than 512 megabytes of memory
and in fact the the number of these
devices out in the wild is is incredibly
large so we focused on reducing the
memory footprint on these devices and in
particular and actually reduced Chrome's
overall memory consumption by 35% by
tweaking the heuristics we use and the
trade-offs we make in the heap size and
zone memory route so that's a big number
another brief engine update we've talked
i've talked previously about the
different parts of v8 there's an
optimizing compiler there's a baseline
compiler well we have been hard at work
introducing an interpreter to v8 now you
might be thinking an interpreter isn't
that supposed to be slower than an
optimizing compiler or a jitang compiler
well an interpreter has a benefit which
is that it has a lower men
memory footprint then an optimizing
compiler which has to compile all
JavaScript into into native code and in
addition that the interpreter is a
simpler piece of software so it's easier
to make optimizations with this
simplified execution pipeline and we can
also choose we don't have to use the
interpreter always we can choose sort of
how we tear up to full speed so adding
the indignation interpreter actually
brought sizes memory savings but in
addition it allowed us to make some
improvements which made es6 generators
almost three times faster so this we're
excited that this is showed real wins
already so let's talk about es6 features
or es2015 and and beyond v8 supports es6
es 7 and parts of yes 2017 or things
that haven't been actually formalized
into an ex-minister acro script standard
yet and this is these this slide doesn't
properly capture just how large of an
update to the javascript language these
iterations were so if you've been
programming or you know using ES 5 and
below it's definitely time to take a
look at the powerful features and the
idiomatic features that these language
updates bring it's also time if you look
at the can GAC's compatibility table a
lot of browsers have support for these
features so if you're using babel or
another transpiler it may be time to
start considering whether you can turn
off translation of features too and and
your whether your users have support for
them so i'd also like to announce and
this is something that we've been
spending a lot more time on is how v8
embeds in the note and note i think paul
talked a lot yesterday about how many
developers are full stack developers and
the browser JavaScript environment is
just half of the javascript environments
that you care about so as of node 7 all
of these features are available by
default with the exception of async
await which will be
in the next major node version and we've
also been working on the performance of
individual JavaScript features and you
can see here that we've we've been
working on things like spread generators
for of arrays and destructuring and all
of these were getting closer and closer
to to our optimal performance there as
well as built-ins like object.create
function.prototype.bind array.prototype
push these are things which are used all
the time and and framework heavy coat
and and otherwise but I want to focus on
one feature in particular which we
launched recently this is async await
and this has been one of the most
frequently requested features and most
eagerly anticipated features of all of
those language features on the previous
slide and that's because this code
should look very familiar to JavaScript
is inherently asynchronous and it's very
very easy to end up in callbacks OOP so
async and await our primitives which
when combined with promises can turn
code like this into code like this which
looks like the synchronous code you
might run or write in another
environment so ASIC and await bring
readability they bring debug ability and
they make it a lot easier to write
asynchronous code in a style that Maps
more on to the synchronous way that you
might think about what your application
is trying to do so I'd like to give a
brief demo right now and I'm actually
working on a little site that looks kind
of like Pinterest so let's let me make
these a little bit bigger here okay and
what I want my site to do is let me see
if I can make this source even bigger
there okay people read that a little bit
so what I'm trying to do is I want to
cite that loads on a mobile device run
on a port network very quickly with
small thumbnails of the images before it
loads the full res versions so I've gone
in my network tab actually in dev tools
and I've throttled the network down to
for G which actually is still quite fast
but I think it'll be enough to see the
effect are going for here and when i
refresh now you can see that I'm loading
in these blurred thumbnails and then as
the full images get downloaded I'm
replacing them into the page now for the
sake of this demo to show you
async/await I've used the fetch API
which definitely is overkill and is
quite contrived but what demo is not a
little bit contrived so you can see here
I'm fetching a thumbnail and fetch is an
API which turns promise so traditionally
the way that you would handle this is
using a dot then I'm decoding the
response into a binary blob and I'm
taking that blob and creating a URL
which I am insert into some HTML and
insert into the page then after that's
done I am fetching the full version of
the image and taking the async fetch API
getting a promise back converting the
response to a blob and then inserting or
updating the source of my image tag
removing the thumb class which is the
thing that that blurred so you can see
here a pretty simple structure I'm just
inserting them into this disk grid I
have so this code is not terribly hard
to understand but it seems pretty four
boasts for what I'm doing and it's not
quite clear to me that waiting for each
of these previous then bodies to finish
before executing the next ones is quite
what I want to do and I think that by
converting this to async await we may be
able to make some optimizations so how
do you use async wait well a weight is a
keyword which waits for a promise to
resolve before the the statement ends
but it doesn't block the threat so the
browser has an event loop and the reason
that JavaScript is so heavily relies on
asynchronous code is because Java the
browser doesn't block on IO so it's very
important that even though your code
might look synchronous in a single
weight helps it do that it's important
to remember that under the hood
waiting for a fetch the promise returned
by the fetch API to resolve doesn't
necessarily block the main thread and
that's really the power of async await
so how do we do this well I'm gonna do
one thing first
and that's that is I'm gonna take these
snippets of code that are creating these
HTML tags I'm just gonna make them their
own function so let's do this will be
insert thumbnail and I'm gonna take in
my image which is the the string there
the name and use that as an ID that
needs to be an ID on the HTML so I'll
take that as an input and then it takes
a blob too so let's see that should
should work there and then I can replace
this with insert thumbnail and image
blob great and I'm do the same for this
other code which takes my full
resolution image and replaces the the
source of a particular image tag so
let's make a function do that say update
thumbnail and that also takes the image
name so confined the HTML object or the
HTML element and the blob which it
inserts there okay so that makes things
a little bit easier to see already all
right and let's make sure that things
still work yep they do okay perfect so
the first thing I'm going to do here is
all the awake keyword if it appears in a
function needs there needs to be some
indication to the browser that the
function is has awaits inside of it or
that it is it is following this other
model of programming so we use the async
keyword to to dictate that a function is
gonna have a weights inside of it so
usually the async keyword just goes
before the the function keyword but in
this case because we're using es6 arrow
notation here you can also put the async
keyword right in front of
the parameters to your error function so
this is an async function now and
instead of taking a promise chain here
I'm gonna go ahead and write Const
response and this is the first of two
responses a wait fetch so what does this
do well what this does is when this line
executes is the fetch API which take
returns a promise immediately but the
promise doesn't resolve until the
network requests for the image goes
through this line will actually await
the resolution of that promise before
assigning it to the response constant
but as I mentioned earlier won't block
the main thread while it does this so
the code is as asynchronous as it was
before but to a reader is a single line
of sort of synchronous code so this is
incredibly powerful to to continue down
the line we sort of do the exact same
thing with all of those then those then
chains so let's go ahead and quickly
write this out and I'm gonna take my
blob here actually going to call it
thumbs just we can remember that this is
a thumbnail and this is awaiting a
response one blob great and after that
actually then I can just insert my
thumbnail with image the name of my
image and the thumb block okay
so already I've gotten rid of all of
this code into these couple lines which
just look and make a lot more sense when
you're reading through things okay let
me just quickly do the exact same thing
I'm gonna copy paste this and this is my
second response and this is for the full
image and I'm getting back the full blob
from this which I'm inserting rather
than inserting I'm updating my thumbnail
okay
so let's quickly see if this does what
we expect
and does okay so you can see here that
we've we've removed all of this code
with the then the then chains and the
den callbacks and turned it into six
lines of what looks like synchronous
code but is really as I mentioned
asynchronous under the hood now there's
one extra thing to show here in my
promised Chen like chain I caught errors
at the very end now the way to do that
in a sink and a weight code is as you do
it in synchronous code you just insert a
try block around what you want to try to
run without errors and you catch any
errors if they come out at the other
side so that looks and and reads just so
much cleaner than before all right let's
make sure that runs and we've
successfully converted promise based
then code to async await so you can see
how powerful this is but by converting
things to async await we also sort of
can potentially better see a problem
with this and that is if we go to the
network tab we can see that my all of my
mini thumbnails here so those are those
are these first 11 lines they all finish
before my full resolutions get fetched
now why is that well if we look at the
code it's because we're waiting on the
first fetch to finish before we kick off
the fetch of the next function so that's
a problem I want to actually I might as
well be fetching both resources at the
same time rather than waiting for one to
finish before I kick off the next one so
this isn't this is one time where async
await has a little bit of a quirk and
that is that what you really want to do
here is kick off the fetches and a wait
excuse me and and and keep track of the
promises that they return appear and
then await the resolution of the promise
in the proper place and this synchronous
order because I I do fundamentally need
to insert the thumbnail before I order
before I update it
but if we if we do things like this
instead of instead of awaiting them in
line then the fetch the fetch actually
kicks off right when those right after
those first two lines complete and I'm
not blocking or are waiting on the
resolution of that promise until the
right time in line so let's make sure
this still works it does and you can see
now that the make sure this is working
it's hard to see from the waterfall but
I believe that the the kicking off of
the first full resolution is no longer
blocks on finishing the download of the
thumbnail so that's an important thing
to remember sometimes you want to kick
off the promise before you await its
resolution either way I hope you can you
can sort of see that this code is a lot
easier to write reason about and
understand than the previous code and so
if you're using promises at all
absolutely you should take a look at
updating your code to take advantage of
a single weight and a single weight is
supported in Chrome Canary and will be
in an upcoming release the next release
so let's wait to the slides
okay so async await very very cool
feature and it just really simplifies
the writing of code so we talked a lot
about JavaScript but I want to move now
to something that's a bit more on the
horizon but promises really really
powerful a really powerful tool for you
as developers so web assembly is a cross
browser plugin free low-level language
that makes it easy to run native code in
the web so there have been previous
efforts to do something like this flash
you might even remember Java applets in
the far distant past but each of those
was encumbered by particular
difficulties and webassembly is the
first cross browser open standards-based
so Lu
so we're really excited that we're off
to a good start in the standardization
of web assembly now what are the
benefits of web assembly well web
assembly is a binary format so it's much
smaller over the wire than textual
equivalent you may be familiar with
Azzam j/s which tries to achieve some of
the same goals but by using a backwards
compatible JavaScript syntax so web
assembly is small from the start because
it's its own binary format and it's fast
and webassembly you're dealing with
memory and performing operations on
numbers and in 32 s and 62 s float32
float 64 is in memory rather than
dealing with higher-level JavaScript
primitives which have their own you know
runtime associated with them so web
assembly is fast and it's near native
performance and as I mentioned it's low
level so it's possible to compile C and
C++ to web assembly and we're really
excited about this because we think web
assembly will unlock a new class of high
powered apps if you thought it wasn't
possible to run a Photoshop equivalent
in the browser it definitely is
something that webassembly would be
capable of of running so web assembly is
designed to enable sort of high
performance computing and unlock things
not just games but media applications
and other things which traditionally
have taken too much you know raw compute
power to run effectively in JavaScript
so we have a demo on web assembly org of
an angry BOTS game the angry bots game
running is actually a Unity game that
was compiled to web assembly and you can
see that the performance is a lot
smoother than even the Asma Jas
equivalent and I definitely encourage
you to check it out and web assembly is
already implemented behind a flag in
Chrome Firefox and edge so this demo
runs in more than one browser but today
I want to talk about how you as a
JavaScript developer might take
advantage of web assembly
without digging into C and C++ or
bringing out a compiler to compile web
assembly and that's because we think web
assembly is also going to unlock a
really interesting functionality which
might just be in a library so you might
be writing a traditional JavaScript web
app and just use a web assembly module
to perform some functionality which is
computationally intensive so if you're
writing a progressive web app that
encodes and decodes JPEGs you could just
unload off load excuse me the encoding
and decoding of the jpg file to a web
assembly module and write all of the
rest of the application the user
interface and you know that whatever the
features you have in JavaScript so web
assembly was created from the beginning
to play well with JavaScript and
interact just alongside of it so just to
give you a brief demo of this this is is
far from an angry BOTS game but I wanted
to show you that as a JavaScript
developer if you receive a web assembly
module you don't have to really
understand native code or C or C++ to
still use it so I've got I've got a
weapon in an HTML page here that right
now is just using this this web assembly
API because it's exposed to JavaScript
the way you start and run web assembly
is by calling a JavaScript API so it's
gonna load this web assembly module and
instantiate it which is what we have to
do to run it so let me quickly switch
over my server and let's take a look at
what this looks like ok so so so briefly
before I forgot the other important
thing here is to see what we're what
this web assembly binary is well it's
incredibly tiny this is the the binary
representation or the to me the the
textual dump of the web assembly module
that's all there is and this web
assembly module does something very
small just adds two numbers together so
I mentioned this isn't a big game demo
but it's just
we'll be interesting to see how this
interacts with javascript in HTML so
let's go to our our new index here and
this fall so what we've done right now
is and we're I'm using async and await
actually because all these these
functions are asynchronous we we fetch
the module we turn it into an array
buffer and we use the web assembly API
to compile it into a module and
instantiate the module you can think of
a module sort of like an es sixth class
and the web assembly instance as an
instantiation of the class it's the
module has some the module can be
instantiated more than once and you
might want to use it in different ways
but regardless instances sort of the the
unit of of what of javascript object
that we're going to use to invoke this
web assembly module
so let's actually break here and see
what we get
so instance is let me just uh just
actually log it out here and you can see
it directly no I don't know okay so what
we get out here is nothing
alright let's go through what we're
loading here it's our server on the
right page yes
I'm not calling load that is Wow
Wow thank you I really yeah I told you
this talk was about advanced JavaScript
but it goes beyond advanced to expert
level JavaScript thank you okay so we're
gonna load this and we might then see
some results hopefully I mean you know
you could never you can never be sure
here okay and what we get out is an
object which represents our web assembly
instance Wow okay now what assembly
instances in JavaScript have a simple
thing on them they have exports because
of web assembly module can export a
bunch of different functions so we see
here we get this object has an exports
method excuse me an exports of value and
property and add to is a value that it
exports so add to is the web assembly
function now the important thing to note
here is ad 2 is actually native code so
again adding two numbers isn't a
particularly impressive example but you
can see that from JavaScript in an
environment you're very familiar with
you can easily get access to something
like a native function and we can call
it just like any other so let's let's
take this and and I mentioned that all
async functions are return promises so
we'll have to use dot down here but
we're gonna take our instance and we're
gonna call instance exports dot add to
let's take two numbers and let's let's
log these to the console ok and let's
see what happens I keep forgetting I
didn't map my persistence over here
let's do that one more time
and this is instance dot exports dot add
to and let's see what happens missing
argument listed a close up correctly we
get 84 so you can see that even if
you're not a web assembly developer or
even if you're not compiling these web
modules yourself you can imagine a day
in which instead of downloading an NPM
module which is JavaScript it provides a
JavaScript implementation of something
like you know an zip encoder or an image
decoder or PDF renderer you could just
rely on a web assembly version or a web
assembly implementation of the same
thing and use it with no knowledge of
how it was created
so web assembly is currently in a
browser preview period and we've
announced that this is slated or the
roadmap is to collect developer free
developer feedback during this browser
preview and launch web assembly on by
default in browsers in early 2017 so web
assembly is really close and it's gonna
be really powerful
not just for native developers but for
developers making any range of
progressive web apps with some
computationally intensive code so thank
you very much that was the my talk and
if there's one thing to take away it's
that v8 is continually investing not
just in the performance of JavaScript
but in unlocking new capabilities and
improving the ergonomics of writing web
applications in the first place so thank
you very much
