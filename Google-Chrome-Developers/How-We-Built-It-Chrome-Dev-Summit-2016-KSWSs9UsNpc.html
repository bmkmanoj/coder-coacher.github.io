excited to present a journey of how we
build housing dot-com the mobile version
okay so I'm Rahul I lead the front-end
team at housing as the name suggests we
are into home buying and for most of our
users home buying is a once in a
lifetime event and it's a long journey
before they settle for their dream home
we have native apps to facilitate that
experience of with native performance
better reengagement and offline
experience but we also had few
challenges like poor internet
connections mostly 2g and 3g and low-end
devices in terms of computation memory
and storage these kept our users from
downloading our apps and thus hindered
our business to reach their goals we
also had our mobile website which looks
something like this the problem with
this was it was a monolithic code base
having desktop and mobile tangled
together and the components were kind of
bloated because of the filth in
JavaScript and the media queries in our
CSS and that eventually affected our
performance so we thought about we have
to cater the growing need of our use a
mobile user base and we chose to upgrade
our mobile website to something that can
compete with our native apps
the reason being simple web has better
discovery and wider user user base than
any other platform also the cost of
bringing a user to our mobile web was 50
times cheaper for us than bringing the
same user to our native apps so it was
the deal breaker like we started off
building our mobile website the first
and foremost thing that we had was to
support all the major browsers that are
out there that our users use on more
than 2000 2000 different devices that
they have
so this was the first team and then we
thought once we have this part done
we'll upgrade that experience to compete
with our native apps so we built housing
go and we were happy with the kind of
metrics that we saw we were able to
bring down our page load times by 30% we
are even having 10 percent longer user
sessions and the bounce rate was cut
down to 40 percent on top of all this
the most important part was 38% more
conversions on our mobile website that
really helped our business realized the
goals much sooner and effectively than
earlier and yeah I like to call up on
stage Ritesh who will be taking us
through the journey of how we build this
good morning so I am British I am a
front-end developer at housing comm so
let's talk about how we actually built
it from the start we were focusing on
for QA key areas the first one is that
we wanted to deliver assets fast then we
wanted to bring down the time to first
meaningful paint
and also the first J's enable
interaction time and at the same time we
had to improve the experience of our
returning users so most of the other
performance metrics actually depend on
when is your asset delivered so this is
a waterfall of a traditional website
first your whole HTML loads and then
other asset requests moves so you have
to wait for whole HTML to load before
making a request so when you analyze
your code you will find that there's a
certain part of your code that needs no
computation or no API request so let's
talk about HTML streaming now this is
how it looks like on client side first
we send the initial chunk that only
contents contains the code that needs no
computation you can see this pre connect
reload and the critical inline CSS now
sending the preload we actually start
the request for critical JavaScript
earlier
I will talk about them so now this is
the full HTML after the server has made
API requests and it has received all the
responses it sends all the HTML now this
has body initial one didn't had and this
is all the content now the size of full
HTML is around 15 KB but the first
response that the server sent was around
4.2 Kb this is it so preload most of the
time the developers already know that a
particular route is going to need a few
critical resources you can load them in
advance and so by using HTML streaming
and preload in combination we were able
to start the request for critical J's
much earlier than other assets so after
we were done with asset delivery we went
ahead to improve our render time and by
render I mean the first meaningful paint
now the difference between first paint
and force meaningful paint on the left
side you see that that's first paint
first print is anything when there's
anything any pixel available on your
phone most of the time that's not
relevant and user feels like waiting and
when the relevant content is there
there's the first meaningful paint now
we wanted to zero down the difference
between these two so we experimented
with server-side rendering I am saying
experimented because you should always
measure before you implement so this is
a traditional app shell model on first
load till 2.2 seconds there is a white
screen of death you have nothing to see
then there's a state where you have
something but it's not relevant to the
user
he still has to wait and around seven
seconds he sees the first meaningful
content now the region before two point
two second and seven second is what we
call the loading screen of purgatory so
so the user doesn't know what's going to
happen he may receive the content he has
to wait for a certain amount of time and
if there's any error he will have to
wait in that state forever
so we wanted to improve this we wanted
to remove this totally so this
this is after SSR enabled now when we
implemented server-side rendering the
first meaningful paint happened at 2.3
seconds and that was quite an
improvement and this are all these tests
have been run with web-based test or the
it's written on the bottom so so the
this also a bonus they when they
implement a server-side rendering that
the basic meaningful content is
available for everyone I mean as we all
said that we have users using more than
2000 types of devices and so their
variety of users with different browsers
the versions may be older ones so the
basic content of is rendered for all of
them so that's a bonus so till now I
have talked in bits and pieces about how
we improve just enabled interaction but
the main thing that you need to do for
improving jeaious enabled interaction is
that you need to ship less code less yes
so less of the J's faster will be the
interaction time now when you ship less
code you will have to lazy load
resources on demand and this brings us
to code splitting we are using webpack 2
for code splitting and we do both J's
and CSS charting so generally the chunks
that we make we divide them into two
categories the first one of them is
route based chance now when a user lands
to a particular route first we make or
call for the main J's file that that you
will require and in parallel we make a
request for the corresponding CSS file
so when the CSS file has been loaded we
allow the navigation and after his idle
we make a call for the next probable
route that he might navigate to so that
when the user navigates through that
route the transition is almost instant
so next I come to the second category
that's intent-based chunks now these are
the chunks that are only required when
the user does a particular kind of
interaction like scrolling or click and
doesn't involve any route change
let's take an example this is a our
listings page now on top right you can
see on notify button now by lytx data we
know that this is a kind of button that
gets clicked once in few sessions and
the corresponding view that it requires
has its off 32kb
unzip so it makes no sense to load that
with the main.js bundle because most of
the times it will go unused
so we require it only when the user has
clicked on that particular button so
after doing all this currently we are at
a stage where our first meaningful paint
happens at around 2.3 seconds and the
first jjs enable interaction starts at
around 4.2 seconds now by Jace enable
interaction here I don't mean the Dom
content loaded we have defined a custom
metric like we calculated this when the
component actually mounts like since we
are using react it for us it is actually
component at mount so this is the time
this is the time when the component dead
mount gets triggered so I have talked
about how we push critical resources
using preload we have improved render
using SSR and inlining critical CSS we
are pre-caching assets using service
workers as ron will tell you and we are
lazy loading resources on demand so we
are very much near to what the purple
pattern promotes and so till now what I
have discussed has improved the
experience of first-time users now we
also had to improve the experience of
returning users so I will call back
Rahul to tell you more about that
yep so as I told you finding our dream
home is the long journey user comes
online multiple times to make his
searches to compare the houses he is
seeing the property is saying so it was
very important for us to make a
compelling returning retaining user
experience so that we make that journey
as smooth as possible we use services to
precache few resources on install and
act as a proxy for subsequent network
resources so that and so that it can
serve them from the cache directly when
it's requested second time by doing this
we have been able to bring down the
first meaningful pain that happens for a
first-time user at around two point two
seconds to 780 milliseconds and the
first Jason abled interaction from 0.2
seconds for the first time user to one
point one seconds this this so yeah we
also implemented add to homescreen
features to give users to the access to
instantly interact with our app directly
from the home screens and we implemented
push notifications I like to mention
that the kind of conversion rates that
we are having from push notifications
are almost beating fewer few other
channels that we have so that's that's
one thing that's taking us closer to our
apps the offline navigation this was
important for us because whenever you a
user visits for the actual site visit
the properties are generally at the
outskirts of cities where the network is
very Frankie or absolutely no network so
this experience helped them to actually
revisit their session or really look the
properties they have already done on on
the mobile we use pretentious maneuvers
in the API to keep our users almost
logged in virtually almost every time so
that their information is sync across
devices very smoothly yep so once you
are done building the app the main
question that we had is how do we
maintain this we have done lot of saying
to maintain the first first paint time
first yes enable interaction time but as
as the product evolves
they'll with lot of lot of features it's
very difficult to keep in check these
metrics metrics so we came up with our
own system of continuous integration
with webpack and webpagetest and we made
it as easy as just putting a label on a
PR in github so if you are done with
your code and you raise a PR you just
need to put a label run tests and we'll
put out all the information that needs
to track and track these metrics right
on on the gate appear like the chunk
sizes it helps a reviewer know that how
this PR is changing or modifying the
chunk sizes that we already serve the
few roadway statistics like the first
paint when what's the speed index of the
few of the critical routes that we take
care of also the network and the
timeline view this helps the reviewers
get any sense of what resources and
unloading and how they are loaded so I
think this was very important to us to
close the loop of the complete
development from the development and
maintenance yeah it's it's a not always
we are yet to do a lot of things to make
the app faster and one of the thing that
we are experimenting is moving from
react to pre act we have seen that in
our initial prototypes moving from
reactive react has brought down a
difference of 122 KB in our in our
vendor bundle and that's huge like
that's around 700 to 800 milliseconds of
J's enable interaction time gain on the
client side we are also experimenting
with amp to let our users have almost
instant experience when they come
through Google Google results page so
thank you thank you
hello over here hello Jake you there
yeah Paul I'm here okay uh we were asked
to do a quick hand over so we've cut the
bit where we walk on stage that was
housing calm ah and here's lift hey well
good morning everyone I'm Malcolm our
product manager at lift and here with me
today is my colleague Maru
lead engineer on our project and we're
gonna tell you a little bit about our
journey of how we built our progressive
web app at lift so just show of hands
how many of you taken the lid before
awesome well for those of you unfamiliar
lift is the fastest-growing on-demand
trustee service in the u.s. it actually
came out of a hackathon project from our
original product Zimride and so
similarly our ride lift project also
came out of a company hackathon and so
certainly in the very beginning when we
came up with the idea there was a lot of
internal skepticism as to you know why
we would build a web app at all you know
could we if we did could we actually
build a web app that would be a viable
alternative to our native apps and
certainly this makes sense because
historically lifts been a native mobile
first company has invested a lot of time
resources and set etcetera on the native
apps and so you know we said well let's
go ahead and take a stab at it and see
what we come up with and I think we're
pretty happy with our work this is a
desktop view of the app that we built
and our hackathon projects gathered
enough internal
excitement that we said you know why
don't we go out go ahead go out try to
prioritize this and see if our users
would also be just as excited and so
some of the reasons why we built this
right from our standpoint a PWA
could be a great supplement to native
for various reasons number one greater
reach so essentially allowing a lot of
our users that are unsupported or on
aged out devices to use lift number two
reduce friction so certainly pushing
users through an app store funnel is
very very inefficient and number three
faster uploads and experimentation right
so let's talk through each of these so
greater reach on the pie chart that you
see on the right approximately eight
percent of iOS users the market and
three percent of Android users will soon
be unsupported as we slowly deprecated
older OS versions right so our
progressive web app allows us to support
these users furthermore one hundred
percent of Windows Mobile and a hard set
of Amazon fire devices for example
simply because we never had Amazon fire
app until our PWA and we still don't yet
have a native app in Windows Mobile
either so this allows us to support
these users and in addition to this
obviously it reduces a lot of
operational costs technical costs
resources because it means less code and
potentially less incidents or support
tickets number two reduce friction so as
we all know sending users through an app
store funnel is highly inefficient
there's high drop-offs high cost for
installs and so that the funnel that you
see on the right there we can
potentially go from six steps right
starting from web entry all the way down
through the app store towards sign up
and finally a first ride so it's been
said that every step of this funnel you
could essentially lose twenty percent of
your users and so what our rotor reasons
for this I mean maybe it's because I
don't know users don't like the
permissions are you asking about or
maybes because they don't have enough
storage on their phones they have all
those snapchat videos that they see you
know saved so we can basically change
this to the three step process if you oh
so in other words imagine the PWA it can
replace the white portion of that funnel
another interesting thing is deep
linking so imagine we had a developer
partner app like Google Maps and Google
Maps has integrated lyft and they want
to send you
to a seamless experience from google
maps - left right right now if you don't
have the app installed it sends you to
the App Store very very you know not as
seamless as it could be so deep linking
from developer partner apps straight
into our progressive web app is a much
more seamless experience to do that and
finally faster deploys so certainly
deploying fixes code experiments on web
takes hours not weeks there's no need
for this
you know app approval process if you
will and so running experiments faster a
be testing and certainly our app is
always up to date you know have to
constantly update your app and in terms
of you know productivity and timeline
our team actually just started with just
basically one engineer Mosin and you
know our Alpha MVP that he built was
built on top of an angular stack
primarily because lifts historically
been on angular and we were able to do
that in roughly two months time and so
we proved that our PWA had a lot of
promise right we you know of course
eight our own dog food you use a lot of
our leverage our public API to handle a
lot of server-side things we've got a
little bit support from like design and
QA but for the most part you know this
was pretty quick compared to developing
in any event and so once we cook quickly
proved the potential of this we got
enough internal support to get more
engineers on the team and worked on a
new app a beta version of this from the
ground up in react and was able to do
this in you know roughly one month's
time and so now I'd like to bring out
Mosin to talk a little bit more about
the technical aspects of the app
little one I'm here to tell you the
story study all about the right meet
Valerie she just saw dj khaled is giving
undercover lift right so she want to try
maybe he's hit her driver so she goes to
lift calm and what you have in live.com
is this big pink button that says
request the right we don't force users
to download the app they can just
request the right right there in the web
this is really important because if we
force them to download the app they had
to download almost 75 megabytes of data
just to start
so this is where PWA wins you might
think ok if she downloads the iOS app is
going to be a better user experience
it's gonna load faster but in fact our
PWA notes faster than our us app this is
under LTE network with a good device but
with slower networks and slower devices
we get good results acceptable results
so now that she's on it she's in our PWA
she needs to sign up for sign up and
lift we asked for your phone number and
a payment method if you have your web
payment set up you don't need to put in
your credit card just use Android pay
with payment API so she can do that with
two taps she has an account and she can
pay for her own when she requests the
right oh I forgot this i talked about
how the PWA is a better user experience
and that means in any front animations
anything is same as
the native app okay so now that she
wants to take a ride when she taps
request right what we do is we legislate
the service worker that listens to push
notifications from our servers so if her
driver is coming in two minutes she can
put her phone in the pocket and wait for
the driver to commit when driver is here
we send this push notification that
letters lets her know that
driver is here this push notification do
another thing it has a payload that
updates the right information in our app
so that means if she taps on this train
push notification we are going to take
her to our PWA
without making any Network requests
because push notification had all the
data when she's done with the ride we
also send it push notification that push
notification as well includes rights
information so even if she's are flying
she can open up our PWA and access this
screen which has all the information
about the right who the driver was how
much it cost and things like that this
is really cool but it doesn't stop here
thanks to background sync she can submit
her feedback why she's offline when she
does this what we do in the
serviceworker is we are making a post
request putting it in the cache and then
serviceworker is going to wait for
online event and that happens this post
recourse is going to be submitted this
is without her interaction it's
happening in background I think this is
really really cool so making this
progressive web app was a really really
interesting journey for us we are doing
it for about two months it's very early
but we learned so many lessons that they
want to share it
few of them with you as other speakers
here told you list JavaScript is better
as much as we love to add new libraries
and new dependencies to our code we
should always be considered about amount
of JavaScript we push the users this is
really really important for mobile users
your regular MacBook Pro that you
develop on is very more faster than the
phone that your users are using that's
why in lift we are using real devices
for development and testing we forbid
ourselves from using our Mac's or these
powerful computers for development it's
not the most pleasant experience but
that's the user experience you're
working on another thing that we did was
minification I'm sure all of you minify
your JavaScript but we did something new
which is thank to angular team with
their type of script to closure compiler
annotated JavaScript project with that
we were able to minify javascript even
further a method named in minified
regular minification process will not
change because job mini firewood doesn't
know where this method is being called
so he can't rename it all over the place
but the type of script and closure
compiler we were able to minify it even
further the other thing that we did with
JavaScript was tree shaking which is now
much easier than before with web pack
and the new minifiers
here's a quick look of our technology
stack you're not using a lot of
dependencies as I said just react a
little bit of a pack and things are
working pretty great our bundle size is
just some 40 kilobytes geez it
thank you we had challengers doing this
work too
the biggest challenge was other the
other platform but at the same time all
these PWA api's are pretty pretty new
and sometimes we saw mdn documents out
of are out of date there is not much
Stack Overflow questions to look for you
just ask questions and get answers so
that but that is an interesting
challenge to have the other one
we can't is not in our control so
hopefully that's gonna be fixed next
year um I have one little lesson we
learn and that is animation for opacity
if you use CSS animation for opacity
infinitely it's gonna crash your browser
don't do that so now I'm gonna hand it
over to Malcolm to talk about business
impact of this PWA thank you
all right Thank You Moses in and so
putting this all together what was our
early business impact the initial
response from our alpha was certainly
very very positive we you know exceeded
our initial weekly rides number of
weekly rides goal by 5x we were able to
launch a app especially a wrapper around
our PWA into the Amazon fire app store
very very quickly and if you're
interested there's a link up there to
learn more and finally we estimate that
we'll have up to a 50% improvement in
force upgrade churn so this is again
folks that we eventually have to force
upgrade due to having lower or older OSS
and so next steps you know this is
certainly still a very very early beta
we're still iterating on it a lot it
will be buggy but you know we encourage
you to try it out number one for next
steps we definitely like to prove and
optimizer conversion funnels number two
experiment a lot right and number three
finally start adding a lot more features
onto this so that we can actually reach
feature parity with our native apps and
so I wanted to thank everyone here for
listening you know some of our team
members will be here at the conference
later today to answer any questions you
might have or just chat and if you'd
like to give it a try just go to ride
lift calm and in fact we have a coupon
code for you to use for 20% off your
ride all right thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
