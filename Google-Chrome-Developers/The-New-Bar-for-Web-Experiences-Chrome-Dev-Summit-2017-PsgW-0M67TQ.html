video from around the world I'm Taryn I
work in product partnerships for Chrome
and the web platform team which means
that day to day I get to interact with
lots of different partners and web
developers like yourselves as we try to
think about what are the new latest and
greatest web technologies to bring to
market and hopefully motivate some of
you to ship them to so when Chris and I
start talking about what kind of talk we
wanted to give we knew we want to focus
on what we see as a new standard for
really good web experiences the modern
web then Chris talked about the new bar
and well I only heard the words modern
and bar and I thought about my favorite
modern bar in New York City which is a
Hudson Hotel and what a modern bar
experience should be like I know so
despite our shared love of cocktails
Chris quickly got me grounded and said
this wasn't actually our topic no no so
I'm Chris Wilson I've worked on
developing the web platform for nearly
25 years nearly a quarter century since
NCSA mosaic and I am the developer
advocate lead for the progressive web
app team here at Google and we're here
to together actually because we both
really want to get you as excited as we
are about the user experiences that are
now possible on the web what we both
believe is this inflection point today
that we're currently experiencing the
tipping point of the web as a universal
platform this groundswell of the web
being used to deliver experiences that
aren't just useful and real but they're
beautiful immersive experiences so we
want to inspire all of you on what's
possible today on the web share really
great partner journeys and success
stories to give you ideas but this isn't
just about doing something that's never
been done before or not been done before
no not at all I mean so I'm an avid
scuba diver right and I live in Seattle
and we have really strong tides and we
need a slight update I think that's not
supposed to be there but we get really
strong tides in Seattle
and this is the experience of how I used
to get tides let's switch over to the
demo screen there we go so this is what
I used to use to check tides to see when
I could dive and it's really kind of a
painful experience to be honest because
like if I want to flip between days I
actually have to use these drop downs I
have to remember what day of the month
it is which I can never do without
actually looking somewhere else on my
phone so it's kind of a pain it's not
the best and the team at Dockyard
actually has built this application that
I frankly instantly fell in love with
it's called high tide and this is a
progressive web app it's actually
starting up cold here so it figures out
loads up and it figures out oh you're in
San Francisco because it has geo locusts
and but I actually want to see what the
tides are like in Seattle so I'm gonna
type in Seattle and go check the station
okay so I'm flying home on Wednesday and
actually it kind of looks like Wednesday
afternoon is a perfect time to go diving
so I have to get my gear packed up now
this isn't a killer app right this isn't
like oh my god I could never get tides
before or something I've been able to
look up tides forever but this is a much
smoother experience it's really smooth
scrolling it starts up really quickly
and actually it's still kind of half
works offline it gives me an experience
at least while I'm offline even if it
can't generate the tide tables and this
is really underscoring the point that
it's not just good enough to just
provide a service anymore you actually
have to prioritize your user experience
this is what users expect now so let's
flip back to the screen here we go
like I would radically prefer this
experience on the right rather than the
experience on the left and so this is
what users expect out of something that
they want to use frequently and so the
core concept we want to get across today
in our goal for all of you is really
it's time to raise the bar for what you
can deliver for your user experiences we
know we can all do better and we want
you to exceed user expectations for
what's possible on the web we all know
that the web is great for user reach
it's the
front door for so many of the companies
and services and now we want you to
believe that the web can be used as a
great user experience platform we've
been using this term progressive web app
for about two years little over two
years now and we want to be clear this
is really just a placeholder for this
new higher bar for delivering web
applications like when we talk about
Service Worker or add to homescreen or
app manifest push notifications all
these different technologies this isn't
really like we wanted to categorize this
as an app it's really care about your
user experience provide a better user
experience in fact the progressive web
app pillars are really just about doing
that providing a great user experience
so we're mostly not even referring to
progressive Web Apps and certainly in
our talk we'll mention it a few times
just as a easy way to say something but
it's just a shortcut for modern web in
particular caring about your user
experience more than anything else
and what users have grown to expect not
just from the web but from their
computers and their devices they expect
these experiences that are fast that are
integrated with the way the device
they're using typically works and that
work reliably and that's how you build
these truly engaging experiences why PWA
is need a service worker is because then
they can cache and it can provide a
really fast initial load their
installable not for some other reason
just because that's how the user expects
to get to applications and then the
browser fades into the background the
experience just feels like it's part of
the device and yes these pillars do
spell fire I'm not supposed to yell fire
in a crowded theater so we're not making
a big deal of that but as we explain the
details of what your users expect we're
going to show you some success stories -
so on the first pillar fast users don't
expect janky scrolling they don't expect
slow load performance you saw how
efficiently that high-tide app loaded
how smoothly it scrolled loading an app
has to feel instant it has to feel
invisible and this is really just about
keeping the users attention as we said
before user attention is a really
precious resource after three seconds
53% of users abandon sites half your
users are gone now this is bad enough on
a desktop machine certainly I'm guilty
of this if something takes more than
three seconds to load I will probably
just close the tab and find something
else to do but those are usually
connected with there's a reliable fast
network connection but if half of users
abandon a site after three seconds it is
frankly a miracle to me that anyone ever
loads pages on mobile networks the
average mobile web page takes an average
of 19 seconds to load on a 3G connection
now of course I might think hey that's
fine I've got 4G LTE or whatever and I'm
usually on Wi-Fi anyways on my mobile
device that's great except remember
worldwide 60 percent of mobile
connections are still to g2g like not
even 3G but 2g so worldwide this is a
much more critical problem than you
might understand and in a nutshell what
we're really saying is you have to focus
on making your experience fast needs to
load instantly and I'm going to leave
most of this to a session from Adi later
this afternoon but we really wanted to
share some successes from being fast
for example LMA is the biggest food
ordering and delivering company in China
they launched the first progressive web
app for the domestic Chinese market and
they serve 260 million users 260 million
to put this in context because a quarter
of a billion doesn't really register to
me this is almost as much as the entire
population of the United States that's
their customer base
they actually have 1.3 million
restaurants listed in their app and 99%
of their users order food from mobile
devices so it's kind of critical for
them to have a good experience right and
LMA set out to improve their mobile
experience focusing on speed and
reliability but particularly in flaky
connections so they use an app shell
they want to get skeleton screens on the
on screen really quickly
and then want to ensure that whenever a
user taps a button it gives them
something it shows them this feedback
that hey
things happening don't worry we know
what you're doing in transition to that
page and they get their skeleton paint
up in 400 milliseconds on a mobile
connection they actually get fully
interactive in two seconds in typical
conditions like this is pretty amazing
to me this is awesome and this critical
focus on page load time by the way this
user interaction was really the goal of
the amp project amps built on web
components in the HTML I think that's
great it's a way to easily build fast
and reliable pages on the web so it's
amazing to see all this momentum with
amp they just had their 2 year
anniversary last week where they
announced that there are now four
billion amp pages out in the wild across
25 million domains
that's an incredible milestone and amp
is really continuing to evolve and to
support additional use cases especially
when it comes to e-commerce
you see here a couple of examples of
e-commerce sites have built highly
interactive pages it's possible to build
a product page updates the availability
of an item shows a different thumbnail
in price as well as a way to add a
product to a shopping cart let's take a
look at an example of a merchant
building a highly interactive amp page
here you have overstock it's a us-based
home goods provider that's built a fast
loading interactive site using amp it's
also important to highlight that the
other amp pages are actually 100%
functional parody with their non amp
equivalents on their mobile site they're
using amp to sort and filter they're
using several amp components the amp
sidebar for the menu and pakore daeun
for content that can expand and collapse
based on the user interaction there live
with amp with for over 4 million product
and category pages and their early
metrics are looking great overall
uplifts in conversions as well as
increase in revenue using their amp
pages so think about it a year ago
overstock couldn't have built this page
and yet amp has allowed them to step up
their game and I love to hear kind of
stories and feedback from developers
especially as they're going through
building these new mobile web
experiences and I want to highlight here
that the amp pages allow the team to
realize just how large their regular
mobile web page
were and how slow they load and so it's
awesome to see the overstock team
continue to iterate on their amp design
to improve their metrics and then take
those lessons and apply it back to their
overall mobile website they're heavily
investing in progressive web apps as
well to take amp to the next level and
raise the bar and so amp has evolved you
know pretty quickly from static pages to
now interactive pages and more recently
developers have begun exploring how they
can use the amp library to build fast
beautiful websites to early days and
we're eager to get feedback and hear
from sites who are exploring using amp
for their full site experience up here
on screen is Casey Co which is a recipe
site from BuzzFeed they went all in on
amp for them raising the bar was
building an entire website using the amp
library it's fast and getting
interactive in less than three seconds
and so users are getting this amazing
experience coming from Google search
from Facebook links from Pinterest pins
and am was a natural way for the tasty
code team to make something super
performant and optimized for their
audience and what's even more awesome is
that the site is responsive and then
becomes an efficient way to build a site
using a single code base the tasty taco
site provides experience not only on
mobile but on desktop so it's a really
great develop overall developer
experience and this is really the theme
of this new bar for web experiences you
should provide a good experience across
devices and on each one of those devices
the experience should really feel
integrated with the device capabilities
the way the tip user typically does
things end to end
experiences that are built on the web
don't need to feel any different than
experiences that are built on native
platforms they should be just as natural
for the user to interact with now users
expect to interact with all apps pretty
much the same regardless of how they're
built like they expect to launch apps
from the home screen they expect that
they're visible in the task list they
think that app should maintain your
identity have access to low-level
hardware stuff like camera audio or
accelerometer and Owens going to talk a
bunch more of that about this in his
talk later this morning but one good
example I really wanted to call out is
media playback when you're listening to
a music stream
offered over the web you still have the
same expectations as one offered from a
native application as a user if your
screen is locked you want to be able to
see what song's playing you want to
maybe skip to the next song or skip back
here that one again maybe hear it again
I'm never gonna give up the song but
with the media session API web apps get
to hook into this capability - they
could integrate with how the user
expects to do things and media companies
are actually now seeing a ton of success
in the web so geo cinema is part of
Reliance Geo they're the biggest 4G
telco Network in India and they have a
hundred million paying customers this is
one of the largest mobile video networks
in the entire world and their
progressive web app is basically a
one-stop shopping destination for Indian
movies TV music videos the whole deal
and this was an app only business like
they only had native apps and they went
to the web for the first time with this
progressive web app that they built and
they only launched this three weeks ago
at the beginning of this month and
already they're seeing 10% longer
session times on their mobile app under
their mobile web app than on their
native app and better reach for their
customers who are in tier 2 and tier 3
cities because in these smaller areas
they may not have the native app they
may not have the storage space to keep
it and so Chris just walked through kind
of this really integrated experience for
the most personal device for it for
users and so I want a transition to talk
about a little bit more about how you
can make sure that you're delivering
really great personalized experience
whether it's getting users to sign
in/sign up or check out so let's first
talk about push notifications and here
this is really a great opportunity for
you to provide a much more targeted
experience for users so MercadoLibre is
Latin America's largest online retailer
with over 190 million registered users
some of their biggest markets include
Brazil Mexico and Argentina is this huge
marketplace for buying products and
oftentimes buyers want to ask a question
of a seller before making a purchase so
we want to share this really great use
case for push notifications that's
highly targeted and personalized so when
a user wants to get in touch with a
buyer they get prompted with a great
visual explaining that they can receive
a push notification when the seller
responds so that's the visual you see up
here this is such a great alternative to
email because it's much more real-time
again integrated into the users personal
device then when the seller responds the
buyer gets a notification on their
device
it contains the title the product as
well as part of the text of the response
in it
so again users get a bit of a preview
when the seller responds Mercado is
seeing a 41% opt-in rate for these web
push notifications again a whole new
channel for being able to re-engage and
reach their customer base so I really
love how this type of push notification
is specific and shows how Mercado is
able to deliver a great user experience
taking advantage of native device
capabilities so let's turn it to the
sign up use case which we know is really
painful for a lot of you when you're
trying to do this on different sites so
pet love is this innovative Brazilian
ecommerce site for pet goods and we
included them because look every talk
needs a cute picture of a puppy and so
actually pet loves offline page is
actually a photo of a puppy in case you
want to check it out go check it out so
pet love wanted to avoid the issue of
having users go all the way through the
checkout full flow only to abandon the
cart when they have to go through the
painful process of signing in reducing
sign-in friction is a critical step
especially if you require the user to
sign in before they're able to checkout
so as Ben and Dion mentioned there's now
a new one tap sign up library that you
can integrate and so for someone like
pet love this means you can sign up on
your mobile device and then when you go
to your desktop device you're actually
automatically signed in and so there's
this great kind of cross-platform story
for both sign up and sign in here and
it's pleased to report that there's
actually pet lovers seeing that to 2x
more users are actually able to get to
the checkout flow already signed in and
they're seeing a big bump in overall
conversions we also have the identity
demo boot for anybody who wants to learn
more about the sign up and sign-in
process so in addition to the overall
signup process
you know Pet love also went ahead and
just integrated and upgraded their
overall website experience into a
progressive web app and so what we love
to see is that sites are actually using
multiple features and products and so
it's not just about yes you can
integrate a particular API but really
the site and the user is truly benefit
when you're able to do multiple things
at once and so pet love integrated the
signup and then they went ahead and just
focus on performance and just we kind of
doing and upgrading their experience
they're seeing overall increases in
conversion and time spent as well as
it's important to note that their
progressive web app is eight times
smaller than their native app this is
especially critical for users where they
have a lot of users on 2g and 3G
networks and so this is a big deal or in
this case a tiny deal which is actually
a better thing so another great
personalized example as Starbucks and
the Starbucks of course is the largest
coffeehouse company in the world they're
based in my hometown of Seattle so of
course I had to talk about them they
have 20,000 stores across 62 different
countries and their customers expect a
really high quality experience no matter
what device I have what network
conditions there are around I gotta have
my pumpkin spice latte this time of year
and users often end up standing in line
at the store rather than ordering a head
like a lot of customers use their
rewards program and I personally hate
carrying extra cards around in my wallet
so I don't want to do that and the
Starbucks team built this great
progressive web app it's still in beta
with the goal of making it easy for
users to come back and sign in and pay
with their bar code and it was actually
really surprised to hear because I
thought that it was really just mostly
cards that people used 20% of all their
transactions are done using the bar code
and this bar code they're their beta
progressive web app actually has a
service worker that caches all this
stuff and it enables customers to pay
with that bar code even if they don't
have a network connection even if they
don't have a network connection they can
pull out their phone and pay for their
stuff with their Starbucks app so from
sign-in to check out their beta is a
great example of this user experience
you can offer from
recive web apps so speaking of seamless
checkout this is an area where we want
sites to think about how they can reduce
the number of steps necessary for the
checkout process so this is probably a
pretty typical experience if you've gone
through the checkout process buying
stuff on mobile web where we see that
sites can have seven to eight steps to
complete including reviewing car
creating the user account adding the
information so swim mallet had a pretty
typical new user checkout flow that
required login and multiple screens and
even though they were leveraging
autocomplete fully it was still a pretty
long process taking two minutes or more
from start to finish so swim outlet
which is actually the largest online
specialty swim shop in the US did a
review of their site and implemented
payment request so users that's from
outlet can now go from the cart review
page to their order confirmation where
they see a payment request sheet this
mobile optimised form that's prefilled
for the users information meaning it
only takes a few clicks to complete so
similar to the j.crew walkthrough that
Ben and Dion did because the swim outlet
shoppers are able to skip so many
in-between steps they're able to check
out in 20 to 25 seconds an 80% reduction
in time to checkout which is huge and to
help with speed here check out flows
we're now making the Google payment API
available as well this means you can use
credit cards you've added to your Google
account from products like Google Play
YouTube Chrome Android pay and then the
Google can send the merchants the
payment and shipping info so that users
don't have to type it in we showed you
in the keynote the merchants fancy
implementing pay with Google button and
in this demo you see on screen that the
site calls payment requests similar to
swim outlet and that you can see Google
as a form of payment enabling a much
faster checkout process and the payments
team is also here in the forum in case
you want to check out and have them
review your checkout process so the web
as we all know has always been this
really really safe place right okay
maybe that's patently untrue but the
expectation has always been at least
that websites don't get access to
powerful device features powerful API is
without asking for permission
and as we add more and more powerful
api's to the web as we enable more and
more web capabilities that permission
changes the model of the web and how
users have to interact with it so we're
still on this journey of building the
best model for this but when websites
need special permissions from the user
they have to show this permission
request now the permission requests
appear as ignore abou banners at the
bottom of the screen on Android top of
the screen on desktop and developers
have often shown them frequently they
just pop them up whenever they think oh
I might need this in the future without
considering is this really an
appropriate time to ask the user this
and do they have enough context to
answer that question and this results in
a really distracting user experience
because you have these little dialogues
popping up all over the place and it
turns out this is kind of a bad thing
too because in Chrome for Android alone
we found users either entirely ignore
the permission requests or they
temporarily dismiss them more than 90%
of the time so 90% of the time it's not
that the user is saying yes you can have
that permission or saying no you can't
they're just saying get this dialog out
of my face so to address this problem
since chrome 59 we actually started
saying if a user dismisses a permission
request doesn't like accept or deny it
they just dismiss it three times in a
row will actually just temporarily block
that permission request in the future
for a week so it will pop up again but
not for another week since clearly the
user doesn't feel like answering the
question now is another step though
towards making this even better
beginning in chrome 63 for Android we
really want to reduce these continuous
distractions for users so we're going to
present permission requests as modal
dialogues now this sounds backwards
because now we're going to force the
user to answer this question but this
really is going to encourage users to
say yeah sure that's a good request or
deny request that they're not interested
in rather than it is kind of ignoring
that they're being asked and this is
going to drastically reduce the number
of permission requests that users
actually see because they'll make a
decision up front
and the best part about this is this is
going to encourage applications to not
only ask for permission in the context
of why that permission will be useful to
make the users experience better but
only ask it when it's actually a good
idea and they need that capability and
this is really important because we
found that sites that ask for
permissions across all api's without
context on average they actually only
get granted permission 40% as much as
sites that actually ask for something
and give you the context so if you're
given the context of hey I want you
access to your location because it will
help me tell you which restaurant is
closest to you you'll actually grant
that so much more often like what 150
ton percent is much often as you will if
you don't get any context at all like
40% of the time they would get that that
accepted so since a block decision by
the way is permanent unless the user
manually overrides it we hope this is
going to encourage people to ask for
permission and give context okay so
let's talk about reliability for web
applications when you click on an app
icon on your home screen you're expected
to just work you expect it to just load
and do something and this frankly has
always been something holding the web
back as an application platform because
its users we've done become conditioned
to think that web app equals something
that only works when I have a network
connection and native mobile apps never
show us this cute little guy nothing on
my home screen shows this except for
Chrome and in order for web apps to earn
a place on the home screen we need to
make them reliable even when the network
isn't and the worst part is mobile
phones actually aren't always online or
offline they're in like this
Schrodinger's cat state where they might
have a network connection they show four
bars but it might not actually do
anything or it might only have one bar
but it actually can get data through and
this is actually even worse like this
breaks the user experience just as much
as saying hey I'm disconnected
completely so let's talk about a service
that I'm sure you've probably heard of
and you might
you know rely on and need to be reliable
ride-sharing so everyone's heard of uber
like they're a ride service with a
global focus they actually build
products that work all over the world
and earlier this summer they announced
their progressive web app ember called
mÃ¼ber no really it's called mÃ¼ber they
said so in their blog post so I'm gonna
say that the rest at a time so mÃ¼ber is
this investment in delivering really
great global access for uber everywhere
especially for those users with really
low connectivity or low storage space on
their devices or even devices where
their native app wasn't actually
supported and users need to really be
able to quickly and reliably request a
ride no matter where they are what their
network speed is what their devices and
mÃ¼ber provides that experience using
the web in fact they're actually
designed to work really well on 2g
they're interactive in three seconds on
2g their core ride-sharing app is really
just 50 kilobytes like that's incredibly
tiny I mean I haven't seen a JavaScript
library that's small in I can't even
remember one but it's really designed to
work well because they cache these
requests and they actually let them
serve the content locally even when they
have intermittent intermittent network
and they detect this really well
Instagram is another example you're
gonna hear more about this later in the
creating media without an app talk but
they do this great job of unlocking the
ability for users on unreliable
connections to share experiences even
when they don't have a connection
through offline support so you can take
a photo even when you're not connected
to the Internet and using background
sync in the serviceworker API it gets
posted automatically as soon as you're
back online so they'll talk more about
that later and continuing at this theme
eBay is actually currently looking at
service workers to see how they can make
their experience better for their users
and they're not quite ready to refactor
their entire core experience but they
came up with this great standalone use
case to try out service
career deployment so they started
cashing the users eBay browsing history
like what what items you looked at
already they cashed those using service
worker and then the user can actually
look at those like they can flip back
through items even while they're offline
and this way they can learn how to use
service workers for a really strong
offline experience and then use that to
integrate back into their main
experience
so all these pillars fast integrated and
reliable they really just lead to
engaging and an engaging app really goes
beyond just being functional and it
insures your whole experience is really
delightful it makes it easy for users to
do what they need to do and using
features like web push they can always
be up to date with notifications you can
keep users informed and it uses the
right capability is the right time in a
really beautiful way and to talk through
an engaging experience we're going to
take a look at trivago great thanks
Chris so go to demo screen so in the
keynote we highlighted trivago as this
really great progressive web app and so
I wanted to go ahead and give a demo
although all of you who I know I think
you're really paying attention to us
you're probably looking at your phone
too already so if you want it to go to
traval go calm you can do that as well
and follow along so I'm gonna click on
trivago this beautiful splash screen
that again you know gives you some time
to warm up the browser and I'm gonna go
ahead and search here so for those who
are unfamiliar with trivago they're
actually one of the largest hotel search
engines for travel and they operate in
55 countries so I'm gonna go ahead and
search for San Francisco let's take a
look at the dates let's see maybe I'll
be in the city for my anniversary next
weekend and then if you actually scroll
through it's really really fast and
smooth and if I actually try to go into
the various different hotel product
detail pages you see a nav here where
each of the piece of information is
available really really quickly you see
the skeleton some of the skeleton
screens that Chris talked about earlier
and so it's just a wonderful kind of
immersive user experience and one of the
things that the trivago team really
focused on was the ability to be
extremely
resilient and real and still performing
even with on a flaky connection and so
I'm gonna go ahead and go to airplane
mode and as you can see here there's the
UI that that tells the user you're
offline so then we'll reconnect when we
are back with Network and even while
being offline you don't hit a white
stream you actually are still able to
consume some content again if I'm going
into a listing that isn't already cache
there's really nice UI for you for to
communicate to the user when they're
offline and I think what's terrific
about this is that even when the user
kind of navigates through trivago and
goes back to a screen or they actually
have a maze so I guess it's their
version of the offline dinosaur but
you're actually able to play a game
while you're waiting to come back online
which is really cool but please still
pay attention to the rescue let's talk
don't just play the little game and so
what I love about trivago is that it's
great to ship really amazing experiences
for users but in a day it's still a
pretty large business and so I want to
highlight its a couple of stats here so
again as I mentioned they focus a lot
and provide a really resilient
experience and that that they wanted I
want to highlight is that 67% of users
who are interrupted by a period of a
flaky connection or offline actually
come back to continue to browse think
about that think about how often you you
hit a flaky network and then you
actually just leave the site in this
situation you're actually trivago is
still maintaining some sort of content
for you to interact with until that
network connection comes back and so
that continuity is really proving well
in their business results so they're
seeing users continue to stay with them
and continue to browse another set which
been highlighted earlier in the keynote
and I want to really emphasize here that
97% they're seeing a 97% increase in
overall conversions and conversions here
is defined by a user browsing through
lots of different hotel listings and
then clicking on the view deal button
and so that means that you know users
are able to find what they want really
quickly
and are clicking out so that's a really
really great experience again I want to
share you know one of the highlights
here is that trivago actually published
a blog post would think with Google
where one of the developers said that
it's you know mobile users come to
expect sites to just work regardless of
flaky Wi-Fi or poor mobile reception and
so this is really the new bar it's the
standard bar I hope for what users
expect and for what all of you
developers should be able to deliver for
all of your users and another example of
an engaging experience I want to walk
through is West albums approach for
those who are here at chrome dev summit
last year I actually demoed the West Elm
beta site and I want to touch upon the
journey that they went through over the
last year and I think that's going to be
very relatable because sometimes you
know here at Google we have a lot of you
know we move at a fast pace and but when
I talk to partners I have to remind
folks that it takes time it takes a lot
of planning a lot of internal
stakeholder management see a lot of
nodding because people understand what
it takes to kind of reinvest or invest
in new experiences so I want to walk
through kind of what West Elm did and so
for those of you don't know West Elm
it's a major retail furnishings company
it's part of the lowing of Sonoma group
that has eight brands including Pottery
Barn and William Sonoma calm as well and
so I want I'm gonna go ahead and walk
through the timeline so this time last
year that just launched the West Elm
beta and they kept it as a separate
experience and they start to redirect
some limited traffic there but they knew
that they had something good and so they
actually went through rigorous usability
testing and they got positive feedback
and so that gave them the confidence to
continue to roll out to more of their
traffic so there were you know seeing
ten percent of traffic constantly
constantly checking what the data was
telling them again continuing to see
positive metrics and then at the point
where they were rolling out ten percent
traffic and seeing positive metrics they
said well we're on to something good
here it's actually let's take let's take
this opportunity to really check their
platform so that they can use web
components across all of the company's
sites been highlighted you know what
some Pottery Barn and one Sonoma going
through this process already and so this
really means that not only were they
building a high bar from one site but
they were taking that learnings and able
to expand it across so many other
company sites and when they rolled out
to 25% traffic across iOS and Android
and it's important to note that west
Elms traffic is actually over 80% of it
is actually on iOS I want to pause for a
moment to kind of share a couple of
stats that they solve for 25% traffic
they saw an increase in average time
spent as well as an overall lift in
revenue per visit now if any of you have
actually been on the west down site and
I present revenue increases actually a
lot if you've seen their so I think this
is it was a huge testament to the work
that the team did in terms of you know
testing and continuing to look at their
data and then that data that I just
shared with you was so positive that it
actually accelerated kind of folks
internally to think about multiple sites
upgrading on to this new platform and so
over the next few weeks
Pottery Barn comm William Sonoma comm
and West Elm comm will be getting this
new experience through you know probably
most of it coming right after the
holidays but you'll be seeing all these
new upgraded experiences so it's a great
example of testing iterating retooling
and then launching for what makes sense
in terms of raising the bar for all of
your users and I hope you're getting the
idea as we go through all these examples
we're hopefully showing you there's a
ton of different features here there's a
ton of different ingredients to help you
mix and match the recipes to formulate
your perfect cocktail or web experience
whatever speaking of cocktails I hear
there's some good nitro cocktails at the
bar tonight here in SF for those of you
who are here with us and yes there are
mocktails for those who don't drink
alcohol as well but so just two years
ago we had this major
Ekholm company in India ship a beautiful
new web experience and so I really want
to emphasize that we think about the web
as this global you know having global
reach and so it's just this one company
and I always like to take a look at kind
of where we are like your
years - years ago got one company and
today there are so many sites adopting
all of these modern web features from
amp to serviceworker to push
notifications better sign-in better
check out because these sites want to
deliver a better user experience
there's just just a small sampling of
brands but it just gives you a sense of
kind of the momentum that we're seeing
throughout the world and it's just not
about sites it's about making sure that
platforms are able to invest in the
modern web and so we understand that
it's also important that we are able to
turn on many of these features at scale
and so we're excited to see that
automatic and WordPress are continuing
to invest here so most folks have
probably heard of WordPress org
automatic is actually the creators of
WordPress com WordPress VIP the jetpack
plugin for WordPress as well as
WooCommerce and so with automatic we've
been able to collaborate on a couple of
fronts first on amp we're creating the
official google amp plugin for WordPress
and making it instantly available on
millions of sites across wordpress.com
and the VIP sites and with serviceworker
we're doing some experimental work with
the jetpack plug-in to bring the generic
serviceworker framework to the theme
otters so this means that you can
progressively enhance your theme with
more progressive web app functionality
and hopefully there'll be more to
announce on this front soon the
automatic team is actually here with us
at chrome dev summit and they'll be
giving a talk about how WordPress is
continuing to invest in the web so
WordPress and automatic are just one
example but Gento is a major e-commerce
platform you know they're serving you
know tons and tons of sites actually
over a hundred and twenty four billion
dollars in gross merchandise volume goes
through the Magento platform on an
annual basis they have lots of you know
huge developer community tons of
Technology partners and recently Magento
announced their commitment to
integrating progressive web app
technologies and and they'll be it'll be
part of the upgrade into their next
version of their platform so we're
excited that they are continuing to
invest so that users are going to get
modern shopping experiences
and hopefully this shows how you can
reach the bar you can have some support
help reach the bar you can get some
assistance that's actually what our team
is here for that's why we hold these
conferences this is what we want to do
is help figure out how to help you to
reach that bar so with that we hope that
you'll you take some of these stories
get motivated and inspired to go back to
your teams and build something great
actually build really great modern web
experiences we're around the next couple
of days feel free to come back come up
to us we're excited to engage with all
of you and have a good rest of the next
two days absolutely Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
