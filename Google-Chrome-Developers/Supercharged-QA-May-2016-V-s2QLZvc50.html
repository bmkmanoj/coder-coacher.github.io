normally when we do our videos we get
lots of comments we get lots of
questions on Twitter you know loads of
things that kind of come into us and so
we thought why not let's actually take a
step back and answer some of those
questions how our SVG is rendered they
seem quite slow are they GPU accelerated
if so in what ways I have actually no
idea cool I do so they're actually Dom
elements they by the way the SVG but
every child is a actual Dom I'll be like
a rectangle right so you're going to be
careful because if you move them around
going to trigger layout but the layer
operation will stop at the SVG route
it's one of the times we actually have
what we call a layout boundary where the
layer actually is not document scoped
it's going to be scoped to the SVG
element if you look at that yeah the
other thing is a transform normally we
like trying to promote this thing to its
own layer and then transform it around
that doesn't work in SVG context in
Chrome I'm not sure about other browsers
but in chrome we don't promote anything
to its own layer when you actually add
like will change or translates it all
way to repaint it's always a repaint so
you've got to be be cautious with that
Toby I actually expected that for an SVG
because I think for some reason I think
of more than canvas like than anything
else right right but hopefully hopefully
some point that you know optimization
might learn don't know though and then
are the GPU accelerated they can be if
you've got GPU rasterization switch done
in fact one of the best ways to improve
SVG performance today on mobile is to
make sure that you've got GPU
rasterization for at least four chrome
and the way to get that if you just
google for I think it is actually magic
viewport chromium possibly or i think is
Ganesh or GPU rasterization chrome what
one of those will get you into the world
that you need to be in next question
isn't possible to disable I don't with a
book
anyway is it possible to disable web
animations on very very very very very
slow devices it has to be at least five
and they put three tour toys emojis
afterwards I think I know if that person
is really going for slough go fully slow
devices I I can't think of a way to
adapt to your animations really I think
what you could do pass potentially the
performance observer that is in the
works at the very least right now could
eventually help you do this my first
intuition when I read this question was
that maybe you can kind of abuse a
request I'll call back because that will
only be called if your web page is not
too busy and if that is being called you
could use it to nal you have any
missions go the other way around haven't
disabled by default and basically
enhance your web page with the
animations provided it is not under too
much of a load yeah he's the problem i
had with that is that you're now main
thread can so if you're animating with
javascript right all your animations are
coming from the main thread which is
fine so you can then test for main
thread availability with requests that
i'll call back or request animation
frame or both but if you've got
something that's like a CSS animation
that is done with say a transition and
you're just using the compositor thread
it's just going to keep going even if
the main thread is janked up then you
can't use that technique because it's
going to be like well i can't do any
animations right now and the problem i
have is that even with the frame timing
API it's still only main thread
availability so it's kind of going to
benefit anybody who's animating
JavaScript but it's not going to benefit
anybody who's an amazing just purely
with CSS or something like that overall
though I the thing I wanted to kind of
asked myself was is it the right
decision to disable the animations in
the first place right I was like if your
UX can stand not having the animation it
feels like you don't need the animation
right animations just shouldn't be for
the sake of I usually they serve a point
and if it don't serve a point then you
might as well skip them because it's
about being you a little bit mindful
about the users resource right right so
is like yeah but I get it's a sliding
scale and some you might be like hey
it's an added bonus if your device can
take it or what
as I say I don't I don't think you can
do it reliably today and I don't know of
anything that's like in the works it's
just like this is a cast-iron way of
saying this device should be good to go
but I think you're right request that a
callback probably the closest we're
going to get well there you go so those
are the questions that you asked and we
would invite you to ask more questions
in the comments below twitter i'm at
arrow twist at dust soorma that's like
that's like the summer but in German
which I learned had forgotten all my
German until I taught him he did he did
so ask your questions pingers on twitter
and we will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
