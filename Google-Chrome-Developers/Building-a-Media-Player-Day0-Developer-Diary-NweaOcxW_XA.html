develop a diary the last one where I
built the chrome dev summit site and
kind of shared the process with you well
I'm gonna do it again
but what's different this time is that I
know very very very little about the
subject area I'm going to be building a
media app sort of a video player if you
like a generic one to try and understand
what goes into making say a video player
work and I understand that there are
things like chunking that you can do to
sort of do adaptive bit rates and you
can encrypt media as well I know nothing
about these things and so not only am I
going to build a progressive web app I'm
going to discover what little I know
about media on the way through and share
that with you so come along for the ride
that I expect there'll be service
workers they'll be I'm thinking some
full screen kind of takeover hero
transitions I'm thinking there's gonna
be tons of stuff if you have any
questions things that you want me to
actually cover in the videos just you
know drop a comment in below don't
forget you can always subscribe and I
will see you as these episodes start to
land brilliant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
