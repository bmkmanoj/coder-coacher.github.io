lunch and you know we're over here from
the material design team my name is
Zachary Gibson a senior designer this is
you and Chen also a designer on the
material design team and Adi from
polymer we're gonna talk a little bit
about adaptive UI with material design
and what's happening with paper elements
so let's just jump right in
I am no mathematician I'm a designer but
I can tell you that the trick'd
arithmetics is not simply to solve
problems five times five will always be
twenty five the trick is to understand
all of the various rules and systems and
and stuff that exists that allows us to
solve any mathematical problems so
height width area and the same thing is
true when we design adaptive UI we can
design for any screen we can make things
for any screen but the trick is to
understand the systems and all the
patterns and all of the stuff that
exists that allows us to design for
everywhere so in the next 30 minutes UN
and Adi and I are going to show you some
of the stuff that were like hard at work
to define how material design works
everywhere I'll keep going we a couple
little clicker fumbles here unfamiliar
material design is a visual language
created by Google that unified classic
principles of good design with
innovation and possibility of today's
technology by sharing a conceptual
metaphor a visual style that's bold and
graphic and following motion design it
is a single underlying system that
allows for a unified experience across
platforms and different screen sizes
first launched at Google i/o in 2014
which is a year and half ago material
has received great press we really like
this quote from Armin material has the
potential of being one of the most
we can visual improvements to the web
nearly a quarter million Android apps
have gun material since we first
launched while polit while Android is
Google's vehicle for bringing material
design to native apps on mobile polymer
is Google's reference implementation for
material design on the web including
things like components and layout and
other components things like you know
the iron element set or the neon
animation set you guys have downloaded
the paper element set it over you've
looked at of over two and a half million
times it's kind of crazy right and
you're using paper elements and over a
hundred thousand pages at the moment and
this number is going really fast now we
think that adaptive UI material design
and polymer are a really great fit
because when you're developing a web app
you want to make sure that it works
really great cross device you want to be
able to build something that looks like
a native app on mobile but when you go
to desktop it adapts and uses you know
the best of your hardware abilities and
all of your screen real estate you also
want it to look fantastic on tablet now
the polymer material design teams have
been working really closely to try
making sure that the paper elements set
works great cross device and we've got
tons of examples and demos we're going
to talk about in just a bit about
showing you how you can apply adaptive
UI principles to your polymer apps so
what is adaptive design we're all
familiar with responsive design
you know blocks reshuffling mostly based
on media queries but I think adaptive
design takes this a little bit further
we are enabling containers to you know
fit in the right form and are just like
appropriate to the right content and
it's you know adaptive design is based
on context like how a person is using a
certain screen or device it's based on
content just respecting like why user is
looking at something that when they're
looking at it input methods like varying
from fingers to Mouse's to mice is it
mice or Mouse's mice mice keyboard
and you know voice a lot of just various
input methods we also have user needs
like accessibility and
internationalization and even device
limitations like processor or bandwidth
constraints so obviously that's a lot of
stuff to take into consideration when
we're trying to make a web app right and
you know the web is pretty wild it's not
a controlled ecosystem like designing
something for Android so it becomes
difficult to just standardize UX
patterns across across form factors but
we're trying to tackle this issue the
material design team and polymer and I'm
gonna walk you through some of the stuff
that we're trying to do and I really
think that it starts with naming we need
to be able to codify our UI's
nomenclature so to show you how we're
doing this I'm gonna play a little game
here I'm gonna describe a material
design component and we're gonna see if
a D or UN knows which component I'm
describing without showing it so this is
a temporary panel it's on the left side
of the screen and it contains navigation
paper draw paddle yeah I think he knew
the answer this is the paper drawer
panel right but here's what we did we we
described the behavior we described the
structure it's a panel and we gave it
certain descriptors like it sits on the
left it contains navigation so let's go
again here this is a toolbar it's at the
top of the screen it's in front of all
other content so things might come
behind it and it contains actions and a
title it's the paper toolbar yeah so
this is like the paper toolbar or what
we call the app bar and material design
so you know we did the same thing follow
the same pattern there's structure
behavior and certain descriptors we can
define pretty complex UI following this
pattern so you have you know a group of
surfaces it's displayed in three
vertical columns the group is centered
on stage and you know each surface
contains a summary of content that can
expand and other surfaces might reflow
around this so this is something like it
might make G+ or Pinterest or Google
keep so you can see the
by defining certain structures like our
material design components you have a
toolbar a sheet a panel with various
descriptors it's on the Left it's on the
right it's in front of behind or above
below with various behaviors like
something is persistent or a temporary
we've created a matrix so we can just
accurately talk about our UI so you have
a toolbar it's at the top and it's
permanent that's our app bar you might
have a sheet that's at the bottom and
it's temporary we call this a bottom
sheet right so with a consistent
nomenclature to be able to describe the
structure and what might be in that
structure and you know how we should
expect it to hey with certain behaviors
both verbally just like how we talk
about our UI and in code we can
accurately define like how are you I
should get built so what is a grid the
main purpose of a good is to set up
limitations to layout but with those
limitations comes many great qualities
like style familiar placement of items
and content in a cohesive feeling across
product let me walk you through some of
the rules and patterns that our grid
follows as we create a structure of
material design interfaces our 12 column
grid system allows for a wide variety of
layout here you can see we're combining
components like a toolbar a list and a
card the list takes out four column of
the grid we have one column of negative
space a six column card in another
column of a negative space this next
example is very similar but that we have
a extend a header and a car that goes
over the a bar and it follows the same
grid now let's remove the list
here we have a six column card we can
introduce something like a left panel
which you can see squeeze the grid to
the right notice that we still have a
six calm card the grid system isn't just
limited to layout with carts here we
have a left panel a list and a detail
view and it follows the same grid as we
just mentioned this last example there's
a left panel the overlay the grid
there's an extended at bar in a
persistent right panel notice that the
left panel has no effect on the grid or
the content I'll talk more in detail
about behaviors in just a moment for now
the most important thing is the
versatility of laying out various
material design apps using the same grid
system we've also defined guidance for
common margins and gutters here you can
see we're using 8 16 24 and 40 dips
margins and gutters if you're unfamiliar
a dip is a unit of measurement in which
the numbers and dependent of the density
of the screen dip density independent
pixel the most important thing here is
that we're defining we're focusing on
the margins and gutters to create
consistency in our layout rather than
defining the column width there are more
grid patterns our disposal here the
first example the grid is full width and
is squeezes content block as the screen
size changes in the second example the
grid is centered where blocks reflow
when a navigation is very important to
the flow of an app a left panel can be
permanently on-screen
I'm going to talk about two type of
behaviors here the first one is
persistent the second one is temporary
in the first example there is a
persistent panel coming from the left
here I can still interact with the
content and choose to remove the panel
the second example the panel is
temporary here I'll need to snap out in
order to get my content back this last
example is another variant of the
temporary behavior here you can see a
left panel can simply overlay content
successful handoff so you know we have
this idea of a consistent grid and now
we need to know what happens to that
grid as things different parameters
adaptive parameters change so to do that
in material design we've started to
align around certain breakpoint systems
that work across material products right
it looks pretty complex a little like
this it's you know it's kind it's kind
of complex but what we've done here is
we've done a detailed study of our
device landscape ranging from small
phones to super large desktop displays
let me break this down a little bit here
so you know on desktop we looked at
window sizes so you have an extra small
window and that goes all the way up to
like an extra large window on mobile we
have three basic sizes there's small
medium large small is like your Android
one devices mediums like a nexus 5 or an
iPhone 6 and largest a phablets you know
we also looked at tablet sizes so we
have small tablet sizes like a 7-inch
and large is like a 10-inch tablet and
then for landscape we calculate the
smallest width in either orientation as
a defining value so here's how the
landscapes look
and getting to some of the stuff that
you and was showing with the grid we've
also defined a few key points at which
that default grid starts to change based
on screen size so you can see above 840
here it's a 12 column grid system always
sometimes more when it gets bigger above
1600 but for the most part twelve
columns and then below that 842
basically 480 it's it's an eighth column
grid and then below 480 we use a four
column grid this helps us create
consistency in our layouts and
consistency in UI patterns the other
there's a two other things being pointed
by this one here and the two on 1600 so
basically at 600 what we found was it's
quite a small size so what we try and
say there is that you can sort of have
one level of content hierarchy on the
screen at a time so you have a list or a
detail and those are need to be sort of
layered that that's what that screen
size so once you go above that screen
size those can share the same screen
space so you have your list which might
be emails and your detail which might be
looking at one email and above 600 those
can share the screen space because we
have enough space for things like
typography line length and so that's
just like some of the things that this
is helping us define also noted at 1600
the grid can sort of hit at max width
and it can either you know become
centered or it can stay left aligned or
it can you know continue to grow as the
screen space grows so I know what you're
thinking you're thinking wow that is the
most beautiful illustration of
breakpoints I've ever seen I want to buy
this man many stroopwafels but please
dear God show me the code so
implementing breakpoints with polymer is
actually pretty straightforward and
there are two core concepts behind this
one that you're probably already
familiar with and one that you might
have played with before the first is CSS
media queries how many people here use
CSS media queries before basically
everyone so this is even Zacks UC system
he's got so media queries really
powerful now all of the breakpoints that
Zack was walking you through in his
beautiful illustration are currently
available in polymer starter kit so you
don't have to go you know wondering okay
well what number is that how do I fit
this in it's all it's already available
and the other primitive that we think
you'll find useful for building adaptive
UI is iron media query and we've had
this around for a while but iron media
query basically gives you data binding
on top of CSS media queries it's a it's
an element that's built on top of the
HTML match media API which lets us like
parse out media queries and do telogen
things with them did I pronounce that
correct HTML you're in charge HTML yeah
you're in charge you guys say HTML or
HTML I'm just gonna assume I'm right
okay right so you can see the API here
we've got a few tributes so we've got
query which is a beer CSS media query
we've got query matches which is a
boolean for just you know letting you
know whether or not a particular media
queries been matched and then we have an
event that lets you hook into whether
that that media queries been reached
called on query and match has changed
now together with these two primitives
we can actually build pretty powerful
things this is a new template that we've
been working on for blogs and we called
it super cool blog which is that's the
right way to pronounce that's the right
way it's the right way great I get my
paycheck this month fantastic
so here we've got super cool blog and
basically what we you just saw was a
grid of lots of different types of
content adapting to fit the context that
it's now in so we've adapted from a
desktop view over to a mobile view or
now just like stacking these cards on
top of each other because we're using
our media query we're also able to
achieve more complex effects like this
this kind of fancy header that you see
at the very top another thing that I've
been working on lately is a material
music prototype that looks a little bit
like this it's basically built using
neon animated pages so you get these you
know it's nice little transitions every
single time you select a different album
but the idea is that you have a slightly
more complex looking grid on desktop we
have a lot more screen real estate
anytime you select none we show you this
view but let's say that you switch to
context and you moved over to you know a
mobile device perhaps here we've adapted
this grid to make better use of the
space it's a slightly different type of
grid slightly simpler makes more sense
for your thumbs to be able to touch
these items and we also you know when
you and you select an item we just show
and hide UI to make best use of that
that's screen real estate that we've got
available so you know as we mentioned
when defining adaptive UI you know
sometimes the best user experiences take
more than just like reshuffling blocks
on a page and you know so what we're
currently in the process of doing on the
material design team like you know the
past couple months the next couple
months we're in the process of doing
this stuff right now is defining UI
patterns and working with polymer to
help us build some of these patterns
into components so I'm gonna walk you
through some of those and addy and I are
gonna try to trade the clicker without
fumbling it which we've done guys it for
but you know we've been pretty hard at
work on the material design team
reviewing hundreds of apps before
they've launched their material reviews
and what we found is that apps share
common architecture a lot of apps are
lists and just different variations of
lists so what we're trying to do is
define this as a pattern and be able to
provide those things with baked in with
our guidance like a lot so you can use
it a lot easier so there's just a lot of
themes that we found that reoccur and in
the reviews so the first theme is
basically position the position of
elements can be core to the
discoverability and the usability of a
nap when screen sizes change or we
change like from using a big clunky
finger to a mouse our expectations
change with what we with where we expect
to find certain UI elements so here's a
good example of that in material design
we have this big pink button sometimes
it's not pink but we call it the
floating action button and sometimes
it's like the most hierarchically
important button on a screen it's also
called the fab so you might hear me say
that on mobile this is pretty
discoverable because it's not you're not
that far away from it right
but when we move up to a larger screen
sometimes that thing if it stays in the
bottom right corner is a million pixels
away from everything else on the screen
so what we're saying is you can move
that thing like it doesn't need to stay
in the bottom right corner and I'm not
trying to say here that like here's the
new location of it
but like it can be relative to UI that
that is appropriate to the context of
the app that you're showing so things
can reposition there's other things that
reposition so basically we take that
theme and we're looking through all of
the various components in spec and
saying what else moves so there's things
like snack bars and menus and a lot of
other components so let's take a look at
how this was possible here cool so if
you've ever worked with a designer
you're probably used to them coming to
you with some mocks or some some motion
design videos and saying okay is this
gonna look as good when you code it up
and when someone does that to me I
usually say yeah yeah sure if by as good
as you mean not at all
thankfully thankfully when you're
building adaptive apps with polymer it's
it's not it's not really like that at
all
here we've got desktop view where we're
positioning our fab in the very top hand
corner and we're achieving this just
using CSS just using some
position:absolute when we change our
context and we switch over to mobile we
can actually display this closer to your
thumb again just using a very simple CSS
media query I'm using one of the
breakpoints from the material spec and
I'm just positioning it closer to the
bottom corner of the screen so that it's
actually closer to somewhere that you
can reach let's take a look at another
example so here we have a menu we've got
a paper menu that you can go and you can
select to have it expand now this type
of UI probably makes sense on desktop
because we've got a lot of available
screen real estate but if you switch
contexts once again to a mobile device
maybe you want to make sure that that's
a little bit closer to your users
fingertips and to do that we can use a
media query that will just stretch that
menu will change its position from the
top part of the screen to the very
bottom it'll stretch it's real estate so
it's taking up all the available space
and you know this is an example of us
reusing the same content in a component
but just changing its container around
little bit just making sure that it's in
the right position for your users so
that's a good transition here right when
we change containers we find this
happening a lot in material design apps
especially when things just change
drastic form factors right so
transformation patterns can also be
technically the most complex adaptations
of UI and also from the UX perspective
it's hard it's sometimes difficult to
understand when to do certain things but
we believe that components sometimes
need to transform from one form factor
to another so here's an example of that
we have a left nav on mobile because of
Android our users are familiar with this
pattern of navigation coming from the
left on mobile it's been built into a
lot of apps but you know we need that
same navigation is a responsive web app
that scales up to desktop we can
transform what was in that left nav into
something like tabs because it's more
discoverable it's not hid it's not a
hidden menu when it doesn't actually
need to be hidden so there's a lot of
things like this of components
transforming that we're looking at we
have things called bottom sheets in
material design and it's basically like
a menu that comes from the bottom of the
screen on mobile and when you touch
something here and something moves up
very small amount like that's not that
far but when you're on a big desktop
screen and you touch something way up
here and a small bottom sheet comes from
the bottom doesn't work so that needs to
transform into something else that's
relative to the context of an app and
there's a lot of other stuff so here we
have an example of this pattern
implemented using polymer on desktop
we've got some horizontal navigation
that are using tabs and have that suite
in effect and then if we switch context
over to mobile you'll see that we now
have moved all the navigation into the
drawer rather than repeating art are
different forms of now now this makes
sense because of the context that we're
using we accomplish this using iron
media query it's it's really really
powerful so here we can use the on query
matches changed event to hide the drawer
if the user happens to be you know if
the user is a developer basically and
they're resizing the screen but we can
also make sure that we're
using computed properties in this case
computer properties look a little bit
like this which basically allow us to
trigger tabs to be hidden if we're on a
smaller screen so here we're just doing
a little bit of class switching
so reflowing
is commonly what we think of when you
think of responsive design things move
as our screen size moves
if you've ever resized the window you
know that UI looks like when it reflows
but we're just trying to bake this theme
into the system so for example we have
this little polymer a clock widget and
on the top is this digital header and on
the bottom is an analog clock and it's a
small vertical screen but when we go to
a larger more horizontal screen the
architecture changes and we have the
clock on the left and the analog part on
the right so lots of reflowing will just
naturally happen another common
occurrence of this that Addie's going to
walk through is grid lists grid lists
are you know well I'll let addy walk
through it but first let's look at these
this clock here ok so Zach was just
talking about a clock example where it
adapts from being horizontal to vertical
depending on your context now the good
news is that the adaptive UI portion of
that example is pretty trivial to
implement using polymer the clock itself
took me many many hours to do and we're
no longer on speaking terms
but in Palmer we can achieve this effect
once again using iron media query and
we're using it to sort of trigger a
change in layout once again using
polymers layout classes or layout
attributes so you can switch from
horizontal to vertical depending on
whether you know you're on a small
screen like a phone or tablet or you're
on desktop let's take a look at another
example so most of you have probably
visited the polymer summit sites and
you've taken a look at the schedule if
all of this is completely foreign to you
and you're wondering what you're seeing
on screen
you were probably at the wrong
conference but stay around and maybe
you'll learn something about polymer
let's focus in on this grid for a moment
so we've got a grid here implanted using
polymer and this actually reflows so on
desktop we have these really thick cards
that have a lot of information lots of
interesting stuff going on but as soon
as we switch to a device with
Moeller screen real estate we actually
reflow this so they're now displaying
all of these cards not just vertically
but we've also sort of collapsed them so
if you're scrolling on your device
rather than having to scroll through the
full length card for every single
session the users can control of
deciding whether or not that expands so
we have three elements that power this
we have our iron media query of course
we have our schedule grid and we're
using iron Ajax just to power the data
behind this so let's focus in on just
the grid part of this so we've got our
schedule grid here and it's got media
query definitions for all of the
breakpoints that we're trying to target
and it basically will change the maximum
width of each of the cards as we decide
to switch between viewport sizes it also
defines defaults for margin and padding
because those things might also change
depending on the type of context that
you're in now we're taking advantage of
narrow layout over here which basically
allows us to use a useful pattern so
rather than having an iron media query
definition inside of every one of our
elements we're just using one and we're
passing its state down the whole way
through our data binding system it's
kind of neat and that just lets us
decide whether or not we're going to
collapse this card or keep it expanded
so a couple more patterns that I'll get
through a little quicker here there's
you know we're familiar with this
pattern of revealing UI as screen spaces
grow but here's a small example let's
say I have this sort of CMS or text
editor on mobile and as screen space
grows we reveal more powerful UI maybe
because a touch we went from finger to a
mouse or just because we have the
additional screen space to reveal more
UI so here you can see we added the font
editing and a few parameters for
justifying text revealing can also apply
to a lot of things like imagine you have
a small card that there's a lot of
content behind a click or behind a touch
on mobile but on desktop we revealed
more information in that same card
container
looking at divide which is another theme
this starts to get to the structure of
our applications so here's a good
example of the divide where you have
this thing on the left here is basically
three layers to an app you have a left
nav that's hidden you have a list and a
detail imagine this says Gmail but when
this grows you might have something
that's like a left nav and a list on a
detail just dividing into the space and
these kinds of things that were we know
how these patterns work we're trying to
wrap these as components and a lot of
the stuff that you an showed earlier
those are a lot of good sort of
component mashups that we're trying to
provide as responsive adaptive elements
to all of you because as we heard
earlier from Rob I heard that you're a
little lazy so we're trying to give you
that stuff for free yeah the other thing
yeah the other thing that we're looking
at is just respecting natural scrolling
directions so you know on mobile we
scroll vertically and we scroll
horizontally and on tablets especially I
scroll like this and you know but when
you go to a larger desktop and you're
using a scroll wheel that doesn't feel
right so we're just in the process of
asking the question like can we make an
adaptive component that changes
scrolling direction based on a break
point and then just very simply and
lastly surfaces expand so you have a
card on mobile and that card might
expand to either a column width or it
might extend to an incremental width so
yeah cool so we've been working on
another example of adaptive UI in
polymer this is the greenest application
in history but basically the idea is
that we're demonstrating a few different
patterns here we're demonstrating
transformation reflow and position so if
I switch up and say that I'm on a tablet
like a Nexus 7 you'll see that we
started off with a slightly thicker
header bar at the very top but we still
have kept that same effect on scroll we
switch up to Nexus 6 you'll see that
we've changed the position of that fab
so it's in the very bottom corner the
user can easily access it and we've also
got a slightly different paper drawer
panel and play
as well both of these things are
possible thanks to CSS media queries and
iron media query every time you guys
talk about UI patterns
so where were we
it is our goal to make making material
design apps easy let me introduce some
of the tools and resources that you
might find useful in building your apps
the aplia collection created by the
polymer team is available on github for
people to explore and build their own
templates and if you haven't check out
the paper elements in the polymeric
catalog you really should we also
created a device matrix reference using
this reference designers can quickly cat
key dimensions dye densities and other
matrix they need the latest wall and the
works is the resizer
by previewing web app and family shot
you can examine and compare if any your
elements adapt appropriately across
devices you can input any URL or choose
some of the pre-selected size in the
side drawer if you wanted to preview per
device you can navigate through the key
breakpoints that we'll introduce today
for desktop mobile and tablet yeah we
also have the material design spec you
can feel free to check that out to you
we're constantly updating and refining
the material design spec so what's next
the future of the web out of Web Apps
looks really amazing and we're looking
forward to all of the stuff that you
guys are going to make and the material
design team and polymer are just trying
to make it easier for you to build
things that we already know about and we
already feel like we have good system
for defining so with polymer we're
creating lots of demos like a do showing
we're creating more templates so that
you can inspect these things and pick
them apart and understand why we're
doing certain things that we consider to
be best practices you can also follow
the material
design team and just design all things
design happening at google talk about
design at a Developers Conference but
it's a you know we're doing a lot of
stuff here um and we have events coming
up where there's one coming up in London
and one coming up in New York there's a
lot of new articles there's one that's

logo that we just launched and some new
resources like the one that you and was
just showing there and these tools all
sort of these tools and all this
reference and guidance and stuff we're
trying to make it easier for designers
and engineers working together to build
really awesome things with material
design so with that thank you all for
