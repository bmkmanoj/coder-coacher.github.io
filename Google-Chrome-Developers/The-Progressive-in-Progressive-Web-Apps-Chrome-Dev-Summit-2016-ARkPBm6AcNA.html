to be almost done or happy sad it's over
anyway yeah I'm here today to talk to
you about keeping that progressive in
progressive Web Apps my name is Patrick
Kettner unlike what it says on my badge
apparently they thought the chrome team
needed another pall around so but my
badge is right I do work at Microsoft
despite what my t-shirt shows there I'm
just a conundrum of confusion it's just
a photo I take every year for my
birthday I get these pictures of cakes
every year my incredible partner Katrina
hi if you're watching he's usually here
with me but now over the last year or so
she's actually excuse me been spending a
lot more time at home because we just
had our first child Holden was born
thank you very much it's he's worth the
applause I know I'm pandering a little
bit but he's a he's a really really cool
baby um you know it's funny when you
when you first like have a kid like your
first kid all your co-workers all your
friends all your family give you like
kind of the same collection of advice
they all say like you know enjoy your
life while you still have one or you
know have fun eating while you can still
have time to do it or have fun sleeping
while you still are able to and it's
funny because with Holden like none of
that really applied he's been a super
easy baby he's really cute all the time
and he's just happy all like literally
happy all the time he got sick he's fine
now but he got sick and had to go to the
hospital and he was adorable in the
hospital like this is him with a fever
and it's sick and everything it's great
he's a crazy happy baby he's cute all
the time with one single exception and
that's when we go on drives he hates
getting into the car seat not so much
the drive itself but like being strapped
in he just I don't know he doesn't like
being like not able to move or something
and he just freaks out and that's fine
when you first bring him home we like
literally live a block away from the
hospital he was born in until we walked
home like we didn't see Drive it took us
a while to discover that he hated this
and you know it's fine and then after a
while I loved to travel and you know
Katrina puts up with me liking his
travel and eventually we grew kind of
sick of sitting at home getting a little
cabin fever and so we thought we would
pack up and go visit Whistler just up
outside of Bank
Washington work at Microsoft so I live
up by Seattle and you know knowing that
he hated being in the car seat knowing
he'd have to go into the car seat and
being a nerd I do something that I think
most of us would do is I go and try and
find out something online
I started hard on how to make it better
and so I look up how can I calm a baby
you look at all these different ways
that people suggest doing it it's my
first kid to forgive me and I found this
really neat video the frame rate is
going crazy it's usually slower than
this but it's basically this interesting
thing it's all it is is a video of
dancing kind of dots and it snaps him
out of it like that every single time
and I'm not quite sure what the science
behind it is but effectively just the
combination of the contrast and the
motion it just instantly he forgets why
he's crying and he's just like oh crap
there's all kinds of stuff and you know
he just keeps going and it literally
works within seconds every single time
and so I'm like oh sweet great got it
put him in the car freaks out show him
the video on my phone two seconds later
he's fine passed out and we go get in
the car
head up to Vancouver it's a beautiful
drive if you've never been Pacific
Northwest's where it's at we have a
wonderful day in the Whistler area it's
a great place to visit we go and see the
old Olympic Stadium that's him still
sleeping after getting there those dots
really work and you know we're there for
a few hours it's been a long day we get
ready to go onto our car and I strap him
in and he starts you know he wakes up as
soon as I put him in obviously and he
gets really upset soon as I do it and
some like I got you this time pull up my
phone is on my phone carrier I have like
free international roaming I hit play
and I get this and I get this and a
baby's crying and my partner Katrina is
starting to get upset because it's been
a good two minutes now where I'm just
talking at the phone and like it's
coming it's coming it's fine just don't
worry and I wait and I wait and it's
been five minutes literally five minutes
staying at this screen with the baby's
screaming getting more and more upset
and Katrina getting more and more upset
and me getting more and more frustrated
cuz I don't know about you guys but as a
person who works with technology
especially like web related stuff when
the web fails me I take it two super
personally looks like I'm like I could
have done this better something you did
was stupid and the whole time you know I
eventually were just like you know what
whatever I'm just gonna
we're gonna go and he'll cry and he'll
be fine and so we just hit the road I'm
just getting more and more frustrated
I'm like God just 2g completely ruined
my day that we had a nice time but this
my phone is just so frustrating and then
you know I started to get eventually he
cried himself to sleep and I was driving
I'm like you know it wasn't like the 2g
that ruined my day because that could
happen to anywhere there's no way
there's you know like YouTube can't just
send everything in like one bit or
whatever I it was really a defect it was
45 megabytes ruin my day that's the size
of this video and I was super lazy I
went out I found a solution and it
worked really well on my machine on my
incredibly fast home internet and it
functioned and I was happy with that
without thinking about the fact that
it's for a ton of people out there
I was it really really sucks when you're
in Canada on 2g and you have no way to
load this sure I could have like
pre-downloaded I should have done a lot
of things to make it better as an end
user but I couldn't have expected that
to happen and so eventually we get back
over the quarter eventually he is able
to be calmed down again we get back home
and you know I sit down still frustrated
with having been disappointed in myself
for being a lazy engineer and so I do
what I feel like a lot of people do is I
sit down I open my text editor and try
to make a better solution does work
JavaScript developers so we
reimplemented
so I open up my text editor and I open
up in and I'm ready to go and then I
realized that I'm terrible at anything
visual yeah I'm like the maintainer for
moderniser I can JavaScript around tons
of people all the time but anything
visual related I'm just horrible at so
I'm like it's fine it's just a bunch of
dots dancing and then I've like I have
no idea how that makes that happen like
I can put a dot on the screen I can do a
basic canvas or something like that but
I don't know how to move stuff and so
it's it no wait no wait no idea what to
do and so wise man once said when you
don't have a better idea you can buy a
novelty domain that's exactly what I did
and I I went out and I bought hush
little baby and in that time that it
took me to come up with this hilarious
domain name I was lucky enough to put
out a tweet on there saying like does
anybody can anyone explain how to do
this and Sarah sue Diane and I'm sorry
for pronouncing it wrong Sarah
trying hard though I said like oh you
should check out green sock and if you
guys don't know green sock is a
phenomenal animation library it's kind
of like a jQuery for animation but
ignore the jQuery animate part it's
really really good it's super performing
it's super fast it works really great
for JavaScript type manipulations and it
worked I was like holy crap I got this
whole thing working literally within
like an hour was less than 6 K for the
initial rendering and the initial
animation I lazy load in a like an mp3
file so it gets you know up like 2 Meg's
or whatever but that's fine and it works
incredibly fine edit a serviceworker
obviously because I didn't ever want to
be stuck in Canada with a crying baby
again and you know it's a super simple
serviceworker this is one of the first
ones I ever shipped in a personal
product and I was happy with how little
code it was you know I do obviously a
feature detection for serviceworker and
then this was basically our entirety of
the serviceworker it's just a simple
like a pre cache step so we obviously on
our install we grabbed that event we
have a array of URLs of files that we
will definitely always have and then we
grab that event we open up the cache
that we have for it and then once that
resolves we prefetch every single one of
those with a simple request and put it
in our cache and then we just also have
a very simple fetch step where in case I
add something that it'll mean later and
I don't add it to the prefetch step it's
just you know automatically added there
as well
we check to see if it's in the cache and
if it is we respond with it and if it's
not we do fire off another fetch it's
you know really it's literally that's
the entire content of our serviceworker
just transpiled out of es6 and it was
great we had all this like super smooth
working stuff I was super excited
because you know Holden got upset
because he ran out of a bottle before he
finished it cuz he eats a lot and I
picked up my phone and I boom and he
stopped and I felt like super dead and I
was so excited I ran over I showed
Katrina she was excited you know cuz you
know it's a bait when no one likes a
baby crying you want him to feel better
and so she takes him into his room later
and he we're in an old building for
America I know I've British friends who
make fun of that but it's like a hundred
years old which is ancient for Seattle
and it's like thick brick walls and
everything and so in his bedroom we have
terrible cell phone reception and so
she's like he starts crying I put him
into bed she's putting her into bed and
pulls out her iPhone
and then she goes to open up the phone
down and get this crap once again I felt
like it's just an absolutely terrible
you know problem solver this same
problem happened just because I had made
it work perfectly on my phone for my one
solution and so the problem is that it
had no iOS support as we all know there
is no service workers support within iOS
and so I had to sit back and think about
what to do and a wise man once said when
you don't have a better idea try out app
cache and yes that app cache it's
terrible it's terrible it's awful I'm
not suggesting that people actually
super try it out but what I am
suggesting is that you don't immediately
discount technology that you hear is
terrible there is a lot of stuff that
browsers have been shipping for a very
long time
that might be able to meet your
solutions I work at Microsoft I hear
about old crap all the time you know
stuff that we've been doing in IE 5 that
is just now coming like Jay like Jake
mentioned you know that the navigation
transitions there's you know there's all
kinds of stuff that we did a long time
ago that might still be useful
occasionally it's worth checking out the
very least it's worth knowing what we
did wrong on these old specs like
application cache and in this case what
I was doing oh yeah actually it's so bad
that it's being removed from HTML I
don't know how many things you know of
that are actually actively removed from
the HTML spec but this is one of them we
all agree that this is terrible and
needs to be purged from our collective
memory but app cache is incredibly well
supported across the board as long as
you're not developing for like Opera
Mini or god forbid old ie like you are
pretty much guaranteed to have an app
cache support and for some a site that's
as simple as the one I made which is
obviously much less
complex and I'm sure most of the things
you guys would ever make it's um really
really straightforward and actually fits
all of our use cases and so we just take
our future detect from before and we add
another little feature detect I don't
know I a lot of people actually have
never used application cache and so you
might not be aware that in order to use
it it's actually an HTML attribute that
exists on the HTML element and that has
to be there at the very top of the page
at load time you can't like dynamically
inject it it's not again it's a horrible
API it's a giant douche bag the
attribute has to be a curse time and so
in order to get it onto the page you
have to
and over backwards and do it this way
and so inside of this check what I ended
up doing is creating an iframe a hide
that iframe and then it's a give it the
source attribute of like a specific page
that only loads loading an app cache it
basically just has that attribute and
then I append that at the bottom of the
page this is the entire contents of that
HTML document it's super super small it
does almost nothing but it gets that app
cache in there and it starts downloading
all the assets and so that those assets
that I have in my pre FETs cache I'm
able to take that and through like a
little web pack transform turned it into
a web manifest or an app sorry an app
cache thing out of there and the cache
manifest is a really simple file formats
one of the reasons why it's terrible
it's cuz it's super like if you do this
one thing it makes sense and nothing
else so we had the cache manifest and
then the files that we had before and
then we also have to have like this
network star at the bottom the reason
for that being that app cache um
automatically assumes that it knows
everything and any URL that is not on
this list will automatically 404 even if
you're online it's a terrible API it's
really really crappy but if you know
this edges and if you know what to do
when how to get around those problems it
can be useful check out crappy API is
because there might be like a little
glimmer of something useful inside of it
um it's a douchebag don't forget it
but check it out don't immediately
assume that just cuz you've heard of
technology whether it's something built
into the browser or a library or
anything else is terrible just cuz you
heard it's terrible find out for
yourself and learn in fact I was
thinking about while I'm doing terrible
ideas I was remembering when I very
first started in websites and we had
this anybody remember dhtml anybody ever
had that on the resume yes thank you
yeah does anybody ever write an HT a a
hypertext application thank you thank
you thank you yeah
so I made it into a hypertext
application as well because why not and
so what I did was after all those text
checks I shipped this as a I check to
see if it's up old Microsoft oh I'm
sorry a hyper HTA or hypertext
application is a proprietary offline
application shipped in Microsoft
Internet Explorer 5 it's terrible um but
but it exists and I figured I was
already doing stupid anyway so when
I have some fun so if you go to this
website hush little baby and ie you
actually get this huge pop up because
there's no reason to be using old ie
unless you're checking out the fact that
I was stupid enough to add an H ta and
if you download it you get this
experience you get this huge nice little
one window pop-up it has this little
icon in the corner that's basically the
only fancy thing about it it has a flash
audio player because if we fall back
from the web audio player we load a
flash player and so you have the full
experience again just because it's fun
but it's stupid the whole point that I'm
making is that technique that PWA is
like Jake mentioned are only been in a
kind of a collective collective
concept of a PWA is new when francis
Behrman came up with that only a year
ago back in like june of last year but
the tools behind it the things the
fundamental pieces of pwace have existed
for a very very long time this offline
application is not a new concept there's
a lot of pieces of the web and a lot of
pieces of pwace that aren't new concepts
they're just finally good versions of
concepts that we've tried to do multiple
times and there's a lot of things that
you can do today to kind of implement
that and one of the things I hear
regularly from people is that they're
really excited about pwace but they
can't ship them today because they can't
wait to do a full reef site architecture
I can't wait to implement all these
different features and that's just not
true you don't have to wait to do this
stuff you can start implementing pieces
today for example it's alright yeah I
forgot my fault leader it's on a radical
new way to create websites it's erratic
it can also be a radical new way to
update websites you can do stuff today
on your website that already exists for
example the web app manifest in case you
haven't ever seen it it's a very simple
a spec it's a very simple document all
it is is a JSON object that is exists as
a file on your page you have stuff like
your language that should be the text
Direction the name of your documents the
description of stuff so it can show up
in like um application manager page Oh
an array of icons so that you can just
support a bunch of different devices
it's even stuff like orientation you can
finally lock your screen to landscape or
you can do stuff like a theme color so
you could affect say the title bar on
Android or maybe like the color of
Cortana on Windows we're looking into
what we can do with that you can even
actually specify really
applications if for some reason your
company thinks a native application is
better but they're still cool enough to
do a PWA you can say if the user has
this native application installed fall
back to it if they also have that and
you can do toggle that with you prefer
related applications like it's super
super simple to do this and the great
thing about it is there's no JavaScript
API to this concept it's just an HTML
tag that you inject into your page you
have that one JSON document you add it
to your page and you are on your way to
having a PWA just inject it in there
and you might be noticing actually sorry
one of the cool things I wanted to
actually talk about was that oh we are
really really excited about pwace on
edge and one thing that the Bing team is
actually going to be doing is crawling
the web to look for these sites that
have web manifests and when they do we
believe we're gonna actually be
ingesting them into the Windows Store
automatically for you and so you can
easily opt out of this if you don't want
to have it as a part of it but you what
will happen is you automatically get
interested into millions and millions of
Windows users you have this ability to
reach out to them and once you're
involved in our Windows Store
automatically we like you've just by
shipping this web manifest you can start
doing feature detection for the windows
WinRT API so that's basically it should
pretty much any Windows API that you
have access to you've got full access to
in JavaScript we started doing this work
in AI windows 8 and it's available there
so you can do stuff like integrate with
the system calendar just by doing a
simple feature detection script and then
checking to see if you're in Windows if
it is so a full calendar you can
integrate with Cortana you can integrate
with a lot of low-level things and have
a truly native application feel in
website code that you ship out
automatically just by adding a manifest
it's a really cool thing to check out
and to make it even simpler you know so
I was sitting and thinking about how
frustratingly simple but also redundant
a lot of this information was you have
that JSON object and a lot of that
information that's on that JSON object
is already in your application and all
these meta tags that we've had this
shelving to this tag soup at the top of
our page for a long time now and so I
created this note application sorry a
node plugin module thing called
manifestation it takes a URL and then
gives a call back to you that just
generates a the most fully featured web
manifests object it can create and it's
really
tries to be extremely full-featured like
for example our language detection it
loads up the whole page using cheerio
just like a server-side jQuery and CLD
the compact language detection which is
a it's a binary object it's very similar
like how Google Translate work so it can
actually look at the context of words
and how they're used in tell the
difference between Portuguese and
Spanish or something like that and so we
go ahead and load up the HTML of your
page we go in check for the language
attribute if that doesn't exist we go
and check for the XML language attribute
because you might be making in HTA and
do a PWA for some reason uh you eads
then after that check the DC language ad
should be dublin core if we have any
librarians in the house it's like a supe
it's a really old meta tag that no one
uses but if it does exist we want to use
it in there and then after that we'll
fall back to see LD where we'll actually
look at every single word on your page
parses HTML and try to automatically
detect what the document is just like
you would do if you open up Chrome it's
a foreign language it says I can't you
want to translate this from Portuguese
it's exactly the same type of concept
and so after all that we strength we
send back a string of what that language
might be that's just one of the
detection that we do there's for every
single field on web manifest we have one
this is the beginning at the top of like
a 200 line file for images where we go
and scrape every single image that's
declared as an icon we download it check
to size ensure that the mime type is
correct and sure that the extension is
correct and do all this stuff and
generate the full icon array for you
automatically in fact it's so easy to do
this I made a website so that all y'all
can do it like literally right now you
can go to web manifest this website it
exists it says cool domain it's super
simple again I love stupid domains you
just go there and you put in the URL hit
submit and it will download your web
manifest file that'll automatically be
generated from the code on your site
already you don't have to do anything
you just download this you add it as
that link tag and it works it's great
and you at the beginning of having a PWA
and you can be ingested in the Bing
store soon um yeah you just get this
pop-up download you got it it's awesome
it's what manifest it's a super simple
thing if you want to end up changing
what I do because we try to be fully
featured you might want to remove some
of that stuff if you think it's
unnecessary we I added a short URL to
the validator you can just go there
excuse me you paste in your JSON object
that you've modified and I'll tell you
what
it's valid if you have an invalid
manifest file it actually won't count as
a manifest at all in like Chrome or
Android or anything else that's shipping
it so you won't it won't work basically
you would be blocked from doing a p2p
way I'm gonna make sure that you have a
valid piece of JSON object also the spec
on this is really pretty simple and so
if you've ever been interested in doing
w3c work if you've ever been interested
in getting more involved this is a great
one to dive into it's a small group
we're all super friendly we'd love to
get more feedback on this stuff and if
you guys have stuff that you want to be
involved it's a great one to check out
it's a really fun thing to work on and
so while we're talking about like stuff
you can do today you know like you don't
have to wait for all these new features
to come like Jake just blew I think our
collective minds with the stuff that's
coming in the future and there's a lot
of really fun stuff but there's also
stuff that you can do for a long time on
the web that is amazing take for example
web workers um they actually landed in
WebKit back in 2008 and 2008 in web
years is just geologically the Chrome
icon here's wrong it actually was dead
back in 2008 like it is a really really
long time ago and a lot of things have
changed I mean ie8 wasn't even released
yet it was a long time ago and yet then
but since it's been around for so long
it's phenomenally supported it supported
pretty much everywhere it's back to ie
10 it's it's really really cool and if
you're not familiar with web workers
it's a really simple API if you has
anybody here ever implement like a
scroll handler like on scroll don't lie
it's a quick
we're among friends yeah it's terrible
right like you instantly jank up your
whole page and that's because everything
on a browser is completely single
threaded right because the Briscoe the
browser doesn't know are you going to
modify everything in the Dom in that
scroll handler so I can't read layout
stuff until your scroll handlers
finished because it would be wasting
work it's sucks because most of the time
you're probably not but it can't trust
you and so what a web worker does is it
give us the concept of having a
background thread you're able to say
like it gives you a new JavaScript
context that has no access to the Dom
that you send like strings or possibly
objects to depending on the version of
web workers you're working with and it
say like hey go calculate this and then
send back the results and then and it
can do that completely in the background
in it so it can do some really hardcore
heavy number crunch
without in any way affecting your scroll
performance you can do a lot of really
cool stuff with it
take for example pokedex dot org I'm
sure a lot of us saw this it's a nolan
lawson one of my amazing co-workers
created this website as a really
advanced PWA does an incredible
performance on the site and part of the
things that makes it so fast is because
it's like a react issue powered thing
it's using virtual DOM and it actually
calculates the virtual Dom differences
inside of a web worker and then since
back the diffs in between so it's able
to render stuff faster it's something
the react team is actually investigating
currently is doing virtual Dom diffing
inside of a web worker it uses like I
said virtual Dom it has this concept
where it gets the diff it sends it over
to the UI thread where it applies all
that stuff and I don't know this is this
looks important I'm concluded it because
it looks sciency um so but the cool
thing is you have this phone this is a
Nexus S which is this I think five or
six year old phone I'm at I should know
this I'm at a Google conference I'm
sorry but you get incredible performance
this is a reason this is like he just
did this last year and it's phenomenally
fast and look at how smooth that
animation is began one of the things
that he credits is being able to do this
so well is by doing his Dom diffing
inside of a web worker
there's tons of crazy cool stuff you can
do in web workers take for example
moderniser like I said I'm the
maintainer we have our website our
dynamic builder is completely
client-side I've built in a whole lot of
stupid stuff into it like I showed you
the HTA right now and all these
different things are check boxes and
every single time you check one of those
off it'll go ahead and download the
entire module they're all modular pieces
right and one of the problems we had on
the moderniser team is that people were
in including the entire bill to
modernizer
and as we grow to more than almost 300
modules that can be a gigantic piece of
JavaScript and frankly most of you don't
need to know whether or not
border-radius is supported in the
browser right all these tests all this
code that isn't running that we didn't
want to include and so to make people
aware of what they're doing when they
start checking off features we actually
have a gzip calculator up in the corner
and so as you check stuff off it updates
and we do that full gzip comparison
inside of a web worker in the browser
without ever going to the server we're
able to do that
because of what you we and we're able to
do that every single time you click off
stuff because web workers are so cool
you know it
a defector scrolling your performance
the animations or anything else it's
just a really silky smooth fast
experience and you're able to get some
really neat information in fact I love
web workers I like to push them as much
as I can so much so that I'm looking
into a new project right now that I've
been working on where it has a terrible
name if anybody has a better idea I call
it web worker preprocessors so we've all
used transpilers we've all used stuff
like Hamel or Jade or other stuff like
that I love them I want to take them and
run them on on this client side I love
sites like jsbin or code pen but I want
them to be a PWA I want to be able to
run that offline and so what this is
doing is actually a tool chain that
automatically creates cross compiled
version it transpires transpilers to run
inside of web workers I have a number of
ones already working including some Ruby
based ones we have stuff like what do we
have we have less support slim support
pug Jade the old version of pug we have
autoprefixer and even Hamill and I'm
currently working on sass and it they
work does that the Ruby stuff's actually
transpiled using a cool project called
opal which takes Ruby code and transpose
it into JavaScript and if they work I
have every single version of slim a
similar to Hamill ruby version
throughout its get range
like literally 58 versions of it running
inside of a web worker passing their own
full test suite and it works and it
works really well if you're interested
I'd love to talk about it because this
might like this is what I've been doing
at night it's a lot of fun but the point
is web workers are cool you can do a lot
of crazy cool stuff like cross compile
of Ruby into JavaScript and in order to
compile your templates it's complicated
but I think you all know what I'm
talking about and the whole point of
what I'm saying with all this nonsense
and stupid ideas is that you know when
you build stuff try out something stupid
you know like there's a lot we can do
all kinds of really crazy cool stuff on
the web and you shouldn't be thinking
that you have to wait for it to be
supported everywhere to do something
stupid try something cool today in one
browser if it features supported in one
place be it Safari be it edge be it
Chrome be it Firefox try it out feature
detect do it and ship a feature the way
that browsers actually decide on whether
or not to support a feature are based on
what you all do if everyone wants to say
if everyone started using web components
back
when they first were introduced and
everybody would be supported on web
components it's this weird like prisoner
dilemma where people think that they
have to wait for browsers but browsers
wait for the people who just start using
stuff that's interest you give the
developers feedback give the spec
author's feedback and make really cool
stuff you know and so you don't need to
wait for a real texture in order to
start shipping a PWA you can start
shipping individual pieces like the web
manifest like a really simple cash
cashing service worker today you can do
it today literally right now almost
every single site that can implement
that stupid eighteen line service worker
that I had in a way and you will
instantly your whole site might not work
offline but you can have faster caching
you can have a faster load from almost
all your users try out the new Sahni
features and try it out today try
something stupid the web's really cool
