an episode on dev tools we're going to
talk about our newer progressive web app
tooling yeah so the reason we have to do
this is we recorded an entire video
episode and then everything changed it's
Tuesday so dev tools has changed right
so the resources panel has now been
replaced by the shiny new application
panel so I'm currently on progressive
web app there's two smaller pictures and
some of the newer stuff that we we let
you preview include like your web app
manifest yeah so basically web app
manifest is kind of if you've ever built
web apps you've had to do icons for
different devices and browsers and you
had to put in lots of link tags manifest
is JSON file where you can put all of
that stuff in one separate resource and
the browser will only go and grab it
when it needs it yep so we summarized
everything from like your name your
short name through the different theme
colors and background colors that you're
using we show you your orientation
chosen in your manifest file and then
just like preview all the different icon
sizes you might have set up so I've got
like all of them because I'm crazy you
are crazy I'm crazy it also lets you
emulate as a home screen if you click on
this little link here that's just like
the experience where I'll show you okay
well what you want to name this thing so
the reason this is important is because
whenever you click on Add to Home screen
what it will do is it will go through
all of the criteria that chrome looks
for to basically decide whether it's
gonna show the user the banner or not so
it'll be things like does the web app
have a serviceworker does it have a
short name just have theme color and if
any of those criteria aren't met
it will print out an error to the
console just saying yep you need to have
this and because it's not that I can't
do that home screen cool so next thing
we take a look at is the serviceworker
panel so debugging serviceworker has
been like historically really really
painful and I think dev tools is nicely
evolved over time to make that
experience a little bit sweeter yeah
this is definitely like the best version
of it it's it's just really hard when
you're starting out to understand what
is going on when you're doing this stuff
for the first
but I think this definitely like the
nicest version so far
yes we're gonna quickly walk through all
the options here so the first one is an
offline checkbox and basically if we go
when we refresh you'll see that what the
app is working offline this just
emulates offline in the same way that
the network throttling drop-down will
let you do nice fairly useful when
you're testing offline support with
serviceworker the next option is update
on reload which forces your
serviceworker script to update refresh
so the reason this is a super handy is
before this existed what you'd have to
do is you'd make an edit to your
serviceworker you'd save it you'd go
back into your browser you'd refresh and
once you've refreshed the page it will
still be using the old serviceworker
because your new service worker will be
grabbed by the browser it will go
through and install stair and the new
serviceworker can't take over the page
until the old one's gone so when you
check update on reload what it's doing
is it will unregister the old
serviceworker register the new one and
once the new one's ready to go it will
refresh the page so that the page is
using the new serviceworker so it's one
check box so there's kind of a lot of
stuff going on behind the scenes and
it's super useful next up we've got
bypass from Network which will bypass
your serviceworker scripts and load
resources from the network the reason
this is handy is when you're not working
on a serviceworker and you're working on
other files you don't want anything to
be pulled from the cache you just want
to be using the files that you've just
changed then we've got show all and sure
would basically show you every single
serviceworker that's registered because
we've got like an increasing number of
sites and apps using this you might find
this a little bit noisy I just say give
very unlikely to ever want this and tell
something like foreign service workers
come in that yeah we switch letting you
know that it exists okay unless they
change it tomorrow but it's here today
at least what else does this let you do
ok so you can update your serviceworker
there's a push option as well what does
that do let's let's head over to your
demo I'm gonna guess it's gonna do
something with push messages you're so
bright path you right so this is a push
demo matt wrote a while back we're gonna
go and we're gonna enable push
notifications and your demo worked this
yes right so what we're gonna do is if
we click push it's gonna emulate a push
of it and you'll see that we get a push
this is kind of interesting because this
is the first time I've actually seen or
like tested this myself in Canary and
they basically added a new feature where
it's it's populating a little bit of
data in there which is kind of super
interesting slightly weird with the fact
that you can't determine what the data
is but it's awesome that it's there
because it does mean that if you wanted
to check what data would look like when
it comes in your serviceworker mean it's
now something's there it's awesome sweet
what happens if we click send a push via
xhr does anything happen you should do
it should do it actually
oh I didn't there yeah I don't know you
did GCM just took a while to kick in
okay so there because there's no data
it's just like a super generic AAA
thanks for sending this message sweet
you can also go and click on the little
name oh you've got a minified
serviceworker okay let's let's go to
someone who hasn't done that and if we
click on source you can go and you can
check out the source to show he just
doesn't care about users data so
offensive so the reason this is actually
super cool is the fact that you can now
have breakpoints to your serviceworker
like you would any normal javascript
file so when that code gets executed in
the serviceworker it will actually stop
the serviceworker from running and you
can start debugging stuff like you
normally would with dev tools which is
noise sweet you can also so you can see
that we've got like these activity
indicators for the status so green means
that something is active then it's
running you can stop your serviceworker
so we can go and do that they'll say
activate and stopped you can focus your
client so we're currently focused you
can also hit details and I'll show you
inline any of the exceptions or error
messages you can getting so the one
thing that used to exist here that's
been removed you should be able to have
like an inspect button that you would
click it would open up an entirely
different dev tools just for
serviceworker
I still kind of like having the two dev
tools one for the page from for
serviceworker but I think the dev tools
team you're trying to get everyone to
work just out of the one dev tools and
change different contexts so in this
case all the serviceworker logs would
show up in the one console and you
select different frames within that
so it's kind of interesting this the
only thing that I'm anxious about I
guess but this is quite a nice way of at
least servicing just the errors because
I made easy I'm just gonna click clear
and now all of our problems have gone
great for any life was that simple I
mean life is that simple clear storage
is basically the best thing ever if
you're developing any non-trivial
progressive web app and you know you're
trying to support offline with service
workers you're maybe using you know
storage mechanism like indexdb or local
storage recession storage you've
probably run into the situation where
you know you need to manually go in and
clear all of your different storage
mechanisms out and then head to
different panels unregister service
workers and it's just it's this whole
super tedious thing
yeah I've ended up writing helper
scripts that I just drop into the
console to delete everything it's yeah
it's annoying when you get to that point
so in an effort to make Matt gaunt
redundant there's now like a queer site
well that'll eight quickly there's now
clear site data button
I think the label for this might might
be changing this the button is still
there basically what this does is it
almost resets the world for you which is
kind of really nice it does all the
things that says above like it will
unregister your service workers and your
storage and clear out your cache API
storage and yeah this does seem like an
obvious feature but at the same time it
hasn't existed for the longest time and
when you start working on service
workers you realize how quickly you just
get into a mess and you just want to
reset everything and the old solution
for that was to just develop in
incognito windows so this is super
welcome this is this is so nice we were
talking about cache storage because this
is this is was resources panel you can
still go in and debug all of your
different storage mechanisms that
includes the cache API so in the case of
my app I'm using sw-precache
of all these entries but someone like
Paul Lewis's voice memos app we go in
here and you'll just see that there's
like there's an entry that's got all the
different files listed that he's got
cached in the cache API I wonder why the
response is empty so it's all perfect
it's all perfectly perfect and you've
also got other options in here like
frames
don't just say that like it is no one
knows what frames is I don't know what
this does anymore it's basically a
breakdown of diff
yes but let's assume that it does that
maybe maybe this gives us something to
do another episode on next week on
totally throwing many tips what is
frames under applications tab alright so
I feel I feel enlightens that is that is
the application tab is there anything
we're forgetting you've got device are
on this screenshot that device ah so uh
canary dev tools now let's you like
preview device art for for a few
different devices we got the Nexus 5x in
there I think the six might also have it
does not it does in the very very latest
version I think it says it coming I
think it's coming
but basically device art is awesome just
lets you like see what it would maybe
look like on an actual device and it
adds in my the navigation bar at the top
but yeah it's going you can go in here
and like get your no navigation bar in I
have asked for us to like take theme
color into town oh yeah you could do
that yeah that'd be really nice and then
oh yeah assume that by the time you've
seen this maybe we've convinced them and
this is already out to date and if not
raise issues reason maybe we can get it
alright so that that is the application
tab hopefully you'll find that a lot of
this stuff makes it a lot easier to
develop and debug your progressive web
apps that's it from us thanks for
listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
