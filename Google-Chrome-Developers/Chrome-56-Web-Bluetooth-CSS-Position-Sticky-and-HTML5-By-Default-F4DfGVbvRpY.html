Bluetooth low-energy devices using the
web Bluetooth API resistant sticky is
back making it easy to create elements
that scroll normally until sticking to
the top of the viewport and HTML slides
by default is enabled for all users I'm
Pete LePage let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in chrome 56 until
now the ability to interact with
Bluetooth devices has been possible only
for native apps with chrome 56 your web
app can communicate with nearby
Bluetooth low-energy devices in a secure
and private manner using the web
Bluetooth API so web Bluetooth API uses
the gap protocol which enables your app
to connect to devices such as light
bulbs toys heartrate monitors
LED displays and more with just a few
lines of JavaScript web Bluetooth can
also be combined with physical web
beacons to discover and control nearby
devices francois has a great article on
updates and be sure to check out some of
the cool demos that go along with it
previously building content headers
scrolled normally until sticking to the
top of the viewport required listening
to scroll event and switching an
elements position from relative to fixed
at a specified threshold it was
difficult to synchronize and often
resulted in small visual drums chrome
now support CSS position sticky a new
way to position element an element that
is position sticky starts relative but
becomes fixed after the element reaches
a certain scroll position simply set
position sticky and set a threshold for
it Paul Kinlan has an update post about
it linked in the description last August
we announced that we'd be moving html5
by default to offer a safer and more
power-efficient experience this change
disables the Adobe Flash Player unless
there's a user indication that they want
Flash content on specific site and
eventually all web sites
will require the users permission to run
flash in chrome 56 html5 by default has
been enabled for all users which means
that they will be prompted to run flash
on a site by site basis for sites that
they've never visited before more
details about how and when users will be
prompted and recommendations on how to
test your flash site are linked in the
description below
of course there's plenty more web PR is
available as an origin trial the WebGL
2.0 API is now available and the payment
request API has a variety of new
features check the description for more
details and links to documentation and
specifications if you want to stay up to
date with chrome and know it's coming be
sure to subscribe and follow chromium
dev on Twitter I'm Pete LePage and as
soon as chrome 57 is released I'll be
right here to tell you what's new in
Chrome
