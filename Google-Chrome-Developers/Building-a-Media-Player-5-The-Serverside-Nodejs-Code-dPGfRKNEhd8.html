developer diary so to this point I've
shown prototypes and explained a little
bit of theory but finally finally but
finally we actually get on to talking
about what's been going on in the actual
application code and in this entry I
think I'm going to mostly concentrate on
the server-side so firstly I suppose I
need to acknowledge that a lot of this
code really came from Surma if you've
not seen our supercharged episode where
he talked about server-side rendering
definitely watch that it was a live
stream way he took about an hour or so
and built a relatively straightforward
handlebars based Express based with
caching headers server-side rendering
thingy setup and I guess yeah a lot of
this is sort of the ideas anyway have
been picked up from there about how to
do some of the caching and so on and and
it was also server who told me about the
Express sub apps or Express apps that
you can actually have lots of them but
more of that in a moment because well
there's code to look at so let's have a
dive in and see what's there so this is
actually the server as it runs today
which largely involves getting a copy of
Express making a an app to kind of wrap
everything else and I'm running all my
stuff on the Flex containers in Google's
App Engine - what you can do there is
you can boot up a container which runs
node it's great does you know it's like
that and then it wraps it in kind of
auto scaling load balancing stuff it's
really really quite handy for like this
but it passes in the port as part of a
the environment variable so we basically
pick that up and that's what we run on
whatever it tells us to run on beyond
that there's some middleware and I'll
come back to some of this in a moment
I have also got passports enabled which
is a way to do
ooofff if you need to do it and I'm not
sure if I'm going to or not whether I'll
have an admin area or whether I'll have
a place where people can actually log in
so they can see their own you know what
they've rated or whatever I'm not sure
but I've put it in here just for now in
case I need it but the interesting ones
actually kick in below so there is an
app here for static so anything that
begins slash static I hand off to this
app which is under apps statics let me
have a have a quick look under there and
this is actually relatively
straightforward this one it's basically
going to call express dot static with a
path and the ops and the ops is that we
want anything that comes from slash
static to have an age of one year on it
so it will expire in one year not a
moment sooner apparently but that's the
idea we're going to say anything the
begins flash static grab it from the
English case actually goes to the client
folder which is up here and grab lit
from there come back to that I suspect
in a little bit so anything that begins
slash static which is like images the
manifest so on and so forth go and go
and grab those from there the
authentication one I'm not going to get
into that right now that's the stuff
that would use passport because I'm not
sure if it's actually going to survive
if I actually need it or not there isn't
a lot of point in me just showing that
just yet if I do do anything that
requires it I'll come back and explain
that case mostly placeholder which is
the same of the admin it's just me kind
of testing the earth stuff the I tell
you what will jump over the
serviceworker one and we'll come back to
it in a bit
most of the app is actually served
through this dynamic one this dynamic
app so let me show you around that a
little bit so this is not dissimilar to
the static one except it's way way
bigger is its own Express app I call
dynamic I'm using adhara
add a row hey this is the problem with
reading names online you never know how
to pronounce them and then you have to
say them out loud and there's a good
chance that you're going to look like an
idiot I don't need much help to look
like an idiot just so you know glad we
have this check anyway i'm using i'm
going to say add arrow i think and if
it's wrong oh well and what that does is
it wraps dust j s so does j s is an
alternative to handlebars or
is any of those really I wanted to give
it a go because it supports promises and
streams as I understand it so that you
can in theory at least if you want to
make your templates or build them a
thing so if you need to do something
which requires a little bit of acing
work then you're not blocking forever
while that happens all the same it seems
like an interesting thing to go and play
with so that's what I'm doing in order
to make it work in no dough you need a
wrapper around the stairs and that's
what Adaro is then we have a bunch of
kind of setup stuff really which gets me
things that I need about reading my
video library information about the
videos that I've got information about
the actual package itself cuz I use
things like the version number in the
package Jason to stamp certain files to
make sure that all works I have a bunch
of helpers which again we can come back
to which are their helpers to help me
with the templates that justice is going
to create finally we have a little bit
of setup here for the actual default
view like what the title is going to be
the page what scripts we need and so on
then we step into the actual config of
the engine where we can say write create
dust engine set up the views to use the
view path and also anything that comes
from the dynamic side is going to be
HTML and therefore I don't want it to to
cache at all so if you remember the
stuff in the splash static it had a
one-year expiry stuff from dynamic I
want it to expire immediately I never
want it to be cached because what we're
going to do is okay I good I call it
cash in hash you could do caching
grabbed hashing grab cash in hash and
grab any of the above whatever you like
but I call it caching and hashing and
this is something that I definitely got
from Surma so we'll talk about that more
in a moment but the idea is first of all
anything that HTML don't cache that
anything that is from slash static
definitely cache that and cache it for a
year right so anything that's let's talk
about this little this is one of the
roots in it the the home page we grab
the default view options
we add in the things that we need to add
specifically for that mule I which is
the featured video which are the newest
video any things that we want in lines
like the JavaScript and the CSS any
particular scripts that we want to add
to that and then we find it's called dot
render against it with the template that
we've got which is home and that's it it
will basically render that out and send
that back to the client
works just great okay let's talk more
more about the the caching hash stuff
the idea is that if you have a an HTML
file with path to say the manifest or
the JavaScript or the CSS and any of
those change you need to flag that to
the browser because you've said anything
that comes from slash static light your
JavaScript like to see is a slight in
one of us they should be cached for a
year so what you need to do is you need
to do something probably to the file
name that's what most of us do we put a
revision into the file name so that you
can cache that revision for a year but
if I change the HTML or if I change the
files the HTML will get a new revision
in there for that particular file so let
me show you what I actually mean let me
bring up the the browser wrong browser
let me switch across to the correct
browser so I'm running the site on 8080
at the moment and let me show you here's
a great one here yeah this is this is
ideal the manifest here you can see that
we've got this manifest dot and then
this long string here Jason well how are
we doing that let me show you here this
is one of the middlewares that i
mentioned earlier
or is it helpful or is it helper to help
sorry it's one of the helpers which
we've registered up here this one here a
hash helper what it does is it gets
handed a path and what it does it opens
up that file you see here load the file
contents and then it creates a hash from
the file contents by making a shell t56
writing the file date in there and
asking for a hex dump out the other side
which is 64 hexadecimal digits long and
we use that and we pop we replace the
file name so if it was you can see here
let me actually bring me grab let me
show you this number in the header there
we are
this is what it actually looks like so I
said look get the dist client
manifest.json and it will it will grab
that file look at the file contents
create the hash for that and then it
will spit back out an updated path that
looks like this
bleh all that there we are now that's
good and it's bad it's good because that
means this is unique so when the
manifest changes this hash will also
change brilliant but it's also on slash
static which means that it'll be cached
for a year so that's all good the only
thing now is when we actually make the
request this file doesn't actually exist
in fly static I mean flash stuffing
manifesto Jason exists but manifest dot
all that Jason doesn't exist so what we
have on the other side is a little bit
of middleware that just simply remove
the hash if if it gets given a request
that has 64 hexadecimal characters right
next to one another
a 1202 9 then it replaces those with an
empty string and then passes straight
through so it's a completely silent bit
of middleware that just says if you get
a URL with that long accessible string
remove it and will now ask for slash
static slash manifesto Jason should come
back to the server we've asked to the
file we're going to get whatever the
server has as the most recent value so
that's a way of keeping that all
up-to-date last little bit I'm going to
show you on the server side today is
around what I've been thinking of what
I've been doing to do with the
serviceworker there was London there was
a serviceworker app that was dedicated
just to the serviceworker fairly similar
in some ways to the dynamic one but all
it does is it totally controls the the
serviceworker only that's the only thing
that's actually interested in so not
dissimilar in terms of sets that we've
got all the kind of add arrows stuff and
we've got you know default dust options
here and so on but what we do is you see
that I've got this package reader don't
get version and all that's doing is its
opening up the package Jason which is
it's currently set to 1.0.0 and inside
here inside well I loved it there it is
inside here you can see that I render
this
Service Worker template and I pass
through volume so when we look over here
at I believe it's over here no that's
the built version I think I know it's
here you can see that we have the curly
braces version so that means that if I
want to bump the version of the whole
the whole site and I want to invalidate
my serviceworker I can do that just fine
because what I'll do is I'll bump the
version in the package.json and I'll
deploy a new version and then on the
server side will generate a new well
that version number will be passed
through to the serviceworker so when we
next request the serviceworker will get
1.0.1 for example that will be byte
different to 1.0.0 and then we'll run
the whole install activate process so
it's at my means I'm using before a
bunch of times now did it in chrome dev
summit done it in I think it was voice
memos I did it in possibly in guitar
tuner as well a bunch of bunch of the
stuff that I've built it's really
convenient to just go bump the packaged
version and then send that out and that
will cause your serviceworker stuff to
be to be updated and the other thing
that it also does or it should do yes it
does is it makes sure that my
serviceworker is never cache this is a
super important thing even though
technically I guess this might no
doesn't live in it doesn't live in
static but even if you know even if
express wanted to cache the
serviceworker for a day or a week we
really don't want that serviceworkers
you really want them to cache for no
amount of time and the reason is we want
to be sure that if we update our
serviceworker that we definitely come
back and are the people who are
connecting to us I definitely come back
and get it
as it happens even if you set the
serviceworker to cache for more than a
day the browser will always come back
after one day I believe that's in the
spec it does mean though that if you set
the caching headers to be like a year
you're gonna have to wait at least a day
before any changes you make to the
serviceworker get get passed down to
anybody who's already got it installed
so strong recommendation for you there
make sure that your serviceworker has
some kind of no caching headers very
much like the HTML so if you make a
change it can get deployed instantly as
soon as somebody hits your site they'll
go oh
I need to get a new serviceworker and if
they can they'll download activate and
install and all the rest of it your new
serviceworker so there you go all the
code as I mentioned previously is up on
github I will link to it in the notes
below so that's the server side of
things next up I think we should have a
little bit of a chat about maybe more
video stuff because that is what we're
building don't forget you can subscribe
to the channel don't forget you can make
leave comments below
loving reading all the comments thank
you so much for all of those it really
does make all this worthwhile because
it's so nice to kind of see what you
what you think and also to get your
questions as well so if you've got
questions definitely pop those in and
I'll try and either response them in
line or in the next video that I record
toodaloo hey folks thanks for watching
don't forget that there is more content
that you can find kind of over here ish
and if you want to subscribe there's
probably a button oh maybe there maybe
somewhere around there click that if
you've not done that brilliant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
