industry announce last thing we have to
design for everyone especially in
emerging markets who they suffer from
like you know connectivity issues but if
I'm like a business in say East London
and I'm only catering for people that it
almost feels like a wasted effort to try
and design for like another part of the
world or on a verse or community so I'm
spending a lot of time and energy making
things as small as possible it just
seems like again another thing that's
restricting my design ability seems like
every sort of innovative step in design
seems to be followed by right now
designers you have to do something else
which is really frustrated I mean just
feels restraint about responsive web
design was frustrating these things that
I like because you know we want this
kind of pixel perfect well the like will
you really
graphical but it seems like again so
what's supposed to there question is
what is the point in designing or people
who I may not be my market yeah yeah no
I take your point okay I think there's
two ways to cut this firstly if you're
designing for a global audience
well you know you better think about
everyone everywhere you better think
about people that are coming online for
the first time in these regions where
huge numbers of people the largest
numbers of people are coming online now
the second stuff you know the second
approach is where you've got like a
local product you know something like a
restaurant site whatever well actually
you know designing is really gonna be
done in the same way as you would do for
those people anywhere so you need to
think about data cost and flaky
connectivity offline all those things
it's the same principles of design you
know it doesn't matter where you're
designing for its those same principles
that you need to cover so it's that
really that attitude it's not about
designing for emerging markets it's
learning from those okay yeah and then
applying that to web design everywhere
said would you think about the
restrictions and because I know you've
in the past you've worked full yeah the
traditional print
that's right do you have a very good
strong type same background as well yeah
sure sure I mean yeah I used to for many
years I worked as a typesetter worked
with a great design team a record
company and you know I think one of the
things I really noticed there was the
way really good designers responded to
constraints you know you think about
like black-and-white photography or
duotone prints whatever their responses
to restrictions on the medium that
you're using and you know we need to
have the same attitude for web design we
need to be thinking about how do we
respond to the real world you know like
be honest about about your product I
remember like when I worked with really
good designers working on product
packaging and so on they would go out to
a shop and they would you know stand
there on the other side of like whatever
it was in those days like Tower Records
or whatever they would look at their CD
in that gate that looked you know pretty
good in the studio now from the other
side of shop you know what I can't see
what it is
yes so designing and contacts and see
yeah the thing in exactly and the web
equivalent of that is you get a phone a
cheap phone you take it out somewhere
where you not got to go you know great
connectivity you see how your website
works in that context it kind of reminds
me of like when we use to design logos
one test would be to send a fax the
letterhead yeah to see because that's
the real world people would see like and
then you see how like in a dot matrix
printer how the logo looks because a
nice pristine thing is not necessarily
the thing that's going to be produced in
the real world no that's right and you
can do the same you know like look at
your stuff with throttling and chrome
dev tools yeah or if you can you know
actually use you know throttles and them
work network emulation but you know just
go out into the real world designing for
a budget is quite hard because we tried
to shoehorn everything at the end this
is I think what I think a real issue
that you're trying to redesign a thing
once your vision has been done which is
where the frustration comes but how do
you actually think about because really
we need to be thinking about the design
beforehand know at the end yeah yeah so
I I'm in a I'm a great believer in
performance budgets
you know establishing a budget before
for month for performance
and for daily accost you know just like
in the old days you wouldn't with print
you still do with print you look at
production costs materials you can use
and all that stuff so you know establish
that before you're going into a web
project and then stick to that and be
honest about that and who do you think I
mean who are like the people that we can
learn from over the Pioneers at the
moment I look I think you know thinking
about images you know it's very
important to develop like an image
strategy and there's something actually
that my colleague our colleague Ava has
been talking about just at Google i/o if
you check out her talk there
you know images are a huge deal
images are still the biggest data cost
for most web pages by far and the
largest number of requests this has big
knock-on effect for you know for CPU
memory and so on but also just the
number the usage of the radio from the
number of requests yeah and this again
on mobile is a huge deal because you
know it means you have images using more
battery you know so if you do nothing
else I would say just you know look at
your images look at you know say your
hero images on the site like background
images banners and so on optimize them
you know compress them as much as you
can make sure that pixel dimensions are
no bigger than they need to be every
extra pixel is extra memory you know is
an X deal yeah it's a big deal on a
mobile phone so do you know much about
the designers in those regions because
usually the pioneers come out spective
yeah that's right interesting yeah that
that stuff like you know we can really
learn from from regions where the
fastest number yeah most people coming
online like if you look at you know
developers in like Mumbai or Bangalore
they're designing for these contexts
where you know 2g is often the norm and
what we've seen there like you know we
saw this with like companies like
Flipkart and and
housing calm and Bangalore they realized
that they could access a much bigger
audience by designing for them yeah and
you know that's really worked for them
in terms of you know conversions it's
you know there was a business case their
companies and sort of like designers
what it could be missing out on a market
which they're not tapping into simply
because they're not doing designing yeah
yeah it's chicken-and-egg you know if
you design to give people access then
you can expand your audience and so on
and that can snowball native apps are
better in this way because of their more
performant and they do this as a site
well no it's just the web can do that
it's just you have to put the time and
effort into it don't just see it as
switch platforms and then all the
problems are fixed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
