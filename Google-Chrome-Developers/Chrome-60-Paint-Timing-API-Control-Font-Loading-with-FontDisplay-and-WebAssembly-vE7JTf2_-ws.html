and time to first contentful paint with
the paint timings API you can control
how fonts are rendered with the CSS font
display property and web assembly has
landed from the National Museum of
mathematics in Manhattan on a tricycle
with square wheels I'm Pete LePage let's
dive in and see what's new for
developers in chrome 60 when a user
navigates to a page they're looking for
some visual feedback to reassure them
that everything is working with the new
paint timing API we can now measure that
the API exposes two metrics time to
first paint which marks the point at
which the browser starts to render
something anything the first bit of
content on screen and time to first
contentful paint which marks the point
when the browser renders the first bit
of content from the dom text and image
something like that check out fill
walton's posts on updates to learn how
you can track these metrics and use them
to improve your experience web fonts
give you the ability to incorporate rich
typography but if the user doesn't
already have the typeface it needs to be
downloaded potentially making your site
appear slow thankfully most browsers
will use a fallback if the font takes
too long to download the new font
display property allows you to control
how a downloadable font renders before
it's fully loaded Auto uses whatever
font display strategy the user agent
uses block gives the font face a short
blog period and an infinite swap period
swap gives the font face a 0 second blog
period and an infinite swap period
fallback gives the font face an
extremely small blog period and a short
swap period and finally optional is the
font face an extremely small blog period
and a 0 second swap period it's
supported in Chrome 60 and opera and is
in development for Firefox
check out Rob Dodson post on updates for
full details webassembly or wasm
provides a new way to run code written
in languages like C and C++ on
the web at year native speeds it
provides the speed necessary to build an
in-browser video editor or run unity
games at high frame rates utilizing
existing standards based web platform
api's check out Alex Danilo Google i/o
talk and find more info at web
assemblies org including demos dogs and
how to get started these are just a few
of the changes in Chrome 64 developers
but of course there's plenty more the
payment request API is now supported on
desktop versions of Chrome the new web
budget API enables a site with the web
push notification permission to send a
limited number of push messages that
trigger background work such as syncing
data or dismissing notifications without
the need to show a user visible
notification and push subscription
expiration time is now available
notifying sites when and if a
subscription will expire check the
description for more details including
links to docs and specs also checkout

features in chrome 60 in the chrome dev
tools then click the subscribe button
and you'll get an email whenever a new
video is launched on our channel I'm
Pete LePage and as soon as chrome 61 is
released I'll be right here to tell you
what's new in Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
