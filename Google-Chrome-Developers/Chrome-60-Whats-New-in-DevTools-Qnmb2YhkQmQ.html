in dev tools in chrome 60 if you want to
improve the quality of your site but
don't know where to start the new audits
panel is a great place to get some
inspiration to run an on it click the
oddest tab click perform an audit then
click run audit after 15 seconds or so
dead tools gives you a report on the
page these top-level scores are a
summary of how you did in that category
below that are the individual tests that
make up each category score fix the
failing tests to improve the quality of
your page this new artist panel is
powered by an open source project called
lighthouse check out the lighthouse
github repo if you've got some ideas for
audits we should build or if you want to
contribute them yourself if you're
working on a big site chances are that
your pages interact with components from
other teams in your company or ad
networks or libraries and so on
third-party badges help you see which
third parties might not be playing too
nicely with your pages enable badges by
opening the command menu which is
command shift P on Mac or ctrl shift P
on Windows and Linux start typing badges
then select show third-party batches in
the network panel you can now see a
little badge next to each request
indicating who caused it and in the
console you can see who caused a message
or violation to be logged you can also
sort performance recordings by selecting
the group by product option when your
paws on the line of code you often want
to continue execution up to some later
point the new continue to hear gesture
can speed it up this workflow right now
I'm follows down line 9 I want to
execute up to line 20 then falls on that
line to do this I hold command on Mac or
ctrl on Windows and Linux and ded tools
highlights destinations in blue from
here I click on a destination to execute
the script up to that point the context
election menu now provides more
information about the frames on the page
before you just get a default drop down
menu now I'm dev tools gives frames more
descriptive names also when you hover
refrain dev tools highlights it in the
viewport the console now provides more
helpful object previews before dev tools
would just display the strings object
when logging out an object not that
useful now it shows you more of the
objects contents the coverage tab now
provides real-time updates while
recording before it would just say
recording which would force you to stop
your recording in order to analyze the
results but now you can analyze the
results while the recording is still
happening the network throttling menu
has been simplified to the most popular
options slow 3G fast 3G and offline also
the team tweaked the settings to better
match real-world 3G connections so you
might notice that pages load slower now
when throttling is enabled last the
async checkbox in the sources panel has
been removed and its functionality is
now on by default because there's no
longer a performance overhead you can
still disable it from settings if you
need it off for some reason that's all
for chrome 60 if you want to discuss
these changes start a thread in the
mailing list or tweet us at chrome dev
tools and if you want the latest news
and ideas and web development subscribe
to the Google Chrome developers YouTube
channel
I'll see you in six weeks for chrome 61
