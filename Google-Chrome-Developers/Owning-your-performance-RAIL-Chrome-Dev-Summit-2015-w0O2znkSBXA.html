about rail today and we're gonna dig in
and we're gonna see how we can apply
what's inside the chrome dev tools to
really measure diagnose what's going on
and and fix it
so first up you seen it slide before
between response to animation idle load
I'm gonna be focusing mostly on these
two pieces inside a response and load
kind of having that instant hundred
millisecond response coming right back
after topping in action and then it's
loading up quickly and what I want to do
is basically just do a performance audit
live with some websites in production
it's just a lot of live demo what could
go wrong don't know but the first thing
that we're gonna look at is the actual
chrome dev summit s-- website and I want
to take a look and see how it loads and
if we can identify ways that it could
load even faster all right I come over
here and we got is a fresh build of
Chrome and we're looking at the chrome
dev summit site we're emulating is
mobile it looks pretty good and I just
want to capture the reload action just
to see what's going on so you can just
hit command R and that's cool but one of
the hard parts about like what we see
here with the waterfall is yes we see
the waterfall and there's a lot of
network requests but it's really hard to
do the correlation of what is happening
at the network layer and what is
actually happening on-screen so now up
here in the top side we can actually
turn on screenshot capturing and so this
will basically capture screenshots every
single time that the page is visually
changing we capture all of them and then
keep them so that you can help to
correlate what's going on the other
thing that I'm going to do while I'm
here is just turn on throttling so
regular 3G is is usually what I go with
I'll flip that on and I don't know
obviously yeah command R will capture
that
okay but good you can let it finish I'll
let it finish well I'm a patient you can
hit the red guy all right cool so here's
our network waterfall up on the top here
we have the actual what happened inside
of the the view and you just double
click on these to view what happened
okay this was our first paint white
screen good yeah you just hit right on
these if you want to like it all right
ooh look at this you can see that the
page kind of fading in I guess there's a
faint effect there and there we go yeah
cool so this is over here this guy right
this is our we call this the first
meaningful paint right it's not the
first paint but it's the first paint
that like a user would care about it's
typically what you'll see so when you're
diagnosing page-load you really just
want to start from that first meaningful
paint and just work backwards from there
because usually the reason why that was
delayed was because of some network
requests that it really needed to
actually finish that off all right so we
got that and we can also like as we
hover over these down in the and the
waterfall we can see kind of the
relationship of where each of these
screenshots were taken so this one is
over here in this area which is
interesting but one thing that we can do
because there's so many network requests
we can kind of simplify things one thing
that we really want to know is of all
these network requests which really
matter when it comes to page load which
are gonna be render blocking right now
in inside the the network pane there is
this priority column you can just
right-click inside here there's a lot of
things in here priority is one of them
so this is basically the network
priority that chrome and blink uses to
go fetch this and these priorities more
or less map to is it render blocking or
is it not so if it's high then it's very
necessary and if it's a low priority
then less important the nice thing too
is you can see like this javascript file
right it is low priority
and like scripts usually are high
priority but this one's low and you're
like well maybe it was just like a sync
tag they think attribute I'll just click
through on the initiator which is
whatever triggered that request and view
it I'm gonna just move that out of the
way and we're did it click it just
highlighted it once more yeah this line
okay cool
and here's the insertion and yep they
think was one so it's nice to kind of
like verify that setting the script to
be asynchronous does in fact make it be
fetched at a lower priority and so we
know that but the other thing that we
can do here to kind of simplify the view
and let us focus a little bit better its
focus on only the asset types that
really matter when it come to kind of
being content walking so this is just
kind of a hack you can hold down command
and just click on these guys j s CSS web
fonts HTML and include xhr just for now
a bit more simple and so now if we hover
over and get a little closer view okay
cool
so looks like our yellow line dropping
down is hitting right right after these
two guys finish thank the nice thing is
we can also yeah just yeah not sure what
are these requests is the schedule that
Jason in the widget API is the jeaious
this one's low so I'm gonna bet it's a
sink so I think it's not gonna matter
but scheduled that Jason does this is
the schedule page we might be using that
so that might make sense this is like my
number one suspect right so then here
it's like okay well this request
happened way out here and I'm just
verify if I click in okay yeah
this is like the jason of everything
that's happening okay so that's
necessary it was requested way out here
not at the beginning why we can look in
the initiator column and just see what
it says but
the way to do this is you can old shift
in this view and will basically
highlight the The Avett dependency graph
more or less so like we highlight in
this then schedule about Jason was
requested from Ellen site HTML which is
highlighted in green up here which was
in turn requested by the original HTML
so you can kind of like walk your way
down and see the relationships and this
is really valuable because on you know
on your home page there's a lot of like
third-party content a lot of anything
it's it's all about these like CSS
requires these web fonts and scripts
require other scripts and knowing kind
of these asset dependencies is usually
critical in finding out why your load is
is later or not ok so the schedule Jason
is requested from elements of HTML and
you'll see there's two right here and it
looks kind of weird cuz they looked like
the exact same thing and it is weird
turns out it's a bug and it was in
chrome for about a day it's fixed now
but this is what it is all right but
let's just say really kind of either one
of these this is what forced this was
what ended up making this request now I
can look into this and see what is
inside this payload it's looks like it's
like a vulcanized polymer all the
elements and it's it's big which is why
there's so much blue like a lot of
download time to two seconds worth of
download it's 133 kilobytes gzipped and
if I expand that 505 550 kilobytes
unzipped ok so it's a pretty big file
and that is why the download time was
was so big again I'm throttling so
there's that but it's a bit more
realistic when it comes to mobile so
like one thing that we can already say
is essentially if the schedule Jason is
what is our last thing that we need to
actually get this paint out and the
elements that HML has to finish
to do that then if we can affect the
size of this big blue chunk then we're
gonna make that first pink much faster
so like it's varied so we can basically
say that if we dropped the size of this
initial vulcanized elements that HTML
like in half then we would be ending the
request somewhere around here like two
seconds and then the schedule Jason
would just be able to shift over and so
we be looking instead of at a load time
of about 4.2 seconds we probably looking
at about two point seven five to three
so be able to knock off a second worth
of load time with that one change so
this is kind of like the way that you
can can associate both visually what's
happening and kind of the dependency
relationships between assets in order to
really diagnose what is really happening
in page-load and why it has taken a
while all right cool but it's
interesting like the schedule that Jason
was actually requested through
JavaScript and while much page load
concerns are very oriented around
Network there is plenty of things
especially as people are putting more
like more sites that are built as web
apps online a lot of times that you're
dependent on JavaScript to really finish
everything so I want to take a closer
look at a heavier heavier app so we're
now gonna take a look at hotel tonight
if you haven't used hotel tonight it's
just a really nice app and mobile web
app that finds you even it's cool
the team did a really nice job building
this in fact hotel tonight was a it was
native app only and then this summer
they released a mobile web app for it
and it's really really nice so I want to
take a look at it and see what we can
find out this time instead of using
what's happening the network we're gonna
go kind of like dive into it fully
everything that's happening with the
timeline profile and JavaScript and all
that the first thing I'm going to
capture is reloading just kind of the
initial load of the page I'll turn on
screenshots over here because I like
screenshots and we're just gonna hit
command are see how that goes all right
cool
that was fast good all right what's
going on all right
so the first thing is we have at the top
of the timeline the overview the red is
indications where we think there might
be responsiveness concerns underneath
that these little green blips and this
is recording not terribly useful it
usually points it the green represents
the framerate so if you're really
looking to hit 60fps you want that green
to be tall and you'll be janking if it's
falling beneath the next section here is
usually the most interesting this is the
main thread activity yellow is script
purple is recalculation styles and
layout and this is kind of getting you a
sense of what your activity is over time
and then after that a little bit more
faint you can see it here is a kind of a
condensed version of the network
waterfall following that is the
screenshots so we can kind of like track
the the load of this and you can see
like it loaded fast right and we're
looking here and here is where like that
first paint came up so I'm just going to
zoom in here and it's actually
interesting right like there's this
whole section of like things going on
and you think like that might be where
it loads I mean that is where the
JavaScript does all the work but it
looks like there's not a lot happening
up in front which is pretty peculiar but
we can see you know in this tiny little
view this network request and so I'm
like okay yeah I guess it's the HTML we
can now introduce the network requests
into this view so we turn on this check
box and here we have what's actually
happening in the network layer so here's
the HTML and at some point these
JavaScript requests kick in and so on
but it's nice to kind of get this
association between what is happening in
the network
and then on the main thread so I don't
think I want to do right like it looks
like it paints very quickly if we want
to look and and really associate what
the page looked like with what is
happening down here you can just click
on on these frames right here and see
what if the state was and so you can
click these and I think yeah this one
okay cool so this is the frame that
basically gave us our first meaningful
paint now we're looking at rail we want
a first meaningful paint that's in a
good amount of time so it'll shift to do
this kind of measurement 600
milliseconds which is good it's
definitely hitting the thousand L second
budget and that is the first meaningful
paint that is a solid paint but it's
cool right like they there's not the the
paint comes pretty much immediately and
there's not a lot of JavaScript that's
sitting between it and if I want I just
want to like take a closer look at what
is in this HTML payload because it seems
almost magical a pretty print and pretty
print on the HTML it's gonna pretty
print the CSS and the JavaScript and
there is minified HTML in here so I'm
gonna cheat a little bit because the
pretty print doesn't yet do it you know
bring it over to this little web app
that you probably have used before get
that okay CSS here's the HTML okay
they're using react yes and what's
interesting too is as you look down in
line files so they're using the inline
files on every element which is kind of
a thing that's happening now and it
ah seems actually okay right like there
was no x-ray
there was no extra CSS request it was
all in line it was fast so as far as I'm
concerned it looks good to me that's
pretty cool and so basically they did a
fantastic job year of doing optimizing
for the critical path in mind the CSS
the first you know HTML payload is
enough to get the view up on the screen
all right cool now let's come back and I
just wanted to see one thing like you
know so they got the load within 600
milliseconds that seems good but we
should go and see kind of how they
handle responses so now we're going to
just start a new recording and I'm just
gonna tap on this search hotel's see how
this works okay cool cool all right yeah
I mean capture screenshots this part
takes a little bit longer but it should
come back right okay
overview what are you telling me some
things I don't know it's nice to have
these screenshots right because zoom in
and you can even see the little loading
animation is animating so all that was
captured all right so it's like like
click and then animate anime an anime
and then we got stuff so I'll just zoom
in on kind of that chunk and all right
so in our flame chart we have this area
over here and this big guy and one cool
thing you can see here's the xhr coming
back and it's nice because now that we
have Network here we can just validate
that yep here is the actual Ajax request
its API hotelTonight inventory right
cool makes sense so now we got a nice
kind of correlation we had to click the
network request we waited on that and I
came back we did this work
so in total what do we have we started
with this click event but I suspect in
front of that we zoom in enough yeah
yeah we had a mouse up we might even be
a touch start in front of that sometimes
so this is where kind of the input
started and then we zoom out and this is
where the paint finish was it this one
yes this is the frame right here where
everything finished so we measured this
area this is about 1700 milliseconds but
specifically like we have this was our
response right we clicked and we started
getting a loading spinner that is bad as
a response you are giving an immediate
feedback you're saying hey we're gonna
wait so in total that was about 200
milliseconds a little longer than you
want but okay did the Ajax and then it
looks like it did a bunch of JavaScript
after that and so the load itself was
yeah see that's second and a half good
probably could be better now you're at
this point where okay seems like this is
fairly wide we could probably see what
we can do about that so in the flame
graph we're looking at all of the
JavaScript call stacks and you can just
drag it you can also hold down shift
while you scrolling the trackpad to
scroll and it just you know it's very
tall call stacks the tall isn't really a
problem tall is just the height of the
call stack no issue there just makes
scrolling take a little bit longer but
you can see receive component update
rendered component like this is react to
doing some stuff but it's so much data
like I don't really know where to start
so here's one way to go about it we can
view things kind of like you'd have over
on the profiles panel profiles panel
you'll kind of start a recording and
then kill it and there's a chart but you
might be looking at something like this
and this is great but a lot of time
you'll see this program
like what is that program I know yeah I
was i wondered for a longest time so
program for the most part the numbers
are pretty much all the things happening
that is not javascript so the
recalculation of styles and a layout all
like this stuff this is program it's
time that the pure JavaScript row file I
can't account can't account for but you
see it over here in the timeline but the
challenge then is like this is a lot of
information so now we have the same sort
of breakdown but over here in the
timeline with both everything that's
happening in the JavaScript and what's
happening from the browser so I can work
my way down from say for instance this
finished loading and look at the total
time from the call tree and just kind of
like follow the path down and see where
the time spent but you know these call
stacks are really tall it's gonna take
some time so I'm just gonna work from
bottom up and see what functions have
time in there costs so and the bottom up
I'm mostly interested in the self time
column and here for this big chunk we're
looking you know this is 900
milliseconds or so time and our number
one guy is this capture stack trace and
you're like I mean I just looked at this
and I was like it captures actually
seems like something they like you
wouldn't want to be slowing down the
user for a quarter of a second on
capturing stack traces doesn't seem like
terribly important to the user so let's
see what's up capture stack J's actually
is is showing because we now implement
the ability to see what's happening at a
native level so capture sec trace is
actually not in the website's code it's
in v8 i was navigating over here this is
the definition of capture stack trace
and it just sits inside of actually v8
source there's a lot of JavaScript that
v8 uses to do JavaScript stuff and
capture sectors is one of them so this
is ours
and this is what's taking time but why
is this happening so we'll just kind of
like walk upwards
why did capture stack trace get calls
because of error error constructor your
constructor because
tt is in react okay cool so let's click
over there and take a look yeah I'll
check this out this is nice I don't
didn't have to pretty print anything
this is actually just these came in from
source Maps you can actually see over
here they use webpack and they created
source map so this app in production
actually ships with the source map so it
makes my job of demo and it's really
easy you know it's quite nice alright so
right we're looking in this area it was
like function T or whatever but it it
dropped me here and I can see the new
error so I really know what there's the
same but I do know it says that we're
creating a new error and we're turning
it upwards to say something no but turns
out that this error creation to
basically message upwards and then be
caught by react and do something that
air creation actually has a significant
enough cost in this case that it
accounts for a quarter of the time of
this big block that's probably not
probably not what they expected but
we're able to see it here and so that's
probably a good way that we could
address that do something different and
then drop the cost of this at least by
25% and end up with something that is
fitting a bit more into our one-second
budget for the load let's see the other
thing that I wanted to point out and I'm
gonna come back to the network to show
it is in addition to the the priority
stuff that I showed you before there's
also a connection ID column that you can
turn on now this is really helpful
especially if you're an HTTP 1.0 haven't
yet moved to HTTP 2.0 because it's
basically giving you an ID for the
actual TCP connection that is using and
here you essentially get to see when new
TCP connections are created and which
ones share so it actually sort by this
and see for instance that
you know like that these requests here
actually all just shared a single TCP
connection which is actually why you see
like this this great gap here because
this request was just waiting for this
to finish and then same thing here
because they're all sharing the exact
same TCP connection so that's getting
into the turn eternals of networks and
how they work but still it gives you a
bit more insight into what is actually
happening on the hood and why you might
be seeing this sort of a delay all right
bring that back bring it back bring it
back all right cool
so in the timeline some new stuff that I
showed capturing screenshots the network
waterfall bring it in there and
summarizing all of the work just
aggregating it up to tell you what is
happening across all the operations in a
tree view both culturally and bottom-up
you can also and this is pretty fun you
can also group all that work by
different things like domain so say for
instance hotel tonight you know it looks
like most of this is is their own code
but I can also take these take this work
and separate it out see by like URL
where who which files are all my costs
coming from or sometimes even better is
the subdomain so here we can see like
all the third parties say for instance
like analytics or whatever you can see
their actual costs on the page for that
recording even things like Chrome
extensions will be included here so it's
really nice to get a sense of why page
is complicated lots of third parties
going on not sure like who to blame and
this gives you a really clear idea of of
which players are consuming time on your
main thread all right over on the
network I showed the dependency
visualization understanding the priority
of different requests that connection ID
and screenshots it's good stuff as you
can imagine a lot of these things are
fairly new not all of them but many of
them canary has them
in only a few cases will you have to
turn on the experiments but at the end
of Paul backus's talk gave you a good
idea of how to do to take care of that I
also just want to point out like we're
not we're not finished there's a lot
more things that we're working on
especially in this performance space we
want to make sure that you always get
good insight on how you can really make
a big impact when you when you're
addressing performance and getting the
information that you need and also if
you are really into the stuff you're
interested we're hiring so holler at me
and like we'd love to get some people
that are really excited about building
fantastic tools for developers to make
them really productive alright so I just
did kind of like a live performer of
these that have done for all sorts of
different sites what in particular was
the the mobile reddit site which is a
fun site and that had a lot of
interesting things going on got written
up a lot of interactions from the
community just like figuring things out
and now making their site a lot faster
but there's a lot of these I encourage
you to read these you learn a lot at the
same time I also encourage you to do it
yourself this is the Wikipedia team they
printed out they literally print it out
on paper at the timeline and then just
like took sharpies and post-it notes and
just marked it up and said like for this
telemental seconds we're doing this and
then this just like counting for the
time and justifying it to like should
should this thing really take this much
time and it was really effective for
them and in fact like they shared this a
little bit ago they were able to drop
the page load size the page load time
for Wikipedia in half and like oh that
seems pretty good we all use Wikipedia
we wanted to load fast especially when
we're like in a bar like trying to win
an argument so seems good all these
results come directly from their work
diagnosing in a performance audit I kind
of in this manner so encourage you to do
it I think that's it thank you guys very
much
