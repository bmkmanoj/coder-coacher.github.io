experiences that we deliver on the web
we've put a lot of time and effort into
our current projects and building a
progressive web app doesn't necessarily
mean that we need to start from scratch
we need insight into areas for
improvement and tactical fixes that
could be applied to our existing code
bases I'm Pete a developer advocate on
the web team at Google I want to show
you how you can use the new audit
features in chrome dev tools to improve
your apps and take the first steps
towards transforming them into great
progressive web apps our starting point
is a web app that uses the iFixit API to
access repair guides the initial
implementation is a single page app that
uses client-side rendering well this
project uses react the concepts that
we're going to talk about apply to any
framework or vanilla JavaScript in fact
I'm not much of a react expert myself if
you want to see the code used in this
video you can grab it from the link in
the description let's take a look at the
initial experience in chrome alright
that looks about what I'd expect Firefox
Marie looks good and finally Safari I'm
gonna do something a little different
here an intentionally disabled
JavaScript to see what happens when
there's no JavaScript
there's no content that makes sense
because our app is currently rendered on
the client so if javascript is disabled
we don't get any content so now that we
have a feel for what the app does let's
try and figure out how we can improve
the current implementation we're going
to use the new audit panel in chrome dev
tools formerly called lighthouse which
will run our app through a series of
tests covering important areas for
progressive web apps the same tests are
also available as a command-line tool or
a node module that you can add as part
of your integration tests we'll run it
now to establish a baseline and it'll
give us an idea of what's working well
and what we can improve let's see it in
action I'll pop over to the audit panel
and start my tests the audit reloads the
page several times capturing traces on
each load so it can analyze how long
each load took when it became
interactive what happens when there's no
network and so forth it usually takes
about 60 seconds to test my app served
from my local device well lighthouse
will identify areas for improvement it's
not the end destination you shouldn't
spend all your time trying to get a
perfect score ultimately the experience
that your web app provides to your users
is what matters the most in addition to
running lighthouse you should try your
web app across other browsers other
devices os's and network conditions as
part of your normal testing and release
process with that caveat out of the way
let's dig in and look at the results
well I told you earlier not to
necessarily focus on the numbers looking
at our scores we've got one red and
three green there's a lot I can do to
improve my progressive web app score and
I think I can get the other numbers up
to my goal is to make sure that all of
the scores are brain and I'm gonna aim
for a score of 90 or better there are a
lot of failed audits here which explains
our low score there's no serviceworker
and it doesn't work when offline there's
no content when javascript is disabled
and we haven't done anything to make the
app work well on the device like adding
a manifest and setting the meta theme
color we did have four tests pass well
really only three since we're running on
localhost the uses HTTP is a freebie the
page loaded is fast on 3G we've set the
correct meta viewport and sized
everything correctly to fit the results
also includes some recommendations on
manual tests that we should run things
that it's not able to verify itself in
terms of performance it's good but I
think we can do better the big thing I'm
seeing here is that our first meaningful
paint happens at 3700 milliseconds and
our speed index is almost 4500 by the
way if you're not familiar with some of
these terms you can click on the test
results for an explanation of what they
mean and how you can make them better in
opportunities it gives us a few
suggestions on things that we could do
to improve our performance like enabling
text compression reducing some of our
render blocking styles and dealing with
some of the off-screen images we can
also check our critical request chain
size in this case it's only three we're
probably okay
I could hyper optimize this but there
are more important things to deal with
we've done well on our accessibility
checks and there are a few things here
that we could change but again since
it's already over 90 I'm gonna call it
good we're doing well on our best
practices again it's green we could try
and get these numbers up but our
priorities should be on the other scores
that have more room for improvement
let's look into server-side rendering
server-side rendering means that the
browser gets a fully populated and
functional page in the initial HTTP
response rather than having to rely on
multiple requests to get the content on
screen equally important it means that
our web app will work on browsers that
fully support JavaScript or when it's
been disabled and if we accidentally
ship some bag code it won't completely
break our experience not every web app
will be able to run with full fidelity
with JavaScript disabled but in our case
this should be fine it's fairly
straightforward to add server-side
rendering to our react application using
universal JavaScript shared between the
client and the server all use Express
anode based web server which plays
nicely with the reactor outer while
we're talking about react other
frameworks like angular ember and others
have their own solution for server-side
rendering first I'll add a serve task to
my gulp file that starts the Express
server then create the server using
Express react and a few other components
that I'll need for the server and I need
to update my index file to import the
react content so now that we have the
server-side rendering in place let's try
it out in chrome and safari to see if it
had the desired effect I don't expect
anything to change you chrome shows the
server rendered version and it looks
exactly the same as it did before and
how about Safari remember javascript is
disabled here this time it works because
the content is rendered on the server
and JavaScript isn't required let's see
how adding server-side rendering affects
our score
I'll open dev tools and start the audit
this takes about 60 seconds so with a
little bit of video magic we're done
adding server-side rendering to our app
affected both our progressive web app
score and our performance score our
progressive web app score jumped from 36
to 45 and our performance score went
from 79 to 91 since we only added
server-side rendering I wouldn't expect
much to have changed here but still we
have a lot of failed audits but the QED
thing is we now have content when
JavaScript isn't available let's look at
why we got that jump in performance the
bay
that changed is our time to first
meaningful paint dropped to 860
milliseconds and the speed index dropped
from almost 4500 to 2000 our
opportunities to improve performance
have also now changed it looks like we
could save some time if we used lazy
loading to postpone some of the
off-screen images we'll save that for a
rainy day
let's add a serviceworker to make it
work instantly and reliably even when
the network isn't first an important
reminder we need to treat service
workers as a progressive enhancement not
all browsers support service workers yet
so we don't want to degrade the
experience there and even on browsers
that do support service workers the very
first time you visit a page they won't
have the serviceworker installed yet
we're going to adopt the app shell +
dynamic content model which works really
well with single page apps the shell our
HTML Javascript and CSS is loaded
directly from the cast on the local
device bypassing the network taking the
network out of the critical path is this
first way to get reliable fast
performance we can then use runtime
caching to handle requests for our
dynamic content from the iFixit API
under the hood I'm using a tool called
sw-precache which will generate the
serviceworker and implement the caching
strategies for me
SW precast is an early version of work
box Jas it doesn't have all the
flexibility and power that work box has
but it'll get the job done for today
first we need to import sw-precache into
our gulp build script then create a new
gulp task that will generate the
serviceworker to cast our files and
finally we need to register the
serviceworker
now that we have the serviceworker in
place let's run the audit again and
confirm that it had the intended effect
a little bit more video magic and sweet
by adding this serviceworker that pre
cast is our content our progressive web
app score went up by almost 20 points
from 45 to 64 we had a five point jump
our performance score as well we've
improved the reliability of our app by
adding a service worker our app will now
respond instantly and reliably no matter
what network conditions exist adding a
service worker also helped to improve
our perceptual speed index from just
over 2000 down to 1289 after you've
added a service worker it's always a
good idea to pop over to the network
panel and take a look at all of the
network requests to ensure that your
service worker is handling all of the
requests that it's supposed to alright
that looks good and I love those super
short response times well we're in dev
tools let's take a detour to another
panel that's super important the
application panel this is the central
location for debugging everything
related to your service worker we can
confirm that the new Service Worker is
running without any errors here we can
force it to update simulate an incoming
push message simulate a sync event and
unregistered we can also use the various
check boxes at the top of the page to
automate common debugging tasks the
offline check box let's simulate network
failure so we can confirm how our
service worker behaves when there's no
network update on reload ensures that
when we make changes to our Service
Worker during development refreshing the
page will always put the new code in
effect right away and finally bypass for
network skips the service workers fetch
handler which disables the cast and
forces all Network requests to go
straight to the network all right let's
address the missing application metadata
this metadata controls how your web app
looks and behaves when it's been added
to the home screen
remember that manifest that we talked
about in a previous video well we need
one of those but we also want to provide
a great experience on Safari for iOS to
ensure that we provide the largest range
of browsers we'll need to add the
metadata using the web app manifest and
the equivalent meta tags let's take a
look you can see that we've added a 512
by 512
pixal icon if you're only gonna add one
size make sure it's at least 512 by 512
here's the manifest that we talked about
earlier we've added icons using the link
tags to give Safari the information that
it needs we've added a link tag that
points to the manifest set the theme
color and added a meta Apple mobile web
app capable true to tell Safari on iOS
that it can start in full screen let's
test the homescreen bookmark behavior on
iOS Safari using the iOS emulator yeah
that looks good so now that we have a
serviceworker
a manifest and everything in place let's
run the audit again and confirm that it
had the intended effect all right with
those few changes our progressive web
app score is up to 91 and our best
practices score is up to at this point
all of my scores are breehn and above 90
I'm happy
the only outstanding issue is that we're
missing a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
since we're running on localhost we can
safely ignore that one for now our
performance still looks great the time
the first meaningful paint is under one
second time to interactive is about
three seconds and the perceptual speed
index is just barely over the target of
1250 all of the accessibility checks
look good we're following all of the
best practices except for using HTTP 2
since this is running on my local dev
machine I'm not too worried about it
right now
I can deploy this to a server with HTTP
2 later let's take another look at the
application panel and dev tools in the
manifest tab we can see that the
manifest is properly linked and we can
see the app name short name start URL
colors and icons switching to the
serviceworker tab we can see that the
serviceworker is up and running without
any errors and in the cast tab we can
dive in and see what's been cast by our
serviceworker as developers our journey
is never over new features like
constructible response dreams
present all kinds of new opportunities I
hope you're excited about the new audit
panel and dev tools remember the goal is
to radically improve the user experience
of your app and this is just one tool
that you can use to do that you can find
the slides for this video linked in the
description below if you're watching
this on a computer right now why not try
running the audit on this page to see
how it does up next we'll dive into how
you can use amp to create fast first
