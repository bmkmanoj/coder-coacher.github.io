on the polymer team you might have read
the description for this talk and
thought well that's a little vague a
sneak preview of a unique experience
we've been working on built with polymer
well as cryptic as that and Twitter
might be hopefully at least peaked your
interest so here we are at polymer
summit 2016 something I love about
summits and big conferences in general
is the sheer volume of people who come
together all around a common interest in
our case it's polymer web components and
modern web technology it's amazing to
see how much the polymer community has
grown in just the last year I am so
proud to say that there are over 700
people here from over 100 countries I
mean this event is huge and while that's
totally awesome it can definitely be a
bit overwhelming I don't know about you
guys but when i go to large conferences
like this i can get kind of overwhelmed
by how much content there is to absorb
or how many people there are that i just
don't know yet and when I think about it
I realized that that's totally crazy
because the two main reasons why I and
lots of people come to these events is
to learn about all the new announcements
and technology and more importantly to
meet people to meet you to meet other
polymer developers to meet the polymer
team and since this is a pretty common
sentiment we thought it might be a good
idea to create a cute little progressive
web app game to engage everyone and make
it easy to strike up conversation with
each other so we started out small as
Matt mentioned a few months ago Justin
and Chris two engineers on the team were
chatting towards the end of a week and
an idea was born which totally struck a
chord with Chris and he was immediately
inspired the weekend past and by Monday
Chris had already built a prototype I
think I can speak for
everybody in the room was there when I
say that we were totally floored I mean
completely blown away by what he built
and we promptly went completely
overboard I mean everyone suddenly had
ideas from left and right and we just
kept tossing feature requests at Chris
and he kept building it bigger and
badder and better first came the rich
animations then came the game logic been
custom artwork and even music before
long it was clear that our idea for a
cute little progressive web app game had
become so much more it became a true
celebration of the modern web proof of
all that is possible with web components
and progressive web apps now I can't
think of anything that serves as a
better companion to the polymer summit a
celebration of the modern web in its own
way then this pwa so now when you're
hanging around at the summit and you see
someone you might want to interact with
whether it's another attendee or even
Policastro Rob Dodson himself it doesn't
matter who it is where they're from what
language they might speak or even what
device they have we've made it so that
interaction is as simple as saying game
on we bring you polymn on
Paul Iman is an addicting Lee fun way to
interact with the summit I think it's
the best progressive web app on the
internet you'll be the first to try it
and we are so psyched to share it with
you poly mon is a multiplayer
location-based scavenger hunt game
unsurprisingly where you can collect
virtual magical creatures assemble teams
and battle your friends new and old it's
slick design and complex functionality
are powered entirely by modern web tech
the back end is all in firebase the
front end of course is polymer and it's
written entirely in native HTML CSS and
JavaScript I'd love to tell you more
about it but I'm sure you and I would
much rather just see it ourselves let's
check out a demo so here you can log in
with your google account and catch poly
mon or check out your poly Dex so let's
go into the poly Dex looks like we
haven't caught any polymn on yet so all
we see is silhouettes and question marks
let's change that in order to capture
polymn on you can go around and find
polymer team members will be wearing one
of these either on their sleeve or on
their badge and you'll introduce
yourself maybe strike up some
conversation about web components and
scan them and a lad right to your poly
Dex rumor has it that the harder to find
team members might just be worth some
more points so the app and scanning it's
all built in one so when you click catch
poly mon on your menu page the scanner
will open and here's chris with a demo
there you go boom we've caught a seed
out of poly maan which is actually
chris's and so this will pop right up if
you repeat this a minimum of three times
you'll have enough to be ready to
assemble a team in battle to start a
battle you must first find an opponent
so you can see here represented by these
two phones then you'll visit your poly
Dex click the battle button below here
and then start a battle will generate
battle code for you dynamically and then
your opponent will do something very
similar they'll go to their poly decks
click battle but this time they'll click
join a friend and a scanner will open
when the code is scanned the battle
instantly begins and then boom your
teams are on the front lines you can see
your team in the foreground and your
opponents in the background make your
first move by selecting one of three
rock-paper-scissors style actions we've
got attack focus and counter as you can
see after you pick your action you can
select which polymn on you want to act
with based on your stats there's a lot
of strategy behind this and I'm sure you
all figure it out but all you need to do
is click around and select a polygon to
lock in your move for the round so it
looks like both teams have locked in and
now you'll see this rich animation
displaying exactly what happened to each
person and how much health was lost and
then that is dynamically updated as you
can see in the bottom corner looks like
we've got 15 to 11 now this goes play by
play around by round until one team runs
out of polygons insider tip if you're
already thinking about your strategy and
looking for a fierce opponent or a poly
Mon trainer we held a poly Mon
tournament during lunch two weeks ago
and Elliot was ultimately victorious
over Taylor in the final rounds he seems
to have the whole thing figured out and
which I'm sure you are if you're curious
about what went into building polymn on
in its entirety I highly recommend
checking out Chris Joel's talk later
monster apps now this is not only
because Chris is hilarious and he built
this entire thing by himself but it's
because he has a lot of experience
building heavy duty not just monster
themed but monster sized web apps and
he'll be sharing tons of tips and tricks
and stories with us before that i'll
leave you with a few more technical
features of poly Mon
I've been calling it a progressive web
app but you might be wondering what is
it about polymn on that makes it a true
pwa so first we've got a frictionless
download so forget about an app store
putting in payment info waiting to
download the giant file if you've got a
modern browser you've got polymn on it's
as simple as that second there's a
service worker which makes it very
resilient to network connectivity issues
while we've learned our lesson and
beefed up the network capacity for this
year's summit we all know conference
Wi-Fi is notorious so this is a crucial
feature not just to have today but to
have always finally it's got a native
look and feel no matter which device you
access poly monton be it a phone phablet
tablet desktop it'll look and feel like
poly mon was built to fit that screen
though poly mom's appearance and
functionality may make you think it's a
native app its size proves that it is
certainly not crazy but our main page
which loads a live map a QR processor
code for the poly decks and the UI
elements for the menu weigh in at under
200 kilobytes yeah
and even more crazy the entire polymn on
application is under 1% the size of
another kind of popular location-based
scavenger hunt game on the market right
now so I'll just leave it at that final
recap go out there catch three to five
column on assemble a team start a battle
and more importantly have fun and meet
people this is where you could check out
polymn on polymn on polymer dash
project.org finally thank you I'm Wendy
or as you'll soon find out ginz art go
introduce yourself to the polymer team
during the break and start catching some
poly Mon thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
