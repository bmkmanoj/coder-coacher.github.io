from the grub devtools team just came
off staged presented on what Wells
debugging the web we were talking about
all the cool new stuff and dev tools
from debugging javascript to authoring
CSS and bunch of auditing good stuff
stuff like I really excited about was
dipping right dipping in CSS like what
is your app actually using yeah two nice
things in here so you not only if you
make changes like see exactly what
happen but then like you just want to
know across all your CSS like what is
being used like on the page you can say
start recording do whatever you want
finish recording and then we will like
to point out the CSS that was not used
on the page and be like this stuff there
might wanna yeah CJ I know when I right
right abs a lot of CSS like keeps it
appending and yeah it's always this is
like you're so scared he talks a little
bit about lighthouse and kind of a new
thing in dev tools for lighthouse can
you kind of describe and into our users
with that that's all about so lighthouse
does it's a kind of a modular portable
engine for analyzing pages finding out
what best practices they could be
adopting the things that aren't so good
measuring performance all this stuff
right and it's available in a number of
different laces Chrome extension node
module command-line interface and what I
showed was actually an integration
inside the chrome dev tools so a new
panel kind of a revision of the audits
panel and it's like has lighthouse in it
just run it and the nice thing that I'm
super excited about is that the
lighthouse that's in it is just sitting
off on github and all of our like
