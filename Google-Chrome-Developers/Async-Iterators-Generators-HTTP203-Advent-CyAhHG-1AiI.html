and it's an entire year Oh didn't know
that this time this time instant iron
yeah and so in a year a lot of things
can happen a lot of things will happen
and some things will be happening to the
web and so I think it's interesting to
talk about the things that gonna be
happening to the web in the year of 2018
so I thought I'll try to explain to you
one thing in two minutes all right I'm
gonna talk about async iterators and
generators okay now I'm aware of its
races I am aware of generators exactly
what you've done there is put the word
async in front of them right we're done
Oh excellent brilliant okay so um yeah
so iterators are a type that you can use
in for loops for example and for all
loops we have an iterator and you just
get like arrays are have an iterator so
you can values you can create an
iterator which is infinite as well for
example yeah okay then you have
generators which are the star functions
with the yield keyword where you can
basically construct an iterator on the
fly using a generator for sections like
I sort of helper methods exactly in this
area okay and now that the sometimes the
problem was you wanted to not only yield
values but you wanted to yield promises
and you wanted to kind of know that in
only the next values away available once
the previous promise is done resolving
to something right okay and that's where
they came up the concept of async
iterators which are the same thing but
they internally instead of returning
values they iterate over promises okay
so if I'm if I've like fetched three
things I have a promise for each of
those things and I think it's a right is
that gonna let me we would iterate over
them in order and you will not be able
to do the second one until the first one
had resolved and has been processed by
you excellent okay so that's I think
iterate it's one of our icing generators
I guess it's gonna be the helper
function it's a public function but in
this is you can yield promises and it's
gonna be super helpful exactly like you
said for fetches or in a serviceworker
when you want to fetch your header your
main con it in the footer and you want
to you want these to be in order because
if your footer comes before the header
or the content that wouldn't make sense
so you kind of want to
those bits and bobs in order and then
just stitch them together or just
forward them to the main thread so that
build the page can build up so I think
it's gonna be really really useful once
we have it in our JavaScript environment
and just be able to work with
asynchronous values like streams yes
brilliant sold the fetch observer the
fetch observer doesn't have to do with
the actual fetch yes it does doesn't
observe fetches yes it does how magic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
