push messages and add new features to
notifications you can preload important
resources with the link rel preload tag
and the canvas element gets an upgrade
let's dive in and see what's new for
developers in chrome 50 push
notifications allow you to trigger
system level notifications in the same
way that native applications do in
chrome 50 you can now include an
encrypted data payload with the push
eliminating the need for the
serviceworker to fetch the data needed
for the notification and it's already
supported by Firefox using the web push
API you can now dismiss notifications
across devices when closed by the user
on one device and you have more control
over how notifications look and behave
you can set icons on actions set custom
timestamps and even specify whether the
device should vibrate or make a sound
have you ever wanted to let the browser
know about an important font script or
other resource that will be needed later
without delaying the onload event chrome
now supports the link rel preload tag a
w3c draft spec that allows you to tell
the browser which resources should be
preemptively downloaded and can reduce
the time to get real content on screen
link rel preload replaces link rel sub
resource which had a number of bugs and
drawbacks and wasn't supported by other
browsers the canvas element now supports
the two blog method which means instead
of manipulating base64 encoded strings
that you get from two data URL you can
now work with the encoded binary data
directly it's smaller and tends to fit
more use cases that a data URI not only
can you more ease
we upload them to your server or store
them in indexdb for later use you can
draw the image blobs to another canvas
context with a create image bitmap API
support it today in Chrome and Firefox
one other quick note the geolocation API
eyes are now only accessible when served
from a secure origin these are just a
few of the changes in chrome 54
developers check the description for
more details and be sure to LIKE and
subscribe I'm Pete LePage and as soon as
chrome 51 is released I'll be right here
to tell you what's new in Chrome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
