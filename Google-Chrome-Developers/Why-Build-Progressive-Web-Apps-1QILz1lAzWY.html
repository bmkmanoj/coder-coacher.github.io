the 1820 this is Babbage's Difference
Engine it was designed to tabulate
polynomial functions such as logarithms
and you know there was one machine one
app hand-built hard-coded now to get a
new app you had to get Babbage to design
a new machine and in fact wait nearly
200 years for someone else to build it
so move forward 150 years or so and
software looked like this big programs
needed you know 10 disks or more CDs and
then DVDs were actually a revolution at
that point the map point could be bought
from a store and this had my pan and
zoom and completely changed trip
planning web-based maps at that time it
couldn't do anything like that so let's
move forward a few years Google Maps
happened hey pan and zoom on the web and
you know it worked on any computer not
just one that you spent 30 minutes
installing on when capable the web's
distribution model really wins now you
know raise your hand if you use Google
Maps on the web on desktop yeah sort say
what about mobile well that's different
isn't it you know if you go to a browser
to get to maps on the phone the hardest
problem with software is distribution
anyone who's ever worked in IT will
understand this so how does this play
out on mobile it's true that users are
spending most of their time in native
apps reengagement features keep users in
native apps push brings users back even
when the app is closed and home screen
icons maintain the visibility but usage
is highly concentrated it's a
winner-take-all situation app developers
often spend more for distribution than
they earn back so if the native
ecosystem isn't going so well well why
hasn't the web been more dis
RUP t'v here's one way to think of the
differences between web and native the
capability access native apps have the
ability to start up fast and reliably
they can work offline and use push sync
and sensors now the web some ways is
safer more respectful of privacy but
doesn't have those native features if we
add another access reach you can see
where the web succeeds
according to a recent comScore study the
average user installs zero apps per
month
well Google data shows that mobile users
visit around 100 sites per month this is
the power of URLs they meet one-off
needs now what if the web could meet
those UX expectations this is what
progressive Web Apps represent PWA for
sure web apps are finally able to earn
their place on the home screen and in
the notification tray and they don't
have to give up reach what are those PWA
experiences look like well here's
washington post the progressive web app
loads in a tab like any other site if
you use it a few times the Add to Home
screen prompt has shown if you tap it
well
the browser lets you know it's added the
icon is now available from the home
screen and if you tap it the app starts
with a splash screen and runs fullscreen
like this tap to get to the task
switcher and there's the progressive web
app alongside other native apps what
they've done is to make it incredibly
easy through users to get at what they
want so what was missing from the web
first we needed reliability and
performance on par with native apps ad
next we needed to be in the notification
tray lastly once trustworthy we needed
to be on the home screen so let's talk
about performance we all know that time
is money and this data shows just how
badly bounce rate increases with load
time other studies show
that after just three seconds 40% of
users will abandon a website 40% but
what if you didn't need to traverse the
network every time for every asset what
if you could intelligently cash assets
locally and reliably
that's what service workers do service
workers enable you to implement caching
with the cache API not just by hoping to
rely on browser caching this means that
after the first visit sites and apps can
be reliably fast ok that's huge but what
about the first visit the amp project
from the Google search team aims to
address the web obesity epidemic amp
provides reliably fast web components
for first load these amp components are
much faster to load and less data hungry
than non amp content but what if you
could combine the two fast first load
with reliable performance subsequently
we can do that by combining amp and
serviceworker this is where amp meets
PWA here's an example news stories on
the Washington Post are super fast to
load because they use amp once a story
page is loaded the site installs a
serviceworker and assets are cached
intelligently now that provides reliable
speed that native can't touch want to
try out progressive web apps well there
are great tools built into the chrome
dev tools for progressive web app
developers Google engineers have also
created lighthouse this gives you an
extension that reports on how your PWA
is doing as well as command line tools
you can build into your workflow and
production processes there are loads of
other new capabilities coming to the web
too many to talk about here web assembly
and WebGL to unlock games media capture
and stream encoding for user-generated
content and many more but two particular
api's that are shipping this year will
change many kinds of apps web payments
and credential management now the first
is web payments
a standards-based way to enable easy
checkout on the web web check out using
fiddly forms is a pain Mobile makes us
even harder entering data via on-screen
keyboards is difficult and insecure the
web payments API reduces this to a
prompt confirmation and done if Android
pay is supported by a site and phone
that could be even easier
another transformative API is the
credential management API this
simplifies the whole process of managing
identity on the web and enables OneTouch
logon here's kayak.com using credential
management sync via smart lock with a
single tap on sites that supported the
credential management API also allows
automatic sign-in for users that
previously visited to sum up pwace are
reliable fast and engaging the feedback
we get from talking to many developers
in many regions boils down to two key
questions why is this important and how
do we get started
for why it's important let's look at the
overall market here we'll focus on some
high level metrics reach acquisition and
conversion let's talk about reach and
how we're seeing overall mobile web
audience grow now we have data for
Chrome 1 billion monthly users on mobile
and this was just 400 million a year ago
and chrome is you know only four years
old on average chrome on Android users
visit 100 sites per month let's drill
down to site level data
now this comScore data compares reach of
the top 1,000 sites and apps here you'll
see that mobile web reach is two and a
half times that of apps so when you're
able to deliver a better experience to a
wider audience this makes a compelling
case and you're likely to see similar
numbers on your own site now it's worth
gut checking your own site traffic
numbers and understanding the traffic
breakdown between app and mobile web
anecdotally we've heard that sites say
that mobile web traffic ranges from 50
percent to as high as 90 percent of
mobile traffic in total so this data is
great we're seeing growth in mobile web
and that Reach is more than double of
app traffic the next question are there
real businesses at scale seeing success
with these investments well we've been
working hard to provide real-life
examples so that you have proof points
removing barriers to entry means that
users are much more likely to try out
our mobile web properties than an app
the mobile web sees many more unique
users however as you can see native apps
capture users attention native apps
currently get a lot more user engagement
can we have both another data point to
look at is how easily users are able to
discover and experience your service
acquisition is about more than you know
just getting users to your site and that
sometimes means paying for users here's
an example
Sileo is a local marketplace site for
buying and selling goods they built a
progressive web app and saw similar
engagement numbers as their app however
they found that user acquisition cost
could be up to ten times cheaper for
their web app compared to their native
app the web has incredibly low friction
and as a result it's also less expensive
to acquire users now I don't know you
must be thinking well that's what the
marketing team worries about but hey if
you're trying to build a business case
you have to think about these multiple
forces at play conversion is about
getting a visitor to become a more
frequent user of your site and in some
cases getting a user to complete a
transaction Aliexpress based in China is
one of the largest e-commerce players
globally with their PWA they saw massive
uplift within days they saw 74% increase
in time spent on the site and two times
more pages visited for then the number
that really matters is whether users
actually convert now complete
transaction
Aliexpress or conversions go up across
the board you might think that many
progressive web app features don't work
on Safari and that this wouldn't help
with users on ILS well it turned out
that that wasn't the case at all using
the PWA approach to building for the web
Aliexpress saw an 82% increase in their
conversion rate on iOS the progressive
in progressive web app does make sense
and focusing on the end-to-end user
experience will still have a dramatic
impact on your business even with users
who can't experience the full power of
progressive web app Aliexpress already
had a mobile website and they decided to
supercharge it with PWA features I think
of terrific results here is a quote from
the director of mobile at Aliexpress
which emphasizes that investing in a
great mobile web experience benefits all
users no matter what platform they're on
to understand why this is important now
think about the big pie of potential
users you want to increase potential
reach to reduce acquisition costs and
improve conversion rates yeah once you
put the figures together the web starts
to look pretty good so how many get
started with progressive web apps the
technologies can be intimidating do you
have to convince your team to do a
complete overhaul well the short answer
is definitely no it can be complex to
introduce new technologies especially at
larger companies with complex
organizational structures and sites with
legacy code and architecture think about
this as an ongoing journey to invest and
build on the web sometimes a site is
about to go through a redesign so
starting from scratch makes sense this
enables you much more easily to build in
progressive web app design patterns in
particular to take advantage of all the
power of service workers now conger is a
major e-commerce player in Nigeria and
they decided to start from scratch
calling their site conger easy you know
pronouncing it easy
they had to deliver a full end-to-end
web experience that was as fast and
reliable as their native apps for iOS
and Android they need their web
experience to work offline for catalog
and for checkout functionality and they
focused a lot on minimizing data
consumption which is critical for their
users comparing data usage to their
native app initial load took up to 92%
less data and data usage to first
transaction was 82% less now of course
not everyone can take the conger
approach starting from scratches
oftentimes not realistic another
approach is to build a simple version of
a site for example to improve on a
specific section or user journey for
airberlin it wasn't possible to do a
site wide PWA so they focused on the
post booking experience they needed to
deliver a fast engaging reliable
experience and their users at the
airport require quick access to
itinerary details boarding pass and
destination information they leveraged
caching to solve this problem giving
them load times of under a second after
a passenger has checked in they can
access their journey details and
boarding pass even without internet
connectivity the washington post built a
simple version of their site they put
together a simple progressive web app
demo using their top stories feed the
goal was to show what type of user
experience is possible and they focused
on speed 80 milliseconds page load times
with their PWA
you can see there live public demo at
wapt.com /pwa newsroom staff and
executives at the washington post were
really excited to see this new
experience and as a result they've now
actively evolving their demo PWA to make
it the core mobile web experience
another strategy is to define a specific
feature to test pick one thing that you
can have high impact with now this is
likely to do the case at really large
companies The Weather Channel team has
been into
in progressive web app technologies for
quite some time they needed to
prioritize based on what they believe
would be the highest impact for both
their users and their business they
decided to focus on a single feature
with web push first whether went big
with a single feature rolling out
globally in over 30 languages users on
their mobile web app can subscribe to
multiple types of notifications just
like their native app that's how they
got started on the journey to building a
PWA booking com the large travel company
and it's hard for them to make a lot of
big changes however they understood the
importance of progressive Web Apps their
data-driven so it was critical for them
to work in small steps to try new
features one by one test them and learn
so when you think about proposing a path
to integrate these technologies it's
helpful to think about these alternative
approaches build from the ground up
start with a simple version or just
focus on a single feature different
paths can make sense for your users and
your site you know we've been really
excited to see incredible momentum
across the globe here's a sample of
folks shipping or actively working on
pwace and the new web api's with these
early adopters we've seen that every
site has their own way of investing in
mobile web and starting down the path
towards progressive web apps so now it's
your turn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
