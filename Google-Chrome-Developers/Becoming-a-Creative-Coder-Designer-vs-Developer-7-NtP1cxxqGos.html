worked on get her place sweater ePHI
yeah I think I'm handsome erection and
it kind of amazed me that looking at
code from us off artistry point of view
like code as an art form I as a median
and what you think about that yeah so
like sweaters I was basically
browser-based way to experiment and test
a knitting pattern and then they kind of
visualize it in front of you before you
actually spend time on knitting stuff
the way I came across was that when I
was making knitting pattern knitting
come in two forms it's like a glove
paper pretty much visualized I know the
the blueprint of what it looked like or
it comes in the form of written
instruction so it's you know cast on
this much stitches and then knit this
pattern it took in like a written
language and then when I noticed was
that it is really close to a code
it was very much knitting code so we're
like oh I can just put that into you
know my JavaScript I was about
JavaScript by welcoming so you know I
can do it in JavaScript and that's how
that it kind of got started but I
realized that I can quickly iterate my
creative process because it is in code
and it's like at all the valuable for
all and you know in the place I can
tweak the valuables I can see what it's
like in you know 100 different versions
and I find it really interesting then I
discover like a creative coding
community that does like a generative
art so it's the art is the output but
then they write code and they kind of
experiment with different algorithms and
tweak the valuables and then like see
what happens it's like really different
approach from for engineering yeah so in
software engineering I will say this
also engineer it's just like you don't
really want unexpectedly volts as a
whole get that you need to hit it's all
define and then you
code for it but then when you think
about the coding of the creative process
you kind of start to introduce like a
fun to like oh what if I changed back to
negative one and the fear of the unknown
while you're embracing with I know I
want to cry something interesting but I
have no idea what it is and then you
just let the little yeah the piece is 4
mm I mean how do you go about sketching
class stuff because I mean from when a
designs I mean I can't design in browser
I just I don't understand how anyone can
not actually literally sketching could
be anything like writing code comments
or whatever but I mean how do you that's
the bit if I find so difficult to
understand it so I look at the code and
looks like looking at the matrix I don't
understand how you get from it's almost
like you know write codes question mark
profit Jeremy's like how would you
actually get what's the processor yeah
yeah designing to think so I feel like
there was a killer asian like you know
there's anything with anything there was
a killer asian of stuff but I start with
paper actually so I have an idea if it
was I was creating like some kind of art
a visual or something I would go for
like I want to have this circle on this
page or like you know kind of like a
visual set I like pretty much like comes
from like a visual mindset so I can't
start from logic I just start from like
here's the thing I want to see on the
screen granted it will not end up like
that at all
at the end but then I get to code after
I have like some basic ideas of how my
visual wants to look like and then
there's like another design a duration
of negotiation between whatever
technology that I'm using usually
browsers and you know JavaScript and web
api that like I thought I wanted to make
this interaction on paper but it doesn't
really work on browser because I change
the medium and that's my medium and
negotiation between technology and my
creativity of like can i how can I
achieve what I wanted to do in my head
on this medium that is usually build up
of me and sometimes it's impossible or
sometimes it's not reasonable to do the
interaction that I thought I want to
make on my head
paper and I'm like alright and then
sometimes I discover like a new API or
like a new thing in browser and being
able to like oh actually I can change
that this is quite interesting I can
change them I always more design to do
something different so it's usually
ended up like a completely different
thing from what I originally sketched
but I quite enjoy the discussion and
negotiation between technology and me
yeah kind of like a game sort of like I
have this plan can I do this in browser
and will browser let me do this if not
can I find a loophole if they're like
you know kind of clearing up the level
and playing a game basically with the
technology let's discover what is
possible and what is there but getting
it I mean also you can often take
lessons learned from now yessiree I'm
you may not be like you're doing some
generative pattern but it's like a
technique or coding thing that you can
bring back in which is like you know
invaluable right totally totally I
learned so many things that I like code
snippets that I like ended up using in
my production code for my job you know
so do you recommend making as a way to
learn I do it's quite a lez make quite
algorithmic process but I recommend
anybody to do it's quite binary knitting
I'm going into super geeky stuff yeah
but in knitting there's are two versions
of stitches which is like you're pulling
a young from the back of pushing the one
from front and that creates like a
different face of anywhere and the
combination of that creates complicated
patterns so it's basically binary and
how you arrange that binary and how you
repeat that binary pattern becomes the
final product so it's it's when you're
designing the knitting pattern it's
quite like exercise of defining
algorithm to get through this pattern
for designing to get to learn address of
and see coders like paint or whatever
what's your developer to of just
embracing the unpredictable I mean what
with the voice would you destroy them so
I think every time I like do creative
projects the question I get or the
feedback I get is like so what or what
does it do
how is it you saw great and like getting
over that those like a mentality of like
if you do code you have to make useful
tools that everybody is going to use and
get so many github stars and you get VC
funding it's not a stalker
yeah I'm like you don't need to aim for
that you can just use coding as a
creative expression to you know flex the
creative muscles and once you like
thinking about like what I'm making it
doesn't have to make money it doesn't
have to make sense it doesn't have to
help somebody else this is purely for my
fun and discovery then it gets a lot
easier to experiment it gets a lot
easier to I don't know get into code and
just like make hundred different
versions that is not tracked on github
that's totally fine
providing a performing experience is
something that requires you know close
collaboration between two sides like I
don't think I'd ever seen skeleton
screens as a concept until started
reading like blogs the designers were
working on yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
