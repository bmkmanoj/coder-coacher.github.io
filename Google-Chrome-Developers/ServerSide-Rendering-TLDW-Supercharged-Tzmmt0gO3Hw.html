DW last time Paul and I took our advance
through the code and built a back-end
for it that the server-side rendering
I'm going to show you what it actually
means in the browser so if you look at
my screen you see nothing new it's still
the advanced way that we build and we
can go to all the different subsections
with the nice transitions what we have
however if you look at the network panel
in this case we are only transmitting
minimal amounts of data names the exact
data that we need to show what the
section is about and yet if i refresh
the page it still works because in that
case the server has decided that the
entire scaffolding needs to be sent and
to how that worked in detail let's go
over to Theory caller or as we call it
to yoga welcome to Theory Conner this
node server is what we have built it's a
web server written in node that takes
the requests from the browser these
requests could be for the home page the
About section the contact section
whatever we have in the side nav the
server takes this request and reads a
header file the contents and the footer
phone and assembles these three parts
into response that gets sent back to the
sûreté of the browser however if there
is a partial flag present in the query
part that is instructing the server to
only sent back the contents which is
what's happens when we do dynamic in
page navigation and this is actually
what is called server-side rendering
because if the initial request is for
about the server will basically inject
the contents for about into the return
page into the scaffolding that is around
it let's look at the actual code back in
real-world corner let's jump straight
into the code we're going to start at
the bottom because that's the logical
thing to do so we're using Express to
start our web server and we are using
speedy because ironically the actual
h-2b to module doesn't work with Express
but speedy does and serves eight
- and not speedy so that's kinda nice to
have so we have our certificates here
we're starting a web server that serves
our app and we're binding it to port
8081 the actual app itself consists of
two handlers the one handler that we're
going to talk about in a bit that
actually does the server-side rendering
and below that we are just using
expresses static middleware that does
nothing else in the straight-up deliver
files from disk over the network it's
just static file delivery so let's talk
about the actual heart of this server
which is the server-side rendering
function it is a handler and it takes
care of all the requests that are for
HTML web sites these can have multiple
shapes because it could be just slash it
could be slash index.html or it could be
any of these subsections with an
optional index.html at the end and we
turned that into a regular expression
and just put that into the express
Handler and the first thing we do we are
extracting the zeroth element from the
parents object which is the first
parenthesis from the direct expression
meaning it is an empty string if you're
on the home page or it is the name of
the subsection if we're in any of the
subsections and what we are figuring out
next is if this is as I mentioned in
theory corner if it's a partial request
or a full page request it was a partial
request the only file that we need to
read is the index.html of that
subsection so if we for example look in
the index.html of the About section it
just has this one line that I showed in
the dev tools earlier if it it's not a
powerful request we need to read the
header file that partial file and the
footer and assemble these to form the
actual response what we're doing next is
after successfully reading all these
files is we are turning them into
strings because originally we get back
buffers and we can't really work on
buffers so returning them into strings
and then we are using handlebars the
reason we are using handlebars which is
a templating engine is because we have
to do minor manipulations in the header
to accommodate for the data we are going
to inject and what I mean by that is
let's take a look at the header file is
that in the header file we have all the
views
currently not visible but these are for
views and be only three because one of
them is actually going to be rendered by
our server-side rendering logic so we
wrote a little handlebars handler that
will exclude that remote view that is
currently in use so if we are on the
about page these three lines will not
appear in the output because we were
actually going to inject the data and
this will be doing next we have these
three files
we're just assembling them step by step
concatenating them and then sending them
back to the client additionally we are
also generating an e-tag this eTech is
there to allow efficient client-side
caching it is purely based on the
contents that we have and we're just
using a sha-256 checksum to bullet based
on the contents we're adding these
attack headers via the set method of our
response and we also set sensible cache
control headers these cache control
headers mean that even though the client
is allowed to catch them it has to
revalidate every single time a request
goes out for the same page in case an
error happens in any of these steps and
this is one of the beauty of promises
we're just using the promise chains
catch handler to set the status to 500
meaning internal server error and
appending our error string so that we
ask you ever know what just went wrong
and can fix our code luckily that didn't
even happen on stream so we could never
show all that it actually works and
that's already it this is how you do
server-side rendering you take the
index.html you inject the content the
user actually requested and then you
send it back to the client the code I
just skimmed over is on github and you
will find the link to the repo in the
description of this video another link
you can find in description is the link
to the full-length live stream that
pollenated where you can see how we
build this entire thing step by step if
you want to know more subscribe to this
channel on YouTube or follow us on
Twitter thanks for watching see you next
time
the lights up there you click them it
makes you subscribe it's a good thing
and also if you want to see me panic
life on stream where I can't figure out
why h-e-b 2 is not working go there
that's the live stream and you will have
an hour long of pure entertainment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
