environment
next to lifeless barges and wildlife
that probably hates us but it's stopped
raining so we're right the operating
click on the plus side the two wing
guards are being kind today so dev tools
people have wanted the dark-themed built
in for quite some time know you've
wanted the dark theme so people can ask
you what dev tools name is Adi using
let's picture a world where that might
be true now if you went to settings you
could actually enable such a beautiful
theme under appearance so let's go let's
go try that out and see if it works
so what that'll do is it'll instantly
redeem all of dev tools and device mode
as of the build that we're using today
and so you can go and you can check out
all the different panels we can try out
like recording timeline stuff just to
see how well this looks on different
panes so here we can see timeline looks
great you can do all your screen shot
stuff looks good resources sources panel
network profiles all this stuff has been
optimized to look really good with this
theme so it's kind of neat people maybe
check it out
and yeah so one of the other things
that's recently been added to dev tools
is the security panel which is much more
exciting questionably more exciting more
important questionably so basically what
the security panel will do is if you've
got HTTP tab for your site and
everything's fine there's literally no
reason you're in need to go here because
for the most part you should be fine but
if you've got something wrong with your
site like this one where it's served
over HTTPS but it's not the red padlock
all the green padlock it's the usual
like piece of paper the security panel
will actually tell you why so in this
case is saying the pages are secure
because it's using a sha-1 certificate
does the double check you're not on
adiós maricón no I think you're okay I
couldn't I couldn't use your site as a
bad example display at my use my attempt
but it's also helpful things like you've
got mixed content so in this case we've
got one blocked mixed content and in
this case you can click on the network
panel and it takes you to that one
resource so it's a JavaScript file that
it's been
but it's just basically a super clean
and super nice way of debugging half the
problems and it's really useful if you
find that Chrome's doing something weird
and you don't really understand why it's
doing what it's doing you know that's
the place to go that's cool
so you know the way that like on your
site your site looks really pretty I'm
kind of jealous because your sightless
better than mine now but on your site
you've got like a mix of system fonts
like the people probably have installed
and web fonts that you might be learning
from like a guest google fonts or
somewhere else
right if you take a look the wildlife
just loves us here they're just like
super stoked about what I'm gonna show
right so here what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go and check out the Dom
tree view and select some text so here
I'm going to zoom in in styles you can
see that we've got this new little side
panel called rendered fonts and what
this saw that you do is see if a font
that's currently being used for a
particular piece of UI is local meaning
as a system font or if it's been loaded
over the network so that's a system font
here we've got some other text you've
got you've got like unit testing a
serviceworker you have a heading or
something title block content you with
your BIM and right you can try and here
we can see this one has been loaded over
the network so it's just a nice little
tidbit I usually use like a Chrome
extension oh what fun for just exactly
this because especially if you wanted a
font to load and you want to figure out
was it the one that I specified it was
it the fallback
yes super nice I love it so we've got
that built in now another thing I wanted
to show so here we've got get bootstrap
comm everyone is familiar with this you
know half the web is built with this
thing at this point
now I'm just going to select a piece of
UI so I've selected the download
bootstrap button right now over in
Styles if you take a look let's zoom in
we've got a new dot CLS button and
that's basically element classes so what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna click on
that and what this button is done is
it's actually gone and plucked out all
the different class names that I have
for this Dom node and this just lets me
go and toggle on and off different
classes so here you can see that I'm
able to turn this thing off from looking
like a button and this type of thing is
really useful if you're dealing with
state
of any kind and you just want to like
iterate and play around with your
different classes yeah thank you and the
nice thing with this is I normally end
up just like unchecking all the styles
for a particular class rather than just
do what you've done you just disable the
entire class altogether that's really
nice like it cool so another thing
another thing another thing yeah this is
how I get kicked off stages at
conferences I've had another thing it's
not good this is Paul Lewis's voice
memos app I've currently got the dev
tools color picker open and if you hold
over any color and the color palette now
what you'll see is we actually now show
you a whole range of different tints for
those colors just kind of neat so you
can like see lighter versions and darker
versions of any of those colors here I'm
just going to go and select some it's
just kind of nice we actually now show
titles like hint at alternative shades
so this just shows you all the different
shades available for particular color
that you selected it's kind of nice
avoids you having to go back out to yet
another tool let's check it out I'm
still trying to find it you'll find it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
