Dutton and yeah we'd like to really talk
to you about you know some of the
revolutionary changes we're seeing in
e-commerce yeah you've seen a lot of
ecommerce sites demo today and we really
think this is just the beginning of the
conversation because the pillars of the
PWA technologies that you've seen we
really think these are fundamental to
improving the online shopping experience
out there indeed you know at the heart
of the e-commerce revolution is this
huge growth in mobile computing
you know the shift to mobile has
completely transformed the landscape for
online retail you know you've you've
seen this right you know a couple of
years ago depending on whose stats you
look at you know mobile overtook desktop
and this is you know a huge shift for
e-commerce in particular and not just
that but we're seeing of course this
huge growth in the number of people
online who generally don't actually use
desktop or laptop devices you know not
just mobile but mobile only and just
bear in mind you know that mobile only
doesn't mean that everyone's doing
e-commerce on like high-end spec you
know high-end smartphones new phones
like you know the geophone here in the
Alcatel go flip that they're hugely
popular and they're becoming a very
appealing and accessible upgrade you
know for many users not least the
hundreds of millions of feature phone
users who now want to shop online and
you know all this is is a major
challenge for e-commerce developers and
just to be clear you know online
shopping is already a huge deal last
year mobile commerce was worth something
like a hundred and twenty three billion
dollars in the US alone globally the
mobile share of e-commerce is growing
really fast in the u.s. mobile accounts
for nearly a quarter of all e-commerce
and you know we're seeing similar
figures for other countries now it's no
surprise give
the rise of mobile computing that a
majority of commercial traffic is you
know coming from mobile devices now what
is surprising perhaps here is how much
of mobile e-commerce is happening on the
where but rather than you know in native
apps retail on mobile and desktop web
already gets a relatively high
proportion of user time you know
compared to other verticals where people
are more inclined to use mobile apps
this data up from a recent UK study
shows that you know retail has a
relatively low share of app minutes
compared to other verticals there's
another growing problem I think for
native apps here you know the reality is
that unless you're one of your customers
best-loved
stores you're unlikely to find a place
on their home screen and I think this is
you know like we've heard where the
mobile web really shines you get you
know reach for e-commerce without that
barrier to entry
however conversion rates you know people
who actually complete a purchase on
mobile on the mobile web are far lower
than for desktop websites mobile
conversions are about one third of
desktop conversions and this is I think
a fundamental challenge for the web the
web has gone mobile but conversions on
mobile remain low you know of course
this is not all about negative
experiences on mobile people have
positive reasons for completing
purchases on desktop devices or you know
in-store people use different devices I
don't know different times of the day in
different contexts and platform share
actually varies quite a lot between
retailers
there are even seasonal differences I
just learned actually that in the u.s.
you know there's this big increase in
mobile usage for purchases between like
Black Friday and the end of December
it's interesting but you know the fact
is that the shopping experience on
mobile has left a lot to be desired you
know we've all done this kind of stuff
yeah and you know ecommerce as I realize
now is all about removing friction and
we need I don't know we need much better
integration with devices and with
platforms another way of cutting this is
to look at time spent online versus
money spent on mobile simply put you
know people on the in the US spend most
of their online time on mobile but much
more of their money on desktop now given
the success of online retail already on
mobile a better shopping experience you
know represents a huge opportunity for
the web so how do you get started with
that ramen at least tell us I'm glad you
asked some a seamless transition okay
open up my section with an overused
cliché which I will seamlessly shoehorn
into an e-commerce context for you and
it's this if a customer doesn't convert
on your site and no one is around to
measure it does it actually make a
difference people are on your site they
may even be buying things but if you're
not measuring it you can't make an
informed decision about what to change
so we've told you about setting a
performance budget I want you to do that
and I want you to be measuring things
like low level metrics like page load
that's useful but it's not the whole
story also look at the holistic meshed
metrics like Semih was showing you like
time to interactive because that's more
indicative of the users actual
experience however none of this actually
means anything if you measure these
signals purely in isolation there's no
value when we've constantly reiterated
the performance met message to you the
foundation of bit has been that users
are abandoning those slow sites there's
a real consequence for poor performance
so what you need to do is use your own
business metrics to create your
definition of success those metrics the
technical metrics are then tracking your
progress towards it of course the
problem with all of this is people once
you give people and especially
developers
SCOR to work towards they're gonna focus
on trying to hit that score and that
leads to this kind of thing if I'm
incentivized on performance metrics then
I can optimize for a page load bandwidth
time to interactive and so on and in
fact here it is the world debut this is
turbo shot okay this is the fastest
ecommerce experience in the world and it
looks like this it's a text box where
you pop in the product ID and you just
press buy write a search box and a
button we know this pattern works this
is gonna change the world
okay now I hit all my performance
targets so the business metrics are
gonna be equally amazing right no okay
a slightly extreme example but I do see
this kind of thing happening in the real
world it might be that it's just cutting
the number of images that are in your
image carousel to reduce bandwidth or
maybe you have a database query that's
quite intensive fetching lists of
products so you limit the number of
products that's returning the thing is
people will cut critical content in
order to meet the performance metrics
that they're being incentivized on so
what you need to understand then is
what's the right business metric here to
work that out you have to understand
what people are actually trying to do on
your site and here are a few examples
firstly 90% of the users coming to your
site are going across multiple devices
to make a purchase so sure it's easier
to measure conversion if it all happens
on the one device but it's really not
the whole story
and when I say embrace that I don't mean
just make a good experience on mobile
and a good experience on desktop I mean
really support me moving between those
as part of that journey because browsing
on mobile and then purchasing on desktop
is actually a fairly common pattern and
it's not always just cross device either
87% of people are checking online before
they head into a physical store to make
the purchase so don't assume just cuz I
didn't convert on the site that that
doesn't mean success and finally you can
mirror that back again when they're in
the store they're right back on their
phones looking for information about the
products that are in front for them
so I want you to measure conversions but
I also want you to think about where the
customer goes after that if you got the
experience right they're coming back
maybe they're even telling their friends
or colleagues about it so you need to
dissect your pages to understand how
those components are affecting the
conversion for different user types do
they read the reviews how many carousel
images are they looking at and provide
ways to tie their online experience to
the in-store experience as well
because basically the message here is
that the technical metrics are just a
tool for tracking progress towards the
business value you're trying to deliver
don't just blindly try and pursue these
performance targets because we've told
you to always be re-evaluating your
metrics to ensure that they're
incentivizing the goals that you really
care about okay that little bit of intro
out of the way let's dive into the first
and most obvious aspect of an e-commerce
site which is actually showing people
products the message I want to convey
here is really just an architectural one
for implementation I kind of want you to
take everything you learned in a DS talk
and Somis talk and just apply it here
the end go home but remember the
business objective you're trying to
achieve because it can be tempting to
find creative interpretations of some of
these metrics for example here's an
anti-pattern that I've seen on a few
sites which are going to remain nameless
and it's when you start adopting an app
shell style architecture it's incredibly
helpful in getting that time to first
paint down and it's tempting to say that
it's a meaningful first paint as well I
mean we got the brand up there we had a
indication of progress but what I came
for was the product so don't let your
code structure dictate the way that you
display content on screen fix this by
ensuring that you understand the
performance budget for your shell and
that's not delaying your other content
by waiting for the shell to actually
boot up additionally there's this one
and I still see this and this is
unstable loading so you got your
critical content there first and it's
great it's glorious right it's this cat
that lives down the street which
obviously you want to see a larger
version of so you get right in and
you're just about to happen
we pop an ad in a fright under your
finger okay I like the dark beautiful
yeah it should we need more captain yeah
honestly honestly when people stop doing
this I can't stop including M
presentations not only is this annoying
to your user but all that additional
rearranging of elements is hurting your
page performance as well so make sure
like Surma said if possible you include
everything you need to do the layout of
that page in your first request you can
actually see this approach in action if
you take a look at how amp renders its
content okay even if you're not
implementing amp you should learn from
the lessons of what they do here by
mandating a static layout it means that
the runtime can calculate the elements
that are going to appear in that first
viewport and optimized to load those
resources first images get loaded on
demand ads are always loaded with a
really low priority and these best
practices come through when you look at
some of the amp format so here you can
see a little snippet where we've got an
iframe we've set the height and width
we've provided an image in the middle
which is going to give us our fallback
while it's loading
but amp also defines this layout
component which provides some rules like
responsive fail and fixed and so on that
allow that flexibility in the display of
the element but in such a way that it's
still possible to determine the layout
without the content there already as the
formats grown we've been adding more
elements to address the needs of
different verticals like e-commerce the
amp vine component is what's enabling
the behavior up here I clicking a
different color to change the product
image and so on these examples come from
the aptly named amp by example.com so
you can go there to find way more detail
about this and as well earlier Towel
mentioned overstock where they've added
amp for their category pages now that's
stable loading that I talked about in
the layout means that I get that real
meaningful content in front of me near
instantly and tie it back to the
business metrics those talking about
they've seen an eight point three jump
eight point three percent jump in
conversion from these pages looking at
the screenshots though image is a pretty
prominent here now the amp image tag
provides a number of optimizations out
of the box
but what about your publishing on the
wider web well luckily Sam has some
opinions about this yes indeed I do you
know product images are a fundamental
component of just about every e-commerce
site successful online stores display
dozens of product images on every
landing page and now as you've heard
from Ava's presentation you need to
develop you know load strategies for all
your images but of course ecommerce you
know is kind of different
product images aren't just for
decoration whatever devices or platforms
or you know like e-commerce frameworks
you're targeting you really really need
to optimize your images you know we
review a lot of websites and I have to
say you know I think it's well I think
it's fair to say that better use of
images is the single biggest improvement
that many ecommerce sites can make you
know with image optimization small
changes can have a big impact and you
know as we know that data blight can
increase data cost but also can eat into
memory which can have a really
detrimental effect especially on lower
spec mobile devices and as actually Sam
Saucony will describe in his talk you
know image loading can actually like
load and decode can actually delay
JavaScript parsing so you need to be
really careful about this stuff using
the wrong image format you know this is
a particularly common cause of data
bloat that we see on ecommerce sites
this examples from a well-known shopping
site the biggest images it turns out and
I looked in the dev tools photographs
saved as PNG s you know the second one
here is like a photo of a cat that I
managed to easily reduce to like around
13 K and you know just by resizing as a
high quality JPEG compressing with image
optim this is a huge deal you know for
the mobile web and e-commerce another
common problem we see on ecommerce sites
is product images saved with dimensions
you know larger than needed you could
you should of course you know save it in
using pixel dimensions that appropriate
target display size and pixel density
and this can significantly reduce data
cost but like I say also memory usage
which is of course a particular problem
for low spec devices in this example
actually quoted from addy Osmani it's
book about images he's just published
his eBook Twitter made some changes and
they actually reduced decode time for a
lot of their images on the timeline from
like 400 milliseconds to 19 which is
which is huge really by making you know
just a really simple change they're
getting image sizing right yeah of
course not loading images at all is a
great solution or you know not loading
images until they're required can solve
a lot of data cost problems for image
Hemi sights but you do need to be
careful you know with product lists like
infinite scrolling otherwise it can be
really sensible to avoid pagination but
you know we do see this on a lot of
ecommerce sites there's nothing worse
than being forced to wait for images to
load while you scroll you know don't do
this
this kind of jank loses customers now
the new intersection observer API that I
think Mariko and Monica I think showed
briefly earlier can provide a much less
janky experience this API gives
JavaScript the ability to respond when
elements are about to enter the viewport
let's see that in action and we'll see
some kittens this is Louis and little
puss anyway and you know in this demo
the image is actually only loaded when
it gets to within 100 pixels of the
viewport and you can see of course the
the image actually loading from the dev
tools Network panel it's pretty easy to
code this kind of thing and this example
I've added the data source attributes to
each image specifying the image to load
and then in the JavaScript you create
the intersection observer and set it to
watch for like one or more images and
then set the source when they're about
to come into view in this example the
route margin is set so that the callback
it's images a hundred pixels before they
reach the viewport of course you can't
always guarantee images will load in
time especially when you're considering
fluctuating connectivity yeah as you've
seen on lots of sites you know a nice
technique to improve perceived
performance is to load a low resolution
placeholder before the full image you
know Facebook medium lots of sites have
done like really really ingenious
versions of this in different kinds of
ways one of my favorites takes on this
actually just seen recently is image
trace loader
I don't know if people have seen this
but you can see it here and this is
using a node module that creates SVG
placeholders which can then be used
inline it's really nice one thing that's
actually struck me looking at lots of
ecommerce sites is the sheer number and
you know churn rate for images I just
counted and amazon has like something
like I think it's 81 images on first
load of its you know its homepage on
mobile and a whopping 290 injures on on
desktop there is a lot of CAP it is
that's astonishing yeah so you know as
well as obviously individually
optimizing like you know hero images you
need to automate you must automate image
production and thankfully there are a
lot of really good free and paid for
tools and services to create and
optimize images the point here I think
is that to handle images at ecommerce
scale you must incorporate good
optimization tools in your workflow it's
kind of fundamental so finally you
really need to also build image testing
into your workflow and light house makes
this really really simple you know
identifying images that could be better
compressed better sized or otherwise
optimized you know hi people love
high-quality images on retail sites and
they can really help drive retail
traffic but you need to make sure that
they don't weigh down your website oh
thank you okay that was pretty intense
blast I can keep going if it no
no no we already recorded dear to my
heart we cut like 80 percent of our
content already so okay we've shown you
some products with beautifully optimized
images but that first product isn't
always the one you want to buy you may
actually want to navigate around the
rest of the site so we should probably
think about doing that now I feel like
e-commerce occupies this space somewhere
between content consumption and a task
oriented of application if I'm consuming
the video content then the player will
buffer ahead ensuring that say the next
30 seconds of video allotted for me so
as I explore your site I want the
content I visited to be appropriately
cache so I can come back to it and
ideally I want the content I will visit
to be pre-loaded so it's ready when I
get there
of course bandwidth isn't free so I'm
not gonna be happy if you go ahead and
preload every single possible link off
of the page one way you can go about
doing this if you have a serviceworker
in place caching your incoming requests
is that you can use the link rel
prefetch tag now what this means is the
prefetch that the browser will fire off
a low priority request for the resource
you've specified in its idle time this
means you can safely start to warm up to
neck serve resources without impacting
the users current experience the
difficult part here is not doing the
prefetch it's choosing what to prefetch
so like I was saying before you need to
use your metrics to determine what are
these likely next steps and build a
threshold in for when you want to fetch
them now you can also just use to add
items to the cache directly yourself as
Jeff mentioned the cache API is actually
available from the window as well as the
serviceworker this is useful if you want
to trigger this behavior in response to
a user action so for example if you have
products that are often purchased
together once I add one to my basket you
could go ahead and pre cash the other
products so that they're ready for me to
browse to immediately the other thing
that you could also do here is just
trigger a fetch request so if you
already have a fetch Handler that is
handling your caching especially if
you're doing something more complex then
firing the fetch lets you encapsulate
that behavior all in the fetch hand
just to do the caching bear while this
is more powerful you do need to be a bit
more careful these requests are just
sort of fired as soon as you specify
them so you're responsible for
scheduling them and be careful not to
mix in this kind of approach with like
the preload and prefetch as well because
you can easily trigger duplicate
requests for the user so that's some
browsing and exploring but what about if
I already know the product that I'm
looking for yeah that's I mean that's
where search comes in find abilities is
crucial for successful online retail I'm
not gonna talk about SEO here but now
what I want to talk about is search
within your website the need for search
you know really differentiates ecommerce
from other types of sites and apps this
is one of the like task oriented aspects
of the e-commerce experience as you can
see from this chart you know search on
shopping sites could do a lot better
this is a survey of top 50 retailers and
you know it shows like really quite high
levels of frustration you know basic
problems with search products each
search really needs to improve even just
you know to match data beyond product
names would be an improvement for a lot
of sites a good start with this really
is just to look at your search locks you
know and see how people are actually
searching and I think there's a common
theme in a lot of this it's like
resilience to differences in online
behavior you know the variety of ways
that people search for products in this
case so Ron talked about you know
caching static content or preemptively
caching resources dynamically to make
sure not to interrupt the customer flow
but what about search for e-commerce
websites people have a perception the
native apps can work without
connectivity or with you know under
flaky connectivity and not the mobile
web but you know that that's changing
would it be great if search could work
offline you know search that could
handle flaky connectivity is not
available on any e-commerce site that
we're aware of we'd like to be proven
wrong but you know this seems strange to
me places with intermittent connectivity
like transit
public transport you know for example
are exactly the kind of contexts where
people might want to search or browse
your products you know there's a reason
why there's like advertising on you know
subway trains and buses and so on of
course there are caveats price or
availability data can become stale and
data caching can only work for a limited
number of products content is also
limited you know you can't preemptively
cache hundreds of product images let
alone like videos or other heavy content
what data you choose to cache choose to
make available for search depends on
your users and you can really make a
choice here now there are lots of ways
to do search that I'm not going to talk
about you know back in search engines
like Solar elastic search newer
full-stack frameworks like firebases
firestore for example what I want to
show you is one simple way to build
client-side offline enabled search not
because this is the best or the only way
to do it but you know just because that
shows that Network resilient search is
actually possible so here it is in
action product search which is like
super fast and it actually works
seamlessly online or offline images load
if they're cached or otherwise you just
get text down this demo uses JavaScript
library called Luna which is based on
solar as they say on the tin it's not as
bright but much much smaller the core
idea is that you build an index on the
server or on the client and then use
that with a minimal JavaScript library
to implement full text search now what's
nice is that the index and and in with
the the product data can be is JSON it
can be stored using the cache API and
that makes it really really simple to
implement and you can even include like
I say the data with the index in a
single JSON file the major constraint is
that the index is often you know for a
set of data like significantly larger
than the data itself but that can still
be very manageable since Jason you know
compressors really well with gzip in our
test we found that like combining that
index and Product data for a thousand
items took a bit over like 300k can
pressed about 2/3 of that is actually
the index data so you know that's pretty
good
in the example I've used I actually use
something called elastic lunar which as
you can see here compresses to a very
tidy six kilobytes lunar can actually be
used to enable full-text search in other
context like with indexdb with rappers
and framework stuff like exe and you
know CouchDB let's take a look at the
codes first up you need to build search
index data from your product data and
you can do that on the server like I
have here using node alternatively you
could actually fetch the product data
and then build the index on the client
like I've done here
our second duck to enable that network
resilience I talked about you can cache
the index locally using the cache API
here's some serviceworker code to to do
just that
here I've specified an array of
resources to cache and service worker
event listeners and here's the code for
caching and handling
fetch requests and then you can get your
index data load it and you're good to go
and remember that the index data
including the product data is now cached
so you can still do search even if
connectivity goes up the spout
finally the bit that matters you know
there are lots of options for search but
it can be as simple as this
like I say will give you a link to some
offline search demos at the end of this
presentation now I understand it's just
a demo and this approach is certainly
not suitable for every site the point
here is that it's possible to build
experiences that work really well
despite erratic connectivity or no
connectivity at all
you know serviceworker and the cache API
mean that network resilience is becoming
the norm for good web experiences and
you know I think ecommerce really needs
to embrace that cool ok I feel like
there's kind of an extra session there
which maybe in the bar Sam will do that
at the after party and now went to the
home stretch which we're going to do
really quickly which is we're actually
going to add something to our basket and
we're going to buy
Wow okay at least we're gonna try and do
that the problem is over half of US
consumers are abandoning their cuts
that's due to small screens too many
fields to fill in poor connectivity or
poor performance so this is getting to
the heart of that 66% lower conversion
figure we showed you at the start we
want to try and solve this problem right
if users are abandoning the site because
it's a subpar experience obviously we
should address this
however like we saw people want a cross
device experience so we should embrace
that as well
users should be able to choose where
they want to shop and that's the key it
should be a choice right not just
because we've made the alternative
horribly unusable so let's start with
filling in forms you may remember the
stats from earlier today if you don't
then here's a reminder of how many times
we help people there this is okay this
is eight billion sign ins assisted per
month I think the number this morning
was actually nine billion but I can't
even imagine eight billion so eight nine
billion a lot of people yeah it's it's a
lot basically basically what this
translates to is I would like you to
mark up your forms properly in serious
is so trivial to do this and it makes
you users it makes my life a lot easier
it's not just the autocomplete
it's giving me the right keyboard for
like my email address my credit card
number and so on in fact those of you
with your laptops and access to your
code check this right now and I get it
implemented I will review the PR for you
this we promise to lgt em all as all of
your requests I saw you all with laptops
I know you can do this okay and of
course like I said before it's not just
I mean I assume you have a metric for
how happy I am but maybe that's not the
most important one you probably want to
measure some other things as well
there's an approach from Paul Kinlan
that you can use here it makes use of
the WebKit autofill pseudo-class so you
can hook a listener on to that listen
for your input events Averell i you can
now detect when autofill has been used
okay in the end we're still filling in
forms though we're still sending
passwords and credit card numbers over
the wire we've improved the user
experience but the underlying problems
still exist now you've seen payment
requests a few times today what I want
to highlight here is the journey from
those forms with the basic level this is
programmatic access to retrieving those
saved card details so now you have this
browser level standardized way of
retrieving card data and shipping
addresses and more but beyond that it's
also beginning to provide that
integrated hook into native payment
requests like Android pay and so on you
move past transmitting card numbers to
something that is both simpler and safer
for you and your users so just a quick
reminder another video that it's almost
like they knew we need to speed up
they're like yeah these are just like
files on the page how can you need to
request access for that so this is where
you do you set up your data first you
know your payment method the transaction
the shipping request and so on
right you create the payment request
passing that data in when you call show
this is what triggers the request to be
displayed on screen and then when that
promise resolves when the user has
completed the you either handle the
completed request and send it to your
payment processor or you handle any
errors
now payment requests as you saw is also
available on desktop so I can have the
same experience there but what about
taking my basket with me okay I just
don't want to browse on my phone and
then we add everything on on my laptop
and like I told you chrome will help you
there but you're still making me go
through the extra effort of pressing a
button to do that credential management
API is again moving from there autofill
to an interface to store and retrieve
the credentials and then as you can see
here I'm basically hitting the page
checking to see if I've got some
credentials and if I do then I'm passing
them to my normal sign-in process to log
my user in with the announcement of our
one tap sign up and sign-in libraries
you can build on top of that to
streamline the process even further so
now my identity is just something that
seamlessly travels with me and I'm going
to expect a personalized experience
everywhere Chris and towel mentioned
Starbucks earlier so you can see how
they've started with credential manager
API to automatically retrieve my safe
financials and sign me in as soon as I
hit the site no interaction required so
to be honest I can't really
do any thinking before I've had a coffee
so I'm enthusiastic about anything that
makes this process as seamless as
possible
yeah thanks Ron anyway so you know we've
taken you from like viewing products
through browsing search right up to
checkout but of course that's just you
know tiny slice of the entire problem um
I just wanted to check actually we were
wondering is there anyone in the
audience who's actually ever worked on
an e-commerce site on an online store oh
my god okay that's quite okay well look
we have a lot of Googlers on hand you
know who've worked on payments and
credentials and a really expert in
online retail so please come and chat to
us in the forum or wherever you know
we'd really like to hear your
experiences what you want from the
platform and what's missing you know
what we can do to help yeah and I mean
this is really just the beginning of the
conversation it's not just us we've been
talking to retailers to try and learn
about their challenges we've been
talking to e-commerce platforms like
Magento who are busy transforming their
product into a PWA platform they're
around today and would be more than
happy to chat with you as well now
speaking of slices we wanted to find a
way to keep serving up even more of
these examples so we're building actual
buu we're building the progressively
improved ecommerce or pie shop as a
platform for sharing this with you so
you can follow along with our progress
there on github right yeah we we've also
put together a document to accompany
this talk which has links to a lot more
information including the demos you
couldn't see earlier and also the you
know the pie shop project and all the
resources we've referred to today yes so
thank you for listening if you find us
later on Twitter we'd love to chat more
