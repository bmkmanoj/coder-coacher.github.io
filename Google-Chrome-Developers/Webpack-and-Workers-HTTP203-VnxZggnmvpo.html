is it is it the 2 minute speed run of
the web 2 minute speed run that's pretty
good because I was thinking of like HTTP
to a free into but it's just too many
numbers then really isn't it drive it
home so 2 minutes you're gonna talk
about a thing and what you're going to
talk about I'm gonna talk about my
recent explorations with web heck and
workers you have two minutes
go work us yes I'm aware of them still I
think this is a copy of exactly what we
said in the previous episode but now
imagine you want to have module loading
in workers you can have that that's the
import function but it's not available
in workers anywhere yes yes so for nowt
you can't okay but ok cool let's do
something like roll up oh hi Pat where
you basically transform the syntax into
just like in lining the things or
loading some with some other mechanism
well cuz your input script the main
threat has script tags so you can
emulate the behavior yes I look into web
pack and I was trying to build a little
app it has logic in the worker and UI in
the main thread and had some modules
that were shared between the main thread
and the worker oh right and this is
something you can deal with because you
can have you say your main page just
including it as a script tag yeah or
dynamic import and your worker can use
that horrible import script synchronous
function but it wasn't it so yes and my
thought was what pet should figure this
out right like you should see oh there's
a shared code let's put this in a
separate files using its comments
drinking stuff so exactly it realizes
how here's the common bit I into a
separate file right from resolved you
would think not quite so that's a slight
difference so because in web pack you
have entry points and these entry points
are assumed that you take one of them at
a time
but with a worker you actually take an
entry point and the worker entry point
at the same time so there's a different
assumption because you can actually
between entry points usually webpack
doesn't put common modules in a share
say so this is when you're using webpack
to do the work magic for you yeah what
if you just do
we've got two entry points one doesn't
know that there are shared modules all
these haven't figured out so now I have
put in an issue in a more discuss with
the webhead people how we can support
workers because I feel like I want to
make 2018 about workers so we need
support in tooling for that that was
very good timing because ah nicely done
music to my ears nicely it's not as good
Christmas if I set that off again do you
want to just beat box and then we could
dump that I was home
I'll give you maybe ten maybe five
seconds five four three two one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
