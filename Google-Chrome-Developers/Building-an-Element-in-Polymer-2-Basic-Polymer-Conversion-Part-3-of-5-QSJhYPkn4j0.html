welcome back to our series on building
an element in polymer 2 in the last
video we got to know the layout of a
polymer element now let's get to work
building a simple checklist will start
by locking it up so a checklist is going
to have some simple check boxes and a
input so let's create a check box so
input of type check box let's remove
these other things we don't need that
right there and then we'll create a
normal input and so if you go over here
this looks about right you have a check
box and you have the name of your task
like get Tomatoes but the thing is the
check box usually has more than just
this so we might want to have more than
just that it's copy paste this a bunch
of times and here's a bunch of different
check boxes and let's see what else we
can do let's add a header for the title
let's say this is the to do section and
we'll also create a completed section so
you know exactly what you've done
already and the call is completed and
we'll copy/paste a few here and we'll
add a button at the bottom to create a
bit more so add tasks give it a refresh
looks pretty good we have a to-do
section with a bunch of things that you
want to do and then you have a completed
section and these should all be checked
at the end and an ADD task button which
would create more tasks alright so let's
go back let's clean it up just a bit
let's remove this section we'll put a
placeholder here so we remember to go
back here add completed stuff and then
let's take a look at the to do section
so the 2d section is a bit long it's
something that we can't really scale up
so if somebody wants a hundred different
things you
you copy paste this 100 times and that's
not exactly what we want
it'd be nice to consolidate and have one
section that repeats dynamically
luckily the polymer library has a very
nice feature in it called Don repeat you
can find this and other types of useful
libraries in the lib folder inside of
the polymer directory in here you'll see
things like elements and utilities
mix-ins and some legacy stuff from Pablo
Moore one if you're still attached to
that and so here you'll see dom repeat
HTML let's import that so we'll go into
the polymer directory and import you
live directory and then elements and
then dom repeat so now there it is let's
type it in here and so dom repeat is an
element that wraps around your repeating
sections so create that move this cut it
up create a template tag and paste it in
there now let's just fix this up make it
look all pretty cool nice so let's go
repeat
nothing's repeating what did we do wrong
so luckily the polymer IDE when you
mouse over it will tell you a lot of
nice features about this element so here
it's actually a slightly older version
of Dom lot of Dom repeat so it takes an
items property and it has a template
with the things that you actually want
to repeat so let's go type that in so
and don't repeat let's type in items
here the polymer IDE again will tell you
a bunch of different things like items
only takes an array and it determines
how many instances you'll have the
template so let's data bind this over to
a variable that we're going to do whole
tasks and so tasks we're gonna have to
define over here in the properties block
so we have tasks we're going to call the
type
arrey and then call the value we're
going to make it a function that just
simply returns an empty array its
refresh still nothing because the array
is empty so let's fill it up with stuff
so we'll have one two three four five
sorry it's not zero indexed and tada
here you go you have five different
things repeated you can also do nice
things like rename the property with as
and so we'll say these items that are
passed in we're gonna call them the
variable tasks and in here in the text
input we'll bind it to that so we'll
have input type text with the value of
tasks go back over here and there you go
it data binds the values that were in
the array so we've mocked up a simple
checklist but there's still some work
that we can do to make it look a little
nicer in the next video we'll use
pre-made elements and styling to clean
things up see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
