in dev tools in chrome 61 the new mobile
device throttling menu lets you simulate
a low end or mid tier mobile device with
a couple of clicks press toggle device
tool bar to enter device mode the mobile
device throttling menu is set to online
by default click it to see the mobile
device options select low-end mobile and
you see warning icons pop up next to the
network and performance tabs these are
here to remind you that you've got
Network and CPU throttling enabled now
when you interact with your pages you
can get a better idea of how they load
and respond on a low-end device to see
exactly how dev tools defines a low-end
device hover over the menu or go to the
performance panel and open the capture
settings menu the throttling menu is
just a shortcut for setting the network
and CPU options here you can see that
they automatically update when I set the
throttling menu back to online the new
usage chart on the clear storage pane
breaks down how much storage your page
is using organized by technology another
new feature in the application panel is
the time cache column which tells you
when a response was cached also new you
can now enable the FPS meter from the
command menu press command shift P on
Mac or ctrl shift P on Windows and Linux
to open the command menu type FPS then
select show frames per second meter in
the top right of your viewport there's
now an overlay that shows your pages fps
performance in real time if you work
with a lot of performance recordings
there's now a setting to change how your
mouse wheel or trackpad behaves while
you're analyzing a recording here I've
got a recording of a page load by
default when I swipe up and down with
two fingers on this section dev tool
zoom in and out but if I open up
settings and set flame chart mouse wheel
action to scroll now that action Scrolls
the section instead es6 modules are
shipping natively in Chrome 61 and
debugging and dev tools works as you'd
expect it to
right now we're paused on this on
function in bootstrap gasps it says here
that we're importing the function from
helpers jeaious when I step into this
function it should jump us to its
definition in helpers jeaious meet
that's all for chrome 61 thanks for
watching
tweet us at chrome dev tools or start a
thread in the mailing list to discuss
these changes and subscribe to the
chrome Developers YouTube channel to
keep up on the latest ideas I'll see you
in six weeks for a chrome 62</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
