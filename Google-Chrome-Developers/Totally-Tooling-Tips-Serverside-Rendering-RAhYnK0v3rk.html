is server-side rendering yeah it's a hot
topic hot topic lots of nuance lots of
opinions around it yeah lots of feelings
what is server-side rendering in a
nutshell server-side rendering is and
this is particularly important for like
JavaScript heavy like client-side apps
you take your application and you sort
of like you think of it almost like you
you pre boot it up on the server so you
stamp out all the Dom nodes you get
everything kind of in place you have
your CSS in place so it paints really
fast you send all that down to the
client you get a really nice fast first
paint right because everything is just
already there in the document right but
it comes with a cost
right if your server-side rendering
something it's gonna potentially improve
a few metrics like potentially first
paint at first meaningful paint for
content full paint how quickly people
get text on the screen but it also comes
at the cost of you shipping down a much
larger payload of HTML yeah after your
users and that can have the impact of
pushing out everything else including
your JavaScript yeah so you get this
like really fast first paint showing
people something on the screen you can
see it but then you can't necessarily
interact with it it's like you know you
end up on a shopping page renders really
quickly then you start tapping on
buttons and unless everything is like
end-to-end server-side rendered the user
might have bits of the experience that
not necessarily complete ready yeah
that's right off I've experienced this
recently I was I was driving through the
woods and was on a way slower mobile
connection that I usually am
and yeah I landed on a page and I knew
it was server rendered because I was I
was like I can't click on any of this
and I know exactly why yeah it can be
frustrating yeah it can be I mean
they're there for different you know
verticals maybe server-side rendering
makes sense so if I'm a publisher I
might care more like really I have a way
about making sure that the article text
can be seen pretty early on that people
people use server-side rendering for
lots of different reasons so some people
will use at optimize those metrics other
people will do it because they're trying
to make sure the Googlebot and search
crawlers can't see their content
especially cuz not not all crawlers can
run JavaScript yes so we've said like
Google has said that you know the
crawler can understand JavaScript to
some extent and that's that's great and
everything what I what I recommend if
folks are unsure is to go check out the
webmaster tools there's like a little
tool there right that's you go fetch as
Google lets you render your page the
same way that the Google bot would and
we now know that that's powered by
chrome 41 yeah we've got some Doc's on
that now leave them down in the show
notes link them up in the magic boxes
and that's great you should you should
check that out see if it's actually
busted in any way yeah you know before
it can be surprising because you're like
all everyone's JavaScript so I'm just
gonna assume it runs like latest Java
super free one came out a while back
alright it's probably old enough to
drive
and so there there definitely times when
you know I forget to include polyfills
for you know for search crawlers like
you sometimes need to you know you can
probably feel things like promises
depending on the crawler so people
should just be careful Yeah right
I think actually in the article you
mentioned there are even some debugging
tips because you do fetch as Google and
you might just see like a blank page and
it's hard to know that okay well what's
missing right is my application actually
broken or like you're saying am i
missing a polyfill so there are some
tips in there how you can kind of debug
that and figure out you know which is it
I've totally been bitten by this before
I was missing a web animations polyfill
once and I was just like I guess like
this whole thing's just broken yeah and
then was able to debug it and I was like
oh I just need to include this one yeah
yeah
so it may not be quite as complex and
broken those folks think there are some
possible ideals I know that you know
when some people are thinking about
building mobile websites progressive web
apps you know will tell them that the
you know architecture pattern of choices
the application show because you can
easily cache pieces of your UI that
don't need to be fetched from the
network on repeat visits improves your
performance and so on but then they're
like well yeah but I kind of need to
server-side render my content too
because I they be tested and server-side
rendering is improving my SEO and it's
nice to get a little bit complicated I
mean one one possible balance you could
find there is use your architecture of
choice for your performance architecture
of choice for your normal users and then
conditionally serve the server-side
rendered version to you know
Googlebot or other search crawlers yeah
do a little will you a sniffing may be
good
hi I didn't say that
okay Matt said that Matt said that's
that area so folks should be you know
there's there's a lot of nuance this
problem we're not talking about in terms
of performance I know that everyone's
gonna have different things that they
care about just be you know take a
holistic look at server-side rendering
and we're you know we're their trade
offs we're you know maybe just using a
fresco over other things might make
sense and just you know use your tools
measure I have tools tools not rules
grace not rules that's what the that's
my kids say ya know
there is a sign off of some shirt you
have for this episode it's totally time
for the end of the episode now thanks
