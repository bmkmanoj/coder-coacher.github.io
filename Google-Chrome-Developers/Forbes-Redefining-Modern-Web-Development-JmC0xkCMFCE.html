no place I can't reach the impact of the
web on the newsroom's was monumental
it's now more the reader telling an
illusion this is important to me you
really have to start to build from
scratch what is a story on the phone
with a progressive web app there's a
link tap it and install it with no
friction the PWA is on their phone done
and once that is installed we are able
to alert you to hey we got some more
information for you if you're interested
in whatever areas as you are you can
install that subject that topic and
we're going to serve you the content
that you want that's going to change our
business in a big way the technology has
enabled us to make our new PW a faster
than the current mobile site we're now
able to deliver visuals fast append if
you can start to deliver visual spectrum
then you can start to change the formats
you do people are willing to stay longer
of space stay longer a see more
advertising the PWA is going to result
in more personalization personalization
will yield more engagement the web has
made me realize there's an audience out
there an audience that's knowledgeable
and as an audience that needs to be
understood
