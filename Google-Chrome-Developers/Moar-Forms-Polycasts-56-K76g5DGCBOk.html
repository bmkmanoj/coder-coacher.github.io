another edition of the Americas show
last time when I was here I was telling
you about how to get your forms to care
about your custom element and the thing
that I showed you was that you can
basically bind the property that you
care about in a custom element to the
value of a hidden input because forms
care about hidden inputs and that's how
you can send them to the server today
I'm gonna still talk about forums but
I'm gonna show you something a little
bit different oftentimes you might be
the one writing your custom element and
all you need to do is just make an input
look prettier because the native input
isn't the greatest so if you want to
just do that the way you can get a get
around it is to just make a wrapper that
just styles your input and then your
input is still in the light Dom of the
form so the form just sees it as if it
was a normal input and not a custom
element so let's go ahead and do this
over here I have a form just like I had
before and it's styled it's exactly the
same that almost last time I'm still
using HTTP pin and if you missed it I
was telling you it's a thing that just
basically echoes back all the headers
and all the arguments that you sent in
which is great so I have a form and in
it I want to do again the birthday
example where I'm gonna ask you to put
in your birthday and then I'm gonna send
you something on your birthday so I'm
gonna have an input here inside the form
and these inputs have a placeholder and
they have a name and a date so if they
have a name the form cares about them
and it's gonna submit them so we can go
ahead and see what it looks like you
have a really ugly input but if I type
something in it
by the magic of forums I'm gonna send
this day in the month over there but
that's not what I want I want to
assemble something that says birthday so
that my server knows what to do with it
so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is
first make these inputs look great
because they're terrible right now I'm
gonna wrap them in a custom element that
is gonna take a label that we're gonna
display and just style basically all of
these inputs that get distributed to it
so if you go over here to our element
I'm gonna add the label and it's gonna
come as a property as you saw so I'm
gonna actually add it as a property so
that we can display it and then a giant
content block that basically says
display here everything that you're
passing me
and again the styles aren't any
different than before if you look at my
shirt styles the only thing that I had
to add was to also style a distributed
input not just like a shadow Dom input
like before so if you go back to inform
I'm gonna actually import the elements
so that it works and now if i refresh my
page BAM
pretty input that's amazing but whatever
data you passing it it's still in the
wrong format because I didn't really fix
that in any way so we can go ahead and
do that by binding the value that we get
from a native events I'm gonna over here
get the value from the input and it's
gonna be whatever the input fires an
event I'm gonna put in in a property
called month and I'm gonna do the same
for the date only call it a date
and then I'm gonna do the same trick as
before where I have a hidden input and
that thing is sent to the server so I'm
gonna bind this property month and this
day separate them by slash and wrap
these all in a nice little Dom bind so
that the bindings actually work and if I
go back to the demo put in a birthday as
before submit it BAM look at that we
have an argument called birthday and
it's in the right format the server is
happy I'm happy
the forum is happy I think we got this
done so that's it that's another way
that it can get your forums to care
about custom elements thank you so much
for watching hopefully I'll get to see
you again
I'll talk to Rob to see if we can do
this again please subscribe to the
channel if you have any questions
