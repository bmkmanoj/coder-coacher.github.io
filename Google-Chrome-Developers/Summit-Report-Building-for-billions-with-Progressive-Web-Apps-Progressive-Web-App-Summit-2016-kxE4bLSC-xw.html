to the progressive Web Apps summit we
are just wrapping up day one you can see
we're setting up for the after-party now
I'm here with child Oppenheimer she is a
product manager on the Chrome for
Android team tell you were just talking
about building for billions and making
sure that businesses are really thinking
about emerging markets so as what are
you just tell me you'd like you know why
is it important for businesses to be
considering these markets what is you
know what should their their direction
be there
well we've seen across the board when
we're actually thinking about building
experiences for everyone is if you
actually want to reach as many people as
you can the growth that we're seeing in
Internet users is very much in emerging
markets and so when you look at Internet
users today we actually see that the
majority of Internet users are in India
and China and the United States still
has quite a bit what's really remarkable
is when you look at where the growth is
coming from it's primarily driven by
places like India or places where people
haven't had internet connection in the
past so we've actually seen over the
past year in India that a population
equivalent to about a third of the
United States entire population came
online just in a single year in India
and there's still over 800 million users
in India who don't have internet
internet access yet so we expect that
number to keep growing and and in these
markets I know probably a big deal is
the the network infrastructure right and
and it may be being not so not so great
at times can be a little bit flaky can
you just talk a little bit about that
like what did developers need to have in
their head when they're thinking about
these network conditions yeah absolutely
so there's probably two main points to
think about when you're thinking about
your network conditions for users who
are coming online for the first time the
first is that the network conditions can
be spotty and they can be slow so we
actually see that globally a metric from
2015 found that about 60% of cellular
connections around the world are 2g
connections but in a lot of these areas
where people are coming online for the
first time we see this closer to 2/3 or
66% of all connections are 2g and that's
ignoring 2g liked speeds which is
actually a much bigger portion of
connection types so the speed can
actually have a really big impact on how
long users have to wait to even get to
your experience in the first place and
the second big thing to keep in mind is
the cost a lot of the users in these
areas are relying solely on cellular
connections on their phone to access the
Internet and that means that they're
paying for the data
quite regularly for all of their
internet access and on a lot of these
areas data can be incredibly expensive
so in India for example if you look at
minimum wage in conjunction with how
much of 500 megabyte data plan costs a
user would have to work about 17 hours
on minimum wage just to afford 500
megabytes of data which is huge if you
actually try to simplify that to web
views or something it gets the point of
about just being a huge trade-off if a
users accessing your website they're not
accessing something else and they have
to make those trade-offs pretty
consistently yeah absolutely especially
with sort of the sizes of webpages
growing all the time it seems yeah so
okay so with that in mind how does the
developer approach this problem I mean
are there are there tools are there
strategies like how would I go about
sort of reducing that that payload size
there's a few things the first is
probably to just think about it right
take a walk through your experience and
think how many page loads am I making
the user get to before they get
something valuable
how big is each of those page loads
actually on chrome dev tools you can see
on the network panel exactly how many
bytes are being transferred for every
page load both using cache and not using
cache and you can also simulate
different connection speeds so you can
throttle your connection to B to
simulate a 2g light connection so you
can see how long users have to wait and
sometimes it can be 11 seconds which it
might you might not expect if you're
testing on your conditions so the first
step would absolutely be just to sort of
test it out and then beyond that there's
actually a whole lot of tools that you
as a developer can use you can use
service workers to help a lot with speed
not just for offline and sort of the
extreme of the connection type but also
to keep an eye out for sort of request
timeouts if users are on really slow
round-trip times to make sure that
things are still loading as quickly as
possible
cool and if there if there's maybe like
a good educational resource someplace
where I can go to learn more about some
of these things do you have one of those
in mind yeah absolutely so we actually
have a sort of building for billions
website that covers what you can should
think about when you're thinking about a
global audience and then the tools that
we have so that's just on sort of our
developer tools under billions okay
right on so we can include a link to
that site down in the description also
if you are interested in catching towels
talk that is on the PWA
progressive web apps dev summit playlist
on our chrome Developers YouTube channel
go there check out the playlist also be
sure to subscribe Cal thank you so much
for chatting with us today thank you all
so much for
sticking with us today we're wrapping up
day one so I'll catch you here again
tomorrow for day two of the progressive
Web Apps summit live from Amsterdam
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
