him is Philip anchor okay did I say it
right yeah you did he comes to us from a
peer in and others might knowing by the
guy that has the most number of bugs in
the chromium whatever about web RTC I
know it was the guy that if you had any
real issue of the behavior for Bertie
see he's the guy to ask you ask you get
immediately URL of a bug in chrome that
is the responsibility and in which
versions it was published what happens
today and what it's going to be fixed
and today is going to talk about duo one
of the things that he loves doing is to
tinker with stuff and the tinkers
usually with others applications that
use web RTC so you're free so today I'm
going to talk about duo thanks I for the
intro so I can skip that so last year we
did a weapon see hack series Chad asked
me after reverse engineering hangouts to
do some more stuff in WebRTC hacks and
we got google to sponsor a basically
survey of the mobile application space
we did stuff on whatsapp on FaceTime
facebook Messenger and why did Google do
that we didn't find out that last year
but at Google i/o we saw them launching
duo and it's built by the team behind
where disease i said and they said we
know this technology like no one else
and yep challenge accepted so I started
reverse engineering that but first why
would you do that so one of the things
is you want to look at what your
competitor does I'm not implying I'm
competing with Google here and you want
also to look at how your own app behaves
and like what protocols do they use for
signaling what codecs do they use do
they use h.264 vpa 859 what bandwidth
settings do they use which you will see
in my appearing a lot we think it was
apt what signaling protocols I used what
how does the connection establishment
work we saw that was what's up and do
they have any exciting features that can
let's say borrow
so in terms of tools I prefer just to
sniff the traffic on the network it's
easy on the legal side you don't have to
reverse engineer the binary which is a
little more tricky usually and I mainly
use TC be done but in wireshark tcpdump
for capturing stuff and then Wireshark
for analyzing it even though I end up
writing a lot of actual codes that
processes the packets and then displays
them in certain ways we'll see that so I
also like this Wi-Fi pineapple router
it's very convenient because it's a
Wi-Fi hacking device and it's very
convenient for mobile development
because you can just SSH into it to a
TCP dump and get the same behavior you
get on wire sharks the same
functionality on this device and it
allows you to capture from your mobile
device so duo has some interesting
features first thing is the connection
setup google was very interested in that
last year the other is knock knock which
basically shows the caller's video
before you accept and another big thing
they are proud of is the switch between
4g and Wi-Fi so in terms of connection
setup we found when looking at what's up
that they are going for a relay server
first and basically they start doing the
call establishing a connection to the
relay server and then once I get set
that is most likely going to work they
try to move to peer-to-peer and that
gives you a slightly faster call setup
since you have less connections to check
and if you use ice there's a slight cost
of doing more connection checking more
connections and yep we found that the
users turn first so the orange line you
see here is on port 19 305 they're
running the turn service on the same
port as I do for their upper UC demo and
what you can see is also that it seems
to be used exclusively during knock
knock which might be a privacy sing like
you don't want to expose the other IP
address
and once Dena clock faces over which
took like seven seconds in that graph
you can see the pink line and you can
see that the other side is answering it
is the audio you can see at the bottom
it's a bit late I don't know why yet but
maybe I'll find out and it uses dtls it
uses ecdsa p 2 65 to generate those
certificates which is much faster than
the old RSA certificates on mobile
devices and that was an optimization
that started in 2014 you can see that
the if you look at the Wireshark stuff
you can see that it's 91 bites
certificates hidden inside turn channel
data which makes it very hard to find
and initially I didn't see it I thought
oh its esters but it wasn't so knock
knock it is not really new ID you see
who's calling and then you can decide
whether you want to accept and it has
probably been tried many times in the
past but it isn't common so why didn't
it work out I think it requires a very
high video quality instantly the first
two seconds because if you see a blob of
pixels then you're not going to accept
the call so what Google did is they
implemented a new way to estimate the
bandwidth and that's called sense I'd be
w/e and you can see it in the RTP
packets because they have a specific RTP
headaches engine with an ID 5 and I
could observe them so the orange lines
there shows the ramp up to 1 megabit per
second and I think Nicholas is going to
talk about that later and there it takes
seven seconds which is a bit bad
probably going to touch that later but
you see the answer is video the purple
line goes up very fast in less than a
second and I blame those results on the
capture set up i had so one thing I
noticed is that after knock knock one
part of the eyes username fragment
changes that is similar to a nice
restart but it's not a full
is restarts and we'll talk more about
that now because the seamless handoff
they have it is quite impressive feature
basically you think situation is you
walk out of the door you walk out of the
range of your Wi-Fi and then just
switches from Wi-Fi network to mobile
network and it works really great I
found it to switch in less than two
seconds so in terms of usability it's
great I even saw it sometimes happening
between two clients on the same Wi-Fi
which then fall back to the mobile
network which probably is a back so how
do you capture that how do you capture
stuff from the mobile network to observe
this behavior so I work for a telco so a
period is part of telenor so I just
thought okay maybe I can do my pineapple
stuff on the one end and a gsm gateway
support node box on the other end it's a
little hard to get access to those boxes
unless you're a telco you then it's not
easy and it turns out that it is very
hard to sink those captures between
those two capture files you get from
that fortunately there's an easier way
basically you capture the receiving end
of the call so the other side is
initially connected to 4g and Wi-Fi then
at some point you just plug the unplug
the Wi-Fi router and what do we see when
we do that we see that it on the left
side there is the orange line that is
the turn first part before knock knock
is accepted then we can see that the
pink line where peer-to-peer kicks in
it's on a different connection then at
16 15 I unplug the router ucz pink line
ends and there's this orange part in the
middle which kicks in after that it's on
the same connection that was used
previously was he turn server but it's a
different period you can see that if you
look very closely in the capture packets
it's not very nice because you need to
go through a sudden of packets and then
after plugging 02 back the
traffic switches back to the Wi-Fi
network because in some countries it's
costing you money to use the mobile data
and we can also see during this
switching phase when the there's a
slight glitch when turning the wife are
offset forward error correction is
kicking in so you can see that in those
red and green lines at that point and
that turned out to be important later
and it's the same connection as we've
used previously it's turned you to the
capture setup I had and you can see the
different peers in the turn channel
binding and send data indications and
what you can see here is the orange line
continues even though the pink line is
transferring all the data and most
important it's not a nice restart the
username fragment combination stays the
same which makes it by definition not a
nice restart so I see stars are
basically the standard way of dealing
with a connection failure in ice you
send get a new candidate sent them via
the signaling channel problem is if you
walk out of the door you're signaling
channel may have just died as well and
what do does it voices it doesn't do a
nice restart that keeps this as a
connection open and then it can
seamlessly switch over to that
connection that has the advantage that
it works when the signaling channel is
down even though the signaling channel
is probably quick so it might really
establish at that point it's very hard
to determine and I don't think they're
going to talk about that anytime soon so
another thing to commonly check here is
what audio codec is used like we know
Google will still likes the I cyclic a
lot it's still in chrome but in the
packets in the dump i just found payload
type 1 11 which is the standard opus
payload type no surprise here I mean
opener is a great quality the more
interesting question and I'm looking at
Utah is what is the video codec used
is it h.264 is it vp8 is it vp9 so I
searched for the standard payload types
which are 104 vp8 1014 vp9 and 107 for
h.264 and I didn't find anything and
that is why default the weapon see
library encodes the data or Samsung
prefers to send them on the network
using the redundant data which is
payload type 1 16 however there were
retransmissions during that glitch face
and it took me quite a while to find
those and what I saw was a number of
packets with an RTP payload type 99
which in chrome is a common
retransmission payload type for the
payload type 107 which if you paid
attention on the previous light turns
out to be h.264 and I think it's because
I captured iOS iOS sessions mainly and
of course it's on iOS it's a battery
life question and you want to conserve
battery life you want to use hardware
acceleration so h26 horse and natural
choice there it seems that the
controlling the bitrate of the hardware
encoder is a bit tricky we've seen a
number of bug fixes there recently and
the quality i got from do was less than
i expected so more improvements overall
I think do a soft quite a number of hard
engineering problems and I've seen the
problems I've known in the last 23 years
that they have been working on it and it
really took them that long probably so
to do this fast call setups they do this
turn first stuff which landed in chrome
in January racing's they do ecdsa
certificates web racy switched
completely to that it's the defaulting
thompson's chrome 52 this walk out of
the door problem it solved by keeping a
fallback connection open and the hard
when coding to maximize battery life
using h.264 for iOS iOS that is
something that has been worked on last
year mostly and one of the big problems
that still remains is this initial video
quality
teasing and you really want this fast
ramp up do two cents I'd bandwidth
estimation and I think it is very
promising what is going to happen here
and it's going to be default in chrome
55 which is going to be rolling out in a
couple of weeks so basically that makes
do a real benchmark against which you
can test your application in terms of
quality and features and I left just let
that stand so good work Justin hope
you're not unhappy
