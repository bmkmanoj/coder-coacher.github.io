that is also the last month of 2017 true
so we're thinking towards 2018 in the
things and going to be landing in
browsers or things we'll be thinking
about in that year so I want you to
spend like the next two minutes
introducing a subject you can quiz me
about it and we'll see if we can come up
with something that we can actually
publish on YouTube right here we go two
minutes I want to talk about weightless
CSS weightless that is one of the words
I said the other one is CSS so CSS with
a weight yes that is a good reversal and
what is some weight okay so when you
write a CSS selector it has specificity
that is correct yes which if I I could
call weight if I didn't want to risk
trying to pronounce asbestos it means
specifically less CSS is exactly can you
see now why I went for weightless CSS
yes so this is a proposal that was
agreed on in TPAC mm-hmm and 2017 in
2017 and livery was telling me about it
and and the idea is they haven't settled
on a name yet but it would be something
like is in the same way that like like :
is and then a function yes exactly that
and inside you could put like a simple
selector Oh like dot foo
so that would make a selector make match
without increasing its specificity
exactly that so you be able to use all
of the stuff that you can use outside is
or whatever it's called but it would
have like yeah why are your specificity
because this is this is the CSS working
groups attempt to meet people halfway
that don't enjoy the Cascade so much oh
I see so one of the things that you know
the complaints are the one of the
reasons they've seen people go to CSS
and JavaScript is that this new hole
just attach it to the element directly
exactly I send their models a lot
simpler
so it's can they bring that to regular
style sheets as an option where just
things will be done sequentially can I
use child selectors in the is thing I
don't think so because
that was one of the long-standing things
that people wanted to or that they if
you contain a thing of that type then
style me the other way around or
something no it would just be simple
selectors but no specificity
this the out-of-time editor it's the
template proposal from apples Oh Apple
template proposal the Appleton doesn't
hold so what like what they proposed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
