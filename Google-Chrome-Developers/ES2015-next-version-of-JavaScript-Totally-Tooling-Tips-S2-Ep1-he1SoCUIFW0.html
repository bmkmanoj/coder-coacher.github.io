for life the future for life global
warming
Skynet taking over human species just
being obliterated but on the flip side
we've got es6 so it's all gonna be okay
everything everything worked out great
then it's gonna be great anyway you all
right es6 is awesome
it is awesome like I I guess the one
thing is at the moment is you can't you
can't just use vanilla es6 and the
browser like right now i think so we've
been we've been landing a lot of u6
features in chrome v8 or philosophically
years other browser vendors been doing
an amazing job with this too but we're
not quite at the point where you can
just you know use it in production
without acquiring translation yeah on
that side of things a lot of people
probably need a good transpiler I think
most people are using Babel at the
moment yeah it alone pretty legit and if
you're using babel like and you're
trying to get into a build process what
we probably use or you know things like
gulp table just a few lines of code get
set up it's very very straightforward
but I think you've been you've been
playing around with browserify and babel
if i for like bundles right yeah so the
only reason of using both is browser v
will grab any of the imported files and
bring them all into one so that when you
run it through babel fi it's got
everything just in one place it can just
lunge it all together and that seems to
be working out okay like the one thing
that you see in a lot of tutorials
people would just say define your script
file and then run it through browserify
and then run that through babel and then
everything will just work out and it's
just for that one file and that's fine
but the minute you add another file for
a separate page or something it doesn't
everything just falls apart
so I've had to do a little bit of work
there it's just like I'm using glob da
sink to basically just go through a set
of files in my bill process and it looks
with just is six GS and those files will
then get run through like browserify and
then once it gives your browser probably
get said through paper fine and then it
creates the files that's legit
so I've got like a nice little workflow
going right now so that I can just write
here six and then everything's like
ready for the server in es5 good to go
cool so the first step is transpiration
we've also got so one thing we need to
do usually is both lint our code and in
style check it and what I've been mostly
using for the stuff is like I've used
jazz hit pretty heavily in the past for
Coast out for code linting and J SCS for
code style checking and gscs 2.0 now
supports like babel so you can style
check your code it also has a number of
es6 only features which are kind of nice
like es6 only rules so let's say I've
got some code that's using string
concatenation I can actually add a rule
to my GSEs config and say well I want
that code to be using template strings
instead and then like throw a little
exception and say you know nice if you
wanted to do things like oh okay in this
case you could use the ferry function
force that as just a linting rule
yes exactly this is kind of sweet on the
the linting side of things there are a
few people that have been like switching
over to using yes lint it's a yes lint
is a tool by Nicolas sake his that tries
to combine some of the features you'd
find in gscs and J's hint but it's a
little bit what could argue it's a
little bit more future facing tries to
support es6 a little bit better I still
personally use J in J s yes but yes lint
is is really solid it's a an option a
bunch of people are using so we're
checking out - yeah like I've still just
start to Jason and Jessie as logic is
like that's what I'm used to anything I
had to do was that in the es next true
into Jason I see
and JC JSC SRC file CA s next true and
then all the linting rules too started
working like it everything that it was
complaining about something just went
away it's like using a class that's fine
there you go but yeah that that has
basically been my set up process which
is actually been fairly simple once I
got it all set up like the major feature
that I'm just in love with is the fact
that you can have a fire with a function
or a class and you just basically sit
it's just defined like an export saying
this part this function or this class is
allowed to be exported and imported by
another another class and that alone
I've just fallen off with just
everything to do with me or six modules
is fantastic ability to import which
means you can then extend one of your
classes to the other one and then just
will the boilerplate for this top
prototype you know just like getting rid
of all of that and just defining a
function like my code I'm so much
happier with how much cleaner it looks
and like because I come from a bit of a
like a Java background like this is just
like so super friendly to me
it's insane like what are your favorite
features and yes in a critique you for
free Java too much like my my futures
are most of what I would do I like like
everything I kind of like template
strings there need objects for the
shorthand object literal stuff super
need a lot less boilerplate involved I
love computer property names yeah having
that in the language is amazing fat
hours are neat two-week Maps week maps
movie sets but I did want a name job
what are two things so another name
drill paddy you're surely I know your
shot so I'm surprised you know wearing a
t-shirt with set name drop right now no
no I'm wearing a t-shirt that this
doesn't never forget floppy just never
forget so I've put together a repo
called es6 tools that tries to summarize
the whole landscape of tooling for es6
es2015 whatever you want to call it yeah
tries to capture like stuff that you
need for Grund's and go up and you know
all the polyfills you need and all that
other fun stuff so it's kind of like
depending on what you'll set up is you
could go to this
just list down all the things I to you
right there that's the idea nice but I
also wanted to mention so there's two
really good books that are free to read
online if people want to learn more
about es6 the first is understanding es6
which i've been reading a lot it's by
nicholas Akos again solid book and
there's another one called exploring es6
by axel rush manor both saw books both
really really knowledgeable guys so yeah
people should check those out yeah like
i loved it like the amount of white code
that you can delete just from a ton of
these features and just the
maintainability feel somewhat cleaner
with this kind of thing absolutely love
it for me i think everyone should be
checking here sex and just playing
around with it like like i said for me
like it just makes everything much more
like ever which i love what it no no
we're taking you six away from you
you're just no more no more babel format</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
