welcome back to day two of the chrome
dev summit I'm joined here on the floor
by webmaster extraordinaire Paul Kinlan
Paul's also a member of the chrome
developer relations team Paul you and
and yes you're our webmaster I know and
you are going to give a talk on what is
next for the web so can you this like a
preview of some of the content that
you're going to be covering in your talk
yeah so the what I'm talking about
what's new and what's next in the web is
like why the web is good why we still
think it's a platform that you should
deploy on and like why you should be
built like building for the web like
continuously and continuously deployed
into it so one of the things that we're
talking about is obviously the why but
also kind of some of the brand new
things are coming to the web there's a
whole bunch of brand-new api's that are
kind of like landing inside the browser
not every browser at the same time yeah
it's a bit of a problem sometimes but
they really enhanced kind of like the
capabilities of the platform and I'm
trying to talk about why we should be
like still pushing on the features on
the platform and actually trying to
build the great experiences and then I
kind of look at some new api's which are
kind of like a little bit of showbiz as
well so so I don't know what are some of
the new API is that are a little bit
showbiz Oh some of the new API is I
showbiz so one of my favorite actually
it's not really show biz but I really
like it so like there's the canvas
capture and media streaming API so like
one example I've got is recording from a
WebGL canvas and then downloading it
like we've never been able to do that on
the web before and like you could do
that upload it to YouTube really great
little API and then obviously things
like you know web via as well which is
gonna land soon so for folks who are
interested in learning more about that
stuff what's like one place or resource
where they could go to kind of dig into
that stuff so developers.google.com /
web is that that's our home right that's
where we try and tell developers you
know how to build for the web how to
build best probably following best
practice as well and then if you go to
slash updates on that as well then you
get the all the new things that are
landed on the platform as well so if you
want to know what's good what's good if
you also want to know what's kind of
coming on the platform as well the
update section as well for that site
right on us and politic you so much for
being with us today
we'll do it again we'll do that again oh
yeah it feels good thank you all so much
