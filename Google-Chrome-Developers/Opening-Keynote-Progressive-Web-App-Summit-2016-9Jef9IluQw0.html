this venue is incredible I'm so excited
to be here this morning with you to talk
about progressive Web Apps but I'm an
American and so I would be excited about
something I guess but I think it's
legitimate to be excited about this
because we've got two incredible days of
talks we've got code labs we've got
experts here not just chrome ease my
fellow engineers from chrome but also
folks from other browser vendors and
engineers who are making progressive web
apps in the world some of the world's
best experts who were engineers just
like you making this stuff are gonna be
here to share their expertise and what
they've learned over the past year it's
it's gonna be great
so at chrome dev summit last fall we
promised that we a chrome dev summit in
Europe and this summer and we're
breaking that promise because we thought
better of it we thought that instead of
a chrome dev summit we should have
something that was more inclusive the
web is bigger than Google it's bigger
than chrome it's bigger than any single
platform a browser vendor and so that's
why we've done the progressive web app
summit instead we renamed it and we're
incredibly glad that as Paul mentioned
our partners from Mozilla opera Samsung
Microsoft basically everybody is here
and it's great and as I mentioned I'm an
engineer on the chrome team I lead both
the engineering side of the team that's
building the progressive F stuff but
also the standard side and as someone
who's been on the chrome team for a long
time let me assure you that building and
distributing native software is a real
pain I've been on the chrome team since
before there were 1% of people in the
world using Chrome we had to fight
really hard to get chrome into people's
hands you have to convince someone to go
download it and then once they've
downloaded it they have to click on the
thing and run the installer and once
they've run the installer they have to
then choose to use your application the
same thing is true in the end of
application platforms of any time you
start to convince users to go find your
thing download it install it and then
choose to run it that's a massive
challenge for any company that's trying
to make forward progress although it
used to be a lot harder this is how when
I was a kid my family acquired most of
its software we used a Ford Taurus
station wagon like this to go to a place
like this
to buy disks like these that you had to
physically put into the computer before
you can do any of those other steps so
it used to be a much longer journey to
get software so when I went to college
it was a revolution that we were able to
use CDs from almost everything many
fewer discs to swap and when I got there
at one point I got for $5.00 from the
bookstore the college bookstore I got a
copy of microsoft mappoint now if you
hadn't used Matt point that's okay
not many people had but Matt point was a
bit of consumer GIS software you could
have a map on your computer that you
could pan and zoom around it only took
30 minutes to install but it was an
enormous ly transformative experience
you could just zoom around the entire
world if you needed to yes the data got
out-of-date but it transformed the way I
planned trips especially road trips kind
of an American thing but very very
timely for me in college and at the time
web-based experiences just couldn't
compete if you clicked on the link to go
to a bit to the left you then sort of
waited and then oh there it was even
though the network was pretty fast you
still sort of did this stuttering back
and forth it just couldn't compete it
was this big cliff between what you
could do a native of one you could do on
the web then Google Maps happened we've
actually got pan and zoom on the web it
worked on any computer not just the ones
I had spent time installing the software
on and the data was never out of date
maybe it wasn't entirely complete but it
kept continuously getting better and I
didn't have to go get another CD or
download a big patch it just was always
fresh so when the web is capable of
delivering a particular experience it
can compete our distribution model is
actually better links are the web's
superpower
so okay quick I can see everyone so a
quick rate raise your hand if you use
the web to get to maps on your desktop
or laptop computer yeah okay now keep
your hand that's almost everyone keep
your hand up if you use the web to get
to maps on your phone okay so so less
okay yeah okay ten percent sure that's
about what I thought so we don't really
use the web on mobile the way we used it
on
but remember that we started with native
apps on desktop - so what we needed to
break the logjam between native and the
web on desktop was some enabling
technology an AJAX was that enabling
technology it allowed us to move data in
as you panned and zoomed around the
experience we did the exact same thing
for email I don't know about you but I
moved almost all of my mail consumption
to a web browser on the desktop but I'm
using a native app on my phone so why
haven't we made the same transition on
mobile you know I think just to
reinforce how big the size of this this
cliff is today users are spending almost
90% of their time on native device on
mobile devices in native applications
why is that well one theory is that
maybe the reengagement features that
native apps have had keep users in those
experiences or draw them back into it
things like being on the homescreen or
notifications that can be persistently
in your notification tray but it's a
huge amount of time and it's hugely
concentrated if you haven't won the
lottery for native applications you're
probably not going to because users are
spending 80 percent of their time in the
top three apps that's 80 percent of that
87 percent this is a huge
winner-take-all dynamic which we didn't
necessarily see on the web if only
they'd of apps can be engaging and only
a few can make it on native why hasn't
the web disrupted this it often takes
more money to distribute a native app to
a user on native platforms then you'll
get back from that user like native app
developers are suffering why hasn't the
web disrupted this so think it's worth
this thinking back again you know a
decade or so to think about how we used
to get web experiences I don't know
about you but this is how I got webpages
you would dial one of these up and you'd
put you go to the bit of your house that
had the computer in it and you'd put the
computer into online mode and you'd
eventually you wind up yelling up or
down the stairs to your friends and
family like don't pick up the phone
you're gonna interrupt my download this
was tough but we knew we were in online
mode and the web grew up in an online
mode we could always assume that that
next navigation that next transition no
matter how slow it was the first time
was going to be the same speed than
signe but that's not how phones work
phones even when they look like they're
online they often aren't radios
transitioned wildly underneath us
the network isn't reliable we can't
assume that it is HX got us to good
enough because we were always connected
but what about now when we're not always
connected when I'm on a mobile phone and
I tap something from my homescreen I
never see one of these apps always load
maybe they tell me that they don't have
the data that I wanted or they can't get
the new stuff but so they'll show me the
old stuff but they'll never give me this
cute little offline dinosaur they have
this UX contract that they'll never fail
to load if they're on my home screen the
web hasn't been able to do this we've
also made the keyboard to end the tap
and swipe transition but I think that
one of the biggest issues here is that
we haven't really earned our place in
the home screen because web technology
can't be reliable and can't be reliably
fast it's reasonable for users not to
include us in their daily experience so
one way to think about this is there's
an axis here of capability now native
apps have the ability to start up
reliably they can be fast all the time
they can do offline they can handle push
messages they can synchronize in the
background they've got access to all the
sensors while the web is safer and more
respectful of your privacy but it
doesn't have some of those capabilities
it isn't on your home screen it isn't in
your notification tray but what if we
had another axis well ad reach the web
succeeds wildly here even in the
situation where users are spending only
13 to 14 percent of their time on their
phones on the web they're visiting more
than a hundred sites a month meanwhile
comScore says that the average user is
downloading zero apps a month in the US
this is the power of URLs we can
absolutely meet those one-off needs and
we do we are always in the users
experience even if they don't realize it
so what we want is a way to go from
incredible reach to be more engaging to
have those capabilities so what is that
thing I think we can meet those user
expectations today on the web and that's
what progressive Web Apps represent
they're finally the ability for us to
earn our place in the home screen and in
the notification tray first by providing
reliable experiences that are consist
we fast and we don't have to give up the
reach to get it that's the promise of
the web and that's why I'm excited about
progressive web apps so what are these
experiences look like so here's the
washingtonpost.com /pwa you can go do it
in your phone right now wopo calm /pwa
and it loads like in a tab like any
other site and if you go to it enough if
you engage with it you'll eventually get
this Add to Home screen prompting Chrome
for Android so if you tap on that link
the browser will confirm to you that
you've done it and if you go back to
your home screen you'll see that there's
now a home screen icon when you tap on
that icon it's beautifully fast and
it'll launch with a splash screen that
splash screen is a full-screen immersive
experience and the whole app runs that
way if you go into the task switcher
what you'll see is that it's first-class
there - there's no URL bar getting in
the way it's exactly like a native app
in that sense so what was missing to be
able to deliver this experience because
we finally earned it
well first we need reliability and
reliable performance and next we need to
be in the notification tray and lastly
once we're trustworthy and have reliable
performance we need to be able to have
enough metadata about the site to be
able to generate that add to homescreen
prompt to put it on the home screen ok
so this talks today and tomorrow
covering all all of the required
technologies to get to that point TLS
which is imperative an HTTP manifests
service workers push notifications
smooth UIs and much much more
and I'm excited that we've been able to
work with other browser vendors over the
past three years to deliver these
technologies to you they're already
shipping in chrome opera Firefox it's
amazing stuff and they're going to be an
edge soon so the web is bigger than any
vendor or a single platform it gives you
that incredible reach and we're bringing
this stuff to every browser so but I
just want to focus for a second on
reliable performance we all know the
faster is better and if we have to
traverse the network we can almost never
be fast specifically a mobile network
we're getting the radio initialize can
take two seconds the data from so acid
that you just saw really confirms that
correlation between speed and bounce
rate but we see that a three second
delay can bounce 40% of users it's
really tough out there if you're trying
to deliver great experiences on the
mobile web so what if we weren't
necessarily going to have our connection
eaten by the offline dinosaur what if if
a user goes to the site it could be
reliable
after that that's exactly what service
workers are they provide an in-browser
programmable Network proxy so that users
can always get to something on your site
the second third and fourth times they
visit if they are willing to reengage
with you they can always get to your
experience and you can use your own
cache to do it you can always boot up
without ever hitting the network you can
provide an experience from the local
data this is exactly what native apps do
and this is transformative for the way
we deliver reliably performant
experiences so what about that first
visit well the search team has been
thinking about this because there's a
epidemic of obesity on the web and they
came up with amp amp is a format that
uses custom elements HTML custom
elements web components to keep you from
doing most of the things that really
hurt the user experience and it delivers
incredibly fast initial loads they're
seeing median one less than one second
load times from the amp documents on
their CDN which is generally four times
faster than the same document hosted in
a different format and it's often ten
times less data that's pretty great so
one of those a way to go from that fast
first load using amp to that reliable
performance that immersive experience
with progressive web apps so here's an
example of the Washington Post today if
you go to Google News and you see that
amp carousel and you go to an article
you'll be reading it inside the CDN
hosted version so it's not on the
Washington Post servers but while you're
reading it the amp install serviceworker
element will go and install the
progressive web apps bootstraps
serviceworker from the Washington Post
so now if I click a link from this
article out to someplace at the
Washington Post instead of the offline
dinosaur I'll get a reliable service
handled by the serviceworker and it'll
load instantly this is pretty great so
this is also leading edge stuff and it's
been hard to do until recently dev tools
are evolving very fast and this is the
new application tab in Canary and chrome
dev which helps verify some of this
stuff but as good as this is wouldn't it
be great if there was a way to do this
at the command line or in your CI
that's what lighthouse is for lighthouse
is an exciting new tool that gives you a
Chrome extension if you want it that can
help verify that you've met all the
requirements to get that Add to Home
screen prompt and it's also available in
a command line form so you can run it as
part of your
a continuous integration so there's a
ton of new capabilities that are coming
to the web that unlock other sorts of
applications once we've earned that
right to be on the home screen there's
too many to talk about I'm incredibly
excited about webassembly in what WebGL
r2r gonna do this year it's four games
and what media capture and streams are
gonna do for social use cases but
there's two specific capabilities I want
to talk to you about that you'll hear
more about later today from Chris Wilson
that I think are going to really really
make it so that the web is a first-class
citizen the first is the web payments
API and the credentials API follows that
so web payments what's that
so web payments is a way for you to not
have to fill out forms with the worst
keyboards in the world when you want to
check out on the web it lets you do one
tap checkout using cash data that the
browser already has so here for instance
is a Shopify checkout flow I can tap the
checkout button and then I'll get a
pre-populated list without ever having
to fill that stuff in and if it looks
good I can tap it and then I'll be
getting a confirmation screen it all
works
I didn't have to enter any new data
that's pretty great in fact if Android
pay or some other system provided
payment instrument is available and the
site supports it this can go as simple
as a single tap or a confirmation I
think this as a standards-based way to
get this capability available for vasive
lee shipping this year is so exciting
similarly the credentials API is going
to also remove a bunch of typing and
tapping and autofill Corrections and all
that stuff that isn't great to do on
phones like native apps will be able to
do one tap sign-in if the site knows who
the user is it'll be able to request
using existing system credentials that
the user login and that can be a single
tap in fact if the users already been
there this can be automatically done
this is going to accelerate how we
deliver first-class experiences on the
web in addition to all the progressive
about technology that browsers are
already shipping now you might ask how
is that stuff doing and I'd say well but
I think I'm incredibly biased but don't
take my word for it to tell you more
about how it's actually going I'd like
to invite my colleague Tao trans and the
partnerships team to take a look at how
progressive web apps are performing in
the real world Thanks so as Alex
mentioned
I work in global product partnerships
for the Chrome and web platform team so
that means I get a chance to talk with
lots of different companies and sites
and to tell them about all the new web
capabilities today building progressive
web apps that are going to be reliable
fast and engaging experiences and we
often spend a lot of time with partners
thinking about helping them think
through how do you develop a mobile
first strategy for the web so Alex
really walked through a ton of kind of
new capabilities that are available
today and you'll hear a lot more over
the next couple of days so the whole
point of coming to these conferences is
that we want you to get excited and
motivated to really want to build new
things to start digging into these api's
tinkering with with all this new stuff
and so it's kind of like a kid kind of
playing around with a new toy and so
this is my three-year-old the first time
we introduced play-doh to him and he
thought the possibilities were endless
in terms of all the things that he could
make so I had to choose between a kitten
or my son so I decided to go with my son
so you know he's like being extremely
creative he even was trying to convince
me that green play-doh pizza was going
to be so good and so this is the type of
energy and creativity that we want you
to bring back to your team since your
company but I also realized is that the
reality is that when you get back to
your companies you're probably gonna
have to pitch and talk about how you
want to start a web project I know many
of you have probably already started
looking at these technologies and you
may be getting questions from different
people inside your org like how much
time is this gonna take how many
resources it's gonna take what's the ROI
you know all those like annoying
business and resource type questions and
I hear a lot from our partners and so
what I want to do is actually give you a
framework for how you can think about
you know building the case for investing
in the web and so oftentimes I think the
dreaded question that every developer
you know gets is okay build me a
business case for why you want to do
this project and as a developer that's
kind of code for actually don't try
anything new so you start feeling like
this so for those
you have kids I think this is a very
familiar this one he's in a tantrum mode
when I asked when I asked him to do
something he doesn't want to do it but
in all seriousness we want to help you
build a case for the web and the goal is
to walk away from the next couple of
days where you can actually talk about
new capabilities and make the case for
why it's critical to invest in the web
platform so I thought about all the
learnings I've gotten and all the
feedback I've gotten from you know all
the different partners across the world
and when people say hey I have to
prioritize this I need to figure out how
this fits into my roadmap it basically
boils down to two critical questions why
is this important and how do we get
started
and a lot of times partners just want to
have an understanding of you know what
are some numbers that you can share and
what are different approaches so that
this feels accessible and feels like I
can scope this for my team and so to
talk about what's important or why is
this going to be important I'll just
give kind of a brief overview of some
key metrics that folks on the business
side often like to think about reach
acquisition and conversion so the first
one is reached and here we'll just take
a look at the overall mobile web market
and see if it's growing Alex talked
about how you know people are spending
so much time in in apps and so we want
to take a look it's just to see what the
mobile web audience looks like so we'll
take a look at some of the Chrome
numbers that we announced last month so
chrome announced that we at now have a
billion monthly active users on mobile
alone this is incredible for a couple of
reasons one for those of you who may not
know Chrome on on mobile was only came
out about four years ago and this time
last year this number was only 400
million monthly actives
and so what you're seeing is that
there's tremendous rapid growth on the
mobile web and then we look at reach
drilling down to more site level data
comscore data taking a look at the top
thousand apps and web sites and
comparing monthly traffic for apps
native apps versus the web and not
surprising it's two and a half times
that the reach of the mobile apps two
and a half times that of apps you can
probably see it in your own numbers so
it's worth kind of digging in to
understand what your overall mobile web
mobile traffic is and then break it down
between
your web and app and anecdotally I've
heard partners say somewhere between 50
to as high as 90% of their mobile
traffic actually is on the mobile web so
now it's just been another minute on
acquisition so you have this incredible
reach and you still need to bring users
to your site and this often sits with
the marketing team or your growth teams
but when you're trying to make a case
for investing in the web you should
understand all the different forces at
play here and so with acquisition
oftentimes you're probably paying to get
users to your site so it was really cool
when we saw that Sileo which is a
platform for buying and selling goods
it's a start-up actually publishes that
about user acquisition costs they
started building a progressive web app
and then saw that the engagement numbers
between progressive web apps and their
native app was comparable and so then he
the CEO start digging into well if it's
comparable from an experience standpoint
how much is it costing me to get a user
into my native app versus the mobile
website it turns out it was 10 times
cheaper to get a user onto their mobile
web experience so for those of you who
are familiar with acquisition costs this
is probably no surprise but it was
really great to see someone dig into the
numbers and then share it publicly so
the next piece after conversion I mean
after acquisition is are my users
converting so it's awesome I've reached
there coming in and what am I'm actually
getting them to frequent my site more or
conversion could also be defined as
completing a transaction when the money
really comes in so Aliexpress launched a
progressive web app last month during
i/o and it was incredible to see within
days of them rolling out their
progressive web app experience they saw
huge increases in engagement numbers two
times more pageviews 74 percent increase
in overall time spent across all
browsers and what was telling was you
know we often get the question about
Safari on iOS and is this going to be a
good experience across the board
especially if they don't yet support
progressive web app features so we
actually asked Aliexpress to dig into
their conversion numbers which they saw
increase across the board but to segment
it for
iOS specifically or safari specifically
and they also saw an 82% more
conversions on iOS and it just shows
that Aliexpress already had a good
mobile experience but they continue to
invest in it to make it more engaging
and fast and immersive and their iOS
users also benefit so it's just good
all-around
to actually invest in your mobile web
experience and to make sure that you
know you actually deliver experience to
users on all platforms and so this
really cemented I love this quote that
from the head of mobile at Aliexpress
what she really just talks about you
know building you know investing in the
web experience across all browsers and
not only did they see huge benefits on
browsers that support progressive web
app features they saw a bump across the
board and it's just a sign of a really
great investment and they'll know it'll
pay off
once other browsers continue to evolve
and ship these api's and so this is a
model that I thought was really great I
can't take credit for it my colleague
put this together so when you think
about all your potential reach bringing
people in hopefully at lower acquisition
costs we're likely at lower acquisition
costs for the web and in your improving
conversion start to liquid and look at
take a look at these numbers and they
add up to pretty good mass profitable
math I assume and so this is just a
thing a way to for you to think about
why it's so important and why it's great
to invest on on the web and so then the
next question and this is one of the
tougher questions to try to handle is
how do we get started so a lot of people
say to us you know these tech
technologies seem really intimidating
especially as I'm talking to my
management team so how do I can so do I
have to convince my team to do a
complete overhaul and the short answer
is no Alex painted a picture of what's
possible you know giving you a vision of
where we want the entire mobile web to
go with these amazing experiences but we
also recognize that it's complicated to
bring in these new technologies
especially at larger companies where you
have sites with legacy code and
architecture and so we want you to think
about this as an ongoing journey to
invest and build on the web and so the
first
stuff is HTTP which Alex already alluded
to and I colleague Emily Schechter will
talk about kind of myth-busting through
HTTP later today but it's in it's a
critical because all these new features
will only be available over HTTPS so if
it's not already on your roadmap it
should be so now I want to walk you
through partner examples and how they've
actually approached building and
experimenting with all these new web
technologies so the first one is
starting from the ground up
so this is you know when you're able to
just rethink or reimagine what your
mobile web experience should be I know
very few sites actually get the
opportunity to do this but when you do
you really are able to unlock so many of
the capabilities of serviceworker and
all these amazing features and so I want
to talk about conga conga is actually
one of the largest e-commerce players in
Nigeria and they decided to do a rethink
of their mobile web experience and just
build and basically build a progressive
web app that was going to be very
comparable to their native experience
and actually the director of engineering
Andrew is going to lead a session
talking about how conga is approaching
their progressive web apps building
tomorrow but what was really great to
hear yesterday was that this was a
cross-platform effort even though they
were building a progressive web app you
know their iOS and Android teams really
collaborated to make sure it really
truly was an app like experience on the
web and so the conga experience you know
not surprisingly is focused on being
fast and performant and reliable and the
most critical thing for their users is
making sure it doesn't use a lot of data
and so in early testing they saw that
for initial load it actually used it
compared to their native app experience
it used 92 percent less data for their
progressive web app and then that
critical moment of converting the user
to actually completing a transaction
they saw that actually use 82 percent
less data as compared to their native
app so again seeing terrific stats when
you're able to kind of invest end-to-end
and then start from the ground up but we
also know me as I mentioned it's really
hard to catch a company at a moment when
they're actually going to rebuild
something
we're gonna change you know
architectures or frameworks and so I
want to offer why don't you build a
simple version and a couple of examples
of how that's being done so airberlin
did this demo at i/o which i thought was
terrific they knew they couldn't change
the entire site experience and so they
thought about well is there a segment of
my site that I can change or convert
into progressive web app and here they
looked at the post booking experience so
imagine like so the pain point I think
that we all recognize is that when
you're at the airport you're frenzied
you want to just easily be able to
access your boarding pass you're at
inner area information maybe your
destination information but the
connectivity is pretty unreliable and so
they wanted to have this customer
journey details available offline and so
they used they leveraged serviceworker
caching to enable this and what they saw
was that the initial loading time was
less than a second because they've done
a ton of optimizations
but even faster with servers
serviceworker for subsequent loads and
so even if you're offline or you land
and you're in another country where you
don't have Wi-Fi access all your
destination and a ternary details are
available on your device so Alex talked
a lot about the Washington Post earlier
and you know we got a lot of questions
about how do they you know why do they
build this you know when are they going
to transition into a bigger or a more
production nice site and so the posts
you know what they wanted to do was they
wanted to do a public live demo to show
what's possible so they took their top
stories news feeds and said you know
let's go ahead and just build this
really fast immersive experience and
they wanted to be able to show it off
publicly but also internally as you know
for folks who are in publishing
newsrooms different people in
advertising their executives and what
they saw was that you know everyone is
obsessed with speed at the post and in
their progressive web app they saw
article page loads times inside the
progressive web app hit 80 milliseconds
so now that's the bar that's the use
experience they want to deliver and I'm
happy to say they're actively exploring
a roadmap of how they're going to evolve
this to that it's going to be available
to a broader set of their mobile web
audience but even sometimes building a
simple version or getting us
or a section of your site to a
progressive web app could also be hard
and so we've seen people just focus on a
feature pick an API or a feature that
you believe will have high impacts for
both users and your business so the
weather company folks we yo familiar
with weather calm you know they've been
looking at progressive web apps for a
while and all these technologies and
what they wanted but they were asked to
prioritize what's the one feature that's
really going to be great you know ROI
and so they decided to go after web push
notifications and what's really great is
that they went big this one feature they
launched about a month and a half ago
and they actually launched in 30
languages globally with web push
notifications and what you see here is
actually the the how you can decide
which type of notifications you want
local national or government issued
alerts by the way these are all
notifications that are available in
their app so they basically made it
parody with the web or make the web on
par with what app notifications were and
then booking calm as you know a major
travel player where you know they had
been looking at all these technologies
and they ideally I guess we could try to
build they progressed a full progressive
web app but that doesn't work for their
business they they're extremely
data-driven they test everything and so
they needed to work in small steps so
that they're able to tackle different
issues learn things quickly test and
optimize and so Jesse Yang who is quoted
up here is going to actually lead a
session tomorrow talking about bookings
approach on their journey to building a
progressive web app and so I really want
to it'll emphasize that everyone will
take their own path whether it's
building from the ground up doing a
simple simplified version or using a
single feature there's no
one-size-fits-all and I want to make
sure that you do the path that's right
for you and so that it feels accessible
so these are just a sample partners
globally who have started shipping or
actively looking at these progressive
web app technologies and again no one
partner
has done the same approach they've again
modified it and really thought about
what's important for their users in
their business as they're thinking about
investing in the web and to help you
with this journey of building
progressive web apps we're pleased to
announce that Udacity now has a nano
degree program and it's an extension of
the senior web developer and developer
nano degree where it's a short series of
classes and projects and then you'll
complete when you complete the course
you'll be able to architect and build
app like experiences on the web so in
closing I guess I did have to include a
cat in here but in the corner so it's
amazing to see so many people here I was
just commenting to the chrome team
backstage that this time last year we
were just talking about serviceworker
and the web push api and progressive web
app as a term was still being socialized
and so it's incredible that in standing
here today about a year later where
we're have a dev summit dedicated to
progressive web apps so we've got an
exciting lineup as Alex walked through
so hopefully you'll stay for all the
different sessions and at the end of it
we want you to leave the progressive web
app dev summit really inspired and
confident about building the case for
the web and more importantly we want you
to go build something great thank you
