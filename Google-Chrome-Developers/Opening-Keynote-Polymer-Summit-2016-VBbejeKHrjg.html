Matt said welcome everybody to the
polymer summit 2016 in London my name is
Taylor Savage I'm the product manager of
the Palmer project we're at a very
unique moment right now in the arc of
polymer and the arc of web components
and really we're in a unique moment for
the arc of the capabilities of the web
platform overall we're witnessing right
now like right at this event right now
the confluence of three factors all
coming together the first is the
acceleration of the importance of the
impact and of the usage of the mobile
web the second is the cross browser
launch of web components and then the
third is we're seeing a really major new
milestone for the polymer project
representing what I think is a really
exciting new chapter so I'll cover all
of these three different moments and
what it means what each of these mean
for all of us as web developers so let's
start with mobile now the acceleration
of mobile has been ongoing we've been
seeing it for a few years now but
suddenly we've hit this this moment
where native apps seem to be sorting to
hit a saturation point and with new
capabilities of the mobile web platform
with things like service worker with the
ability to build progressive web apps
developers and companies are starting to
turn back to the mobile web as a really
capable immersive platform and so for
web developers this represents an
exciting opportunity but also a
challenge what we're seeing is the
attack of the phones so the mobile web
is incredibly exciting
nearly every device out there has a
browser everything from the phones and
all of our pockets to our refrigerators
and we've the ability as developers for
free without asking anyone's permission
to build an application and put it up on
the away on the web and let any user
anywhere in the world access it with
just a URL but mobile development also
makes our lives as web developers really
really challenging we're expected to
build
immersive applications that run at 60
frames per second that load immediately
that a response into the touch that work
across a wide array of different screen
sizes from the watch face to a 60 inch
TV screen and chances are we've got to
deliver that application across a mobile
network a slow flaky network or
sometimes with no network at all and on
top of that we've got to deliver this
application over the slow flaky Network
to devices that are oftentimes really
slow really underpowered
sometimes overheated as you'll hear
about more at this summit and on top of
that the code bases that we're starting
from often just look something like this
like giant mounds of really really gross
spaghetti code really really gross
spaghetti code
most likely they were built originally
for desktop and you're inheriting this
codebase from someone and maybe it was
created with a once-popular framework
that's now past its prime and there's a
chance that you now have to kind of read
jigger this to make it somehow work on
these tiny mobile devices with all these
different constraints mobile web
development is hard it's time-consuming
it's expensive it's hard to know where
to start
and for the longest time the web
platform itself didn't really help us
developers out and so we've built layers
upon layers of tooling of abstractions
to make our lives as developers easier
but now with these especially
challenging mobile constraints slow
devices flaky networks these tools that
we've relied on for so long can start to
sometimes get in our way
or they can lead us down a path
naturally down a path that will
ultimately lead to worse outcomes for
our users on these mobile devices so we
have a thesis on the polymer project
around how to build powerful mobile web
applications with minimal overhead which
is to use the platform the web platform
is our ally now as web developers and as
part of the Chrome web platform team at
Google our mission on the polymer
project is to advance this underlying
web platform to make it easier for
developers to build better apps and to
ultimately make all of our users lives
just a little bit better and so also on
the polar project our mission is not
only
to advance the platform but to provide
developers with the tools that they need
to smooth over some of the rough edges
of the platform so you can still build
powerful applications as close to the
metal as possible so I want to be really
really clear what we mean by use the
platform use the platform does not mean
abandoning the tools and frameworks that
you know and love it does not mean
ignoring the value that JavaScript
frameworks provide it doesn't mean don't
read any JavaScript Java trip is part of
the platform that's part of using the
platform what use the platform means is
to challenge the assumptions of what you
need in order to build scalable on the
web it's a call to take advantage of
what's already there sitting in our
users pockets in the form of browsers it
means let the browser do the hard work
it means be selective with abstraction
every abstraction comes with a cost
every abstraction means extra code that
your users need to download and run in
order to ultimately run and interact
with your application so when you're
building on the web and we're using
abstraction go in with eyes wide open
know where that abstraction is going to
provide a ceiling know where it's gonna
help you know where it's going to be a
cost for you and your users and finally
use the platform means that rather than
doing everything possible to work around
the web platform to pretend like it
doesn't even exist be aware of where the
modern web platform can help you do more
with less which brings me to our second
major factor that's coming together
right now as we speak
a set of new web platform features that
really truly let you do so much more
with so much less which are web
components so web components are the
primary feature that we've been focused
on in the polymer project for a number
of years now they're a set a new web
platform standards to let you natively
build reusable components on the web now
web components as a spec started back in
2012 and frankly back then we were a
little bit overconfident we were over
optimistic with how quickly web
components would get broadly adopted and
broadly supported across browsers we
were over optimistic and so we went back
to work along with all other major
browser vendors
through long life cycles of iterations
many many false starts many many face to
faces across all the different browser
vendors and finally basically as of
today basically as of right now we can
say that we've made it that web
components are here with web components
v1 our new hope so custom elements and
shadow Dom specifically are two of the
critical specs that fall under the
umbrella of web components and born out
of a multi-year cross browser
collaboration we've ended up with the v1
versions of these specs that the
previous version that had shipped in
chrome rv0 and now we've landed a
slightly different updated version that
is v1 and as of basically today as of
just a few weeks ago we can say for the
first time ever that web components are
shipping in multiple different rendering
engines with the launch of Safari 10
just a few weeks ago so previously web
component support was buried and it was
scattered template was supported across
the board but other critical features
like shadow Dom like custom elements
were either behind a flag or unsupported
but now we have v1 all major browser
vendors have rallied around these new
specs as I said Safari has already
shipped shadow dom v1 in Safari 10 and
they are actively implementing custom
elements you can see them in Safari tech
preview right now and both custom
elements in shadow Dom v1 are on the
high priority roadmap for edge HTML
imports are still on hold as we're
working out how they're gonna interact
with es6 modules as those come together
but we're confident on the Palmer
project that we'll end up in a really
good place with a spec driven way to
load HTML with HTML so at IO IO this
year I said that cross browser web
component support was not a matter of if
but a matter of when and when is right
now web components are here whoo
so we've got the acceleration of the
mobile web leading to the need to use
the platform to take more advantage of
what the platform provides us as
developers we've got now a powerful new
platform primitive and web components
that allow us to ship less code now
running cross browser which brings me to
the third confluence which is polymer so
the polymer library has existed in some
form or another for well over three
years now in 2014 we released polymer
0.5 which was the Developer Preview
version of polymer in 2015 we released
the production ready version of polymer
polymer 1 not oh and now it's 2016
so Palmer 100 has been out for a little
over a year and I think because polymer
started out initially in as an
experiment it was kind of in this
experimental phase with web components
since the very early days we get the
question a ton is polymer ready for
production is anyone actually using
polymer in production or any big
companies using polymer and so I wanted
to mention today just a handful of the
companies that are using polymer in
production right now polymer is used by
Comcast which is the largest media
company in the world
it's used by USA Today which is the
flagship grant brand of the largest
newspaper publisher in the u.s. Gannett
seized by ing the largest online bank in
Europe used by net aport a the largest
fashion luxury fashion ecommerce company
by BBVA which is one of the largest
banks in Spain and Latin America by
coca-cola the largest beverage company
in the world by Electronic Arts what a
largest game publishers in the world by
predicts which is the stock where pellet
form for the industrial Internet of
Things from General Electric which is
the largest digital industrial company
in the world and of course polymers used
here at Google on some of our biggest
user facing products it's used in Chrome
with over a billion users it's used on
play music it's used in YouTube gaming
and I'm extremely excited to be able to
announce for the first time ever that
polymer is used in YouTube YouTube one
of Google's biggest products with over a
billion users as well is now building
their next generation of mobile and
desktop sites all on-top of polymer
so polymer is becoming one of if not the
most important front-end web development
dependency here at Google he's done well
over 500 projects with over 6,000
individual components checked into the
Google Code repository so these are just
a handful of the companies who are going
all-in on standards-based web
development and many many more massive
companies and many many more massive
projects inside of Google are continuing
to adopt polymer every single day so
there's a pattern that's starting to
emerge because polymer is
standards-based it's enterprise-grade
it's impossible to get hundreds of
different engineering teams to all
standardize on the same technology heck
it is impossible to find two web
developers anywhere in the world who use
the exact same toolset except that
there's one thing that every web
developer has in common which is we're
web developers we're building on the web
and so when you're building to web
standard primitives when you're building
close to the platform
standardization becomes trivial it
becomes the default and so this will be
a common theme across the summit which
that the promise of web components by
and large is here and it can lead to
great standardization across companies
across organizations across ecosystems
so there's still plenty of more to do
with web components shipping across
browsers we have an opportunity to make
a big leap forward with the polymer
project so I'm extremely excited today
to announce the preview release of the
next major version of polymer polymer to
do
so polymer tornado will be closer to the
platform than ever and there are a few
main features that we focused on to
really make polymer to not upgrade the
first and the most important feature of
polymer to Daddo is web component v1
support
so polymer tornado is designed to take
advantage of the new custom element and
shadow Dom v1 API s that are shipping
cross browser and on top of that it
embraces es6 classes allowing you to
write a custom element using the
standard es6 class syntax so I'll show
you what that looks like when you're
using the standard es6 class syntax in
plumber to eddo they'll create an
element something like this you'll have
that standard es6 class my element
extends this polymer element base class
you'll provide a config which will allow
you to set up the properties and the
observers that you know and love from
polymer you'll use the standard platform
provided es6 and custom element
callbacks with the constructor and the
connected callback which is v1 custom
elements API and then you'll register
your element using that v1 custom
elements dot define call to actually
register your element so this truly
realizes the polymer vision which is to
be as close to the platform as possible
with just a little bit of minimal
sugaring on top and because to dot o is
so close to the platform it's actually
fairly straightforward to take advantage
of many other platform tools like
typescript so this is what a polymer
todo element definition would look like
using typescript decorators so on top of
just the really nice looking syntax
you'll also get type checking within and
then between elements polymer to do also
eliminates some of the polymer specific
abstractions that leak through in
polymer one namely the polymer DOM and
structured data manipulation api's so
that a web component built on polymer
todo will be indistinguishable from a
vanilla custom element so I'll give an
example of what I mean and polymer 100
you might write some script that looks
something like this you'll have a custom
element you built with polymer in your
page and if you wanted to add a child to
that
you need to make this polymer Tom call
and this was so that the polymer shady
dumb system could know about the
distribution of this component and make
sure that the Dom tree is still correct
and reflected as it would be in native
shadow Dom this is a performance
enhancement to take it to be able to run
polymer on browsers that didn't yet
support native shadow I'm especially
mobile browsers but with polymer to
dotto because we can rely on native
shadow Dom in more places particularly
on all major mobile browsers we can do a
little extra work so you no longer have
to use this Palmer Dom workaround so to
do the exact same thing to add a child
you just make the standard Dom API call
that you would expect with any other
element so you don't have to know how
the sound that was implemented under the
hood it's just any other HTML element
and of course we don't want to use well
you want to leave polymer 1.0 users
these many big large polymer 100 users
in the dust
so Palmer to doto comes with a near
seamless backwards compatibility layer
making it dead simple to upgrade an
element from polymer 1 dead oh the to
data and critically polymer tirado also
lets you build elements in what we call
hybrid mode and what hyper boat means is
that the very same element will work
under polymer 1.0 or polymer 2 data with
a compatibility layer and this allows
you to incrementally upgrade your
project one component at a time so I'll
show you what that would look like in a
typical 102 to dotto transition you
would look something like this you'd
have your entire application and all the
components all built on one dodo and
stop the presses suddenly we have to go
back to the drawing board rebuild every
single element so that works in to a toe
and weeks or maybe months or maybe even
years later we finally finished this
transition and we can start again to dot
afresh and this is terrible this is a
bummer especially if you have hundreds
or thousands of components to upgrade so
with hybrid mode you can now
incrementally upgrade your project in
place
so again hybrid bone means that the very
same element definition
run using polymer 100 or polymer 2 data
so an upgrade with hybrid mode might
look something like this one element at
a time
you incremental e upgrade into hybrid
mode as this application is still
running in production you can keep
adding features you can keep adding new
components in hybrid mode as you go and
once all of the components are in this
hybrid mode you can switch out polymer
under the hood run it on top at 2.0 and
then again incremental e up your upgrade
components to take advantage of 2.0
specific features again as the
application is still in production so
this rocks this is much easier it means
your application can stay live in
production as you upgrade it in place
also this hybrid mode is totally
optional if you want to start fresh
using that great to Dino class syntax
you absolutely can do that don't have to
bring along any of the hybrid mode
support this is largely for very large
companies very large projects with lots
of components to upgrade so taking a
step back and looking at the overall arc
of the polymer library 0.5 is an
experiment to see if the web component
standards could create a compelling
developer experience 100 was to bring
this developer experience to production
it was faster it was lighter it was more
resilient it was rebuilt from the ground
up it was something that you could use
in a real live application as many many
large companies and projects are despite
web components not being broadly
supported yet and with 200 we can fully
realize the full value of web components
elements built with 2.0 our web native
with minimal overhead no leaky
abstractions based on cross browser
standards a polymer Toronto is a truly
encapsulated web component now we've
always said that the goal of polymer is
to slowly melt away that polymer as a as
a library should get smaller and smaller
as the as the browser itself reaches up
and supports a lot of these features and
with to dyno we get even further along
this path so if you're using that
polymer element syntax to build your es6
style web components it's just 12
kilobytes of overhead
so let's talk about elements so in
addition to the polymer library the
polymer team builds and maintains a
hundreds of different web components
built with polymer in multiple
collections of elements and as part of
this to Durell release we'll be
upgrading these polymer elements to this
2.0 hybrid mode meaning that they'll
work under either one auto or to doto so
if you use them in a large project you
can do that incremental upgrade that I
described earlier in addition to the
elements and the library the polymer
project also builds a large number of
different tools for building and
deploying elements and web applications
and progressive web applications and we
have a huge amount of really exciting
news for the tools but I don't want to
spoil this press so make sure that you
catch tomorrow morning's keynote for the
whole world of polymer tools and what
we've been working on there so there's
one more thing I'm also really excited
about as we're turning to this new
chapter of web components a new version
of polymer we're also seeing a large
number of new web component libraries
coming out things like sketches like x
tag like bosonic and many more and the
great thing about web components is that
they're standards-based so no matter how
you build your web component anyone
should be able to use it and now we
build a lot of elements on the polymer
project and we show them off currently
in the polymer element catalog but those
should just be a tiny drop in the bucket
in terms of the overall web component
ecosystem and we want all web component
authors to have that same opportunity to
share their work and get a large
audience for their work regardless of
who built the element regardless of what
library it uses under the hood or
whether it uses a library at all whether
it's just vanilla custom element so the
polymer team in the Google office in
Sydney has been working with the broader
web component community on a new place
to share web components with a beta
release of a new web components catalog
on web components org so this is full of
some killer features to help you
showcase elements that you build
it shows element generated element
documentation from notes that you have
from comments that you have in your
element code along with live inline
editable demos that you can get a sense
of what an element does right away and
start playing with it right there on the
element page it also supports curated
collections of elements for sets of
elements that go together so anyone can
publish a collection of elements we've
added for example all the paper elements
and the iron elements as example
collections to collect those elements
it's still a work in progress but you
can start publishing elements on this
catalogue today
and we would love to get your feedback
on the project and we'd love to get your
your contributions to the catalog
repository itself so with the polymer
project we plan to move all of our
elements onto this catalog once that's
ready to ship and again the polymer team
has built hundreds of components but
these should just be a tiny drop in the
bucket as to the overall set of web
components available so I can't say this
enough we are at an incredibly exciting
time the importance of the mobile web is
continuing to accelerate but we as
developers are increasingly armed with
the tools that we need to tackle this
challenge now this summits going to be
packed
it's two full days of talks by polymer
team members by Googlers by engineers
from major companies about how they're
using polymer and web components in
production it's going to be a whirlwind
of information but to help get the most
out of the summit I encourage you to
look for a few dominant themes that will
thread throughout all of these talks
the first is development efficiency so
we have a lot of tools at our disposal
as engineers to improve our efficiency
but at this summit I want you to look in
particular at how standards can make you
more efficient as an engineer how
standards can make an entire team more
efficient how they can make an entire
company more efficient how they can make
the entire ecosystem more efficient the
second theme to look for is performance
new standards give us new dimensions
along which we can look to it
greater performance in our applications
and sometimes old techniques that we've
that are tried-and-true that we've been
relying on for years can apply in these
this new world but sometimes new
technologies require totally new
approaches particularly in terms of
performance and so the key to building a
blazing fast web application on the
modern web today is to find that right
balance between old techniques and new
techniques that really take advantage of
these new standards and most of all look
for opportunity major shifts in
technology at any level introduced huge
new opportunities to make an impact and
web components are a major shift and how
the web platform works an opportunity it
introduces a new opportunity to make an
impact at your company it may introduce
as a new opportunity to make an impact
at the overall web developer ecosystem
because we are just at the very
beginning of the web component
revolution and everyone here is out on
the vanguard this is a uniquely
privileged position to be in
right as cross-browser web components
are starting to launch the tools are
here web components v1 is shipping cross
browser you can now build encapsulated
components close to the metal with
minimal overhead letting you reach the
next billion users those on slow devices
those on slow networks Palmer to toe is
right around the corner it's a big step
forward based on these new web component
standards what gets built next is up to
you we're excited to see not only the
next generation of web apps get built
but to see the next generation of
components themselves to see the next
generation of tools and of services and
of WYSIWYG editors and of CMS systems
that get built to take advantage of web
components and these new standards and
if all of us here are successful the
polymer project will just be one tiny
speck in a massive thriving ecosystem of
web components and for that I can't wait
enjoy the summit thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
