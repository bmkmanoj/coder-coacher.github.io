this is a kind of TL DW last week I did
a live stream with Surma where we made
some swipeable cards now you probably
recognize five mobile cars from things
like Google now where you just kind of
take a card and you dismiss it you know
you see what I've got on screen this is
what we ended up making there you go you
see just miss it and all that kind of
good stuff
now the idea is if you've not got an
hour to watch that live stream back
although if you can I would recommend it
and you can find the link to that below
if you can't that's exactly what this is
for I want to step through the things
that we learnt the things that we did
and just so you can get an insight into
why she went into it so before we
actually get started what I want to do
is I want to step over to a theory
corner oh yeah theory love theory and
what we can do in theory corner is
discuss what we need to do join me
welcome to Theory corner you can tell us
Theory corner because there's some
theory in a corner now this is what we
have we've got the cards in terms of
card because it says card the cards have
will change transform on it the idea I
have here is that we want each card to
be transformed around the screen and so
we want to give each card its own layer
the compositor then can move those
around with the help of the GPU so long
as we stick to transform opacity and we
set will change we should be good so we
move the card as you touch and swipe but
as you get across to this side we have
this marker like no point three five now
I picked that at random you could pick a
different number nor point three five if
you go past that point we basically said
well this card is being dismissed so we
slide it off to the side the other thing
that we're going to do is we're going to
change the opacity so the further you go
across to lower the opacity in both
directions that works there okay so
we're gonna put each card on its own
layer and shift it side to side and fade
it out let's go back to reality what
we're gonna do here is we're going to
step into the code so you can actually
see bit by bit what we actually did
here's the cards and what we do first of
all is we basically create an array from
the cards that we've got in the document
so we'd have to have some kind of code
that adds or removes those cards later
on but don't worry about
we'll just get on with what we've got
here the next thing to notice is that
I've got these named functions on start
on move on end and update now the first
three are our input events and I choose
to do it this way what I do is I take a
copy of it by calling dot bind on this
and that takes it from the prototype
into the actual instance but it does
another thing for me as well it means
that it's bound to the instance so that
in those functions when I say this dot
whatever is actually applying to the
instance and not to the targets event no
wait the events target ah one of those
two so it also does something else for
me it means that I can do add event
listener and remove event listener and I
can call it by name I can say like this
dot on start for example you can see
that down here in the add event listener
so I do
I don't listener for touchstart
touchmove touchend Mouse down mouse move
and mouse up all of them and I can just
basically say on start on move on end
and so on and if I wanted to do the
remove event listeners I could do that
and that would just work out fine for me
so we've got our event listeners and we
have a bunch of variables here that are
just sort of housekeeping things that we
need to keep a track on the other thing
I do is I start to requestanimationframe
where I busily sort of kind of do an
update now if you're doing this in
production I would suggest you don't do
it quite like this
I would start the requestanimationframe
when the user starts interacting and
then when the animations finished I'd
stop doing the requestanimationframe
loop but for the case of this just to
keep things simple I just start it right
to the start and I do a kind of busy
loop through so what we actually do in
the on star on movement on end event
listeners Wow
saying event listeners over and over and
over and over and over again that's not
confusing for me no what are we doing
those well first in the on start the
main thing is this we basically take a
marker for the start position of the
interaction where does the user put
their finger down on the screen and then
we get that with page X the other thing
we do is we take a copy of that for the
current position because as we move our
finger we're going to update the current
position so we know where we started and
where we currently are and the
difference is how far we want to
transform the card the other things that
we do in this is we set the dragging
card to say true but as we discussed in
theory corner we set will change
to transform now we can check that that
actually works by going back to the code
bringing up dev tools and in the
rendering settings we're going to show
layer borders anything that's got its
own layer is gonna go orange around its
border you ready so when I click you can
see that we immediately the card gets
its own layer which is really cool that
means that we can transform and move it
around cheaply like we discussed over
there in the theory corner here's what
we've got in the on move it's fairly
straightforward all we do is we take the
current position of the input and we
basically said that's the current X now
inside the update what we can do is we
can say if they're dragging the card the
screen X which is basically the position
of the card on the screen is the current
minus the start that's basically how far
they've moved and we can apply the
transform to account for that now when
the user stops interacting we actually
have to make a decision if you remember
over in theory corner we said if the
user has passed that not 0.35 marker so
it's sort of a zero to one range one
being the full distance of the car zero
being not at all if they go past the
0.35 which is what I've chosen but you
could choose a different number what we
want to say is they are dismissing the
card and we do this by setting a target
X which we use later on in the update
and here we do screen X plus equals the
target minus the current screen x over 4
what this is going to do is it's going
to ease the card to that final position
which will either be the center or it'll
be off to the side depending on whether
we've decided that they've gone past the
point of dismissal or not then there's
some a little bit of tidy up that we do
here we basically normalize the drag
distance and we use that to set the
opacity so that the further across you
get the morph ad the card is so far so
good so the last little bit is what we
do when you dismiss the card because
what we want to do is we want to slide
all the other cards into place and we do
that with this animate other cards into
position function let me show you what
it looks like without that borders okay
here's what it looks like without that
you see all the other cards just snap
into place which he could do but doesn't
look quite so nice so what we need to do
is we need to transform them down
quickly to where they moved from which
will be the height of the card plus the
margin and you see that here so we take
every card that's after the current one
which is this and we basically say
translate yourself the height of a card
plus 20 pixels which is the margin and
again this is hard-coded so you'd
probably make this more dynamic in
production and then we basically go from
that to no transform at all and we use
an easing of this cubic Bezier and a
duration of 150 milliseconds and all we
need to do is just say card animate with
those settings and then when you've
finished we say the animation is
complete at which point we can just
reset the target and call it a day
and the animation is done so without
switched on you can see we get a nice
smooth animation so the only other thing
to notice is when I'm dismissing the
cards you can see that the other ones
get their own layer temporarily this is
because we're using element dot animate
and we're using a transform and that
means that those get temporarily
promoted to their own layer
cool that means that it's also doing the
same thing that we had over in theory
corner we're getting its own layer which
means it happens nice and performant Lee
and then when it's finished the browser
automatically demote them back and we're
all good so you have it that's swipeable
cards if you've got time make sure you
watch the live stream
there's loads in there there's finding
and fixing bugs there's just chatting
about the general approach all sorts of
goodies in there hopefully you've
enjoyed this little TL DW don't forget
to subscribe to the channel and I will
catch you on the flipside
