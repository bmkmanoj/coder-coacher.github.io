look at when it comes to web
accessibility are no I can only think of
two like only think of audio and then
visual so there's visual hearing
mobility and cognitions okay so what are
the last two so mobility is where like
someone may not be able to use a mouse
or they may need to use a keyboard to
navigate around all of your UI okay and
cognition is where if you show somebody
like flashing text or side with like
lots of animation that might cause an
epileptic fit or just cause them issues
yeah I think I remember someone tweeting
saying like they had a condition where
there was light loads of power lights
scrolling or something goes on it makes
them feel really nauseous because
there's tons of light weird movements
going on when doesn't parallax scrolling
make everyone feel nauseous is the real
question
that's true so thankfully there's a few
tools to help with web accessibility
issue diagnosis should go through them
the first is the chrome accessibility
developer tools which is like a Chrome
extension you can grab I'm a bit of a
douche so I'm gonna run it against your
site mine isn't too bad it's not great I
guess we'll find out yes so we're gonna
hop into dev tools in the orders panel
check accessibility and go and run it
against this site you've got a few your
a few passing tests and you've got a few
tests that are not passing so we're
gonna look at those the first one is
yellow and says the text elements should
have a reasonable contrast ratio Matthew
yeah I said the opacity low on some of
the menu items that aren't selected so I
need to bump them up or find a different
way of visualizing it one of the nice
things about this is if you hover over
any of the Dom nodes that will actually
visualize it over in the preview pane
just kind of cool yeah so one of the
other things I found because I have
another issue on my site which is the
about menu item doesn't actually explain
anything about what's gonna happen but
if you go and see accessibility options
like in the elements panel and you've
got the styles and computer stars
there's an accessibility drop-down that
you get then I think what this is it
actually shows you what the screen
reader would say based on what it's what
it's got
and the main reason like this is a it's
a nice light representation is something
the season for me to go okay as well
screen we would like say but it also
shows you area labels that you could put
that would affect the screen read and
what it says which were kind of light
because I wouldn't have known what the
right area labels would have been so
it's just kind of a nice way of
educating yourself as you're going along
figuring out what you can change to get
better screen reader support or anything
like that cool nice so the thing that
powers the accessibility developer to
steel distinction is actually called
accessibility developer tools it's like
this node module it's not necessarily
just a node module but basically it
gives you all the functionality that you
might need to go and run these tests
locally or hook up to continuous
integration in case you wanted to write
accessibility tests alongside your unit
tests is that running it through some of
my phantom jeaious oh I wrote a while
back a module called alley a11y which
uses the gives you basically a CLI and
CI module for doing that you can just go
and run it against Travis and nice do
its thing drop in your CI drop it in
have you heard of ten on you have you
have so ten on gives you this nice like
web UI for just doing nice basic web
accessibility testing I've run it
against developers.google.com and we
have a ton of missing alt attributes
which yeah we lakes up so tenon is super
nice like the only criticism that have
it like it's great because you know how
to do any calling it's super easy to get
like a gut check of where you are but
the flip side is when I run my site for
races there's no problems with it which
we both know is now a lie so it's useful
for a gut check and it's super low
effort to get it running on your site
but I questioned it I guess so 10 on 10
on runs against the web content
accessibility guidelines 2.0 and I think
the accessibility developer tools just
has like a good set of general
accessibility best practices it tries to
check against so there they're checking
for related but not not necessarily the
exact same set of things yeah the both
we're checking out so the other one is
totally totally to
no T over t a11y basically it's got a
super awesome logo but what it is is
it's basically a bookmarklet so you can
drag it to your your toolbar and when
you're in your site click on it and it
adds like a little button onto the
bottom of your webpage and the main
reason it's nice is just the fact that
it breaks up all the different criteria
of what you can look for in terms of
accessibility into nice little chunks
you just focus on that one area and then
it starts adding things into the page so
with the contrast links it will actually
like hover over the buttons like add a
little button saying this is a problem
area and it's just nice it's very
lightweight super simple and I think the
way that it breaks stuff up is if you've
got a ton of stuff wrong with your site
it's at least manageable chunks I think
it's just nice it's a nice little tool
cool I've got to give a mention to Ally
Jas by Rodney rain which is like this
little helper library that helps you
with some of the workflows you normally
have when you're trying to make your app
a little bit more accessible so it makes
things like trying to figure out what
elements are considered focusable on the
page a little bit easier
trapping focused navigation to a
particular dom subtree something that
would have helped me actually so I was
trying to make this navigation drawer
keyboard accessible the other day and I
wanted to avoid you like tabbing through
the navigation and then like going back
yeah okay and it's having to other parts
of the page yeah that might have helped
with that and it's just really useful
for like querying the Dom for folks well
they're terrible elements check it out
it's pretty decent so I have some web
accessibility Pro tips go on they're not
really pro tips I'm incompetent but
they're good good things to watch other
advice that's all that advice so the
first thing keep an eye on is making
sure that the components and elements in
your page can be accessed using a
keyboard and navigated around using a
keyboard yeah next make sure that your
elements can be used with a screen
reader so for example if I go to your
website and I turn on welcome -
voiceover voiceover speaks descriptions
of items on the screen
it's basically what it does does all of
that the vertical line 1 is the
interesting one where I've somehow added
my name
- the single vertical line so there's
some issues there we've already
discovered in this episode that you have
multiple issues with your site probably
worth checking out people should also
make sure that their their apps work
without sound yep so things like games
might be worth keeping that in mind
something like air hole in our all it is
is a button that makes a horn you could
probably make that accessible make sure
I because I did now it was just like a
text that just goes who people should
make sure their apps work without color
because some people are colorblind I
don't see the full spectrum of colors
yeah and people should make sure that
their web apps work in high contrast
mode as well which is the problem that
I've got on my same you have multiple
problems Matt these are just some of the
ones that we can actually address using
tools thanks man I try I try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
