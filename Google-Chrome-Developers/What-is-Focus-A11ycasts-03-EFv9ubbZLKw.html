the show
so in the last episode we were talking
about a side nav and how to make sure
that it had really good focused behavior
but I wanted to take a step back in this
episode and really talk about sort of
the fundamental concepts of focus and
what it is and and who it's useful for
so if you're unfamiliar with the term
focus basically focus in a nutshell
refers to selecting an element and then
directing all of the keyboard events to
that element so let me give you an
example of what I mean by that
over in jsbin here I've started to put
together a very simple little form so
I've got a few input elements on the
screen and you can see that when I go
over and click on this first text input
I get this sort of blue ring around that
element indicating that it is focused
and now as I type in my keyboard all of
my keyboard events are directed at that
element which in this case knows to
display the characters as I've typed
them now for some of our users focus is
sort of their primary means of reaching
everything on screen for someone who has
a repetitive stress injury like carpal
tunnel syndrome and can't use a mouse or
for someone who is using a screen reader
and predominantly uses a keyboard to
move around the screen for these users
focus is absolutely critical it's how
they reach all the interactive controls
in our application and so we want to
make sure that we have a very logical
focus order in our page now the way that
these users navigate focus in the
document is using either the tab or the
shift tab keys on their keyboard so
going back to my example here if I want
to move focus to the next element I can
just press tab press tab again to move
to that select element shift tab to move
focus backwards and some of the native
controls even have additional keyboard
support built in so for instance I have
the Select element focus right now I hit
the up and down arrow keys to select
different children or maybe I can even
just start typing like hit the letter H
and it'll actually autocomplete to one
of the available items now the order
that elements are focused in the
document is known as creatively enough
the tab order and we want to make sure
that our tab order makes sense to our
users now some elements are implicitly
inserted into the tab water
so native controls things like input
select button these are all implicitly
focusable so we don't have to do any
additional work to make sure that the
user can reach them with their keyboard
but not all elements are focusable so
let me give me an example here going
back to jsbin you can see that I put
together this example I've got an h1 tag
here I've got a little picture of a
kitten I've got a paragraph of text and
at the bottom I have a button element so
let's look at what happens when I press
the tab key on my keyboard so I'm going
to start up here at the top of the page
I hit tab and you'll notice that the
only item that gets focused is that
button element at the bottom of the page
the reason is because for elements that
are non interactive there really is no
reason to put those into the focus order
a sighted user who is using a keyboard
to navigate the page will be able to see
those elements so they don't need to be
a tab stop or anything like that for
those users a non sighted user who's
using a screen reader to navigate the
page well the screen reader is going to
handle the work of reading all of those
non interactive elements so for those
users you still just want to make sure
that the only thing that's focusable are
the interactive controls now I mentioned
the order that elements are inserted in
the page is known as the tab order and
tab order is actually inferred by the
Dom ordering of your markup so for
instance the way that I write my HTML
dictates the order that things will be
focusable in my page and this presents
kind of an interesting conundrum because
it's possible to rearrange the visual
appearance of items on the page using
CSS while maintaining the same tab order
so let me give an example of why this
can be a problem so over here in my
editor I've got three buttons on-screen
in sequential order and if you look over
in the mark-up you can see that I've got
three buttons one right after the other
in HTML now if I select my output here
and I tab through it you'll see I focus
the first button focus the second button
and then I focus the third button so far
so good now let's see what happens if we
apply a little CSS to change the visual
appearance of these buttons so I'll take
this first one here I will style it to
float to the right and now visually my
buttons appear in a different order on
screen but notice that the Dom order
remains the same
so as I tab through the page I focus
what
he seems like the last button that we
know it's actually the first one in the
Dom I tap again I focus what seems like
the first one visually but it's the
second one in the DOM and then I tap
again and now I'm focusing this middle
button it's all very very very confusing
and if you look at a lot of really large
websites that are heavily styled you
might notice the tab order seems kind of
nonsensical and oftentimes this is the
reason so let me give you another kind
of more real-world example this is
something that I built it's a little
site called the Funyun it's like a fake
news site and again as we're tabbing
through this experience you'll see that
when we tap through the navigation it
starts kind of over to the right and
then kind of reverses and goes back
through we tap again and it just jumps
to the bottom of the page for some
reason and we tap again and it jumps
back up to the top of the page if you
look at big website sometimes you'll
even see the focus ring disappear
entirely for a little while at your
tabbing through the page and then come
back on-screen similar to what we saw
with that side nav in our last episode
so how do we fix this well let's go over
to our code editor and actually inspect
some of the code for this page now
looking at the index.html for this file
in that navigation I can see that I have
this anchor right here from my search
element and it's got a little class
applied to it called pull right now when
I see something like that I often think
oh this is probably like a helper CSS
class if I go look at my CSS sure enough
I've got this pull right helper that is
floating that element over to the right
just like our button example so how do
we fix that well the easy solution here
is to just move the element later in the
Dom so I'll get rid of the anchor tag at
the top let's move it later in the page
it's still gonna get that float right
style it's still gonna be you know where
we want it in the document but now when
I tab through this experience the
navigation makes much more sense now the
next issue that we ran into was after
we're done tabbing through the
navigation it seems like focus just
jumps to the bottom of the page and then
it jumps back up into the main document
so let's try and sleuth out what's going
on there
the reason our focus is jumping to the
bottom of the page is because it's
trying to target this newsletter down
here in particular these implicitly
focusable items inside of it this input
and this button I can see that this
newsletter appears very high up in my
Dom order if I go and I look at my CS
it looks like the newsletter sure enough
is absolutely positioned so even though
it's occurring early in the DOM we're
just making it appear like it's pin to
the bottom of the page now just like we
did with that search button we can take
our newsletter and we can move it later
in the Dom to improve our focus order so
we'll go all the way down here to the
bottom after main we can maybe create
like a footer element drop in that
newsletter now we go back we refresh the
page things look the same but now as I
tab through the experience it's much
more logical and we get all the way
through the page before we focus that
newsletter so if you work on a really
big site or an application try tabbing
through your experience see if you have
a sensible tab order and if not maybe
you need to go in and sort of rearrange
your Dom a little bit to make things a
bit nicer for your users that about
covers it for today if you have any
questions on focus order or anything
like that please leave them for me down
below in the comments and as always
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
