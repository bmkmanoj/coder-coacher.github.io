last episode of polycast I showed you
how to bind to sub properties in your
markup but I totally forgot to show you
how to bind to those same changes in
your JavaScript it's actually a really
cool feature of polymer called observers
so let's check those out a declared
property can have an observer method
that runs every time that property
changes and I showed how that worked in
a few episodes prior so if you haven't
seen that you can go follow this link
right here to check that out but
basically what I've got right here is
this this X unicorn element it has a
property called sparkles and an observer
that i've defined called sparkles change
which is this function down here that
will run anytime sparkles is updated so
that's the first kind of observer
function it's one that you know a lot of
developers are familiar with but one
that we haven't talked about yet which
is really cool is the ability to use
this observers array so like the
previously mentioned observer method you
can use this array to specify a handler
that should run when a property changes
and you do this by adding a method name
which is a string to the array and then
the parentheses you for the property
that you want to observe so in this case
I have a zombie manager element and my
properties are this zombies object my
observers array has one observer in it
which is this zombies changed function
and it's looking at the zombies property
and anytime that object is updated it's
going to run this handler right here and
get the new zombies object but there's a
lot more that we can do with the
observers array for instance we can use
it to observe element sub properties so
if I want to look at zombies hunger then
I can have it do that instead and that
new value will get passed to this hunger
changed function what's really cool is
we can actually observe multiple
properties at the same time and what's
great about that is you know if you have
a method that you want to run only when
those properties have a value this is a
good approach to use because
that method right there is not going to
execute if any of these properties is
undefined or null or anything like that
so you know if you have asynchronous
properties that you take a little while
to initialize or something like that
rather than writing some early complex
logic to keep track of all of them you
can just use an observer to watch
multiple properties and when they all
finally have a value just kick off some
function it's a really really handy
trick let me do a quick example to
demonstrate how observers work I've got
this element that I've created here and
I've really simplified it down so you're
only seeing the important parts of the
definition up here at the top I've got a
you know an image tag which would be
presumably inside of my template and
then I've got this binding for blurb
right here and that value is going to
come from my observer function so in my
illness definition I have this bio
property and that's an object which
defaults to this guy right down here so
it's an object with a maker property
which right now is set to dr.
Frankenstein any time this thing changes
we're going to run maker changed we're
going to observe bio dot maker and then
we'll set this dot blurb equal to that
new value and that is going to go an
update our binding right up there so
let's let's do that in practice over
here in the dev tools I've got my
element rendering right here I've
already got it selected in the elements
panel so I can use my dollar signs 0
trick to refer to it and I'll just say
no dollar sign 0 dot set x 0 dot maker
to raw and that's going to update
visually right there now if you aren't
familiar with the set method you can
check out our previous episode which
talked about using set and notify path
in order to update element sub
properties and have those update
bindings but this is you know kind of
like a way of working with observers but
there's actually one last trick that
observers have up their sleeve let's say
instead of just observing maker let's
say that maybe this object had like a
hundred sub properties and I wanted to
observe if really like any of them
changed it would be
really annoying to have to put all of
those into this one huge observer
function and so the last trick up the
sleeve of the observer array is its
ability to look at wild cards so here
I've changed the code a little bit now
I'm still looking at bio maker I'm bio
dot star and what that's going to do is
observe you know any sub property and
you know if these were if these were
objects and they had more sub properties
it would just observe all that stuff
inside of this bio objects it's a really
powerful technique and instead of
passing just a value what polymer is
going to pass to our handler function is
going to be what is referred to as a
change record a change record is sort of
like a special polymer object and it has
three properties it has a path and that
is the it's a string which refers to the
the path that changed so if we change
biotin maker this path string would be x
0 dot maker it has a value property
which is the actual value that was
updated and then finally it has a base
property and the base property refers to
the object that precedes the wild card
so if we were looking at bio fubar star
then the base property would be by ODU
bar okay so what i'm doing here is in my
bio changed function i'm taking the
change record i'm looking at the path
and if it's by omega i'm doing one thing
i'm updating this blinding its biotin
aim i'm updating a different binding
this critter binding which is going to
update the span right here okay so over
an hour devtools let's give it a shot
see dollar signs 0 set x 0 dot mean and
we'll set that to frank see that updates
our first span and now let's let's
update the other thing we'll set by Odin
maker to rob and voila that updates are
other binding so with observers and
change records we now have awesome tools
for dealing with new data in our app and
we're actually finally ready to start
talking about binding to a raise but
i'll save that for the very next episode
