what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you
how I did my most recent project which
is a PWA that uses WordPress in the back
ends 28% of domains actually use
WordPress and that's a pretty impressive
number but also WordPress is written in
PHP which you've never done on
supercharged before and I know PHP has a
pretty bad reputation but I would like
to ask you to not like complain about it
in the comments because I think at
around 80% of backends use PHP so it's
probably good to have some experience
with PHP if you are a web developer with
WordPress you usually have two ways to
get into the system you can either write
a plugin or you can write a theme if you
want to introduce PWA features on a
simple way it is much easier to write a
theme and that's what I did I just want
a theme that uses serviceworker and you
know progressive image loading all these
little things and I would like to show
you how I did that before we start I
just want to give one warning that I
basically have no experience with
WordPress which is kind of good because
on the one hand that means that I didn't
go into the WordPress internals and did
any kind of monkey patching but also it
might mean that I have violated some
wordpress best practices along the way
and I hope you can forgive me for that
but if you find anything that I could
have done better feel free to leave a
comment or open a PR on the repository
the link to which I will put in
description so you can check out the
code and maybe even run it yourself but
without further ado let's take a look at
what I built and where we're gonna
arrive hopefully at the end of the
series so here I have my Moto G 4 which
is my development device the Moto G 4 is
what we consider a low end device it's
not really powerful but I use it because
I want to make sure that all the
animations and the loading I did worked
smoothly on emoji 4 so if I open what I
add to homescreen here that is the block
it loads really quickly and it's
right there and then we can scroll along
and see that every blog post has a
button to make it available for offline
reading which i think is a really nice
feature for a blog and if I open one of
the blog post you will see this really
nice transition happening which makes it
feel really slick and you can just read
through the blog post the images will
load in once they scroll into view in
order ahead of time which again I think
is a really data saving feature and more
blocks should have it at the bottom you
have a comment section where you can
also leave a comment yourself and you
can even leave comments while offline
which is also a pretty interesting
feature if you think about being in a
tube and leaving a comment but as you
can see even if I go back there's
transitions it's happening and they look
really nice and so I pay enough
attention to smooth animations really
good loading performance and just a nice
user experience so I hope you're excited
about this
I certainly am in the next episode I'm
gonna set up the development environment
and I use docker for that which was a
really interesting and in the end a
really good experience so if you're
interested in that stay tuned subscribe
to the channel and I'll see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
