where we are gonna write some PHP on
supercharged unheard of but today it's
gonna happen before I start I've said
before and I will say it again don't
waste your time arguing about PHP and if
it's a good language or not remember we
are all JavaScript developers here so
it's kind of ironic if a JavaScript
developer pretends to use the pinnacle
of language design they are both widely
used languages and you can write a
really really elegant code in both
JavaScript and PHP I mean I don't
specifically in PHP but you can and if
you want to that's definitely a valid
choice to do before I start I'd only
knew that I wanted to write a theme the
theme that uses all the modern web
technologies and because I didn't know
what pressed very well I want to throw
away everything that is usually in a
theme starter pack when you google it so
what I did I had the empty PHP file
added an echo statement to see that PHP
is actually working loaded into
WordPress saw that WordPress for some
reason requires you to have a styled CSS
file so I created that as well and
that's already all you do to have your
very first WordPress theme experience I
guess so as you can see here the CSS
file is literally empty and if we look
at the PHP file it's not much there just
an echo statement so I can make sure
that PHP actually executes and if I run
my docker ice block you can see that
that echo statement is actually executed
and I see it on the screen when I go to
the blog website now let's great in all
it's a very non-controversial blog that
loads very very efficiently but also no
matter how many blog posts I create in
the admin panel they don't really show
up and that makes it kind of useless and
to change that we have to tap into one
of the oldest and I guess core features
of WordPress which is the loop and as
you can see it's literally a while loop
that we use to iterate over our latest
blog posts and we just have our markup
and fill in the gaps with PHP to render
the title and the author and all these
other things and if we now reload it you
can see that we now have a list of our
blog posts and that by
way is server-side rendering servlet
running means that all the content all
the parts that you need to bring
something on screen is in the first
response of the site so we are putting
the title and the author and everything
else into one document that can be sent
to the browser and be put on screen
immediately and that means that the time
to first contentful paint the time it
takes for your content to appear on
screen will be extremely fast for
example in my blog it takes under a
second even over a slow 3G connection as
it can be found in emerging markets for
example and having this lower number
it's really important to not give users
waiting because that's the easiest way
basically to lose your users from your
website but also as of now if you take a
look at the listing that we have if we
click any of our blog posts it will be
redirected to a page where we can only
see the blog posts title and no content
and that can defeat the purpose and the
reason for that is because we haven't
talked about the template hierarchy yet
the template hierarchy is the system
that WordPress uses to figure out which
template file to render depending on
what page the user is currently looking
at and they have a image explaining the
system on the documentation site and you
can see it here it's a bit overwhelming
I went to that but also it's at the very
core of themes so it's worth putting in
the time to understand how it works
because it will allow you to build
complex sites fairly easily within
WordPress what what does this tell us
how do we use a template hierarchy well
for now we only have the index.php and
asked Timnath how he tells us that is
going to be used for everything and we
want a different template to be used for
when somebody look at a blog post and
this is where we can look at the
template hierarchy I have drawn a subset
of the template hierarchy here and
because we have basically three
different places a user can land on our
block that can land on the home page
where there should be a listing of our
most recent blog posts they can be a
category listing if somebody only wants
to look at my JavaScript related blog
posts they can look at the category
listing which lists only blog post in
this category and they can look at an
individual posts and as you can tell
they have
is a distinction that home and category
are listings of multiple Glock posts
while a post is a singular item and
that's why exactly that name is being
used in the template hierarchy where we
have singular so if somebody goes to
home we will use index.php if somebody
looks at a post it will use singular PHP
and a category is a listing just as well
so it will use index.php as well so what
the singular PHP look like then that's
actually pretty simple because I just
copy pasted the entire index.php but the
same code in there and just edit
rendering for the content of a blog post
which is was missing before so the other
pages the home page and the category
page all look the same as before but
when you now click on a blog post we
should hopefully see the actual content
of the blog post as well we just made
ourselves a blog that's pretty
impressive right see we have an index
listing we can click any offer blog post
and then we see the blog post that's a
blog that's pretty cool looks a little
bland admittedly so it just needs a
little of styling love color couple of
images here and there but be careful
about that because this is where I see a
lot of developers tank they're loading
performance and that's exactly we're
gonna talk about next time on how to
load styles and images and all these
things performant Lee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
