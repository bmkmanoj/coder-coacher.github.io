JavaScript modules dynamically my
favorite interview coding question
becomes a piece of cake with async
iterators and generators and you can
override the browser's default overflow
scroll behavior with the CSS overflow
scroll behavior property I'm Pete LePage
let's dive in and see what's new for
developers in chrome 63 importing
JavaScript modules is super handy but
it's static you can't import a module
based on runtime conditions thankfully
that changes in chrome 63 with the new
dynamic import syntax it allows you to
dynamically load code into modules and
scripts at runtime it can be used to
lazy load a script only when it's needed
improving the performance of your
application instead of loading your
whole application when the user first
hits your page you can grab only the
resources you need for them to sign in
your initial load is small and screaming
fast then once the user signs in load
the rest and you're good to go
writing code that does any sort of
iteration with async functions can be
ugly
in fact it's the core part of my
favorite interview coding question now
with async generator functions and the
async iteration protocol consumption or
implementation of streaming data sources
becomes streamlined and my coding
question becomes much easier async
iterators can be used in four of loops
to create your own custom async
iterators through async iterator
factories scrolling is one of the most
fundamental ways to interact with a page
but certain patterns can be tricky to
deal with for example the browser's
pull-to-refresh feature we're swiping
down at the top of the page causes a
hard reload in some cases you might want
to override that behavior and provide
your own experience
that's what Twitter's progressive web
app does when you pull down instead of
reloading the whole page it adds any new
tweets to the current view chrome 63 now
supports the CSS over scroll behavior
property making it easy to override the
browser's default overflow scroll
behavior you can use it to cancel scroll
training
disable or customize the pull-to-refresh
action disable rubber-banding effects on
iOS ad swipe navigations and more the
best part / scroll behavior doesn't have
a negative effect on your page
performance
I love web push notifications but I've
been really frustrated by the number of
sites asking for permission on page load
without any context and I'm not alone
90% of all permission requests are
ignored or temporarily blocked in Chrome
59 we started to address this by
temporarily blocking a permission if the
user dismissed the request three times
now in m63 Chrome for Android will make
permission requests modal dialogues now
remember this isn't just for push
notifications this is for all permission
requests if you ask for permission at
the appropriate time and in context we
found that users are two-and-a-half
times more likely to grant permission
these are just a few of the changes in
chrome 63 for developers of course
there's plenty more the finally method
is now available on promised instances
and is invoked after a promise has been
fulfilled or rejected the new device
memory JavaScript API helps you
understand performance constraints by
giving you hint about the total amount
of RAM on a user's device you can tailor
your experience at runtime reducing
complexity on lower-end devices
providing users with a better experience
and fewer frustrations the intel dot
plural rules
API allows you to build applications
that understand pluralization of a given
language by indicating which plural
forms for a given number and language
and that can help with ordinal numbers

docs and specs are in the description
