educomp is kind of like the focal point
of a discussion around using
cutting-edge technologies to build
amazing and user experiences but I think
kind of the elephant in the room is it's
great to learn how about all these new
technologies but what about older
browsers browsers that are less capable
that cannot take advantage of some of
these things so this session is an
opportunity to kind of discuss some of
those challenges that we've had for a
long time and what we can do about them
now we have a really powerful panel up
here so let me quickly introduce
everyone over here to my right is
schweet aankh Dixit he has been on the
Opera developer relations team an open
web team for a while now working a lot
on compatibility of all sorts of sites
so whether they have willy-nilly reg
exes that are blocking opera and such
also a member of the web education
community group and the mobile web for
social development group at the w3c to
my left timonium era so she has been
kind of fighting for the mobile web for
a long time ever since 2005 when she was
leading the mobile yahoo com yahoo.com
mmm yahoo com yes also was using
Wuerffel to great success trying to
wrangle all sorts of kind of tricky
little mobile devices coming over there
worked at webOS and is now at nokia cool
on her left is ed Sowden ed works for
the government digital service and the
GDS finished a just big huge redesign of
WK a kind of much lauded progressive
enhancement redesign bringing all of the
UK's government online and they're now
continuing to bring more departments
online they've done a really good job
kind of presenting the best way to do
progressive enhancement and documenting
kind of their strategies and
methodologies on also providing a very
like trance
development process blogging documenting
guidelines everywhere really fantastic
job and our opening speaker thom Maslin
tom is the tech lead for BBC news visual
journalism and has been leading the
client side team for the mobile BBC News
team for a while has been kind of seeds
based developer knows browser
performance and JavaScript extremely
well and also a while ago worked on the
team that built and open source the
glowed JavaScript library so smooth last
for the past all right cool so Tom if
you want to take it away it should be
great hi hello and connect with slides
hi hello and welcome to the introduction
talk legacy client by me Tom Maslin or
as I think this talk should really be
called yay I'm so excited there's going
to be five versions of Internet Explorer
for me to support next year I'm 34 years
old back in my arrogant 20s I saw myself
as a bit of a hand solo flying around
the office saving princesses websites
fixing bugs my job used to be easy I had
for rendering engines to support and
yeah I also had to worry about
accessibility but writing my code
semantically fix there and I also had to
concern myself about SEO but that's
essentially accessibility for search
engines right so my semantic code sorted
that too this was a time when we can all
afford to be little Han Solo's bill
quickly put in sites together but then
in 2007 all that changed when Steve Jobs
invented the bloody iphone got more
complicated suddenly we had Mobile's
with very slow connection speeds and
phones with different sized screens new
types of interactions smartphone started
to put to appear with pathetic little
processes and tiny amounts of ram that
run my code really slowly and PPK also
pointed out that was like a hundred
different versions of web kits to
support but all of these problems were
nothing compared to what was about
wash over us an avalanche of devices
being confident little Han Solo's wasn't
good enough anymore instead we've all
had to become intelligent clever Spock's
you can balance all of these issues
against getting our job done correctly
as developers this is the biggest
problem that we have today balancing
agility getting the stuff done quickly
versus robustness getting the stuff done
right now in this paradigm that we find
ourselves in it's very easy to
concentrate on this issue so much that
we forget about boring old issues like
supporting ie seven and eight I can test
in IE eight and seven using a virtual
machine on my Mac but it's really hard
sorry but it's really hard to do the
experience is slow and the dev tools are
terrible trying to get I you 7 dev tools
to do I want is like asking a wiki
that's wearing boxing gloves to wipe my
bottom clean it's a terrible situation
but normally ends are covering you in
something it's some bugs I just give up
on because it's not worth spending the
time required to fix it to fix such a
small fix a problem with for such a
small audience it raises questions about
whether we should actually support these
browsers I'd argue that sometimes it
depends well the challenges surrounding
client support have increased web
development itself has become more
popular it's entered the mainstream
everyone from school children to
contestant on The Apprentice are now
making web pages and the act of making a
web page is actually pretty easy build
something look at it in your browser
there you go it's done very fast but as
I've just shown you the practice of web
development is the complete opposite
it's actually really it's actually
really hard to do right anyone can pick
up a book or read an article online and
that teaches you how to make a web page
how to write html5 or CSS or JavaScript
the
things are hard to master but they're
easy to start doing what is hard to
learn though is how to scale your
website up from a single user ie
yourself to a larger audience these
things here they help you to scale your
audience but learning them is much
harder because to understand these these
you have to change the context of your
thinking away from what's in front of
you as a developer I often find myself
having to defend these things but
ultimately the web isn't about these
they're important but we don't do
accessibility for the sake of
accessibility and we don't make sites
fast or SEO friendly or work without
JavaScript because it's nice what we're
trying to achieve our actual end goal is
ubiquitous we want as many people as
possible to see our site the web should
be inclusive not exclusive I mean nobody
would build a shop that only the dwarf
from Game of Thrones could get into
right shops have doors that are wide and
as tall as possible websites should be
the same an easier way to think of
ubiquity is to call it browser support
when people talk about web browser
support they think well how far back
should we go ie6 ie7 in the web app in
the web site versus native apps to be
the reason why website wins is because
apps are binary they either work or they
don't an iOS app works on an iPhone but
it doesn't work on an Android however
your site will work on both and even
better in even better if you build it
properly it will work to a certain
degree on pretty much anything it's the
ubiquity of the web that wins so to go
back to the original problem i defined
this job is also harder because the
problem is continuing to increase in
complexity and we have to balance that
against getting stuffed getting stuff
done fast and robustly what we shouldn't
do is fight that complexity with ever
more complex solutions people who build
responsive websites that are really just
a collection of smaller websites within
it
creating more problems for themselves
when a problem grows to a certain size
the problem changes into something else
and to survive you have to change how
you think as well we did that at BBC
News we turned the problem of browser
support upside down instead of thinking
about how far back we should go we
decided to support everything we call
this technique cutting the mustard the
responsive site has a very basic core
experience that has a simple layout is
very fast and is delivered to all
browsers the poor experience is good
enough to allow any everyone to consume
the news on top of this we built an
enhanced experience using javascript and
modern CSS / me it has a complex layout
and is very functional this is only
delivered to modern browsers it's
conditionally loaded by checking for the
existence of specific features all the
browsers that cut the mustard have great
JavaScript and CSS support they have
fast rendering engines and a less buggy
this technique is robust because it
supports a massive amount of browsers
it's also agile as you're building the
enhanced experience using code modern
coding practices but I seven and eight
only get the core experience now this
might be good in a few if these browsers
don't bring a significant amount of
traffic or you might decide that these
browsers need more than just the core
experience how do you do that well with
two ways we can edit the cuts the
mustard tests to load an alternative
JavaScript the act that specifically
just for IE seven and eight we can then
cherry-pick what features the enhanced
experience we give them like a two
column layout or video support we also
need to give these browsers better CSS
with mobile first CSS IE seven and eight
only render the smallest view because
they don't understand media queries but
with a CSS preprocessor you can output a
version of a slight style
need to find with specifically for these
browsers the panelists ed Sowden has
already implemented this for the UK
government website and it is one example
of how you can do it instead of writing
media queries directly into your SAS use
this mixing instead then make a new sass
file that sets a variable width the
width value that you want IE 7 &amp;amp; 8 to
render the desktop view to import the
main sass file into this and it will
render out an alternative desktop only
version of your CSS into a new file you
should you should add the legacy IE
stylesheet into the page using the
conditional comment now however you have
to be careful now as I e78 will be
exposed to your modern CSS and there's
lots of selectors and properties that
you need to watch out for if you're
unlucky you may find IE seven eight will
be rendering your modern CSS onto the
page in a way that reminds you of how
Donald Trump's hair renders itself onto
his head so summarize how do you support
legacy clients I'd say don't think about
stretching your code across an ever
increasing browser support list the
problem is only ever going to get more
complex and you can't keep up by making
an ever more complex solution if you
keep thinking like a han Solo eventually
this problem will get on top of you
instead I think the best way to solve
this is with teamwork use the solid base
of progressive enhancement as a
springboard for your JavaScript and
treat each feature on your website like
an away mission deciding when to send
these agent browsers to the fore so
that's enough for me let's chat about it
I'm sorry I'm thanks alright thank you
very much time I was great so we'll go
to our first question our first question
delivered by Hakeem there hello yep
anonymous question why should there be a
stigma attached to not supporting older
clients if a developer knows their
audience and they all have the latest
clients what's the problem I think that
should be why is there a stigma attached
not what why should there be so I'll
rephrased it so Shri tonics you want to
take this Why Why should there be why is
there a stigma attached to not
supporting all the browsers there is but
there shouldn't be mainly because when
it comes to older browsers there's a lot
of there's a lot of reason to actually
support older browsers because there's a
lot of times in which the user cannot
update their browser whether it's
because the system administrator doesn't
allow it or because many times the user
doesn't know what a browser is so if you
say you know update your browser like
you know how could I update my browser I
don't know what it what it is so that's
one thing second things are that
sometimes people know what a browser is
they're fully aware of how to update it
but they don't want to maybe it
sometimes it's because they're on a you
know they're using a phone and they have
a very crappy network and they might use
a proxy browser instead of you know
something which is like a full-fledged
browser and proxy browsers are tricky as
we will see later on sometimes people
have very limited data plans I know
people in Europe who have 30 mb data
plans for a month and if you exceed that
then you'll get charged very very highly
so there's multiple reasons why and
gentlemen reasons why you should support
older or proxy browsers and they
shouldn't be an indistinct asked as such
I mean we all like to play with the
greatest and you know the most cutting
and stuff but you know the realities of
the world is we need to deal with
everyone and sometimes it's it you know
there's also what you call regulation or
some laws regarding accessibility and
stuff like that as well which which need
to be considered as as well so yeah so I
wonder if so the second part is is if we
do like know what your clients are and
if you're looking at analytics and
numbers and they're indicating that
you're okay on dropping support for IE 6
and 7 and potentially 8 is that fine I
think it depends on the context of the
content I think if you're making a
government website then there definitely
is a stigma because these services like
mandatory they have to be viewable by
anyone but if you're making an
application like Gmail then probably not
because somebody with ie7 won't give you
that much benefit ed is there is their
legal like legislation that requires the
accessibility to old browsers so there's
the only legal legislation or legal
things exist for older browsers are
accessibility you can be sued for not
having accessible website but like
that's up for the user to determine what
accessible is like that the stigma that
we have this industry seems to have this
horrible stigma without are you can't
drop support for old browsers you can't
drop support like you got to go back to
the question what is supporting an old
browser like supporting an old browser
for most of us means that we're going to
test in it like so that's not support a
tool that means you're testing in these
browsers supporting is like actually if
anyone has a problem you're going to fix
it for them like that support later so
if someone has a problem using your
website
you want to help that personnel but like
there shouldn't be any stigma attached
with helping someone because but if you
want to spend time making sure ahead of
time that those who won't have problems
then that's how you spend your time
that's it but the one problem i seen is
that ok let's say maybe you know by the
statistics you know that each company's
the services that and maybe they just
decide to drop IE support and sometimes
they are doing in the wrong way I mean
they tried to you know like a sniffing
the user agent or something and try to
eliminate all the IE which seemed to be
old but many times they are like doing
the wrong way so let's say you know I
work for nokia and a user Lumia phone
regularly right and my prize our choice
well it's not my choice actually comes
with an operating system and it sorry
cam and oftentimes I see the site like
oops arena you have to update your
browser it's like really it's ie10 is
pretty decent and I believe that you
know that sorry so site should work but
I think they just you know try to sniff
it out mistakenly and try to suggest me
to operate the browser or just download
some other browsers but the thing is
like if it's saying we don't always have
a choice you know users don't always
have this choice so that's something I
had to just remind you know people have
to remind so I guess on the topic of
support support is kind of a it's a
difficult it is the verb that we always
use in this discussion and it implies
that it is a binary decision you're
either support it or you don't and I
think for many of our development cycles
our development approach support is kind
of this sliding scale and so so Tom with
cutting the mustard when a browser falls
into unsupported they get a core
experience there is so there is no there
is no one support the the idea is that
everybody is supplied a core experience
everybody gets the content but the
content the weights displayed is very
simple so if there's additional content
on the homepage of the BBC news site for
example
like analysis and features facts
available but you have to click it to go
to it so the experience is very basic
there's some but you still get all the
content but then with the premium
version we'll just go and fetch all of
that content and put it straight into
the page we and is the difference in
your case the amount of testing between
core and the premium experience I
imagine you are not as actively testing
the core experience for experience is so
simple it's a single column we we don't
add any functionality into the page yeah
so that's going to pretty much render on
anything right I think Andy Clark
well-known develop in the UK while ago
released a universal aisle 6 ie6
stylesheet the idea here was basically a
stylesheet that had very good-looking
typography but you know destroyed all
the layout killed all your floats just
kept it all in a single column and the
idea was give that I give them nothing
else the content is there and it's
accessible but you can forget about and
like the visual pneus of the rest of the
site and I think that's kind of a nice
wait for something to go unsupported
it's basically to fall into a pit of
accessible content so that the like
having an ie6 style sheet which has
virtually nothing is kind of the
approach we took for one of the large
sections of gov UK because we used the
approach that Thomas mentioning during
the intro with the using mobile first
and then sending specific ie sheet style
sheets for ice seven and eight but I six
they don't get any way out because
layouts added on desktop so ie6 just
gets a low Bellevue so it has no it's a
single column it's basically got
typography because that's all that you
get think it's a benefit as well because
people with I 6 or i7 probably don't
have a good computer and so the fact
that is so simple means it will render
like five or six times faster than
another extreme and as long as you can
get what they want mm-hmm killed I think
that's a that's a good strategy because
there's so many sites which either
support it or just send an error message
saying that okay decided is not
supported
and that's it the user cannot do
anything about that so I think that's a
very important thing that you don't lock
anyone you at least served in the Corps
experience and the first part of that
question was if you know your audience
and it's really difficult to know you
your audience in a very very accurate
way even if you know using your
statistics and your analysis you know
what are the browsers which are coming
through you know there are times in
which you get you know a mention on the
front page of reddit or you you get
slashed out it or an influential news
website mentions you then you'll get
this whole stream of traffic which is
completely unpredictable so you know
even that premise of that question that
you know your audience is flawed so I
think it's a good time to move on the
next question this one to be asked by
John fellows so this is an honest
question what's the best way to make
legacy clients a visible part of the
development process so I think this is
both visibility on the developer side to
understand what is necessary to give
them what you plan to give them and also
potentially on kind of the executive
side to better understand what from a
development cost perspective is included
here I so it at the BBC News once we we
made the responsive site but it was a
small team that did it and then
eventually we found out to the rest of
the department and so we've had to go
through a training process with everyone
as they as they become engaged with the
product but so we've got the the
designers thinking about the core
experience as well and they're thinking
about progressive enhancement so they
start off with the core experience and
then they progressively enhance it and
make the better version the problem that
we find is that many people just
associate the core basic experience with
a very thin layout what they find harder
to do is is to probably try and
understand that the core experience
could be any
it and the premium experience could be
any width as well hmm I also wonder is
there included on this I think there is
a visibility of kind of the perceived
experience between legacy clients and
modern clients and one of these parts is
performance certainly so just rendering
a page or any sort of interactivity the
more modern browser it's going to be
quite a bit more responsive is there a
good way to kind of demonstrate the
difference between the user experience
of someone on an older client versus a
newer client and is that something that
you know that the executive team wants
to see and understand maybe I would say
let's say some UI or i would say you x
using some ajax e type of interaction
and that works probably wonderfully on
you know latest graced browsers chrome
and Chrome on desktop of me you know
worked nicely but yeah they show the
same UI and let's say like older mobile
browsers or could be Android although
under it and stuff it's probably it's
gonna look really junky or maybe even
fails know a lot of its managing
expectation though like people on the
old browser people on ie6 who are stuck
on ie6 in their corporate environments
they'll be used to an internet which is
not quite like the internet the rest of
us use so while like for me or for you
browsing a website in ie6 will feel
painfully janky and painfully horrible
like it's kind of almost expecting that
and people aren't left on these browsers
because they want to be there like
they're there because those are the
browser's they have because corporate IT
have said that's what they've got like
so it's all the case of managing
expectation for those guys those those
people if they if they know they're
getting a janky experience like they
come into that knowing and my colleagues
I have colleagues who were who have ie6
as their browser on their machines and
they know it's going to look crap and
they just think they joke with me like
it
supposed to look that bad and it was
like yeah i think the developer pick
that color for you it's like no they
know the Internet's horrible yeah I mean
the thing is just to add or maybe even
remove from a point on they might be
used to it on when they're working but
for sure they're using the internet when
at their home or under mobile and
transit or something so they know what
the internet what the real internet is
like and it'll be even more frustrating
for them to to do to see the Internet as
it is you know in in the wild on ie6 all
the time at work go and sit next network
they lives our pain and work anyway they
know Calvin's feeling something done
yeah actually I was going to ask Sarah
what you just said but I want to ask
Pasiphae is there a way to if people
have these different experiences at work
and at home they know your site's
different when they're actually going at
work and something might be missing
functionality they're used to at home is
there some strategy we can take to
tomato not frustrated us seeming like
they're suddenly hitting a broken
version of the site that they were used
to I think this comes back to the like
the approach we're cutting the mustard
you make sure they can get the content
they need to get still like while it
will look different it will feel a bit
different as long as they can achieve
the goals that they need to achieve like
it's the best you can do for them like
true I guess I think you know what I'm
hearing from from both of you is that
there is kind of both strategies include
a degraded experience for older browsers
in some way and that seems to scale
pretty well but that does mean that we
do have at least two experiences and so
if we are in a situation where you have
someone that is seeing both of those
experiences is that going to be a
problem I I think that's fine because we
can't like I said in the talk we can't
make a premium experience that works
across the whole spectrum of browsers
because Polly filling and
mobile internet connections are so hard
to marry up together yeah so it's gonna
that's it is half to be has to be good
enough because there's no other one no
it's better than just showing them that
oh you know your your browser is not
supported by always please better than
that okay I guess sorry the one caveat
to I just said is that if you do service
I detection and sniff the old browsers
which is probably so because normally
people when they talk about so you a
sniffing you think about always there's
a mobile device or is this a desktop
device whereas I think now we should
probably think about is is this an old
browser or a new or a new browser I
think might be an interesting in your
case would it be is this a does this
brother better cut the mustard first
yeah you could do that on the server if
you wanted to write like you know the
old browser that doesn't support
javascript but doesn't understand you
know Java JavaScript feature detection
then you have to rely on the server side
hmm alright I like to move on to the
next question this one comes from dustin
Costin things up here in the purple hey
so what as a community can we do to help
the holdouts of legacy clients such as
the government and IT departments
nothing was that was my answer as well
as there's nothing so i did a little bit
of research on kind of around this point
for i came the same pool said to me
earlier I've built a thing so which like
takes your denial attics and splits out
browsers with graphs you can see browser
usage at a time so this is called it's
called browser matrix takes in your
Google Analytics account and then just
choice the trend lines for a browser Oh
slightly really cool if it could show
future like trend lines so I went and
had a look because minerd I e sixes and
sevens trend lines on WK they're going
down ie6 lost half a percent in the last
six months well it was it it's gone from
just over 12 around half just say is
that any particular time of the week so
if your it can also show you stats
on a day by day of seven day rolling
basis and during the week six is above
that and we can it's not really there
but I guess the question is like but in
the case like I ate was he a better like
those guys they're going down they're
going to get there and from the
government perspective like working in
government everyone is painfully aware
in government that we're tied into these
horrible contracts that require us to
have ie6 and everyone's working to try
and get out of them like no one is
trying to stay in that world there's not
much development community can do to
help that Lake and they on gov UK we
have a browser bar that pops up your no
no browser that says try not great which
hilariously when we want it we did want
a design award earlier this year and a
whole collection of the screen shots
though in news articles you could see
that browser bar so made us probably
smile that these people writing reports
for fairly large magazines online still
use old browsers as well but in terms of
government massive corporates very aware
which one I get rid of it internally
question from the audience Daniel so we
we always want to all our users to be
happy and I looked at some numbers and
we have IE all of IES like eight percent
of our traffic maybe four percent of our
traffic I but is it worth spending the
effort versus things like developer
happiness and retention sounds like it's
not worth the effort for you
sounds like you're doing well I'd say it
depends i mean those old devices might
bring a lot of traffic to your site but
do they bring a lot of revenue and right
i think that's something that it's i
don't know that we've seen a lot in the
way of business metrics that are
segregated by browser or by connectivity
or by the performance the load time of
the site but I think it's worth looking
into kind of how those technical metrics
of the site of those users translate
into their success on this right I guess
to get back to dustins question we're
talking about what our community can do
to help legacy clients so Google Google
Apps dropped support for ie8 last
November and Google Analytics dashboard
is dropping support for ie8 in in a few
months google has a policy of only
supporting the the most recent and the
last version and so Google's being kind
of aggressive in this and saying you
just have to upgrade in order to use it
you can't use google docs on i-8 but is
there anyone else that is in a position
where they can help move this forward or
were you just in a case where we are
just waiting for those trend lines to
naturally go down over the course of
years as we did with ie6 in turn a UK
government I'd love to say more but
there is work going on to fix it there
but yeah it's still like there are
people trying one more thing that I I
wanted to add was a lot of these things
are decided at the contract level
sometimes what happens is i can at least
talk about the indian government
sometimes what happens is they don't
make the government website stay
sometimes send it out to a you know a
contractor who makes it for them
and usually things are decided at you
know when the contract is signed and if
you don't if there's a class saying that
okay I six will be supported you know it
has to be supported so one of the things
is to you know as a web developer if
you're lying for that contract to argue
at that level before signing that yes
you know I will not be supporting these
things that might be supporting the the
newer versions and and the second thing
I wanted to mention was this problem is
exacerbated by the fact that many people
who were in government didn't weren't
really text I with that much for a while
they didn't really know about browsers
and you know stuff like that but with
newer devices coming in you know people
are having iPhones and iPads and stuff
like that there they did still might not
know what a browser is or not care but
they they know that okay whatever I'm
you know this website that I'm sending
the contract for it has to work on my
iPad for example so you know they're
more focused on on those things on
devices and then the older browsers so
that mind shift is happening a little
bit but once again as as as web
developers before signing the contract
you have to see it and be very careful
about that token contracts is all
contracts that the UK government signs
now cannot have anything which even
hints at vendor lock-in or device or
browser lock in anything that hints a
specific version is has to be removed
before contracts and go out to pretender
there's nothing like that it's not out
anymore mmm comment from the audience
Mary from O'Reilly hey so just going
back to we were talking earlier about
how frustrating is for your co-workers
if they have one browser version at home
and one browser version at work and
those types of scenarios I think we
might be referring to a very specific
portion of the world in that those are
the people who were very tech-savvy who
have the latest and greatest things who
yeah you know bigger and newer is better
but what about the rest of the world
that you know updating your browser is
scary because it means all of a sudden
you don't know how to use it anymore so
there's people who consciously make the
choice to not update
because of that so I miss I'm sorry your
mom's well okay so yeah that's an
example my mom does that and it but I
mean it's it's a legit scenario and by
by eliminating that the ability for them
to view your website you're basically
telling them they don't matter yes I
think change aversion is real for
everyone in a lot of cases browsers and
web site features as well I mean might
might take here is that it's a lot of it
is up to browser makers themselves to
make transitions as smooth as possible
that's we're good now because the
problem was always IE right and all or
more like corporate corporate ie so
people would build corporate intranets
and they would rely on activex and
that's why we're in a situation where
there's so many corporate desktops that
can't upgrade was going to mention what
that too many times you can't just
download install any process and any
computers you have to ask IT guys to do
that you know so they obviously you know
probably that's where now legacy is
coming from so you know if you you know
working for the web services food like
enterprise and such this is something
like a really huge issue and you had to
really watch a new browser stats and
what you're you know people use in so I
want to move on to the next question but
before I do I want to get a jeffrey burt
off from Microsoft since we are talking
about ie a lot be nice to get his
comment here yeah thank you so first to
defend Microsoft here one thing I want
to make sure and I do that probably
because one of the things I want to make
sure that we understand is that windows
XP that runs ie8 was a great product and
that's why people still use it so
anytime we build great products we're
going to have to deal with legacy
browsers because they're going to stick
around so if you look at a parallel to
iOS so we just stopped or Apple just
stop supporting was a 3gs with updates
which means that iOS 6 is the last
version they'll ever see
but those phones are going to continue
to be around and they will become a
legacy platform that we have to support
so when we have good products that are
going to stick around it's something
that we need to plan for so these type
of discussions will always be relevant I
think in this in this case we're in our
situations that I windows XP is a great
product but the problem there is that
users of I e on windows XP don't have an
ability to upgrade their browser to the
next version of ie yeah so that's you
know that's something that's this clear
if you are on that platform there's two
different things that are going to cause
you to stay on older versions by e1 is
it's your environment whether it's
because you don't want to upgrade or you
can't upgrade or the fact that with ie
you can't upgrade path ie8 if you're on
Windows XP so our are at Microsoft we
use JavaScript we use our JavaScript
engine html5 and a lot of our products
and so whether it's writing apps for
office or in embedded or an xbox or in
Windows 8 apps all of that can be done
with the JavaScript engine so there's
definitely a coupling there that makes
us have to draw some lines in the sands
as to where we can can update and where
we can so it's not that it's there's
reasons behind it I guess is what I
would say sure and I guess we can close
this I discussion for now with the end
of support date for windows XP is april
2014 right so that trend line that we're
watching for ie8 will may potentially
drop down more more substantially at
that point so there's like there's a
whole nother like dark web which no one
talks about talking about like old IES
and the fact there are other things
which we have to support which no one
talks about and their old screen readers
actually no technology head before you
learn the screen readers I want to get
Alex Russell's comments here hi thanks
Alec Ross one of my first projects at
Google was a product called chrome frame
which was necessitated because you
didn't do what you
said Microsoft didn't take care of the
legacy right it was Microsoft
responsibility to do that and instead
Microsoft chose not to invest in making
sure that users of Windows XP could
continue to use modern technology so
having done the cleanup work for you I
just need to make the point that you
didn't this is going to get exciting so
for the moment we're going to move on to
the next question this one Matthias
kruseman Cosmo hi my question is for how
long is it worth Polly filling features
for legacy browsers and taking the
hidden performance sort of productivity
what factors should influence the you to
meet chance to see support for a legacy
client so yeah so in a lot of cases our
method of dealing with all the clients
that don't support it certain
capabilities polyfill in them we started
out with the Jason to jas Jason polyfill
and we've managed to polyfill many many
things these pythons do have performance
costs not only in in the bytes that we
have to send down the wire in CSS and
JavaScript but also in runtime
performance so performance of polyfills
is a concern and what are the other
aspects that could help influence the
choice to see support might not be the
right words but change the support level
so maybe a good example is with
animations so a couple years ago people
would do javascript animations and now
we try to see what animations with CSS
and we just say well if you don't have
that CSS feature you just get a janky
animation I'd say that's fine I don't
have a problem with people in IE getting
genki transitions right unless you're
about Jenkins I mean if
you if you want to have some animation
but you know have doesn't work in some
browsers I think you have to just kill
the animation it I think not moving at
all it's far better than janky animation
so want to say jank Alex you mean like
binary like it's it's closed then it's
open output then it with with a more
modern browser anyway slice Monaco yeah
totally although I guess an issue with
that is not so much with polyfill so we
have seen recently where I made like a
panel up here and I mate I gave it a
nice animation grow it works lovely in
iOS but when I checked it on an Android
amazon kindle fire that union had a
great browser is supported the feature
but it was really it was really Jenky
because because the hardware just just
couldn't just couldn't keep up right
it's not just a harder way actually at
the amazon kindle i know the silk
browser is a proxy browser you know well
maybe a marketing term is like cloud
accelerated browser or whatever that is
you know yes let us keep in mind it's
not like old javascript is forced to
work in some web get it works in as way
you want anna proxy but i think i guess
when we talk about legacy clients
there's a few reasons why like we use
the term legacy and that does happen to
usually refer to them being old but i
think the reason that we don't embrace
them and love them is because they they
may have bugs they're probably slower
than what we're used to and they lack
features that we want to use that we're
interested in using so it's not
necessarily our old but they aren't good
is what we want and I mean is it worth
forming a policy around how to change
your support level for browsers what do
you what's your take on this shoot on I
think ultimately there's there's going
to be so many variations that you should
stop with the mindset of supporting or
not supporting a you know those kind of
browsers or not you know you should just
go with the with the thing of
progressive enhancement and
you know feature detection and because
what will happen is you know you you say
that ok I'll gonna I'm going to support
this old browser but ultimately well
what will happen is you'll get more and
more devices nowadays will we get
devices which are running a very good
version of Android but ours you know
less than a hundred dollars so even
though they're running like a very very
nice version of WebKit for example the
performance is such that it really makes
them almost like a legacy browser in
some many cases so the how do you define
a legacy browsers is going to become
more and more model because a browser
with a very very nice phone can behave
like a legacy browser if the network
connection sucks um and you know there's
a lot of smart phones coming up with
with good version of WebKit but you know
where your underpowered okay so it's a
strange it's a strange time so you've
got like a nokia c5 there's an
entry-level phone it's got a really bad
processor and ram but it'll have have a
really good version of WebKit on it so
will render the page really well and
then you can compare that to an iphone 5
that has opera mini in it so the
capabilities would be less or you would
at least get a static version of the
site is a very bizarre issue to try and
to try and so i don't think there is a
magic bullet actually in the moderniser
web page in the documentation say it's
because you can use polyfill doesn't
mean you should I think it I say that I
it's true yeah so it's really so that's
really developer have developers have to
decide what even really support you know
many times like a fancy you I will be
pretty nice but do you really care and
some browsers have been like round
corners really you don't always need
this you know you can always drop
certain especially if it's just you I
Britain as you can drop it but I guess
the other part of this is that there are
some features there's a set of features
that you cannot let degrade gracefully
webgl get used to get user media Web
Audio API these many can't be Polly
filled and so what is the responsible
way in defining a browser support policy
when you're dealing with features of
this sort where you're providing an
experience that competes with something
on a native platform and it's not
content based so so you mentioned WebGL
I can give you an example there on the
BBC News we do we start doing WebGL
content now we've got Lamar's where the
Mars Lander 3d object so if you had
WebGL supported you could spin it round
and zoom in and stuff like that and it
was really nice but then there's no poly
fill in that so what other browsers
would get is an image get is an image
gallery of the 3d model so we wouldn't
try to polyfill the content with offer 0
10 and alternative content ok I'd like
to move on in the next question John
Resig if you could would love thank you
so I took this question because I didn't
like it so I didn't wanted to be asked
the question was roughly that they felt
that you could get away with supporting
browsers that did not have JavaScript
and I feel that that is not the case
that for most content websites you need
to support clients that do not have
JavaScript but to spin into a more
legitimate question what about web
applications where you're not dealing
with strictly content-based I feel like
most of you are dealing with content
where it's like here's a news article
here's some information you want to read
obviously in that case there shouldn't
be a barrier in between you and reading
that so but like what about a whole
application that is built and very
JavaScript centric should you be making
a fallback for that like I know if you
want to use gmail and there's no
JavaScript you fall back to this forum
based thing and I have no idea how well
that's maintained
but that's got to be someone sad job and
like so like so I but but I mean like I
assume not everyone wants to be doing
like old like you know HTML tables and
like doing the forms like it so like is
that legitimate things for people be
worrying about that for their
applications I'd say it's always best to
create an experience that doesn't just
immediately fell when something goes
wrong with with the JavaScript so I
think gmail is a great example that you
point out so it's something that is a
service it is purely functionality but
then I think I think we should just make
the experience is a great Oh in fact
i'll let you say that so I read on the
gds website about the about why you
should make progressive enhancement with
JavaScript do you get one talking about
okay so head said the incentive instead
of build your applications like an
escalator instead of a lift do you get
me now without you they don't i don't
think i wrote a Jake I'm really not
ready no sir so somebody said you know
if if an escalator breaks the worst
thing that's going to happen is it's
going to turn into some stairs so you
can keep walking up so you can keep
walking up it but then if but then if
you're in a left no brakes and you stuck
in the life do you know there's
nothing there's nothing you can do and
it's the same with JavaScript
applicators well I guess there's a
certain clot there's plenty of
JavaScript applications a diagramming
tool and I am client like many of these
rely on real-time data cannot be done
with page refreshes and so some of these
do require javascript for their
interactions Jake were already good blog
post on this recently yeah jake would
you like to comment on how but there's a
good'n CJ quite mad me I'm kind of
purging on the stairs cuz I was actually
on the way to the bathroom so you caught
me just at the right point any website
that has a loading bar it is a missed
opportunity is a missed opportunity to
serve the content directly without
JavaScript earned
and then get javascript in there to do
it and gmail is an example of that I
mean it has I mean gmail should have
URLs I should be able to bookmark like a
page to a particular email and when I
hit that I should get that content on
the page and then JavaScript can come in
and add the rest i mean it is it is just
a series of tabs and forms it doesn't
need to depend on JavaScript first
render but the the gmail the gmail web
app also also has URLs that are
permalink able for all messages as well
one thing I wanted to mention just to
repeat which matches this use cases you
have JavaScript applications heavily
reliant on JavaScript but you also have
these you know these phones which are
coming up which will have browsers which
support javascript but these are
underpowered phones in which it will be
actually better for them to to get a
version without JavaScript than to get a
version with JavaScript but which runs
really really slowly so in those cases
it might be better for them to to get a
lighter version of the page so and the
other thing is you know search engines
once again if you have like single page
applications you know you can run node
and phantom GS and you know it used to
use a solution with that but I still
think that it would be better to just
have something which can can be run
without JavaScript yeah I supposing that
the search engine optimization it's a
balance of what's what's easy for you
but it's certainly if you're if it's
important for you to have that content
available to search you need to find a
way to do that either through
progressive enhancement or through a
complex server-side rendering farm the
do 10 if the other side of the argument
is the making a job making an
application that's purely relies on
javascript is probably a lot faster so I
so I would say you mean if x and mean if
you're trying to get something up and
running fast if you prototype in if
you've got if you got deadlines issues
then you mean that's that is that that
is an option you can do that however I
would always try to make something a
progressive enhancement so in the slide
where I spoke about the thing
things that were nice so accessibility
SEO working without jobs groups
usability all those things are idealisms
but on their own they're probably not
great arguments that you can go to your
manager and say hey this doesn't work
well with screen readers because your
boss will probably turn around see I
don't care about screen readers but when
you add them all together they create
something bigger and that's that's like
that's the whole point of the web right
and all of those things if you develop
with all of those things in mind then
you're kind of developing in and in the
current of the of the web you're you're
you're swimming with the web as opposed
to swimming against it which is what i
think is like applications that are
purely javascript are swimming against a
little bit so so you can make things
that are purely javascript but i think
it's it's better and you get added
benefits by building things in the
progressive enhancer you have a comment
we're gonna have to make this very quick
but when i get your voice here sorry
somebody says accessibility and i go
crazy I just wanted to say like to add
on to this and I think BBC is a great
example of this that the users of
assistive technology are not like legacy
or down level users either like if you
have something like data visualization
or chat or anything interactive those
are still things that you need to make
accessible whether or not you're going
to serve them to tell legacy clients
like everybody is expecting that they
have the latest technologies they have
the latest browsers like everybody else
and you know it's important to decouple
them from like well we'll just serve
them the text only site because that's
the same thin girl they've had since the
90s yep 98.4 percent of screen reader
users have javascript enabled from
louise wedding survey but guys I think
we're out of time thank you very much to
our panelists for joining us up here and
thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
