Lewis you may have met me Paul Irish and
we've been hearing a little bit about
rail we just want to spend a moment to
just like focus on it make sure it's all
covered yes and just give give the deep
dive on it yeah and I wanna start out by
just discussing like performance in the
way that we think about it like often
times we consider it's kind of this
linear relationship between like the
faster it is the better it is this is
you know generally true and there's a
lot of academic research and a lot of
like you know metrics and numbers from
industry that validate this say that yes
actually conversion goes up revenue goes
up all these things are great but we
kind of think of it is like this like
straight line right and I'm not really
sure but like you know because at
certain points there's certain things
you know if you're on some experience
and and it's just like terribly slow
you're like mom you know you quit it's
just you have to write it gets a little
bit better and then you're like okay
sure yeah I'll put up with it
pass that even better and like I'm happy
but if we like look at it as like these
like breaking up into these quartiles I
guess maybe the line is a little bit
more like this it might be a little bit
more like we start out and in the front
actually it's just like it's literally
too slow like from from terrible to like
pretty terrible it's just still not
really satisfying the user up at the top
you know very high performance like
changing the page load from I don't know
from being a second long to being like a
half second long like both are pretty
much great and it might be incredibly
hard so the ROI of development there is
less important that middle area this is
like the sweet spot right you know this
is like everything it's good I put in
the right amount of effort users are
happy it's smooth it's chill and I do
feel like a lot of times like we kind of
end up started you know we start
and we kind of want to figure out where
it is that we'd go wrong but we need to
figure out like what what it is and
right now you know this is the to slow
thing yeah which I think yeah you want
to get from too slow to wait what did
you call it chill chill yeah it's a very
usual is a good thing oh yeah of course
yeah
but to slow itself like is I don't like
slow I don't know so I think the
question well I wanted to ask this like
is 50 milliseconds to slow I just kind
of have this question in your mind as we
kind of go through it's like well 15
what well yes I mean you know what's
coming up so true it's true um it's true
50 milliseconds is it too slow well look
at it this way right if you're doing
some page low like you're loading the
Google store or something like 50
milliseconds here is not a big deal
right because you know it's probably
gonna take a second or two there's a lot
of stuff going on but let's say you are
scrolling this store right 15
milliseconds here you're gonna feel that
a lot more you get much more likely to
introduce Jang thank you exactly well I
say you're doing something with WebGL
another 50 milliseconds here you're
gonna feel that one too right what it
really comes down to is that the user
context matters what the users doing is
actually the thing that's gonna define
whether it feels too slow or whether it
feels chill I like it yeah good all
right I think that's kind of the way we
didn't think about this like performance
we felt it on the chrome team we've
optimized you know for things like
benchmarks and Kraken and jermay oh and
octane and that's cool at all but like
not really satisfied with that and we
were thinking about a better way of
modeling this I kind of walked back to
Google's principles and the number one
principle is like focus on the user and
all else will follow anyway that makes
sense
seems like a good great thing like let's
apply this to performance
and so like we thought it might actually
we could flip the question kind of on
its head right right so instead of being
kind of going what's slow or is fifteen
milliseconds long or any of that kind of
stuff instead of that why don't we say
what does the use of fear or as I like
to put it how can we make performance
user focused and I think if we're
talking about users we're talking about
human beings and we have to start with
human perception and I think a lot of
people many of us have seen these
numbers before they're about how delays
are perceived so up to 100 milliseconds
it just feels instant hundred to three
there's a perceptible delay but it's not
too bad up to a second you're still kind
of task focused but it's very
perceptible now and then again it goes
all the way up to ten seconds where you
give up I give up I'm not gonna bother
with this I'm just gonna go and do
something else and I guess there's
probably one more number that we should
kind of toss it into max 60 FPS right or
kind of the flip side is the 16
milliseconds per frame or did achieve 60
it's just kind of like the the jank
thing it's been discussed we'll add that
into the kind of so on the one hand is
like this kind of theory I suppose and
then on the other side you've actually
got the reality of looking at a site and
what goes into it so for example let's
say here I'm going to the chrome dev
summit website and I tap on it and I'm
in the search so I tap on the side stuff
that's a load and we're loading the site
and I maybe scroll a bit that's an
animation fair enough and they tap on
the menu loads me the data they're like
I do a bit of a fling face yeah and then
we go into a section with joffrey and
then and then you call them on whatever
so you started to see these atomic
actions as you're going through as
you're thinking about the things that
you're building you kind of go yeah that
feels like these are the disagree
discreet interactions that are actually
happening so what we then need to do is
tie those two things back together we
know how humans perceive delays and an
emotion and so forth and we know that we
can break down our experiences into
these kind of buckets I suppose yeah so
the four that we have
our response animation idle and load and
conveniently by the power vested in us
by transitions so good so good feels
great
okay I was I I really wanted like that
yeah I do love the flame one yeah at the
classic you know flames so good anyway
so real dive into those responses this
is kind of the you tap on something and
we bring something back on screen from
perception we know that it's something
that feels is than ten hundred
milliseconds is gonna make you feel okay
so there may be that tapping on a button
or tapping on a form control something
in that kind of area we want that to
feel instant to our users
next up animation well we want these to
feel smooth and consistent so this is
you know animations like scrolling or
transitions or gestures or those kind of
things humans are very good at noticing
variation in frame rate not necessarily
what the frame rate is but because the
frame would rate on the web is 60 frames
a second that's what we aim for and we
want consistency there more than
anything yeah idols next Idol is you
know interesting it's kind of like the
absence of an interaction the users not
doing anything right now but the thing
is is they might be and the key thing
here is this is a great time to do work
but the user might start interacting at
any time so you need to be available and
responsive to that so that when they
start to interact you are given a snappy
response right back and so if you break
up your work into 50 50 millisecond
chunks you can basically guarantee that
between you and the browser you're gonna
do a good job of responding to that user
when they start to engage the last one
is load low and I think is the one that
we're all kind of most familiar with
talking about it for years and load
firstly like getting the experience to
the user delivering to them and about a
second to keep that like seamless flow
of thought really nice is kind of what
we're shooting for you yes so that's
kind of like the numbers but we're
developers and we need to kind of like
make this both measurable and like
quantitative things that we can discuss
teams and just make it really action
focused so if we take that stuff and
bring it blend it in we're gonna kind of
walk through the specific items right so
instead it's like the responses is
buttons it's phone controls it's
anything where you kind of changing
state I suppose yeah it's the
opportunity to give the user some
feedback you want that to feel instant
100 milliseconds you could call this is
it simply institution yeah exactly
just response have you ever had that
thing will you tap on something and
you're like did that work and you go for
it a second time and just use that bit
the second time the first one kicks in
and you're like oh mmm see the tap it
like a third time you go I'm gonna wait
this time and they kind of get it just
drives me mad sir that's what this is
talking about very much animation is the
next one as I said scrolling transitions
gestures you know like pinch zoom all
those kind of things you want those to
be stick to finger fast so 16
milliseconds in idle great time in
schedule work chunk it into 50
milliseconds sorry buddy do it and
Leslie load deliver in one second
but in addition to that and it probably
the trickier part is continuing to to
satisfy these response goals and stay
responsive to the user during that load
you know during a page load a lot of
things happening JavaScript run it all
over it's just like a circus and
cacophony of things happening on a
single thread and it's a little tricky
to actually continue to satisfy like
responding to the user when they start
to engage and they want to engage the
it's good for us to see kind of goals
and and so on but the important thing
that we want to reiterate about rail at
this point is essentially that it puts
the user right back in the center of the
performance story the technology and the
technical decisions they will come as
part and parcel of that but putting the
user in the center is exactly right
because that's exactly where we think
they should be yep thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
