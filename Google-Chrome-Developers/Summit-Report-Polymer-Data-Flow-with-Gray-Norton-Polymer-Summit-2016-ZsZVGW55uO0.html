with a gray Norton from the polymer team
aka nor Easter if you are a poly Monde
fan we're using our inside voices a
little bit because we were in the
codelab overflow room where folks are
working hard on some polymer code labs
so great you just got done talking about
data flow in polymer applications I knew
that it is a very important topic a lot
of developers ask us about that all the
time and so for for folks watching who
maybe haven't seen your talk yet it's
our way that you can kind of like
distill some of the the key points from
your talk down for them you know we do
get a lot of questions I mean this is a
big thing especially as more and more
developers are building not only
elements but also apps with Palmer
really the considerations for how you
flow data through a simple reusable
element versus a complex app that has a
lot of structured data are actually very
different and the other thing is that
you know unidirectional data flow is
popularized by the react ecosystem is
really kind of taking the world over and
I think there's some good reasons for
that and so really the main take away
from my talk was that if you're building
an app with polymer especially have any
complexity you really ought to be
thinking seriously about taking a
unidirectional data approach and so for
for folks who have never done anything
like that or or maybe don't know a lot
about it is there a good like library or
some place where they could where they
get kids started to learn about some of
those patterns and how to apply them in
their applications yeah I would actually
recommend starting with Redux it's
actually sort of become arguably that
the dominant library for doing that and
there's actually a really nice polymer
binding for redux called polymer Redux
and you know the to work really well
together it's really easy to get started
and the redeco Doc's by the way are also
great for just conceptually getting what
the whole thing is all about okay cool
so um so if you could have folks go do
like like one thing go go check out one
thing after they're done watching this
video what would that be well I am going
to put some files up on github in the
next few days I did a bunch of
exploration so I took an app that Kevin
Schoff wrote for last year's polymer
summit chat app and it was just the
perfect size it was complex enough to be
interesting but small enough that I
could mess around with a lot of
different
so I found some interesting stuff I'm
gonna put those files up where other
people can look at it and play with them
too
so if you go to you know github.com
slash gray Norton I think I called it
paper I don't remember what I called it
but there's there's only one repo that
could be it
well we'll drop a link in the show notes
with the actual link to that repo
afterwards it's one more question to you
which is so you are the nor'easter poly
maan and I just want to know what is it
like being your own poly maan right and
even captured a few times now how's that
been going
it's a little frightening little
overwhelming at first to be swarmed by
people but I actually I take a little
bit of pride in the fact that I'm hard
to catch people seem to you know have a
hard time successfully scanning me and
you know I take that to me and I'm a I'm
an excellent poly monitor great thank
you so much for being with us today
thank you all for watching we're gonna
keep doing these videos we're gonna keep
reporting live from polymer summit so
definitely stay here on the YouTube
channel I'm Rob again this is gray and
thank you for watching stay with us sue
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
