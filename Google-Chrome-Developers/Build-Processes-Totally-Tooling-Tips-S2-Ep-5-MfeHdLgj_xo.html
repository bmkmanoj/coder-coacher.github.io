important because when you want to be
fast you have to sort of give up the
things that are slowing you down t-shirt
t-shirt the t-shirt slogan love it he
says wearing a yeoman t-shirt product
placement but you are you're completely
right like things like minifying CSS and
your JavaScript optimizing images like
all of that stuff is really laborious if
you have to do it manually so getting in
your build process makes total sense
because just whenever you do a build of
your site it's just done taking care of
them this sort of this sort of fits into
my three tiers of optimization tooling
should I should make a pamphlet I feel
like an advert is about to start playing
that's what it feels like right now it's
a life advice yeah there's a difference
um okay so there's sort of a baseline of
tools that everybody should be doing
these days yeah like hashtag I hate you
know data roaming charges I don't want
anyone shipping a thousand images down
line so the baseline is you should be at
least minifying your styles in your
JavaScript optimizing your images using
compression on the server side same like
async script leverage caching yep we
redirect so stuff that's the baseline
yeah then we've got stuff that you and
I've been exploring a lot lately which
is sort of get fast and stay fast tools
like things that will help you in line
your critical path CSS so you can
improve first render yeah things that
will help you remove I new CSS like a
ton of those those things what I'm
finding myself doing is amusing the bill
process like building out custom little
things where basically i can still
control what the critical path is and
the bill press is just helping me manage
it yeah like I know there are bill pro
steps where it's like it will do
everything for you and it's like magic
and that scares me because they don't
feel like I understand it enough to know
those tools are doing the right thing or
not yeah so I'm still in like the
learning phase but I am using the build
process just to make it easier for me to
explore so this web starter kit there's
also polymer starter kit which is very
similar to web stock except it's got
extra plugins specific to polymer like
vulcanized and things like that but then
yeoman is basically like you can just go
in and it'll ask you what like generator
you want to use what the code where you
can then just generate any style of
project so if you wanted to use
something like angular or react or
whatever new hotness is out there
there's chances are there's a generator
that will give you a build process
already for those things yeah exactly
and like one thing i find so we've got
all the baseline performance
optimization is pretty much covered by
web starter kit and if you're if you're
like one thing i find a lot of agencies
doing is that they'll use um in to
scaffold out their projects and they'll
go into webster birkin to take a look
and say okay well we're interested in
the image optimization parts or the
script minification parts we're just
going to steal like seventy percent of
this file and just like drop it into our
project and that's that's perfectly fine
you know you pick and choose what makes
sense to you so the way that I've
started doing this now and I know you
kind of don't agree with this approach
but are you gonna walk out yeah you
should but it so I have one gulp file
that basically you can do a thing like
require directory and then any
javascript file within that directory it
will basically take the gulp tasks from
those each individual files and then you
can basically use them as you would like
at just one big long code file and the
reason I'm doing that is you can split
it out into like styles and scripts and
images like each section will deal with
this own thing then I can copy those
files into a new project delete any
other ones I don't want and just change
the directories and it's like a really
nice way of getting reuse out my gold
files because before when I have big
ones everything would just become messy
it'd be hard to maintain or understand
like where problems were whereas when
I've got them in multiple files
everything just sort of becomes much
easier to manage and maintain and share
you've been demoted from colleague to
desk occupant hush um that this approach
is actually pretty legit if some if
you're finding that you've got a really
really long go file splitting them out
totally makes sense the reason we
haven't done it in some
boilerplate projects is that you know
for beginners you don't want them to
have to like think about one other thing
and it also gets a little bit trickier
to debug if you've got you know multiple
tasks and different files that depend on
each other not a whole lot more but it's
just another thing you got to think
about yeah like this is where I always
get to a where point of like best
practice versus like ease of use yeah
and I always tend to go for best
practice because like you ever look at
any of the native platforms they always
just say this is the right way of doing
something for this platform or this ID
or library or whatever there's no like
middle ground where you could do
something because easier so no then I'll
say you're wrong but it's totally fair I
remember when we were like a little
while ago you gave me a rundown of one
of your your presentations and it was
one of the bits was on build processes
and you were like everyone should just
use grunt actually co-op is going out
the kid on the block it's kind of cool
everyone should just use cob I actually
there's this new things kind of coming
out called broccoli that's also a build
process then again npm scripts is also
coming so maybe use that yep and in my
head I realized this was at the time
where I just learnt grunt and I was
switching over to go because it seemed
like that that was getting used a lot
yeah and I realized that basically all
of the web tolling ecosystem is
basically a game of thrones where the
minute I fall in love with one is going
to die and be replaced so there's a bit
of me that feels like I should just
never get attached to any of my tools
because sooner or later by getting
attached I'm almost dooming it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
