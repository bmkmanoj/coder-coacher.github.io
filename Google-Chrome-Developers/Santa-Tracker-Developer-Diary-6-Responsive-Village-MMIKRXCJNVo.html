the Santa Tracker dev diary I want to
dissect the village now the village is
the place most people will land when
they come to Santa Tracker it's the cute
interactive scene with houses and stuff
to click on but it's different on mobile
and desktop so let's have a look at that
so on desktop which we loosely define it
having a screen width of greater than
768 pixels
we've got a very desktop experience you
can hover over cards and see what's
inside the houses we've also got a new
today card in the top left and we have
this because this is a very physical
experience it's meant to be Santa's
Village and as stuff gets unlocked as
you go down the page you get more and
more houses to play with however we kind
of know that people do tend to click on
the stuff at the top which is why we
have this new two day card on mobile
here but we have a very different
experience we actually flip it on its
head we actually show the most recent
cards at the top what's interesting and
this is actually the same DOM so these
pop-up cards here that you see are
actually the same elements over here but
being displayed in a different way
they're in a flex box in both cases but
on desktop they're positioned very
absolutely they're very specifically
over the houses on mobile we give that
up and we just placed them in a grid we
actually reversed them which is kind of
cool so the same Dom elements if we have
a look here have we use a CSS variable
called release order and on tablet mode
which you see here and if they have a
link which means if they're open we
actually use the order attribute and the
order attribute is using a flex box to
rearrange elements so these elements on
the left here actually ordered top-down
but we leveraged flex box to rearrange
them so that the first one that's open
or the most recent one that's open is at
the top so that's pretty cool so despite
the differences in the card layout the
villages do have some similarities the
header here is the same the Pegman here
which is the maps dive game we have is
actually the same in both environments
all the we position him slightly
differently so this code here controls
whether we have the Easter eggs at the
bottom of the page and so you can see
here that this template which is a
polymer feature controls whether we have
the background Easter eggs there's quite
a long list here as you can see the way
this works is we use the iron media
query it sets the is seen village to
true or false based on whether this
query is true so if it's true we've got
a big size we want to create all these
nodes when this might happen in the real
world is let's say you've got a tablet
and if you
have tablet in landscape mode and then
rotate it these elements will now be
created your tablets change size and now
we have a big wide village and we want
to show the full experience
however when you rotate back
what polymer will do by default is keep
those dalam elements around it will just
hide them now this is sometimes
desirable right like these elements
might take a lot to create there's a bit
of a cost in that but for us we don't
want that for us the cost in these
elements is not really their creation on
the page their memory cost but often
that they'll do things and we actually
want to leverage the natural life cycle
methods of the platform the attach and
detach methods to actually control those
elements behavior let's have a look at
that
the way polymer does that is through
this Reese temp attribute and what that
means is that when this value becomes
false these elements will properly be
removed from the page by default as I
said they'll just be made display:none
why do we do that for us this is really
important because we try to leverage the
natural lifecycle methods of the
platform in our example here we've got
the snowmobile and the snowmobile is a
little thing you click on that zooms
left and right it's quite cute but it
does a bit of work on attached and
detached and rather than having to
awkwardly plumb through some like oh
you're on the page and not on the page
we can actually use the natural methods
these attached and detached methods
which are built-in they're part of the
platform although in the platform
they're called
connected callback and disconnected
callback we can leverage these methods
to do things we actually know therefore
that the elements on the page or not on
the page and that's very nice but we
actually take this to the extreme so in
a previous episode of the series I
talked about lazy pages now lazy pages
is an element that will create elements
as we need them so none of these
elements are on the page to start with
and what happens is when you navigate to
them we create them that makes a lot of
sense in previous years these elements
actually stuck around on the page even
after you were done with them and that's
fine but it causes a few problems we had
a lot of memory issues because basically
sand is a really complicated site if you
went to a bunch of scenes what would
often happen is that your browser would
really get bogged down I mean sound is
already pretty complicated I'm not gonna
lie to you but it will get really bogged
down because all these scenes you went
to the airport you went at the press
page you into a few other scenes your
browser would really be feeling it so
what we do now is we actually remove
these elements from the page what the
tricky parts there are is we need to
make sure that we're actually cleaning
up properly and in JavaScript and HTML
this is actually quite high
odd so if we look at a scene here let's
look at our Elvis key scene
I'll show off the game it's pretty cute
you can ski down the mountain here and
eventually you run into a tree however
we need to make sure that we clean up
properly so in this case this game is
adding a few global listeners and that's
tricky right because we need to make
sure that we remove them when we're done
so we wrap the attach and detach methods
and on show and on hide here which you
can see and so a good way to think about
this is whenever you add an add a
listener make sure you're adding an
equivalent cleanup handle or somewhere
else and so for us we add things like
the resize handler which you removed on
the bottom we also have a tick interval
if we removed on the bottom and we also
have a requestanimationframe now in
requestanimationframe this callback we
don't register an additional one now as
part of this Raph we actually check to
see if we're on the page and if we're on
the page we keep doing more rafts and if
not then we stop which is a pretty
natural way to clean up when you're done
so as part of this we make Santa Tracker
more stable and more reliable which is
great so these were our learnings from
building a responsive village inside
soundtracker and how they apply to the
site as a whole and while obviously
Santa tracker is a hugely complicated
example right we've got lots of
animations and effects and stuff we want
to clean up so it's not happening while
you're browsing the site hopefully
you'll take away something for your own
sites any single page application that
loads content dynamically might need to
clean up rather than keeping the Dom
around thanks for watching I'll see you
next time you can subscribe to the
Google Chrome developer channel down
here we'll check out some other great
videos along here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
