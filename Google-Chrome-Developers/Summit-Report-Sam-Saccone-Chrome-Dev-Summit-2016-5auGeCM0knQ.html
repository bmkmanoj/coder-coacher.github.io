coming at you live from the chrome dev
summit we are here at the SF jazz center
we're just sort of lurking in the stairs
i'm joined by sam saucony Sam you just
gave a talk on application performance
and in particular like load time and
things like that time to interactive for
folks who haven't seen the talk yet what
are some of the sort of the troubling
hot spots that you saw in sort of your
forensic analysis of apps and how they
could you know do time to interact it
better good question Rob I think that a
lot of websites just ship a lot of
JavaScript today and that JavaScript
that they're shipping just takes up so
much time on the main thread on a phone
that it basically locks out the page
from being interactive I mean that
paired with the amount of resources that
people are loading on the page we're
talking about web pages that load super
slow for most users now I know one of
the things that people have been kind of
raving about potentially is like H to
push the HD push is going to like save
the world and things like that and I
know you looked into that as well so
what were your findings related to HT
push and how it affects performance yeah
I found that a well HD Bush is very
useful for getting resources to the
browser faster but it's not like a
golden bullet for performance what works
really well is actually link rel preload
think of link rel preload as a like the
first step in switching to H to push
link rel preload lets you download
resources faster than their discovered
so like with polymer HTML imports it
lets you put the dependent resources way
up in the discovery tree so that the
browser's shoots off those requests so
that when they're finally discovered
it's already there on the browser so
it's great now for someone who maybe
doesn't know much about preload yeah is
there like a resource someplace where
you know where they can go to learn more
about that yeah so if you just type that
into Google the first three results are
all excellent so there's a w3 spec
article and then there's a few blog
posts one on smashing mag that are super
great and explain all the details and
how you can get a big win out of them
alright right on Sam thank you so much

done so yet definitely catch Sam's talk
