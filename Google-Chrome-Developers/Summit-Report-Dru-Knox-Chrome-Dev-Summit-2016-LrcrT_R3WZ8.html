bidelman here at chrome dev summit 2016
just starting the afternoon sessions i'm
here with drew knocks pm and all things
web platform is my understanding is a
little bold statement p.m. on several
things web platform several very
important things and speaking of
important you gave a great talk on
client side storage and all things that
chrome is doing for that can you give us
a little overview what you talked about
so the main thing i was trying to say in
the talk was that offline is really
important and it's something that we've
talked a lot about here at chrome dev
summit but it's really also a very
effective way to use caching to improve
your loading performance so client
storage is not just offline it's also a
massive performance win that's kind of
the crux of the talk and don't forget
about things like browser caching all
these things do still apply even with
all these really amazing api's you
talked a little bit about some cool
stuff that i'm really excited about
which is promises for index database new
filewriter api can you talk a little bit
about those yeah so you see a lot of
libraries available these days that
offer promise wrappers for index DB so
it's clearly something people really
want unfortunately it's kind of complex
right like promises don't map directly
to transactions very well so we're still
hammering out the details but it's an
open area of exploration and something
we're hoping we're coming sooner rather
than later you're working on the spec
for that writable files on the other
hand it's something pretty completely
new I mean it's something that people
have kicked around for a long time I
know it's one of the main reasons people
use electron it's very popular there the
idea of being that instead of having to
upload and download files all the time
which is not a great user experience
it's not super super quick and seamless
instead we want to give sites the
ability to have persistent handle two
files on the user's native device so
it's not sandbox and this allows you to
on repeat visits to the site they can
just open up that file and immediately
read contents out of it you get use
cases like having a folder that play
music or Spotify web app or something
can monitor and upload files from your
collection or having a most recently
used list for
text editor or photo editor something
like that it's like we're the last
endeavors for pwas is having like a
writable file system so one last
question before we wrap it up here I
understand your grandmother was watching
your presentation did she have anything
to say about it she did yeah so her
exact quotes were I believe bless his
soul so that was those great hopefully
that's a positive bless his soul not a
bless his soul and then I'm very proud
of my grandson so everyone was good they
laughed at my jokes and yeah she was
proud awesome okay with that will sign
off right now from chrome dev summit
