cute thing where they install games on
their phone and then four weeks after
they keep getting notification saying
that their village is under attack can
you do that on the web now you can now
you can't how basically what happens is
you register your service worker you
then ask it to subscribe these two push
message it shows a little dialog saying
do you want to allow this to happen yes
or no so hopefully then the kids won't
actually enable this at that point but
if they do then that point you'll get a
special token that is for that user send
that to your server keep it when you
want to trigger a push notification you
can then use that endpoint send it a
specific request and that will basically
wake up the service worker on that
user's device and go cool there's a push
message what do you want to do about it
at that point you can just show a
notification you can go back to the
server and say hey what was this for you
show your notification and then you can
respond to click events nice so that's
literally like the whole end-to-end flow
start to finish so can push
notifications can you with the push API
can they show me like images can I
include contents in there what can look
like the title title text you can do
body text you can have an image to the
side of the notification and you can
also do buttons now as well so you can
actually add like two buttons that you
can so I can show an image saying that
my you know showing that my village is
on fire but also a button to extinguish
the fire pause watch it burn watch it
burn it's also interesting because now
we're looking at doing native
notifications for Mac which is really
nice because it means that we get rid of
our own notification like Center thing
we're now going back into like native
notifications and they're trays on
whatever else goes with it and push
notifications are not a chrome only
thing right no so they're in Chrome and
Firefox at the moment I think other
browser vendors once they start doing
serviceworker they can start looking at
it as well sweet there is some bad stuff
we have chrome and says we have we use
GCM so we have some proprietary bits
what is it what is GCM key
good point Google Cloud messaging okay
I've been drinking the kool-aid for too
long so there's some proprietary bits
EFT for that but again there's new specs
that are coming up that will wipe all of
that out so then because the moment you
have to go into google developer console
you have to register for an api key and
yeah all that's gonna go away so you
just have one api one set way of doing
this that all the browser vendors can
then take and use it's gonna be so much
better if i'm correct we have a code lab
on push notifications as well yes people
can check out which is well worth doing
because that one is regularly kept up to
date I think my old blog post at this
point is probably seen better days so
basically you're saying don't visit your
blog under any circumstances that's just
a blanket rule for all of my content but
yes that's what I'm saying but yeah
there is a blog post and it will step
you through all the guides and it also
goes through GCM and how to set all that
stuff up so yeah go check them out oh
and if someone wants to like stimulate
push notifications dev tools lets you do
this I think yes it does mmm how is that
the bell like as the bell icon yes and
you can do that from service or control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
