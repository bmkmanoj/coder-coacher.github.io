Jake talk about performance and
streaming and stuff and I wanted to talk
about the bit that happens after that
the bit where you have your UI elements
and before I get into it I kind of
wanted to put that into a little bit of
context when we talked about performance
historically on our team last year year
and a half we've talked about a thing
called rail and rail stands for response
animation idle and load and it's a way
of thinking about performance that puts
the user in the middle and lets us
figure out what they expect from things
so for example if you tap on a screen
you expect something to be coming back
on screen in under a tenth of a second
if you scroll or there's a transition
that's an animation and we want that at
60 frames a second idle is a bit of a
funny one but the general idea is that
you should do work when the user isn't
interacting and when there's opportunity
to do so when the main thread has some
time and we do those in 50 millisecond
chunks so we can keep responding to
users and loading you want to keep the
user on their train of thought and so
you've got about a second to get
something up on screen whether that's
from a cache for the network now when we
talk about rail this is the kind of
world view then I think many of us have
today we kind of go yeah responses ok
yeah we don't need to be lucky that's
fair enough it's kind of important
scrolling animation it definitely heard
that's a thing and that's something I
want to make sure is good idle yeah sure
seems good load load yes whoo back in
the safe ok load yeah man if I can
catenate all that good stuff
but here's the thing this is kind of
where we're thinking of being on
people's home screens and a closer look
at that home screen raises an
interesting question which of these is
the progressive one up which of these is
the native web app the truth is users
don't care what they care about is that
the thing that they tap on works really
well and they would never say something
oh wow it skipped things there you go
back would go
rewind okay nobody ever gonna say this
and if they did it was something ice
that up looks like native I hope it
behaves like it there you go they expect
it to behave like a native app they
expect your stuff to run well I want to
say behaves there we go
hello behaves for me is like performance
and it's about does it behave as we
expect is it do the things that you know
and interact with it just do the right
things right since that's the case I
think we can reevaluate rail to look
more like back bad clicker more like
this the response part of rail well we
expect our responses to be instant like
every time instant so that's just now
more important animations yep they're
down there and there we go they're going
up there because we expect again we
expect instant transitions we expect you
know scrolling to be super smooth idle
well now if we're doing more work to
make responses and animations good idle
is something we're gonna have to be more
tactical about we're gonna have to do
some work when the user isn't and we
have things like requests idle callback
for that so idle just went up good news
though I think if you're expecting
somebody to add you to home screen and
run your stuff lots of times hopefully
you're gonna have a serviceworker
hopefully you're gonna be running from a
cache and therefore I think load drops
down to here I don't think it's
unimportant don't get me wrong you still
got to do a good job to get that first
load there but I think over time I think
that's what we're talking about so if
you're being home screen minded I think
it looks more like this and I think if
you think about the the native apps that
you run you have a similar expectation
you don't ever sit there thinking about
well this APK took a long time you know
when you're using it for the 50th time
you're thinking more about how this
actually behaves whether it's got the
features you want and so on so with that
in mind I wanted to talk about three
individual components but they give me
an excuse to talk about about a bunch of
other things and I can explain I suppose
the way I categorize my components from
deterministic we know up front we can
hard code the values
those animations and interactions
through something that's a little bit
less known upfront all the way through
to something where we've got no idea
about how it's going to behave until
somebody actually clicks on the thing or
we have a little bit of an idea but not
much so those three components are a
side nav some swipeable cards and then
expand and collapse view let's jump
straight into the side navigation which
I think most of us I've seen before seen
these you ever seen these quite a lot
so what although for each one of these
I'll explain the theory of how I would
approach them to maintain performance
and to kind of be performance minded I
will be leaving probably some glaring
omissions in the area of accessibility
but just as well
Bob Dodds coming on next and he's going
to talk about accessibility oh it all
fits together wonderfully anyway the
theory for the side nav what we're gonna
do is we're gonna pop on a containing
element over the top of all our content
into which we can place a
semi-transparent
black a background to obscure our
content and then we're gonna have this
contents bit with our actual side nav in
it which will slide in from the side
like so
so the CSS for something like that for
that containing element it's gonna be
positioned fixed left:0 top:0 width and
height 1% some people like to do write 0
bottom 0 that's fine
works just as well overflow:hidden
because we don't want any scroll bars
but the pointer events one is a bit of
an interesting side step that I want to
take it lets me talk about something
that's kind of like a primed element so
these are elements where you you want
that thing to be ready to go and the
sign now is one of those because when a
user taps on the button they expect the
side nav to just come throughout right
so the general idea behind a primed
element for me is that it's something
that could be activated at any time okay
like a side nav yeah it probably fits
that bill and if you were to toggle its
visibility it would take more than 100
milliseconds as in because they're
probably at a tap a button and you
ray'll tells you you've got 100
milliseconds to respond if you take
longer than that it's going to feel
lucky so these are my sort of two
criteria as I say I'm leaving a glaring
omission where's the regards
accessibility so hold on to your hats
for that bit coming next but all the
same we have around on I think this is a
primed element I think it fits and as
such we can take a couple of shortcuts
one of which is we're going to promote
the content bit to its own layer and if
you're not familiar with layer promotion
the idea is you want to separate out an
element from the rest of the page so
that when you paint it or move it around
you don't affect any other element on
the page it's the same kind of deal is
you know if you are not packaged
whatever you create a layer and you can
mess with the pixels in it and you don't
mess with anything else now the easiest
way to do that today to create one of
these layers called a compositor layer
is to use will change transform so if
you imagine the simplest possible page
with a photo of bald idiot and a nice
guy and you put will change onto said
image now you can move it around with a
transform and you can see that it's kind
of separate from the page obviously this
isn't happening in real time but it's
it's the idea of separating these things
out now you may be sitting there
thinking that seems like a great idea
star will change transform burn that
from your mind okay if I'm not clear
don't do it the reason you don't wanna
do it is twofold
firstly you'll want to keep your memory
usage down especially on a mobile device
if you create layers you're gonna use
memory you're gonna have management
you're gonna have textures on the GPU
all that kind of stuff so you want to do
this as needed now with the primed
element I'm gonna make the argument that
you probably want to do something like
the will change in your CSS but in other
cases where it's not known until you
start interacting you probably do the
will change in your JavaScript the other
reason is you want to keep your time in
compositing to a minimum compositing is
where we take all those layers and we
squish it back together and put the
pixels up on screen now of course if you
made lots of layers that's a lot of
depth sorting it's a lot of management
and it's a lot of putting back together
that takes time so you want to be
tactical about this so we've got our
promoted layer and as you can see in the
CSS I'm going to put will change
transform on it like so and then come
back then yeah I'm going to transform
the contents off to the left by a oddly
specific 102 percent and if you're
curious about that is because I've got a
shadow and I just do an extra couple of
percent to hide it cheating but that's
programming you know it's just cheating
right sometimes and I'm a cheat when it
comes to programming I'm very very not
otherwise especially not when playing
little games with my kids I'm very fair
never cheap anyway eventually the user
is going to tap on a button and that's
going to show the side nav which in this
case is just going to add a class in
that class is going to remove that - 102
percent fairly straightforward and we
get something like this where it slides
in from the side that semi-transparent
black black background is the same kind
of deal here we're going to do a will
change of opacity from an opacity value
of 0 to an opacity value of 1 and
getting rid of it like so it's just
going to be the same in Reverse we're
just going to remove that class
everything goes back it's great and we
could just do that but it's like hide
side nav which I put on the containing
element so if you click anywhere I'm
gonna hide the side nav which is a bit
bad if you actually click on something
in the side nav so the way to get around
that is to just add an extra handler for
that particular situation which cancels
the click which is just a stopped
propagation so I'm kind of canceling the
click and it works out really well in
fact so well this is what it looks like
in reality this is one that Surma and I
built this is actually running on a
nexus 5x and you can see you know slide
out slide in I actually added a bit of
drag thing to it which you can see if
you want to afterwards when you take a
profile of this in the dev tools
timeline which is kind of what you want
to be doing with all your UI elements I
have the side nav sliding in and sliding
out which doesn't look very big so let's
zoom in you can see that green chunk is
the frames per second and we're hitting
a nice comfy 60 frames a second on our
Nexus 5x and below it is the amount of
work
frame which is pretty low because we're
not doing much we're just using
transform changes if you're interested
in seeing that actually being built for
real there's the TL DW and is also a
live stream which was about an hour long
with me and Surma where we built the
side nav books and everything it was
great but you can catch that if you if
you haven't seen it so let's move on
since we've done the essentially done
the fully deterministic - hundred and
two percent - nothing we can move on to
this swipeable card which is a little
more interactive a little more dynamic
so that's this one you've seen it
probably some that Google now you know
just ours and it slides up to take its
place the theory here is again we want
to promote to a layer for the thing
that's being interacted with but we want
to do that on demand we don't want to do
this one ahead of time because if you
had a lot of cards that's a lot of
layers and a lot of memory usage not a
good idea we also want to use transform
and opacity as well because we're going
to transform this thing off to the side
and from a kind of behavioral point of
view if we want it to fade out because
that gives the idea of being dismissed
it's it kind of something the user would
expect now at this point I want to take
a little bit of a detour and talk about
kind of game loopy stuff which is
something that any game developer would
be like yeah and it's extremely useful
in this situation what we want to do in
these kind of cases is decouple our
input which can happen fairly
sporadically and whatever from the
actual rendering and drawing you bit we
should expect from a game because your
character stood there you don't want to
you know you want the kind of game to
keep moving even when you're not moving
the character right same kind of thing
we want this animation to keep going
even when we're not actually doing touch
events for example and the way we do
that is we call requestanimationframe
for every frame of the interaction and
we'll give it our update function which
you know the nice side effect gives us a
function that we can just call to be
like just draw it even when there's
nothing else going on now we've got a
touch move at the start of the frame
well that's okay we'll just use it will
distort its value and we'll pick it up
in the requestanimationframe if it comes
in a little bit late
or it doesn't come in at all no big deal
we'll just use the last known good value
if by some weird weird chance we
actually got two or more well again
we're not doing work per input event
we're the only going to do it once per
frame and we're just going to use the
last known good value that's good so
this is a model that you probably want
to adopt if you haven't already for this
kind of work now we get to the actually
to adding the event listeners and fair
enough I'm going to share them between
Mouse and touch I think
pointer events might help a little bit
here but you know I've got this
so touchstart touchmove touchend so on
and as a side note the adding of these
touch handlers to the document is bad
generally speaking and the reason it's
bad is this really you have on the
compositor thread which gets the user
touch it's the one that actually is told
about the interaction first and by
default it would do something like
scrolling it would just move the page up
and down but we registered a touch move
and that involves the main thread and if
the main thread was busy or our touch
move just ran for a long time for some
reason then eventually to come back and
the frame will be shipped but in between
that we've blocked the user oops so
that's not as good and there is a way
around this it's new as of I believe
chrome 51 and it's in opera and Firefox
it's in development according to Chrome
status same with WebKit but this is
encyclopedia large obviously and I'm not
sure about age I can check with the
folks on that team however what we do is
we add this passive true to the event
listener one that says is I won't call
prevent default I'm not going to do it
so don't worry about waiting on me in
order to do the thing you're gonna do
still give me the events and give me the
information but I'm not going to prevent
default okay and then the browser goes
cool I won't block then I'll just get on
with it that's great so anyway back to
where we were
we have our event listeners and we
talked about what they are going to do
for example we have this card it's in
the start exposition so what we'll do is
tapped on it we'll go to our on start
which is gonna basically ask for the
position which lie to be paychecks or
the first touch events page X and then
we'll add will change on it dynamically
which will give us a bit of a hit
because we have to create the layer and
everything but it's probably gonna be ok
probably now you actually move your
finger across and we have to category in
what's the new position which is fairly
straightforward it's the same kind of
deal we just tracked the page X or the
first touch events page X and since we
know where we were and where we are we
can figure out what the translation
should be such that in our update
function we can say if you're dragging
the card your translation is the current
minus the start and what we will do is
we will apply a transform with that
value great stuff that's going to work
we're gonna be able to slide across we
can change the opacity and the same in
the same kind of way but we now need to
think about the next part which is I'm
kind of dismissing the card right or I
don't go far enough
and it comes back to the middle so kind
of this is the behavioral bit so if we
consider a normalized distance so it's
at 0 if it was out to the side we could
say that's position 1 or back in the
other way that's also position 1 all we
can do is we can come to throat these
thresholds I put them in 0.35 when I was
doing this you could pick naught point 3
6 or something else entirely it's very
exciting
what will I choose today who knows
that's web dev so I put an all point
three five and if you don't know Pratt's
not point three five I'm going to slide
back to the middle if you do go past not
point three five I'm going to dismiss
the card fair enough okay so that's in
the the on end like so oh yeah threshold
card width times by not 0.35 and it's is
this is this target x value which we're
going to come on to in a moment it's
defaulting to zero if you go past the
threshold we're going to choose either
the card width or - card with depending
on which direction you were going okay
and we can pick that up in the the else
here where we say translate x plus
equals target X minus translate X all
over four and if you've been around for
a while
and it done this kind of work you
probably recognize this if you haven't
very exciting little one-liner that is
incredibly helpful when you want to do
what I call the easiest easing in the
world or easy inning easy takes always
takes this form okay it's value plus
equals target - value all over strength
and I genuinely have made other
developers like memorize that because
it's incredibly helpful let me show you
what I mean worked example let's say you
want to get this box from zero to a
hundred and you basically target - value
so it's 100 - zero all over strength
which is four we'll move it 25 pixels
cool on the next iteration it's a
hundred minus 25 which is 75 all over
the strength which is four that's 18
point seven five and as you build it up
you're gonna see that it's gonna slow
down because there's a nice kind of
slowdown easing feel for this so that
your box would go mmm sound effects not
included okay
so that's this one line but it's an
incredibly helpful line it's either than
that users back to zero which can ease
us to the card dismissal point now we
need to detect doneness there's no
better word for what we're doing here is
this animation done can I say that we're
finished with this okay the way we do
that is well it's either you go there
and back to the middle fair enough
in which case we can just say are you
nearly at the start if so yeah you're
probably done I'll work that'll get us
most of the way there if you are just
reset the target allow the user to
interact again other one is basically
you slide you've done the slide out to
the side like so and we also know that
we're gonna fade out the card so I mean
this is pretty cheeky but we can just
ask is the opacity really really low if
it is it's nearly invisible if it's
nearly invisible it's going it's going
going gone and in fact gone so much that
we're going to remove it from the Dom
with remove child like so now that will
cause all the other cards to jump up
immediately because the Dom yeah we took
our element until the other ones went
full cool there's some space let's take
it which we don't want we want them to
animate we have this function that says
is what there's
and it looks like this you know that
kind of slide up there you go that's the
thing you want so what we do is in our
animator the cards into position what
we're gonna do is we're just gonna ask
for the current card and we're gonna
step through all the remaining ones like
so and we're just going to basically
push them down straight down by a cards
height so you go back down to where you
were
please just ignore the fact that we just
removed a card you stay where you are
and then what we're gonna do is we're
going to wait a frame for that to take
hold because styles will run after the
end of our JavaScript cool and then what
we'll do is we'll switch on a transition
on transforms and we'll get rid of it
and that'll cause all the cars to go and
that'll look great cool and then when
we're done we can reset the target and
in reality this is what it looks like
this is another one that server and I
built again it took an hour there were
bugs weird so you go slide swipe it's
great if you have two timeline and you
were to take a recording of that again
zoom in and it's actually in two parts
this one the left-hand bit is the car
dismiss what are you doing slides don't
do that to me I maybe it's me and Jake
maybe maybe we just there's something
bad going on I'm blaming Jake it was all
fine until Jake came on stage and
everything broke for him interesting
coincidence
yes so the car dismissal that's right
there and then there's the other bit
here which is sliding the card and you
see there's a little dip at the start
and that's because that layer promotion
of there's a bit of layer promotion but
the kind of setting up of those card
animations did cost us a little bit so
if you're interested in nine you want to
see that one built what are you doing
seriously okay if you want to see that
one built there's a TL DW there's an
hour-long livestream that you can catch
of that one as well
so I football cards right we can move on
areas I'm just gonna stand around here
okay the exponent collapse is the final
one and it's the one that is the kind of
fully dynamic one because you could pick
any of those cards they could be
anywhere on screen and okay in this case
in the mobile case they might do a full
screen takeover but they might not they
might just expand a little bit or
something like that
we don't really know ahead of time we
can't hard-code those values and if we
try it's gonna be pretty horrible so how
do we handle this situation well the
theory for this one is gonna be a little
more involved but that's fun when I get
something like this from a designer or I
do it myself I kind of watch it over and
over and over again it's a thrilling few
minutes but it's a useful few minutes
because it'll as you kind of watch
something over and over again your brain
starts to notice the patterns and the
patterns here are in this case I think
that thing is is getting bigger and it's
moving yes there's the pink head a bit
that's fading in but predominately this
is about a movement it's getting wider
and taller and it's moving and therefore
I would normally go wow that feels like
a width height left in top moment great
that's probably what I would animate
except that that would be bad and the
reason it would be bad is that in every
browser you would trigger layout with a
purple chunk at the top there paint and
composite layout is basically where the
browser says where is every element it's
basically a geometric process where is
the remote element every element what is
its size and so on
paint is where we fill in pixels and
compositing is where we put the page
back together all those layers now if
you've got to do that for every single
frame when you might have a reasonable
size that Dom you're in trouble you
don't want to be able to do under have
to do this work on every single frame
chances of getting 60 frames a second
slim to none you may have noticed that I
use transforms an awful lot and the
reason it is their profile is different
for an element that's got its own
compositor layer changing a transform is
not going to trigger layout and it's not
going to trigger paint it should only
trigger compositing which is something
that we can probably get done
comfortably at 60 frames a second so
this then changes the question to look
like this can we do that effect with
transforms can we remap this slow-mo can
we do that with a transform well to me
that looks like a scale and it looks
like a translation cool my approach is
called flip all right so that's the
first last invert and play because there
aren't enough acronyms okay so I'm
adding another one
cool but it's an extremely useful way to
think about the animation what we want
to do is we want to essentially ask the
question at room type where is the
element that I'm interacting with so we
record its first position on screen and
we do that with something like get
bounding client rect which is fun to say
and has been around since ie for lint
and it will tell you in relation to the
viewport where this element is its left
its height its top its right its bottom
all the stuff that we need to know know
what we can do is we can actually snap
the element in question out to its final
position I'm doing this for the class we
could have manipulate the Styles you
could do whatever you need to do so now
our card is going to be in its last
position like so and we can call get
bounding client rect a second time so
now we know where you were now now we
know where you're gonna be that's cool
that means we can start to kind of
figure out our transforms that we might
need dynamically now there is a word of
warning here going from first to last is
going to trigger styles and layout and
the reason it's going to trigger styles
and layout is because the second gets
bounding client rect came after some
style mutation we said here's a new
class for you or here's some style
changes and then we asked for how wide
and how high and where are you on screen
and the browser goes I don't know you
just moved everything hang on let me go
and figure it out and I'll come back
with an answer and that's exactly what
happens so you got to bear in mind that
there's the from this first class I mean
you might be sitting there going hang on
a minute I'm sure you said trigger in
layout was bad and I did but the key is
here we're not going to do it on every
single frame there are two things we
need to bear in mind one we're going to
do it once at the start as a set up cost
secondly we have rail which is going to
be our friend here bear in mind the user
tapped on a card to get the animation
therefore in rail terms there here we
have a tenth of a second in which to
respond we have a tenth of a second in
which we can do some work and believe me
a tenth of a second is actually quite a
long time especially when it comes to
this kind of work it's great we should
use it and we do so when it comes to
rail and flip you can typically afford
to do a single styles and layout pass
then seriously one
but that's cool that's often enough and
in terms of flip that's a good set up
time you'll still need it to complete in
less than 100 milliseconds so you kind
of have to be aware of how big the DOM
is and if you're able to use something
like CSS containment to limit the scope
of layout and paint you should
definitely do that
and that's really useful however we knew
where we work that was first we know
where we are that's last and now we can
transform what we'll do is we'll just
basically apply an inverse transform to
take us back to here we can do that so
first - left you know blah blah blah do
that with a scale apply a transform that
uses those values so at this point we've
done first last an invert and it's like
this so if I was the top on the card
Ready Steady Go there you go from the
users point of view nothing happened
what's really happening is this going
first last and then we're inverting and
it feels like a lot of setup cost and it
kind of is but it gives us a huge
advantage because what we can do now is
switch on transition on transforms and
remove that transform and our card will
just go we didn't know where it was bit
the stuff we didn't hard code it we just
said where are you going where are you
now I'll figure out the transform and
I'll apply it for you we've just most a
remaps something there was width height
left and top which wouldn't have run at
60 frames a second do something that
definitely will hopefully all being well
caveat so because there's always those
if you've got some scale changes that
are being applied they something like
text let's say you're doing something
flipped like when you got something with
text inside that might get squashed or
stretched so you might need to move the
content to a sibling element so that
it's not affected and then just have
faded in or something like that but a
sleight-of-hand you might need to do
that bit of gymnastics but it's well
worth it like I said the first to last
does involve forcing Styles and layout
so you have to be careful with that but
this is what it looks like in reality
there this is a little kind of expanded
collapse e-card thing which you know
that's running on our Nexus 5x and this
screen doesn't make a look at like it's
60 frames a second but it is
and I can prove it because I've got
timelines that show it and you can see
it I'll show you it's great it's also
responsive design friendly like I said
we're going to ask at room time what the
first position is and what the last
position is we don't we don't hard-code
those values which means the same
animation on desktop looks like this
different position different sizes but
still the same stuff and this is what it
looks like in timeline will zoom in
again to the top bit and you see the dip
at the start and you see there's a red
markers that's they've tools telling you
your frames per second dipped below the
comfortable point of 60 but we know that
that was the setup of flipped that was
the first lesson invert which on a nexus
5x on this case was about 40
milliseconds after that that is a steady
60 frames a second afterwards tremendous
cool I get to call this one a day in a
moment some closing thoughts you've
noticed probably that I use will change
and I would suggest that you start doing
that if you haven't already for elements
that you intend to animate you need to
decide is this thing primed if so I'm
gonna probably put the will change into
my CSS if not I need to do it on demand
probably via JavaScript but you want to
use it sparingly don't go overboard
transform and opacity are your best
friends when it comes to UI elements
running performant ly I hope in the
future to be able to say that you can
get away with a lot more and actually we
are heading for that world with things
like Jeep GPU rasterization CSS
containment lots of really good things
that might help us limit the work and I
mean that we can do more but for today
for the cross browser story I would
suggest that you stick here if you find
yourself in the kind of dynamic and then
something like flip where you can remap
expensive properties calculate your
transforms at runtime is very useful now
follow that's news to you and you've
never come across like layout recalc
style or anything here are some links
inbound phones out don't worry you can
get the slides afterwards as well other
phones went down don't care anymore
there's the Google web fundamentals
render performance section complete with
Udacity course which will take you
through the same kind of content
very useful to get up to speed
secondarily if you want the source code
for those elements I showed you can get
that at the supercharge do I wish to
take you to the github repo if you want
to see me and Surma where sermo
basically spends an hour interrupting me
and I try and code it's like real life
there are bugs as well it's just it's
every time I don't when it's scary but
brilliant and there's a TL DW which is
like five minutes if you ever got that
on that time right I need to shut up and
move on but before I do I just want to
say this again we are hopefully going to
be here this is the first time we've
been invited to people's home screens
that is incredibly exciting but it's
also a huge responsibility
we need to act like we deserve to be
there and that means taking a user
interface work super seriously the web
is ready for us to do that we can do
that today with the tech I've shown that
you can I hope that you go and give it a
try and with that I'll say thank you
very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
