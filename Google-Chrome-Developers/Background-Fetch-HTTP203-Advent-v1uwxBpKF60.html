hey this Christmas it's Christmas we'll
pick 12 subjects that were excited about
for 2018 and like we can quiz each other
about them I got two minutes
oh all right okay my subject for the two
minutes is background fetch Oh backward
fetch didn't we have it before no what
was it we had the thing that we had
before
oh you're thinking a background sync
right background sync service worker
event that would happen next time you
had connectivity okay and you can do
sort of whatever you want today okay
it's not that
what does background fetch now that's
that's a very open-ended question which
you could have said what is the use case
for a background fetch right so think
about a long download that's going to
you know maybe to use a video yeah good
one right and that could take hours days
we don't want the browser to be like it
could take days remember I mean videos
get big Mobile day air is slow or you
could be offline for a while and we
don't want the the mobile to the browser
to have to be awake for that whole thing
okay so basically would be outsourcing
the fetch thing to the operating system
rather than yes on desktop though as
well yes is the plan but probably more
well first yes because also this that
makes more sense
okay so we do we have an origin trial or
something there's something in canary
now okay it's very good and it means we
don't actually need user permission to
do this because you can already start to
hang loads without user permission
that's true
the idea is to make sure it's fully
visible all the time
so you can see like the progress of the
download you can give it an icon give it
a title so the users aware that it's
happening they can cancel it okay but
like do it can I put like a 20 gig video
into cache API now yes if you have
persistent data you have as much space
as you can eat right you two need to ask
for that that doesn't require a
permission okay but a lot of data
there's a lot of data but people like
movies right and you don't want you
don't want them disappearing too
significant related right people do like
movies just love it to them people
we build big buildings where we show
them in these so we are in Canary any
other browser signals positive signals
from a couple of browsers but it's just
Chrome for now and that'll be 2018 that
was two minutes our spot on okay now
what's a worklet worklet is like the
worker like a potentially off threat
thing yes but it's more like wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
