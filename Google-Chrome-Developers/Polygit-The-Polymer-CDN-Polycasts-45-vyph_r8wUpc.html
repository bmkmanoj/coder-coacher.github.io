back to the show as we've been working
on polymer one of the probably biggest
requests that comes in from developers
is when are we gonna get a CDN for
polymer and for web components because
it's kind of a pain in the butt every
time you went to sort of like hack on an
idea and you've got to use bower and
install a bunch of packages and wait for
everything to download just so you can
you know play with stuff so recently the
polymer team has put out a brand new
project which is called polygit it is a
development CDN which I'll talk about
what that word means in just a second
but basically it is a CDN that includes
polymer all the polymer elements and the
web components polyfills so if you want
to hack around using something like
jsbin and polymer you can totally do
that so if you go to the web site
polygit dot org you see that it builds
itself as the polymer magic server and
what it's actually doing under the hood
is it's just using github Roget CDN and
extracting things from there and pulling
them into you know jsbin or wherever you
want to use the CDN so what I want to do
here is just sort of like show you some
examples of how you can use the CDN how
you can configure it to actually pull in
your own packages as well and and
basically just get hacking really quick
so over on jsbin comm i've already set
up this little sample bin and the main
thing to notice here is I'm using this
base tag right here and if you're not
familiar with a base tag an HTML a base
tag or base element it just allows you
to set a URL and then any sort of
subsequent URLs that you use like for
script tags or imports they will all be
relative to that base so what we're
saying here is what the base URL to be
polygit org slash components this
components directory is where polymer
and all the polymer elements and all
that good stuff lives and from here on
out if we have any relative URLs it'll
just pull stuff from from that directory
so I'm pulling in web components j/s
it's coming from that directory I can
import polymer HTML that'll also come
from that directory and so since we've
got all this working off of our CDN now
we can actually sit here if we want we
can just create our own polymer element
right on Jasmine so I'm gonna do that
right out a Dom module here I'll give it
an ID of like
x-foo and I'll give it a template that
just says like hello from X boom and
I'll also give it a little script tag
inside of here we will call the polymer
constructor and we're gonna say it is an
x foo element and then the last thing we
want to do is we want to just make sure
that we use our Expo tag somewhere in
the page and now you can see it's
showing up over there in our output so
this is really great if you're you know
hanging out on the polymer slack channel
you run into a bug or some issue and
you're not quite sure how to explain it
to folks you can just go through it
together at jsbin using polygit and then
share that jsbin with people so they can
help you get unstuck
now I also mentioned that all the
polymer elements that we built are
included in this CDN as well so what you
can also do if you find maybe a bug or
an issue with something like paper tabs
is you can go over here and you can just
write an HTML import for paper tabs so
instead just polymer also pulling paper
tabs and then you can just start using
that element in your page here so I'll
say I want a set of paper tabs and then
inside of here I will write out maybe
like two or three paper tabs so we'll
say this first tab is called foo second
one it's gonna be called bar I last want
to leave bass fubar bass and there we go
now over here in our output I've got
these three paper tabs working just as I
was expecting and you know if I had some
issue I could then take this I could
save this jsbin I could go file a github
issue and and point the engineer at this
particular J's bin and that way it's
gonna help them triage that issue a lot
faster and help them debug the actual
problem that you're running into and
hopefully get things fixed now one of
the coolest things about polygit is that
it is configurable so not only does it
pull in polymer and the elements that
team has created but you can add your
own github repos to it as well so if you
go back to the polygit org website you
scroll down here to the bottom you can
see that there is this sort of
interesting configuration syntax and it
might look a little weird when you first
see it it took me a few times kind of
working through it to understand what
it's doing but basically what you want
to do is when you are defining that base
you
you can configure it by saying oh I
would also like to include this
component and this component might live
like inside of some particular org and
maybe you want a particular version like
version 1.2.3 or maybe you want a branch
right maybe you want like the the master
branch has some good handwriting right
there or maybe you want just the the
latest tag so if you include an asterisk
instead of pulling a particular version
or a branch it'll just give you whatever
the latest tag happens to be so to shoot
an example of that I've again got a
little jsbin here and I'm just going to
paste in a better URL here so what I've
done is I've configured polygit to pull
in two additional dependencies the first
is the marked markdown jeaious library
which is in the CH JJ org on github and
I've told it to grab the latest tag and
I've also told it to pull in the mark
dash down element which is something
that I wrote myself that lives in the
Rob Dodson org on github and again I've
just told it to pull in the latest tag
there so now both of those are available
in that CDN components directory so I
can just go ahead and write an HTML
import to pull in the markdown element
and then over in my body I can just
start using it so I can have them work
down tag and we'll just drop in like a
hello world for the header there and we
can see we're getting this sort of like
huge h1 rendering over there in the
output so if you're working on an
element or a project or something like
that and you want to show that to folks
on jsbin you can absolutely do that
using polygit as well the one caveat
there is that it has to have been
published for at least one hour for it
to be picked up by the Roget caching CDN
but once it's been published for about
an hour it should be available to you on
probably get now the last thing when I
mention here is at the very beginning in
the show we said that this is a sort of
development time CDN and what I mean by
that is it's not a CDN that you want to
use for production and the reason is
because we're not doing any sort of like
vulcanization
or anything like that to optimize the
elements that we're sending down instead
you're getting an individual dependency
for everything that you import which is
actually pretty expensive in terms of
HTTP requests so it's great for
development time it's great for hacking
on ideas but when you get to the point
where you want to launch something into
production you still want to use a
package manager like Bower you still
want to use a process like vulcanize to
make sure you're sending down the
absolute smallest payload possible but
you know if you just want to mess around
some ideas it's perfect for that so that
about covers it for today
if you have any questions please leave
them for me down in the comments or you
can always hit me up on a social network
of your choosing at hashtag past polymer
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
