everybody's responsible for design and
but sometimes it feels like if everybody
is responsible for design and nobody is
and it seems like a leader question but
who do you think is responsible for
design well I know you don't want me to
say this but everyone kind of is and the
idea is that as cheesy as it sounds
you're working together as a team and
your goal is as a team at the end of it
to produce something good now how you go
about doing that is a good question
in some cases you have these very
isolated teams they're almost like silos
where you have the developers and they
prepare a design and you know it's this
complete thing and now they hand it off
to the developers to implement you don't
really want that that kind of experience
and I mean I've had some experience of
that in the past and I work with on
material components for the web yep and
so by the necessity of that that's
pretty much what happened there because
we had the material design spec and then
we had to go ahead and we had to
implement that as different components
for the web and that becomes a very
challenging process because I feel that
the interaction between a designer and
the developer should be a dialogue not
not something where there's a prepared
design that gets implemented because
there's always something missing there
what happens in this particular
situation and you lose contacts right
you lose context yeah and I think it's
important for developers to bring some
of that context into this discussion as
well and for example where it comes to
platform specifics like the behavior of
the platform the behavior of the
platform for exists and you know all of
the caveats that come with the platform
and all of the positive aspects of it as
well that you can really you know seize
and put into your design and I think
that's an important discussion for
example where it comes to things like
typography the web is full of problems
because fonts are big and if you're
making your end users down
load them you're going to have to
consider what happens while the fonts
are downloading what happens once the
fonts do download you know do you swap
in system font by the downloaded font do
you wait a while before you do that just
so you give your user a chance not to
see that jarring transition and these
are all learned things that as a
developer you can have the designers
with particularly if they're new to the
platform do you feel that your
responsibility is to support the
designer in in as well as being
responsible for the experience as well
or is that just really based on the
relationships that you have of the
designer that you feel that you may have
them had to take hold of that
responsibility I don't see it as much of
an individual responsibility again it's
kind of a shared responsibility where
you're only really is good both the
designer and the developer only really
as good as what comes out at the end of
it right because you can have the most
amazing design and if it's not realistic
to implement it according to the
restrictions of the particular platform
you're going to implement it in then
it's it's not going to work right so why
put yourself a developer anyway I mean
almost is like you're one step away if
you're taking the responsibilities of
behavior from the user perspective
rather than from just a purely visual
design perspective but like how our
users going to interact with the product
or whatever and why not just be a
designer well I think it's really a
matter of focus as a designer I wouldn't
do as good a job as I do currently alga
helper and whereas for a lot of
designers it will probably be the other
way around so I think we can frame the
whole thing in a matter of focus so I
know I won't be doing design full-time
but I feel like I should know enough
about a designer's work process about a
designer's tools about a designer's
language in order to be able to
collaborate with them and you know
present problems to them in their
language and present solutions to them
in their language the same way I feel
that it's useful for a designer to know
a little bit about development not be
able to you know put up a website
together and ship it to production
nothing like that but know a little bit
about what
it's like to develop a website based on
a design so that they can then
communicate with me in a similar way I
mean that's I mean there's a little
thing that Nick butcher one of the
design advocates our on our team he
talks about ceilings and floors
especially when comes to material design
and and so some people see designers
developers seam material design as a
limitation that it's a ceiling because
you just makes you design products that
look like Google but his perception and
the way he sees it is no it's actually
flaw if you build up upon that and I
kind of like see the similarity so in a
sense the design and developer is that
the focus rather than the limitation
right you say that's true yes I I think
that's true I think that it's important
for us to know a little bit beyond our
own core jobs because that's the only
way that you're actually going to be
able to work as a team together I mean
if you're living in different worlds
it's going to be very hard to work
together so so you have your specialism
but that's the starting point rather
than the end point yes exactly that's
what I feel I think in that case um it's
not really limiting it's more exhausting
because you have to have much more
feedback loops with the designer into
can't do this what else do you think
would work I can place the underlying
exactly best positions and have control
over that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
