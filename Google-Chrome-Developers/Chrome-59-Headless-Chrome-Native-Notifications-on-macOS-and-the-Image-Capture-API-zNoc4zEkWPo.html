in an automated environment without a
user interface or peripherals
notifications on Mac will be shown
directly by the native Mac OS
notification system you can now capture
full resolution photos with the image
capture API and there's plenty more I'm
Pete LePage let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in chrome 59 a
headless browser is a great tool for
running automated tests and server
environment where you don't need to see
the rendered output or have a visible UI
shell for example using selenium for
unit tests against your progressive web
app to create a PDF of a Wikipedia page
or inspecting a page with dev tools
starting in chrome 59 you can now run
headless Chrome it brings all the modern
web platform features provided by Chrome
to the command line
check out Eric bidelman post on updates
linked below for full details he's got
an example on how you can use it to
convert pages to PDF dump the DOM and
how to use it programmatically in node
Chrome has historically included its own
notification system for web and
extension developers to show
notifications to the user but we've
heard from users and developers alike
that they want chrome to use the native
OS notification system starting in
chrome 59 on Mac OS chrome we use the
native notification system improving the
user experience and ensuring that the
notifications feel more integrated in
the platform my personal favorite
notifications will now respect my do not
disturb settings because of the way Mac
OS handles notifications there are a few
low usage api's that are now discouraged
as they will result in a degraded
experience on Mac OS check out our
updates post link below for all the
details
capturing high res photos and a web app
can be hard either the user has to
upload a photo they've already taken or
switch from the browser to their camera
take the photo switch back to the
browser and upload the photo with the
new image capture API in chrome 59 you
have full access to the full resolution
the capabilities of any available camera
the API provides control of features
such as zoom focus contrast ISO and even
white balance check Sam's post on
updates for full details and sample code
that you can use to get started right
away these are just a few of the changes
in chrome 59 for developers of course
there's plenty more check the
description for more details including
links to docs and specs now if you
didn't make it to Google i/o this year
I've put a few of my favorite videos on
the side there so check those out then

get an email notification whenever we
launch a new video I'm Pete LePage and
as soon as chrome 60 is released I'll be
right here to tell you what's new in
Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
