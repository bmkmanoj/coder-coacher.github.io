bunch of people from polymer engineering
team to answer all your questions
so first Justin Finney Ani is an
engineer on the polymer tools team
Monika is an engineering you've met many
times today and yesterday on the polymer
team Rob Dodson developer advocate
extraordinaire expert in all things web
and general internet celebrity Wendy
kids Berg the product manager on the
polymer team itself who gave the keynote
yesterday and Steve Orville the
mastermind one of the masterminds behind
the polymer core library and engineer on
the polymer core team as well all right
so we have two microphones UH one
microphone up here two microphones up
here so please come up ask your
questions this is an open space this is
a safe space we love being here with you
there are no such thing as dumb
questions please come up ask us anything
you can also tweet at us at the hashtag
ask polymer and what we're looking
through those tweets live and so I'll be
I'll be looking through a machine up
here to try to get some of those
questions delivered to our panel as well
all right great
so to kick us off I have a question in
the barrel which is that lots of
exciting stuff coming out yesterday and
today with polymer and NPM and es6
modules lots of excitement about how to
develop components also a little
hesitancy for a lot of folks who really
enjoyed being able to author HTML in
HTML so is there anything that you're
thinking about in terms of how we can
kind of better support that use case
that has been so special to so many
polymer developers of authoring HTML in
HTML please yes I mean I first want to
say that we hear you we spent a lot of
time yesterday today talking to people
who were you know kind of lamenting the
loss of authoring in HTML and it kind of
makes sense because that's something
that's been a little bit unique about
polymer and you people have chosen to
use polymer and that's why
you're here because you like it a lot
and sir it's definitely got us thinking
about ways we can you know help support
that kind of style and that kind of
workflow even as we move to JavaScript
modules it's important to note though
that also our philosophy of using the
platform kind of means that like when
the platform gives us a tool and in this
case kind of denies us another than one
that we were hoping to use the we our
choices in a sense made for us a little
bit we have to go to JavaScript modules
because that's the native loading
solution on the web but we can look at
ways to kind of layer the project and
provide ways to you know have some
tooling or something like that the the
important thing is that polymer 3.0 is
very very early in preview stage and so
there's a lot of time for feedback and a
lot of time for experimentation with
solutions to give you the you know the
ability to write HTML and HTML so yeah I
mean the actual string that you write is
the same template in fact you could draw
a line from every line in a HTML import
to a line in a JavaScript file and there
would be a one-to-one correspondence
between every line in there we're just
following cember and that's why you have
to bump the major version yeah so we
hear you we have some interesting ideas
on how we can you know serve the best of
both worlds just add quickly that you
know again based on feedback the reality
is active modules are here today and we
want to support them you know but
there's some spec work potentially to
develop an HTML extension to those
modules and that's something that we'll
be thinking about and you know valuating
and seeing kind of you know if our users
are really clamoring for HTML on our own
team I will say that there was
definitely a bit of like difficulty
ripping that band-aid off but we're also
excited about some of the new things
that modules are going to provide I mean
lit is an excellent interesting
direction and
you can't do that in HTML so you know
we're gonna be experimenting and
listening for feedback so a closely
related question that should hopefully
be quick if I'm working on a new project
right now should i target 2.0 or 3.2
definitely 3.0 is very very early and
the other thing to know is that when we
published core and all the elements
those were literally converted
automatically by a tool minutes before
we publish them up it was like one
process so if you're on 2.0 and you keep
pushing forward and you do that we're
gonna take you to 3.0 automatically I'm
sacked you can tell that they were
published while we were here because we
got raped limited by github on the
conference IP Wi-Fi so that if anybody
was trying to use the github API you
couldn't do it cuz Justin did all of it
no we used to get hub token that wasn't
us just so many people in the code lab I
[Laughter]
think you know a little bit of straight
talk to steal graze term is you know
we're really aiming as Justin said to
earlier to you know not change the API
between 2.0 and 3.0 just as little as we
have to absolutely have to you know and
actually Kevin's app that he built he
transferred the whole thing using the
you know the tool that Justin's team is
built and you know it had some bugs for
a while but you know the latest version
works pretty seamlessly and the kinds of
you know I think Justin sort of obtusely
mentioned we're changing as little as we
can arm Evo spread which in G is little
you can honestly like it let me give you
just one example there's the polymer
import ETF what did that do it created
an HTML import well there's no more HTML
important so you have to do that
differently right this is like about
what we're gonna change that's the only
change yeah and if this this brings up a
good point you know if your vending open
source elements out there we actually
recommend that when you use the
converter you do not change the API of
your elements at all treat them is
having the same major version even if
you bump the major version because it's
now modules because that one that means
when your users run the converter they
will automatically be compatible with
your element so we look at this
transition is is not really an API
breaking change
it's just a repackaging alright let's go
to a live question I have a question
regarding to link and improving
developer experience is there any
opportunity we were developing and to
have provided hot module replacement
like you are coding and you'll
immediately see the changes in browser
yeah I mean we we don't have any work
planned on that there are several ideas
on how you can do that one of the things
with hot module reloading is you often
get into a problem where if you're
replacing some JavaScript it's hard to
huh it's hard to replace the state that
might have gotten in a certain you know
states for through some path of code
that you took so I was just talking with
some people today about ways we could
make templates auto reload in Kevin's
been looking at using redux which you
know has some facilities for that kind
of stuff that can replay your state we
don't have any immediate plans but it's
an interesting and open question Kevin
kind of alluded to in his talk that
we're considering ways you know we're
not really prepared to say exactly what
we're ready to build right now but we'd
like to improve the overall developer
sort of end-to-end experience and you
know Kevin demonstrated using redux as a
good way to do that and a tool like that
works well with something like hot
module reloading and you know there's
something that I think we can explore
without can really committing to
anything I mean you know frankly I think
we'd love to be able to build something
that community can also contribute to
you and and you know it's not some
useful feature that's great thanks
alright so we have another question
about tools which is what are the plans
for all the various tools that polymer
tools team builds when it comes to
polymer three so at polymer CLI what's
gonna happen with polymer bundler will
it be replaced by web pack plug-in etc
yes so there's a little bit to be
figured out there but I'm kind of on the
mind that we have
different paths to explore here probably
at the same time one is we have existing
customers who are using the CLI and are
successful and happy and we want to keep
them moving forward into this world
without them having to ditch our tool
chain so we have been adding support for
NPM we don't have an NPM flag on the CLI
and Polly serve and WCT and we'll
probably try to add support for modules
as an incremental choice that you can
add into your project as you go but we
also want to enable people to like not
have to use our tools because we're so
different from everyone else to be able
to use roll-up and web pack and all
these other options that everybody else
has out there so we're definitely going
to take care of you and keep our tools
moving forward it could be where look at
opportunities to replace some of our
custom stuff with something that the
community already has so we have to do
less work but we're also going to
explore the idea of you know if you have
an existing project and you want a
sprinkle polymer in you can do that
without having to buy into our tool
chain make Rob happy with polymer 3 and
the transition to NPM what was the kind
of reasoning for choosing to go with
yarn and a flat dependency tree as
opposed to using NPM and pure
dependencies getting all the questions
here happy to do it though it's really
the platform again a lot of people kind
of think they've been using javascript
modules because there's been support and
all the compilers that will turn es6
syntax into a common j/s or something
but it turns out that the web compatible
modules are a little more restrictive
than what people have been using say in
the node or like web pack ecosystems and
they require that you import by path
just like HTML imports and so HTML
imports and Bower worked well together
because Bower installed flat and then
you can import polymer by importing dot
dot slash polymer right so we have that
same situation on NPM JavaScript modules
require importing by paths if you want
to import from another package you do
import dot dot slash and that package
name and that kind of forces
us to have packages in the flat layout
and yarn does that NPM currently doesn't
I hope they consider adding that feature
and then will be able to use the NPM
client as well you know custom elements
have a you know when you define a custom
element nope that's used you can't use
it again so that doesn't really work
well if you'd be careful about that so
loading a dependency twice is bad for
that the other reason is loading
dependency twice is horrible for perform
for performance so you know relying on a
tool to make your page completely not
suck and load the same code over and
over and over again is not ideal I think
when we install flat we ensure we don't
do that actually it is worth pointing
this out a little bit so it's also
important to understand that your client
side dependencies you definitely want
those to be flattened as Steve was
saying you don't want to ship ten
versions of the same thing to the client
that sucks right your dev dependencies
all your build tools and things like
that those can actually still have like
the nested node install and so there may
be a little like fine-tuning that we
need to do here to make sure that like
it's very easy and ergonomic for
developers to sort of like be like okay
cool I I flatten my client side stuff
and I one of the things you tried out
was different
yeah they're so different yeah so like
these are my client side dependencies
are my like normal nodes or build or
whatever dependencies flood and one
don't flood on the other and we still
have a lot of work to give everyone
templates that they can start from
they're set up to serve and illed in the
proper way so well will be coming out
with that in the coming weeks yeah but
like just personally like I even though
there is a little bit of work and
overhead involved sometimes in
flattening your client-side dependencies
the flip side of that is you know I
think with web pack you have what is it
like common chunks plugin or something
like that so it's like I mean you're you
can either D dupe this at install time
and handle it yourself that way and at
least then you've got like a GUI kind of
walking you through it or you've got to
like click this whole thing into your
build process to do dupe your packages
so
doing it one way or the other usually
and personally it seems like doing it as
early as possible in the install process
is a good thing let's jump to a question
from Twitter which is what about
accessibility so how does polymer work
with voiceover and screen readers in
general yeah okay
hi so how does polymer work with
accessibility I mean generally like fine
I can't think of anything that is like
you know painfully broken the biggest
issue is going to be around shadow Dom
so most of the stuff that we do in
accessibility to build relationships so
you say for instance you have attributes
like Aria labeled by things like that
where you you actually say this element
is labeled by that other element and you
use an ID reference to that other
element so literally like CSS ID
reference right the challenge there is
with shadow Dom right you're creating
this little scoping bubble your IDs are
scoped to that bubble and so you can
easily end up in situations where I've
got something in the shadow Dom that you
would really like to label or you'd
really like to refer to with like Aria
controls or something like that and
you're unable to do it you just like
can't get down there
so there are a few things that we're
working on to fix this that aren't
actually like polymer specific but are
just like web platform stuff so probably
the most important is the new
accessibility object model which you can
find that on github.com
/ WIC G / AO M a.m. and this is
basically like adding a programmatic API
to accessibility and making it a lot
easier for you to imperative Lee likes
it you know like set up relationships in
JavaScript between elements and say like
hey I've got this element here and I
have access to its accessible node
property and I can actually then give it
a actually node reference in JavaScript
then I could you know talk through
shadow bound trees and things like that
that's really the most important thing
that I think we're doing to fix this and
that that'll that'll help web components
obviously but it also just make
accessibility more broadly across the
platform easier for for developers I
think
let's go to a live question since when I
started using polymer was because I
could just serve up date on a flat with
just engine X or a static server but
most of the examples I've seen now or
over the past year have always been
through a dynamic note server or
something like that so I just want to
make sure that you know one of the that
that's gonna stay and follow my that you
took ingest serve from my static server
all of the things that I build are
always from a static server that's like
a Monica role so they always work the
only time I do extra things is to bundle
but there's no requirement is just
imports and that's one of the reasons
why modules require paths is because the
browser needs to figure out the exact
URL to load and then with yarn flat
it'll be able to find it and load it
yeah I mean the one thing I would add is
because of the way that custom elements
version 1 is defined because of the
current existing browser support and
because of our desire always to ship
really optimized sets of code to the
browser we do sometimes what's called
differential serving to serve just the
right bundle you know like for I 11 we
can't serve es6 this is why we will
provide tools to let you serve the
optimized thing hopefully that's gonna
go away soon in the next year or two
question yeah I'm really happy with all
the tooling and documentation you guys
have provided to help remove users from
polymer 1 been to polymer 2 and now -
polymer 3 it's like you know really made
it as turnkey as possible for folks like
myself but my question is you know
there's still obviously a lot of
projects in code out there with polymer
1 still and using the 0x web components
polyfills what do you guys have in terms
of a long-term support strategy or
end-of-life plan for polymer 1 and you
know obviously eventually polymer 2 and
those 0x polyfills as well
can you repeat the question for anyone
watching on like a video or livestream
sorry
sure I mean Taylor yes so a question was
around end of life support and just
general kind of long-term support for
polymer one and polyphenols yeah I mean
so basically there's the native features
that we rely on is one part of the
question and you know this is sort of
web standard practice right those will
not be removed for centuries probably
until like that we actually do crazy
stuff like you know how many people use
these things but so those won't go away
really and you know polymer we are
supporting hybrid mode so I think I
can't say exactly but we intend
essentially to kind of adopt a similar
policy where as long as there's need
we'll continue to support it and unless
Taylor tells me differently does that
also include the v-0 shadow dom the
implementation in chrome that's a good
question yeah yeah I mean this is really
what I'm speaking to I mean the policy
but basically one of the reasons the web
is great is because it really doesn't
break and you know chrome kind of left
ahead of everybody with v-0 shadow root
and you know this is gonna be available
as long as people are using it thank you
features are removed from Chrome is that
we keep tracking them we have a
percentage of pages that are using it
you can see that as well yeah public
information is calm yeah and they have
to drop below like a very small
threshold Eero point zero three Perseus
you know 3% oh yeah all pages are using
this feature and if it drops below that
then you're confident enough that it's
basically just like old pages or unused
pages or just we're sorry we're gonna
break you so I don't think we're nearly
close enough and we're not there's no
chance we're gonna go there in the next
years one thing that is happening soon
that's gonna make Monica excited but if
anybody was here still on like 0.5 or
anything and you're using the deep
selector and CSS or the shadow selector
yeah for that - those are going away
very soon in Chrome and that will change
the styling of your
so we've been trying to urge people to
get up to polymer 1.0 and stop using
that for the last couple of years
hopefully you have they're basically
getting replaced by the descendant
selector so like it's not gonna make
your style not get applied but deep is
just like it becomes a descendant
selector so it's not gonna go into
shadow roots or anything like that
little warning in the console for quite
a while but it's very it's weird I had
this like innate reaction now I see the
warnings I'm just like clear if you're
like me like definitely going to break
it's definitely getting removed yeah
luckily I've seen some sites that
hopefully they've moved it doesn't break
them that bad in all tweaks
alright let's turn to another Twitter
one how optimistic are you and what are
your feelings about other browsers
agreeing to native element extension and
what can we as the developer community
help my cross to bear
is equals is a great idea where the the
idea of extending a custom element or
the idea of adding your own set of
functions and behaviors and prototypes
to a native element this idea I'm very
clear here is agreed on by all browsers
the implementation of this idea is not
agreed on by all browsers so the current
is equals implementation in particular
is not is very content like consensus
and is not agreed on by all browsers and
this means that we would like to we will
continue fighting for something like is
equals it will probably not be his
equals in the state that it is
hilariously enough as equals is a likely
contender one letter off but basically
there is a need for extending custom
elements there are things that you
cannot do unless you are any development
for example submit forms so in parallel
for with us fighting for this API to
actually
we're also fighting for browsers to
actually no just fix the form element
forum elements should look at custom
elements there is no reason why the form
developed 20 years ago should not look
at something developed now so it's a
hard question we're working on it we're
trying very hard to write specs wit so
it's an ongoing battle I'm not I don't
know if this is entirely accurate but
I'm gonna say it on stage as if it is if
you add a shadow root to an element that
you've type extended like so let's one
of the one of the things is like Oh
select right select is amazing and it
has all this built-in accessibility and
presentation to it and my understanding
is if I extend that and then add my own
shadow root like all of that goes away
and so yeah okay so like yeah so there's
like a lot of things that you might like
think that you want to do with is equals
actually just aren't going to quite work
and so then it does become a bit of like
a weird API and the browser is not
really good at like pinkies Ryan like a
pinky swear I'm not gonna do bad things
cuz I've read those like these 20 things
that I can't add a shadow root to but
not these other four or something yeah
so I definitely think personally yeah I
want just them to sort of like expose
the primitives or fix the elements I
want like the label element in the form
element and all these things just either
just work with custom elements or let me
sort of imbue my custom element with
form Ness and label Ness and label
ability and things like that and one day
one day this will happen promise I just
had personally I'm not personally I'm
not very optimistic just speaking for
myself only again because I think this
concern for example that Rob brought up
around shadow roots is a really good
idea of the larger problem you know in
v-0 custom elements you could extend
input but you couldn't add a shadow root
to it so what you could actually do it
it was kind of limited why because it
had this native legacy implementation
and this is really the larger concern is
that these native elements have this
long history of you know super plus plus
plus implementation and crazy specs
before custom elements was even a thing
so the long-term fix is to expose those
api's and make
available to any custom element has
wants them and maybe there's a shorter
term fix it probably isn't gonna be is
it maybe some crazy thing and you know
we know that people really want this and
so we're definitely kind of got our
fingers on the pulse of that and and
we'll be pushing for something because I
think you know the exposing and the guts
of input so that you could do it all
yourself is probably a 25 year project
yes so you know we probably need
something in the meantime
and if is is objectionable you know
we'll be pushing and sort of pushing
people for some better solution and I'll
give a little shout out to Marika stock
alert earlier today all of these
discussions are not in some secret
backroom these are all happening out in
the open on public mailing lists so you
have good use cases and I get hope
bianna github please go and like tell
everybody you're very upset that is
equals is not a thing github comm w3c
slash web components yes there you go
it's the only way we get things done by
proving that you actually want something
like musicals they don't believe me all
right
let's go to a live question yeah thanks
so my question was in fact related to
the previous one but first I'd like to
thank you for letting us use the
bleeding edge of this bag right now
before it was you know recommended and
given the the is attribute is gone
what's the the migration path that you
proposed to the currently implemented
elements that are using s attribute
especially those that are using specific
parsing context like templates script
table TR and so way that we I think
we're getting it from the Big O so think
that I did with form for examples of
wiring for him was an extension of form
you convert into a wrapper and then you
put content in it so basically all of
the extra is equals things that you were
doing you put it on a wrapper element
but that for TR is kind of yeah tables
are tricky tables are tricky but
remember that you can style yeah you can
style things as tables with CSS so you
could move
but you got style think like a template
that
template type yeah so yeah I mean what
what Palmer did I mean yeah it's not
super pretty we're not gonna lie but
this sort of decoration pattern is
essentially this is what polymer did
with like we used to in polymer 1.0 we
had template is down repeat we first
sort of compatibility we did some magic
where we sort of made that work in
polymer templates in 2.0 but the way
that we actually make that work is we
have a Dom - repeat element it expects a
template inside of it and it works that
way this is a general pattern that's
gonna basically work again it's not
super pretty but it's what you can do
great thanks
and thank you for this disent it was
great yeah actually you need to bring
them back on the polymer project website
the student mention about an upgrade
tooth 2 to 0 from 1x any update on this
on the upgrade tool yeah there's a
mention about who's from when 0 to 2 yes
so you know last year we said we're
gonna make this upgrade tool and then
this is kind of my bad a little bit and
it seemed like most of the feedback was
like oh it's really easy to upgrade and
the things that were tricky to upgrade
we're actually going to be impossible
for a tool to automate things like
converting a Content tag to a slot tag
where the content had actually had a
selector there's no way we can just
automatically determine what the slot
name should be everywhere and apply it
so it seemed kind of to us for a while
that everybody that we were hearing from
was kind of satisfied with how easy it
was to upgrade and then it seemed like
more recently we heard an uptick in
number of people who were asking about
about the tool and wanted it so also
recently we started converting all the
internal elements inside Google from
wanted to and at Peter and engineer on
the tools team has been working on the
tool quite recently it's not very clean
code we've just been like hacking at it
to do whatever upgrade we could and so
we're planning on releasing the version
that we have for internal external
pretty soon okay then do you have a
citizen to lint old element to find you
know quickly what has to be changed to 0
right rather you know going to be cherry
mountain
you know searching for specific things
but you know something Tulane so it's
highlighted a way to highlight a new
code you know what should be changed
like yeah we can certainly if there's
cases where we we can't determine what
it should be we can output a message
that says you know this needs to be
updated by you okay all right we're
running a long time let's do one more
live question hello my question is do we
have any tutorials or videos for the
making something like neon animations
because we really load in the now the
Uni and actually animations in the
polymer one new animations in its future
right
so is it is is it fit is we have a blog
post that Elliot wrote you probably saw
him on stage before on the polymer
summit site that kind of explains what
happened to neon and animations and
what's going to happen to neon animation
yeah so my question is like is there any
some new videos or children's like neon
missions because in the version 2 it is
duplicated right would there be
replacements for neon animation yeah I
don't think so the problem with neon
animation is that it's fundamentally a
flawed concept that we thought was going
to work and doesn't like it doesn't
actually add anything in the current
state that it is amazing to the web
animations polyfill a API and we had a
team the team that actually works on the
web animations API look at making a new
and better neon animation and what it
ended up being was the web animations
API so it turns out just like a
declarative wrapper would be amazing but
it just doesn't really work well and if
you want to me it's just a jar of
spiders
yeah I'll also plug baldra in another
engineer on the team made a codelab
performant expand collapse animations
and just by going through that you can
see you know something pretty typical
that anybody would want to build and how
he does it and then you can learn
yourself and maybe apply that to some
other projects thank you
alright let's close out with a question
that I love which is what would each of
you see as your number one request or a
hole current hole in the web platform a
feature or some change that you would
like to see made to the web platform to
make it better there's two I'll go on
and hope somebody else does the other
one I think right now for web components
we're looking pretty good with native
implementations at least in Chrome and
Safari the one piece that seems to be
left to make everything much better is
the theming support in CSS for shadow
Dom so that's the part and theme CSS
spec it just got promoted to working
draft or editors right let's take the
other one out no it's okay so yeah that
will just help that would just help
everybody theme across their shadow
roots that was mine we're better or for
worse for some reason I care about
inputs and forms despite never actually
using a form on anything that I've ever
manned so what I would like to see in
the web platform is input being less
opinionated and forms being less
opinionative elements being less
opinionated about their tag names so for
I'm caring about more than just input
and you know input type equals color
actually working on all of the browser's
cuz it's not yes yeah Foreman input I
would like for man input to succeed at
their job yeah so mine it's kind of
related to that like there's a lot of
things that native elements can do
there's like a lot of built-in magic
I've been working on accessibility a lot
the how-to components that we all worked
on accessibility was like the primary
driver behind that work we were like how
do we build tabs and trees as custom
elements and make sure they are like
really like robust and accessible right
fully keyboard accessible doing all the
right things with Aria everything we can
possibly try and then there's still
places where we come up short because
there's some stuff that we just can't do
in the browser today the label element
the things
like that click on a label and it
focuses your control
that's a cool magical behavior that like
just there's no easy way to get that
you're gonna have to make your own
custom element label now and then you
end up just reinventing like all of HTML
to get all these little features so I'm
really excited about am and other you
know other stuff like being able to hook
into forms I think these are probably
some of those common things folks have
brought up and we've kind of been
pushing it for them for years
I actually think people are listening a
little bit more right there's only about
forms I think forms are actually a good
yeah I could hope you're like finally
getting through to some folks there so
yeah that's really what I want I want I
want to make sure the future of HTML is
accessible and that's easy for
developers to do that to do the right
things and it's not like this arcane art
to make something accessible I think
that the biggest frustration I have is
when there's like a really cool feature
and not every browser has it of course
you know trying to bring down polyfills
and I think a way that that could happen
is oddly enough through payments and
commerce on the web because the more we
allow users to buy things and spend
money there the more companies pay
attention large companies that have tons
and tons of sites and have tons and tons
of tons of developers and so we can
start doing more stuff with payments I
know that chrome payments just came to
desktop will start attracting a lot more
attention and then hopefully companies
will start putting a lot more attention
into their browsers or paying attention
in standards meetings and stuff
yeah people on the team know that the
thing I care about sort of the most is
performance and I think I've said this
before but you know I think with custom
Ellen's we have an opportunity to add
things to the browser that makes it
faster makes us able to do things custom
in custom ways faster I care about this
for a couple reasons obviously I want
things me faster so that we can all make
stuff that's awesome and better for
users but there's another reason and you
heard yesterday and Alex Russell's talk
he talked a lot about mobile CPUs now he
only talked about that for like five
minutes but he works in the same offices
us and we have to hear him talk about
that for like hours and hours and hours
and
hours and I would like to have things
faster so I don't have to hear that
venting all right great so Matt's gonna
come on in a second with some closing
remarks and some very important
announcements so please be sure to stick
around but thank you so much to the
