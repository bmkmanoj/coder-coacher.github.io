and this is the 360 VR video recap of
our 2016 Palmer Summit held at the
tobacco dock in beautiful sunny London
so I hope you're viewing this through a
card board for the full VR experience in
front of you right now is a merchant
ship or a pirate ship or something but
if you turn around you can actually see
the tobacco dock itself you can see the
venue and you can see some of our
branding out there on the exterior so
now we're inside the tobacco dock and
it's a pretty cool vibe inside of the
venue itself it's got a very historical
maritime nautical theme to it and some
very interesting architectural details
there's a lot of folks coming in from
all over the world right now to learn
about the latest developments in web
components and of course polymer so in
this sort of registration area folks are
just getting their badges or getting
their swag bags and if you look around a
little bit you can actually see me
tucked off to the side they're doing a
live interview with mr. Peter lubbers
from the Google developer relations team
so now we're inside the main hall and
we're just getting set up successful
summit really requires a tremendous
amount of preparation and the Palmer
team not only created a bunch of great
content for the event but they also put
a lot of thought into creating a space
in an environment that really encourages
networking and collaboration okay this
is the keynote now we've got Mack
McNulty going up on stage kicking things
off and there's also some pretty awesome
projection mapping going on a funny
story
the guy who put together the graphics
for the projection mapping actually had
to pull an all-nighter the night before
at the backhoe dock just to get
everything ready and because the tobacco
dock is not an enclosed space at all
it's totally open to the elements use
back there just covered in blankets just
jamming away on his laptop to like house
music and stuff and I think the the end
result was was pretty awesome you can
see that we've got a pretty packed house
here take a moment and you know look
over your shoulder to the left and the
right kind of get a feel for the size of
the room I think the final head count
was around 750 developers from all over
the world showed up for this event which
is pretty awesome I mean we had folks
from every continent every walk of life
and it was really exciting to see them
all here in person and get to talk a lot
of them
is the speaker lounge so this is
basically where everyone is panicked
coding bug fixes into their demos so
take a moment uh you know look around
you can see a lot of familiar faces
folks from the Google developer
relations team we also have a monitor
here so we can keep track of what's
going on during the event and keep tabs
on all the talks and go out and maybe
you know give people a hard time or
something if they're there demo explodes
it's always a really good idea to push a
bunch of code right before you go up on
stage and present it so yeah this is
this is usually where we hang out we do
these at every event just so we can have
kind of a quiet space to get some
last-minute stuff done before we go up
on stage lunch time now some folks here
eating chicken some are eating non
chicken this was a very cool loungy
space and this is a good chance if
you're on a VR headset to look up and
check out the transparent roof I'm sure
sometimes it's sunny in London today was
a bit overcast but it's still a very
very awesome venue and this was a really
good opportunity for us to sit down with
some folks and just chat about the
future of the web and really hear from
developers about where they have pain
points and how we can hopefully address
those
for folks who maybe were a little
exhausted from sitting in on talks and
wanted to kick back in a beanbag and
maybe just scope out some sessions on a
TV we set up this little lounge area
true story after the event a lot of
folks just picked up the beanbag chairs
and took them home with them we did this
similarly last year at the last polymer
summit and a guy actually had to buy a
train ticket for his beanbag chair and
he sent us a photo and we lolled at the
end of a very long day of discussing web
components we all chilled out in this
cavernous underground party space this
spot was actually pretty rad
I think nerds like me are naturally very
comfortable in a cave-like environment
so this is very fun definitely had a lot
of really good conversations and got to
make a ton of cool folks that about
wraps it up I hope you liked what you
saw and that you'll be able to join us
next year at Palmer summit 2017
