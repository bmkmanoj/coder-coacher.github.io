to the polymer summit we are here in the
lounge joined by Justin fem Yanni justin
is a software engineer on the polymer
team kind of chillaxing in between
sessions right now Justin you just got
done doing the the tools keynote and
y'all covered a bunch of stuff in that
keynote but for the folks who haven't
seen it yet you want to talk about maybe
some of the eyelet items that you you
highlight it there yeah well first we
kind of unveiled the new vision for our
tools which is that we're building tools
for all the web components not just
polymer and we're building them in this
fashion that we have a core analysis
engine that powers all of our other
tools and that's going to give things
like the linter and the bundler a lot
more power to operate yeah okay and one
of the things that y'all y'all mentioned
two was um some IDE tools to make it
easier to you know use web components in
your editor you want to talk about that
just little bit because that was kind of
like a big highlight of that moment yeah
that was definitely the most crowd
producing moment uh so what we've done
with the analyzers we've bundled up the
analyzer features into an editor service
that provides an API that's really nice
to use from editors like get me the
warnings of this file or at this
position in the file give me the
autocomplete at this position and then
we've made three separate plugins so far
for Adam vs code and sublime there are
fairly simple plugins because they all
rely on this editor service and they
offer autocomplete linting documentation
jump to declaration and so the plan here
is to you know have people start with
these three and then hopefully have
community contributions to build plugins
for things like web storm and visual
studio and eclipsing and on and and and
something that y'all mentioned to you is
that these are not just for polymer
they're there for for all web components
right yeah the analyzer built-in knows
how to understand vanilla custom element
declarations and understand the
attributes and properties but via
plugins we could also support things
like skate jas or bosonic so we hope the
community can contribute okay awesome so
for folks who kind of want to get in on
this and explore this a little bit where
could they go to find some of those
plugins so right now the two that are
available for adam and vs code and if
you look in their package managers it's
called polymer ID
and you can install that and see the
preview version yeah awesome so so I
definitely go check those out I will
also try to include links to those
packages down in the the show notes as
well Justin thank you so much for being
with us today again we're reporting live
from polymer summit if you have any
questions for us you can always ping us
on twitter at hashtag polymer summit i'm
