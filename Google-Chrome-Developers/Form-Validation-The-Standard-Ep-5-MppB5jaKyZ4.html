will solve common web problems with
standards these techniques are part of
the web platform and work with any
framework or library okay let's go
spawn let's make up online stores sign
up and actually I find them really
painful so get a coffee and a judge your
brain and let's make them easier by not
overthinking them and adding some
validation rules which come for free is
part of the web platform you can add
required to any HTML input element to
prevent a user hitting submit on their
form without a value or specify format
to require the users input to match a
reg X that you provide and most
importantly HTML gives you an
overabundance of types to choose from do
you just want to find number you can
just ask for one do you want to color
you could write your own picker it turns
out nearly every browser has an inbuilt
one you can also you know ask for dates
and times and this is great because it
deals with the user's locale on your
behalf so trigger form validation users
normally have to hit the submit button
you can also trigger this with
JavaScript once validation has started
you can take advantage of CSS rules to
style your inputs based on know whether
they are correct or not for me
personally I like to add a Jason hidden
element that's become visible if the
users done something incorrect use
required some fields that are required
use format with the correct type when
you need it use a type to ask for a
phone number or color or whatever you
want and give you user feedback on input
by CSS rules this is how I build form
validation in a standard way see you on
the next tip if it's clear
oh sorry I'm going way up strictly
friction um I actually like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
