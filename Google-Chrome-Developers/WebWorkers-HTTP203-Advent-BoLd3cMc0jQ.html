years yes and our current interval is
about to end and we close at 2017
and so I was thinking my next interval
what is it going to be about is gonna be
2018 it is going to be tenuous likelike
a plus one mmm and so I thought I would
tell you my topic and you can ask me
questions I would have to make explain
it to you within two minutes within two
minutes okay
go work us I'm aware of them they're
existing they have been existing for a
long time but yeah I think we need to
start using them service workers I've
been using I've been using them service
worker it's not Oh so there's workers as
a as a group I guess but I was talking
about the web workers the the way of the
web to giving you actual parallelism so
multi-threading a dedicated worker a
dedicated worker for your sites okay and
I think we should be looking at the
native platforms like iOS and Android
and what they've been doing for Turing
for quite a long time is doing only UI
work on the main thread and putting
everything else in a different thread
okay right I mean are we not doing
already some people are doing now
already I've done that what I'm saying
is I've done that already I have done
that already there have been experiments
but I think it had it's everything but
mainstream and I think it needs to
become amazing because for the past
couple years the problem has always been
jank people doing too much JavaScript on
the main thread and doing animations
wrong and whatnot and if we could just
move the expensive JavaScript code to a
different thread and have some really
good patterns on how to still interact
with the the UI part of your app right
you would be free to just you know write
some blocking code just do like some
expensive JSON object serialization and
it wouldn't really affect the
performance of your app so a big part of
the problem is is that communication
between the main page in the worker cuz
that's so clumsy right now it's it's
post message if you spend it will work
or you get post message which you can
send JSON object at best we have shared
array buffer as well which is a way you
can reinvent all of the buffer overrun
problems but on the web that
but rate I've been working on things to
make it easier which one of the things
is comlink but I think there's lots of
explorations to do and it's definitely
worth doing because it would just make
the web feel good by default and I think
that would be really nice
let's jank it's a good thing and we're
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
