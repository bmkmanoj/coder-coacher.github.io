web series about solving web problems
with standards these tips are part of
the platform and work with any framework
or library these are quick tips let's go
mobile devices like the ones I have here
have physical sensors that might be
useful if you're building HTML games or
more integrated experiences let's find
out how to use them the standard way the
most simple use case is for us to check
the devices discreet orientation the
browser will emit events when the
devices screen is rotated this is the
orientation change event and it will
fire when the display rotates from
landscape to portrait to find out what
orientation you're in there's actually
not really a standard API it's actually
best to just compare the width to the
height if it's greater then your users
browser is in landscape mode but what if
you want finer information on the
devices division recently I built a game
and I wanted to find a detail about the
current orientation for that you can
listen to the device orientation event
it gives us three values alpha beta and
gamma for this game we care about the
gamma property as it represents
side-to-side motion check out my article
to find out more about the different
axes we can also measure acceleration
this might be useful for gestures for
example imagine shaking your phone to
clear form you can get this information
with the device motion event which has
properties like acceleration and
rotation the gyroscope is very powerful
it can give you orientation and
acceleration and can even give you the
compass direction I go deeper in my
article so you can check it out so
remember use orientation change to
listen to the screens orientation and
the device events to listen to fine
detail on the devices orientation and
acceleration that was the gyroscope the
standard way see you on the next tip
yeah I'm trying to force myself another
house
