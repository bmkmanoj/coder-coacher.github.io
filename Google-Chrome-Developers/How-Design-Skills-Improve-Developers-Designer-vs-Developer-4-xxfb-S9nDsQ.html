clique has been has been known as the
technical person and amongst devrel
folks you're known as the creative
person even though you're a developer so
I suppose the question is them our
designers born or they made and the same
as our developers born on are they made
you could say there are people who are
going to going to a firm like it's just
you've either got it or you haven't
you're born with it or you don't have it
right and then there are the other
people who say like if you work hard
enough you can achieve anything I feel
like I want to be somewhere in the
moderate middle there and say for
example like not talking about designing
or developing no matter how fast I run I
will never beat Usain Bolt or how well I
sing I'm never gonna sing as well as
Beyonce or somebody like that but if I
took singing lessons or running lessons
I'm sure I could improve where I'm at I
mean as a designer I'm supposed to say
no we are born because we're in an ivory
tower and we have to we shouldn't be
challenged everything we should say is
is as is but the longer I've been in
industry and some of the best designers
have come across come from a computer
science background or even completely
unrelated to or is almost like they are
more cultured they're with other
disciplines therefore they almost bear
designers yeah I think there's probably
a function of opportunity in there right
and I I don't know but my feeling is
that it's a function of both your
opportunities and the context in which
you grow up so that the nurture I
suppose and then your you know your
suitability to a particular area you
know some people just find it easier to
play musical instruments so from my own
my own experience is that I would never
introduce myself as a designer I find
strange because you do actually I mean I
your design skills I mean you know are
quite respectable thank you yeah but are
you kind of occupy a very interesting
space where you're someone who can speak
code or developer and you you're someone
who has
appreciation for design can apply it so
but in that it's interesting because I
had that opportunity my first job as a
developer was in a design house where I
was working alongside print designers
day-in day-out and I was exposed to
kerning leading you know widows all
these term bits of terminology and you
know I could see those those things and
I could start to see the principles that
were at play and then I tried to apply
them myself
we got it wrong and I adjusted in try to
course-correct them and still that's a
process but it's the same process that I
go through with programming it's the
same mindset the mindset is simply I
want to understand what the principles
are at play here and I'll figure some of
those out by myself but I figure some of
those out because other people have
figured them out before me and so I
interested in in improving in that area
so again the desire is there in me to
actually improve but I'd say my aptitude
is more skewed towards development I
find it easier to adapt and adopt those
principles I'm all readily bring the
design work I always find it interesting
like as a developers able to navigate
both I mean with your media app how are
you how are you doing that because you
feel that there is something you have to
be born with but you're kind of proving
my point that you know well I mean you
have to have a control me somewhere else
that would that was not given the same
experience and then put them in a
similar situation and see what happens
if you give in fact you probably want to
means one that's just purely them
development throw them into the design
and see what happens and one whose own
design and throw them into development
and see what happens my attitude towards
designers it was something I wanted to
understand better it was something I
wanted to be able to do I was surrounded
by designers in my first professional
role who could design and I was
comfortable with my own ability as a
developer having done a degree in coding
I would felt like actually this isn't a
thing that I kind of need to prove
myself as being able to do amongst my
peers right the bits that they can do
that I can't
I feel inferior now and that's probably
playing into some of my psyche right I
better learn how to do that I haven't
there's no benefit to me other than I
can now do something else
I suppose one last point on that it's
like do you think
it makes you a much more better
developer to be aware of design like you
feel much more cultured developer I mean
because my point of view I think as a
designer who knows I mean I say I know a
code when I say that amongst dev real
folks they laugh like oh you weasel will
laugh yeah you know and html/css that's
not real code but it is it is it's
really hard it feels but to me it feels
like you become a much more culture of
designer because you're aware of the
platform some of the best and exciting
projects for me that I've ever done have
been the ones where a designer set out
the the goal and the overall field but
they had no idea that that was
unachievable and so it fell to me on the
development side to both maintain their
aesthetic but achieve the thing that
they'd dreamt up so that was really
they'll be technically challenging so
it's sort of it scratch that itch of my
personality so you sometimes you want
the people who just like I don't know
what's possible so I did a thing and now
you're forced to make that thing a
reality and that can be a really good
testing in the middle bit where you're
actually like I said I had to maintain
an aesthetic and do some code that that
crossover point rather than being over
the wall and a sort of strict silo you
want that transition point where you've
got somebody who can go between those
two worlds and say look I understand the
aesthetic understand actually what
you're trying to achieve visually and
from a UX point of view and you know all
these other aspects of of the design but
I also know the technical limitations
are there or there are more suitable
ways to achieve what you were trying to
achieve so how about we do that so that
it's that point of compromise in the
middle that actually has been most
valuable to me if you're a designer and
you a new take the view that you can't
develop and therefore you won't develop
are you holding yourself back I think
that's I mean maybe maybe in some
context only for that that crossover
point yes and the same with a developer
can you be a perfectly good developed
without designing
yes would you be a more empathetic
developer if you knew more about design
and aesthetic yes I think you would it's
how far you can get along that path is
how much partly how much time you want
to invest how much of yourself you want
to embed
and a function of your suitability to
that tuck and how easy you find it to
take on and save the principle even even
if you don't say I'm gonna be the most
creative designer out there and when
developer I'm gonna be the most creative
zone even if you say I'm just going to
try and understand why line length
matters why letting and curling matter
so I understand the principles for
easing of motion why that matters and
how that plays into things and you know
I'm going to invest just a little bit of
my time that goes an awful awful long
way to actually in my experience of
improving you in other ways you just
broadens your horizons so in reality it
doesn't matter if you they're born on
made it's just about the individual
wanting to well we were all born not
knowing how to say write or speak or
walk and yet we all managed to get to at
least you know many would get to that
point right ah I doubt ask yeah and so
there's clearly a sense in which you can
always improve and I think you should
always look to improve and I think
certainly in what we do improving across
that boundaries it's helpful to you and
it's helpful to everybody else if you do
I won't be doing design full-time but I
feel like I should know enough about a
designer's work process about a
designers tools about a designers
language in order to be able to
collaborate with them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
