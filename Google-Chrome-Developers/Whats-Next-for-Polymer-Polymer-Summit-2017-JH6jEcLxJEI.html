right whoo all right well thank you nd
thank you everyone for being here on
behalf of the entire polymer team I'm
thrilled to be here to help answer the
question what's next for polymer we have
this motto on the team we're pretty
subtle about it so maybe maybe you
haven't seen it maybe you have on a
poster of a podium but in case you
haven't our motto has been to use the
platform and four years ago polymer
launched with a simple mission to invest
in the web platform and to make web
components fast accessible and easy to
use in 2015
we launched her first official version
of polymer polymer 1.0 a
production-ready library for building
with web components and then at last
year's summit we previewed an early look
of polymer 2.0 which had evolved to
match the final web component specs the
browser's were shipping with and so
today native web components are becoming
a reality on all major browsers so
that's it we did it nothing left to do
right thank you all for coming get them
safe now now of course not
even its native support continues to
grow there's still plenty of to do
plenty of opportunities to make web
components easier to use than ever
before and so that's why I'm excited to
share three big changes that are coming
to polymer the first is that polymer
will finally be moving off of Bower and
joining the NPM ecosystem NPM includes
millions of developers and over half a
million packages and soon polymer
developers will have access to all of
them but that's not all polymer will
also be fully embracing JavaScript and
ES modules to give us a fully native
loading experience across the browser
and a much better tooling support for
developers and finally to help you with
all this and make your upgrade in your
move as easy as possible we'll be
releasing an auto upgrade tool to make
this super super easy to use and so I'm
excited to announce today that together
these three changes will become the next
major version of polymer polymer 3.0
and even though this is just a very
early preview we wanted to share our
first look of what you can expect for my
next release so we're really excited but
before we get into it I want to take a
quick look back at how we got here when
the project kicked off in 2013 there was
plenty of challenges and problems we had
to solve and there were two problems in
particular that I want to talk about
today component loading and package
management for web components to work we
needed a fast native loader in the
browser it had to support deep
dependencies that can load other
people's code and build off of each
other and while in line being and
bundling have always been options on the
web we really didn't want to force an
extra build step just for development
and so these were our requirements and
there wasn't much to choose from they
could do all this natively the browser
had always been able to load different
scripts but those scripts could never
then load their own dependencies and
there were whispers of a JavaScript
module system that was in development
but the project was still years away
from any consensus consensus about what
it might look like or how it might
behave and so instead of waiting we
proposed a new simple native HTML
loading system called HTML HTML imports
and this would give the browser the
ability to load HTML on-demand and HTML
can load scripts and styles so
essentially with one loader you could
load JavaScript CSS HTML all of it we
like this because it was incredibly
simple and straightforward which allowed
us to move quickly from prototyping to
spec writing and on to implementation in
the browser so loading was handled
thanks to HTML imports but we also
needed a way to package web components
and to make them easy to share across
projects and teams and remember this is
2013 so a package manager for the web
that was kind of a crazy idea at the
time
handling JavaScript dependencies and
version updates was still a pretty
manual process for most teams but we
wanted to build an ecosystem which meant
that we needed a way to manage
dependencies and because two versions of
the same web component can't exist on
the page at the same time we knew that
we needed a way to resolve version
conflicts and
a flat dependency tree and then lastly
we wanted web components to work
anywhere with any framework so it was
really important to us that we chose an
active community that was available to
the entire web and so we chose Bower
Bower was new on the scene but it was
already growing really fast it was able
to manage dependencies resolves version
conflicts and stall side dependency
trees and best of all its goal was to be
a package manager for the web so this
aligned really nicely with our mission
and our goal to be accessible to any web
developer and any framework so we got
our native loader we had our package
manager with these two pieces settled we
launched polymer our first version of
polymer and we continued to rely on them
to this day but a lot can change in four
years and a lot of those core ideas that
we had in 2013 have finally gone
mainstream thinking with components and
encapsulating Styles native shadow DOM
native custom elements and so the last
year has been a really good opportunity
to look back and reflect and look back
at HTML imports and Bower specifically
and asked are these still right for
polymer do they still meet our needs and
are these still the best choices for web
components going forward and so I
already gave away the end in I'm sorry
spoiler alert but in addition to
exploring these two things and what they
look like I also want to show you how
they do an even better job at solving
those same requirements we've had since
the beginning for this year's web
development so let's start with
packaging because front-end development
has come a long way since 2013 and
probably the biggest change has been the
huge growth of JavaScript node has
exploded onto the scene and NPM its
package manager came with it to build
this one community for everything
JavaScript so that includes no that
includes the web that's included tooling
I mean even space I mean NASA is using
NPM to develop spacesuits I mean that's
the final frontier of JavaScript and so
NPM is about everyone together using
using javascript into a single shared
ecosystem tower hasn't been doing as
well
most of you are probably aware when you
go to install Bauer today you'll see
this message along with a note
explaining the Bauer's deprecated and
that you should move to NPM instead so
while the Bauer community was growing
fast back in the day today almost
everyone has moved over to NPM and the
Bauer project is winding itself down but
you know what that was still a good
package manager' its version conflict
resolution is still best-in-class it's
flat dependency trees are guaranteed to
be as small as possible so I don't maybe
this makes me some sort of JavaScript
hipster to say but that was still a
really great technical choice for web
components which is why we've stayed
with them for so long but the world has
moved to NPM and npm has become the
world's largest community of packages
and developers I mean look at those
numbers that's that's absurd those are
some crazy numbers and so by moving the
NPM each of these packages that comes
available for your project with no extra
hassle are set up but the package
manager itself has never really
supported version conflict resolution or
flat dependency trees and so with NPM
you can end up with multiple nested
versions of the exact same package
and while this could be fine for node on
the front end of it bloats and slows
your application and with web components
it can completely break them because web
components expect to be unique on the
page and can't just be overridden by
conflicting versions so luckily yarn
came on the scene last year as an
alternative client for NPM and our team
actually worked with them early on to
add the support we needed for web
components so with yarn you get that
same great NPM ecosystem but now with a
package manager that supports everything
we need out of web components just like
power getting started is super easy all
you need to do is install yarn and run a
net and if you end up running our
automated tool which I'll get to in a
little bit you get to skip all this
because it'll basically do all this for
you but it's still good to understand
what this will look like so I'm going to
go through it anyway so yarning it in it
will generate a manifest for your
project that you look a lot like the
bower dot JSON you're used to and you
know some dependencies have the exact
same name on Bower nm p.m. which is
great because that means your code
actually doesn't need to change very
much so at the moment for example
one-pass works on Bauer same path works
on MCM no need to change the code but
some packages do change their name
so all polymer packages for example are
nested under the polymer namespace and
that was in the case for Bauer so when
that happens you need to remember to
update any import paths as well so
Palmer I'm Bauer that comes at polymer
slash polymer on MDM another thing to
keep in mind is that if you're building
an application and you reference Bower
components directly that's no longer
going to exist yarn installs everything
into node modules so just be conscious
of that and make sure you update any
paths and that's it then you can run env
our site not NPM yarn install to install
your dependencies from MDM but remember
that yarn doesn't use that flat
dependency tree by default so you
actually need to tell it that you needed
to install flat so just add this option
to your package.json and then when you
run yarn it'll install all your
dependencies for you if anything comes
up any version conflicts it'll help you
resolve it just like Bower did but yarn
also has a ton more features on top of
Bower so for example really smart
caching really fast installs locked
files to freeze your dependencies
workspaces for cross package development
so there's a ton of cool stuff here but
I know I'm really looking forward to
using and I'm looking forward to the
move 10 p.m. in general because it
really helps us complete that original
promise of web components to create
elements that work on any framework in
any browser on any project and asking
developers on NPM to set up Bower just
for a single polymer element or package
that's been a hard sell so this is what
I'm most excited about honestly as a
developer the platform should be able to
meet you where you are if you're at M
p.m. then polymers should be able to
make it really easy to work on MDM and
with polymer 3 that's exactly what we're
going to do so that's packaging thanks
to MPN and yarn now let's talk about
module loading because with all the
excitement around javascript the plan
for a native module system is continued
to move forward different ideas were
considered
different features debated and finally
the spec was finalized last year for EAS
modules and meanwhile HTML imports they
haven't progressed as much Chrome and
opera they added support really early on
but other browsers haven't moved forward
and the reality is most of the other
developers aren't really asking for them
so we'd really hope the big catch on but
that just hasn't happened and that means
that polyfills are still required in
most browsers and will probably continue
to be required for a long time and so we
revisited es modules now that they're
finalized for the browser to see if
maybe they could meet our needs
essentially es modules unlocked two new
features for JavaScript import and
export export lets you tag things as
module exports like this element
variable in polymer element and then
import the import keyword lets you
import it from anywhere else in your
application so really straightforward
and really explicit about what you're
using and so we revisited this and it
turns out that they actually meet every
one of those original requirements and
not to mention the JavaScript community
is really enthusiastic about them and
not only that browsers are excited about
it too so Safari is already shipped
native support kommen opera and B are in
beta and Firefox and edge aren't far
behind in active development and so back
to this chart es modules have finally
become a viable alternative to HTML
imports and if we do and because we
decided to go with them well you guys
you guys see this right look at that
chart it's completely green do you guys
know what that means it means that
absolutely no polyfills are required on
those browsers for the first time ever
how awesome is that yeah so cool so
excited so pumped for that so
this is the result of years of work from
developers across all these different
browsers and we're just so happy to see
it all coming together okay so what does
this actually look like for polymer well
let me show you with an example let's
convert this basic polymer 2.0 element I
have is called pretty button and let's
move it to polymer 3.0 on NPM and
JavaScript modules so there's actually
only three things you really need to do
update your exports update your imports
and move your template into the class
definition really straightforward pretty
simple let me show you what I mean
so for exports instead of attaching
things to the global shared window you
get to be really explicit and tag it as
an export for that file so now we can
change this to export pretty button
directly from the file and that's it
that's all you really have to do to
change it
it's really easy right like super easy
like this baby even knows how easy that
is and how excited he is I mean I'm not
sure if this baby knows what JavaScript
is but I'm like 90% sure that this baby
is excited about HTML sorry JavaScript
exports
okay let's keep going
imports we're going to switch to
JavaScript imports and again super easy
and straightforward to do it's going to
look a lot like what we're already used
to so you can call it you can call it
imports to the exact same path exact
same type of path and you're going to
import the element from it and this is
important because if you've already
worked with NPM then you might be used
to importing packages by name the
modules on the browser expect to import
a file by path and so we're going to
keep the same path style imports we've
always used in polymer so they can work
natively on the browser no bundling
required you can still bundle if you'd
like to totally up to you but it's not a
requirement you can't really see that
path but it's almost exactly the same
and finally you're going to need to move
your template so traditionally polymer
templates have always lived alongside
the class definition and then behind the
scenes polymer would connect the two for
you but now they're removing entirely to
JavaScript this needs to change the
template is going to have to move and so
we can move it ourselves directly into
the class definition the class is
already where we describe properties and
observers and
mix-ins and so it makes a lot of sense
that this is where we would describe the
look and feel the element as well and so
all we need to do is move the template
in and we are now officially completely
off of HTML and don't worry I'm just
using a simple string here for an
example because I kind of know what
you're thinking that's a little gross
right I totally get it you're not wrong
I actually agree writing HTML on its own
style format is much nicer than this
editor's understand it better syntax
highlighting is easier so we definitely
understand we're losing something here
but bringing our templates into
JavaScript also gives us a lot of new
options including the option to go
beyond just simple template strings so I
won't say much more now but if you're
interested in learning more I'd highly
recommend you check out Justin's talk
tomorrow on expressive templates that's
all I'm going to say okay so exports
imports templates all really simple
straightforward changes and now we can
bring it all together so there's the
example we were just looking at all we
now need to do is add our import and
make sure we reference it properly add
our export and that's it there's your
new polymer 3.0 element JavaScript
module it's got everything it looks
exactly the same just with a few small
changes and if you're using hybrid mode
don't worry palmar 3.0 is going to work
with that too and so by moving the
JavaScript modules we finally get a true
native loader for the web and polymer
does a lot in JavaScript already so just
a few small changes or all you need to
get there and just as importantly this
unlocks the entire world of JavaScript
tooling for polymer 3.0 so you can now
use webpack to bundle you can set up
babel to compile to older versions of
browsers and tools like es lint and
prettier and all those JavaScript tools
will work just out of the box but any
extra plugins or configuration needed so
just like with our HTML imports we're
also limiting how well we could work
with other projects and asking
JavaScript developers to use HTML
imports and to download special
polyfills just for a single polymer
element that's also always been a really
hard sell so javascript modules are just
another way we're growing to meet
developers where they
our and this is great for everyone
polymer developers you can now easily
access all that JavaScript tooling on
NPM non polymer developers you can now
use that really cool polymer element you
just found and polymer package officers
specifically you now have this chance to
reach millions of new people millions of
new users on NPM so that's just a brief
summary of the changes that are coming
to polymer 3.0 and the last thing I
wanted to share is something new
something we've created to handle all
this for you because no one likes
painful upgrades if we decided to change
a lot of things at once it'd be
impossible make this move safely so NPM
modules and then a bunch of changes to
polymer no that that wouldn't work so
intentionally the core polymer library
actually isn't changing much at all for
this 3.0 move how we use polymer is
changing definitely as we move to NPM
and JavaScript modules but the polymer
library interface its behavior hybrid
mode how it all works that's all been
changed as little as possible and that's
all allowed us to focus on just the
things we need to change and create a
new automated upgrade tool for polymer 3
called polymer module Iser this is
really exciting
polymer module Iser is still under
active development but as you can see it
does a lot of things already it can
generate your package JSON it can map
from Bower to NPM and I don't have time
for a demo but the most important thing
to take away is it's awesome it's
available to try out today and the
reason we know it's awesome is because
for the last few minutes we've been
eating our own dog food just does that
phrase translate and Danish I just want
to be clear I don't actually eat dog
food but the point is it's just the same
the point is we use our own stuff on the
polymer team we're already using
modulator to run on our own suite of
polymer elements and at this point it's
starting to look pretty good and so I
have one last exciting announcement to
share as of hopefully about five minutes
ago all the official polymer elements
have been automatically modulized and
published an PM available today as a
part of our early preview of polymer 3
super-exciting so please go check them
out play around with them I'm sure you
get that we're all really excited about
this change this has been years of work
and we're just really excited about
where it's going NPM is the package
manager for the web and so we're really
excited to join that community
yes modules provide finally a native
loading experience that's going to work
on cross all browsers and we have an
automated tool so you don't even have to
worry this is going to be a really easy
change so I'll end on the most important
part right
how can you try all this out well the
first thing you need to do is install
yarn the aren't how you're going to work
with polymer on NPM but it's also just a
really good client as well and then
here's what's available today so we have
an early preview of polymer available on
NPM an early preview of all those
elements automatically converted and
package authors if you have any packages
out there that you published please
check out our module Iser on github it's
also available on NPM but just please
check it out give us some feedback we're
really excited to see how that works and
just remember this is an early preview
so we we're doing this because we really
want your feedback but work is still in
progress so some bugs or maybe some
missing features that's still expected
at this moment and don't worry about you
know should I use polymer 2 or polymer 3
early preview keep using polymer 2 for
anything in production remember there's
going to be this automated tool so
whenever you do make the change it's
going to be super easy so no rush and
this is just a rough timeline so you
know don't hold us to it but this is a
pretty rough look at where we're going
to be going so browsers they're going to
continue to move forward we're going to
be really focusing on documentation and
tutorials going forward improving the
module Iser
and improving just our overall general
tooling support so a ton of exciting
stuff coming down the pipe so check out
the polymer blog for any news and
updates on polymer 3 we're gonna have
some great blog post coming out during
the summit and going forward this year
and if you have any questions I'm sure
you do totally great we have the
lunchtime Brown Bag Q&amp;amp;A so grab your
lunch you can come to the mainstage and
we'll have a few people up here
answering
any questions you might have and so
that's it for me I'm so excited to get
these things out there to get people
playing with it and to join NPM and the
JavaScript community thank you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
