know the things you use to make your
pages let's plan unless you're building
a site for a good of Great Escape fans
so saying your CSS you want to do
something different instead of two too
frequently use papayawhip there are
three cool new features and dev tools
that make that way easier the eyedropper
that's used to pick a color from the
page has been around for some time but
it was always on paradoxically making it
harder to discover you have accidentally
found it when your cat's been walking
with your laptop you know one of those
delightful discovery is like finding the
rito cramp in your belly button right
off because so many people couldn't
discover the feature the team went all
the way back to the drawing board they
thought long and hard debated the
personas they wrote storyboards and
facilitated focus groups and if you look
in your canary you'll finally see the
result of all that engineering effort
observe the IKE moving on there's a
small but loud crowd of peach buff
aficionados out there I know because I'm
one of them now if you need to take that
name Collin turn it into hex hsl RGB a
CMYK manzil or Pantone you now can now
go ahead and find out which of these I
made up but first let me tell you about
the biggest new feature in new color
picker say for some reason you're not
happy with your standard go to palette
consisting of blanched almond and mint
cream or maybe colors on your thing but
you still want to embrace your artistic
side either way devtools got you covered
with the new palettes the custom palette
allows you to store and later reuse your
own scholar swatches whenever you need
them but the palate isn't just useful
for storing your own colors of course
you're awesome sitting in front of a
page that already has a bunch of colors
and you want to reuse some that's what
he auto-generated palette comes in it
shows you the past colors from the
current page sorted by how often they
appear in the CSS and finally the
material design palette gives you a set
of colors that look great out of the box
the colors you seen that list out all
the primary colors of material design
but it's a nifty building magic with
this one long press on one of them and
you can pick a shade instead
now go and make your life more colorful
and let me know what you think in the
comments below on Twitter and subscribe
to him more about what's happening in
the world of devtools from me Paul
backers and the rest of the chrome
devtools team will wish you a good
evening and good debugging
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
