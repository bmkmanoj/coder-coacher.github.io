developer advocate on the web platform
at Google and I worked on the web
platform for a super long time i
actually just had my 23rd anniversary of
working on the web platform and i have
to say this is one of the most exciting
times in that history because
progressive web apps are an amazing
breakthrough and user experience like
this lets you build stuff that really
just works for users this is the first
time i can actually say that and not
kind of grimace a little bit inside when
i say that so i hope that we filled your
heads with a ton of really interesting
stuff today i hope that you know we've
given you a lot of grounding of what you
can build and how you can go about
getting started I hope we've impressed
with the opportunities both in market
opportunities and as tile just talked
about in addressing emerging markets
which i think is a really great
opportunity for the web as well so in
this talk I want to discuss a few areas
that are still kind of under
construction this isn't stuff you
necessarily want to be putting into
production today a couple things in here
are but but most of it is sort of to
spark what what's going to come next in
the future so this is kind of the next
next level of user experience and if you
saw my google i/o talk pretty recently
what's next for the web you might think
this is just a replay of that and it
totally is not this is not a whirlwind
deluge I chart of new features i
actually just want to focus on three
important challenges that are relative
to progressive web apps first and
foremost knowing who the user is AKA
authentication and sign on and enabling
the user to pay for things on the web to
be kind of nice and finally connecting
with hardware just kind of near and dear
to my heart personally but i'm going to
talk through some developments in each
one of these and starting with knowing
who the user is sign in in particular
now let's take a look at an average
sign-in screen today like this is what
users land on most of the time
and they often have a lot of problems
with this I know I do because every time
I go back to a service I can't remember
did I sign up with this with my google
plus account did i use facebook which
email address do i you did i use because
i have multiple email addresses all i
want to do is get to the application and
of course my favorite button on this
entire page is forgot password is there
anybody here who's never used a forgot
password button oh you're my hero right
there okay good or you're lying which is
actually not calling you a liar but
anyhow on top of that mobile devices
which of course a lot of browsing has
been moving to mobile it's really really
hard to type particularly things that
are not you know words in your preferred
language and especially when you're
using different characters like you do
in a password I know for example I have
optimized at least one of my passwords
to have characters that are more easily
accessible on a mobile device screen so
i don't use Tilda's in my passwords
anymore because it's two extra taps away
on an android on-screen keyboard and i'm
sure you can understand this leads to a
problem i'm sure some of you know what
this is already so just call it out what
do you think this number is most
commonly used password that's right this
was the most popular password in 2015 it
edged out the previously most common
password password and of course you know
this isn't even getting into how many of
us share passwords across different
services I mean I mean how many of you
share passwords across services because
I would never do that the point though
is the complexity of remembering
passwords leads users to use weak
passwords or to share them and that of
course is a significant security risk so
chrome and pretty much every browser out
there try to encourage stronger
passwords by using bunch of heuristics
to automatically detect when you've
signed in successfully and prompting the
user to save it
and then auto filling it when the user
returns to the site you don't need to
remember to you don't need to type
anything hopefully this will just work
and chrome actually also has and several
other browsers have features that will
synchronize that across different
devices as long as you're signed in to
Chrome and in Chrome for Android this
also applies to Android native apps so
Android native apps get the same
password data but even just Chrome's
password manager alone assists eight
billion sign ins a month like eight
billion times during a single month is
how many times that saves somebody from
typing in a username and password now to
a large extent this should just work
like you shouldn't have to do anything I
should have stopped talking about this
like three minutes ago but since this is
auto-detection this is guessing it's
best to give password managers hints so
that they can guarantee that their
password forms are being treated
properly the best thing is of course
that these hints actually work across
all modern browsers this isn't chrome
guidance that I'm giving you this just
kind of works so despite this talk being
mostly about what's next go do this
right now since password managers our
heuristic based sometimes extracting
that semantic information is difficult
just give us a hint like here we can't
really tell what the what the username
is is it display name phone email so you
can solve this simply by putting in
autocomplete attributes username and
password and if you're marking up
passwords use current password because
when you have account creation or
changing password forms you can use new
password for where the new password is
going and this has two effects I'm only
mentioning this because there's one
really interesting one the first oaring
one is simply this prevents password
managers from plugging a password you
already used into a new password field
but when you mark up your forms with new
password the browser can also tell that
you're trying to generate a new password
and you can do it for them like we can
we can go ahead and just auto generate a
password for you so instead of a
password like this you will get this
well not exactly this I mean don't write
this down or anything something like
this like we've been experimenting with
Auto generating passwords and chrome for
a while it's actually in Chrome Canary
dev and beta channels hope to deploy it
to stable soon but if you properly mark
up your fields with new password it'll
it will make this possible we'll be able
to do this and other browsers will too
but setting aside that stuff what's
really next generation for sign-in is
using something called the credential
management API now we've just shipped
this in Chrome it's still kind of early
days certainly not implemented across
all browsers yet but the credential
management API gets you away from using
form fields with wacky autocomplete
properties attached to it and lets you
integrate more deeply into the sign-in
process of the browser so you can also
by the way use this to sign into
federated services which is kind of hard
to do in a form so Aliexpress which I
think we talked about earlier is
actually a really great example of a
user flow because it's a shopping app
it's really important for users to be
signed in right away to ensure that if
they have items in their cart they're
still there if they have preferences or
stuff that they've been looking at or
wish lists it's already there but at the
same time you really don't want to force
the user to log in as the first step
like you don't want to take that active
step of saying okay give me your
username and password before I show you
anything because if there are new user
of course they may just want to browse
or I may just be searching for something
new I don't want another step in my way
so with Aliexpress when a user launches
from the home screen it loads up this
app shell and during the startup the app
asks the browser for the users
credentials if it can get them without
bothering the user and then they can
sign the user in you can see this at the
bottom here and they don't need to ask
the user at this case in this case now
they do this in the credential manager
API and the code for this flow is really
pretty straightforward there's just a
navigator credentials object and
you have a get method you can ask it you
pass it in some options you say this is
a password based credential and most
importantly here I want this to be
unmediated I don't want to prompt the
user from this call so this code is
actually safe to put on every page in
your app to try to trigger sign in
because it won't ever interrupt the
users flow I don't won't ever pop up a
dialogue it will just fail if it can't
do it automatically now auto sign in is
kind of new for the web we're starting
out pretty conservative so the browser
will only hand over these credentials if
the user is turned on automatic sign in
and if this user only has one credential
for the site if they have multiple
credentials we don't want to pick for
them we want to make sure that they they
get to choose and of course this would
be an interesting security place so we
need to make sure it's kept secure so
credential manager API is restricted to
secure contacts like many new features
and passwords are never actually
directly exposed like when you do get
what you get back as an object that has
the password which you can then hand a
fish to post to a same site endpoint and
it has to be a same side end point you
can't be pushing this off to other other
sites of course so once you get these
credentials when you actually want to
sign in you call fetch and pass it in a
post now when automatic sign-in isn't
possible credential manager API can
still offer a one tap log in it can
still say I want to sign in and then
trigger a chooser dialogue so the user
can enter new credentials or they can
pick between multiple credentials that
they have so chrome will present an
account chooser like this one this one
only has one available but if you need
to do this you use almost exactly the
code that you saw a minute ago the only
difference is there's no unmediated in
this so you can use this flow when the
user clearly has an intent to sign in
like if they click the login button then
obviously you can run this so this is
all great you actually do need to
forcibly store credentials
and this is where our heuristics often
fail but the credential manager API
actually lets developers have the
ability to choose when the Savior
password prompt is triggered so chrome
isn't going to miss out on when the
right time to to trigger this is so if
the user has just entered their
credentials into a form you just create
a new password credential and tell it to
store that constructor will deal with
parsing your form pulling all the fields
out that kind of stuff and you can use
this as I mentioned before for doing
federated login Google+ Facebook any
other federated login you just have to
create that credential using whatever
whatever the particular federated
credential wants to use as an ID and a
ended provider so an identifier and then
the browser kind of just deals with the
rest of the process for you and finally
of course we can forcibly sign you out
we can say hey don't ever automatically
sign me back in always prompt the next
time that that the that you call the
credential manager API to do an
automatic sign in so a number of
companies are already using credential
manager API or started working on it in
some cases deploying this in bits of
pieces in bits and pieces you can play
around with these today in Chrome
because we ship this in chrome 51 so
it's actually turned on already but now
I want to move on and talk about paying
for things now obviously we've been able
to pay for things on the web for quite a
while and it's no surprise that given
the rise of mobile computing a majority
of commercial traffic is coming from
mobile devices like this one what is
surprising though is that sixty-six
percent of purchases are actually
happening from the web on mobile devices
so by and large users are using the web
to purchase things more than they're
using native apps to purchase things so
i guess the web isn't dead after all but
unfortunately there's a lot lower
conversion rate too and conversion rate
is a weird concept so i want to make
sure that
I sort of capture the sixty-six percent
fewer conversions equates to if on
average you make three euros per visitor
to your site now on a mobile device
you're going to make one euro per
visitor on your site on average like
this is pretty bad right this means
mobile users are not paying you as much
or they're not spending as much on your
site now if you if you wonder why I
think the answer is actually pretty
simple because checking out particularly
on a mobile device is still a pretty
messy problem I'm pretty messy project
so check out forms have improved since
the beginning web commerce of course but
fundamentally it's still kind of the
same thing I still have to manually
input my credit card info my billing
address my shipping address this has
gotten so bad for me personally by the
way I get really really excited when I
go to a forum and they have put the zip
code first and they automatically fill
out my city and state for me like I'm so
excited that they do this when if you
back up for a second I shouldn't have to
enter any of that like it should just
know what that information is and of
course this is worse on mobile devices
too because you know if you thought type
in your email address was bad try typing
a 16-digit credit card especially when
they forget to label the field properly
and it gives you the qwerty keyboard
yeah it's a mess so just like with sign
in our first step to solving this
problem is autofill now autofill works
on existing forms you don't have to
modify your site although it does
actually do the same kind of same kind
of autocomplete types but stores a
user's address and credit card info you
can manually save this in settings
yourself you can let it auto detect it
chrome will synchronize it just like
with with user sign ins but so autumn
feels great I mean it does actually
improve the problem it raises our
conversion rates about twenty-five
percent on an existing site with no
changes but although autofill gets rid
of the manual nature of data entry it
does make it simpler for the user but
it's fundamentally the same kind of
existing checkout flow you're you're
still here
ending the user the same form it's just
they have a stamp for parts of it and
they just have to make sure they end up
in the right places so the web checkout
process really needs to be kind of
reinvented overall now like I said
before the current checkout process is
really pretty form heavy for users
though the ideal experience would really
be the server just works it out with a
browser like the browser is your user
agent like that's why we call it a user
agent it works on your behalf so sites
should be able to focus on creating an
amazing engaging shopping experience and
not so much on that last set of pages
that you have to navigate through that
has a long checkout form so this is
where web payments comes in with the
payment request API so payment request
is a simple JavaScript API it allows the
browser to handle that heavy lifting of
payment collection and give the user one
tap check out but still make sure that
the site is going to get the right set
of information not the wrong set of
information and the user has explicitly
said yes I want to pay them this much
money so this is an openly developed
standard API no matter what browser
platform or payment method you choose
everyone should be able to pay for pay
without a checkout form in the end we're
still working on this but obviously
we'll come back to that this is under
development in the w3c web payments
working group that group's goal is to
create a universal so cross browser
standard for any website to accept any
form of payment so this isn't a chrome
only API we want this to be supported
across all browsers in fact I really
want to give a shout out to Microsoft
because they've done a ton of work in
the web payments group as well hi some
love all right and
and although we're targeting mobile
first with crumbs implementation because
that's where its most impactful payment
request is explicitly designed to not be
tied to a given platform the goal really
here is to create an open ecosystem
where any website can I accept any form
of payment with minimal code changes and
without any proprietary one-off payment
api's so with autofill we can eliminate
that manual and tedious bit our
implementation actually uses the same
data from autofill too so you won't have
to enter your credit card details one
more time if you're already done this
and since the browser is taking care of
this the steps of collecting the right
set of information we go from having
multiple taps multiple forms to just one
you just have to approve it so the flow
here is really the site initiates a
payment request the website passes to
the browser what it needs for that so it
says how much is being are you charging
what set of items do you need then the
browser determines the intersection of
what types of payments that the site
supports and what payments the user
actually has what payment payment
methods and then presents a selection
you I to the user to choose which kind
of payment app this can be anything from
a simple credit card to an installed
payment app like Android pay and then
the browser gets a response back on this
and returns it to the merchant and
emergen the website the merchant's
website now has everything they need to
process the payment so credit card info
or the right set of tokens so looking at
this in code I know this ends up being
kind of small because it has a lot of
information on it but the real this is
by the way based on the first published
working draft this may change so like if
you go back at this slide in a year it's
probably not going to be totally right
on but we'll see when you create a
payment request which is the first line
of this all that you do is the first
parameter is an array of what supported
payment methods the merchant supports so
here they'll take Visa Mastercard Amex
discover but that's all not any other
credit cards or other payment apps or
anything like that now the default here
is that is this right it is using credit
cards to pay for things because that's
kind of still where we go but they also
pass in the line items the set of things
you're paying for whether they want
shipping options so the website can
actually support those shipping ops and
options and negotiate them later and
then update the total price now I did
talk about payment applications I wanted
to describe this a little bit in a
little bit more detail so Google
launched Android pay late last year not
late last year early last year and we've
seen phenomenal growth in people using
it to pay for things on Android devices
and and with merchants physical
merchants but what makes this even
better than using your credit card using
your credit card directly i should say
is that it uses a tokenized version of
your card when it passes it to the
merchant so they can't reuse your card
information and of course it uses device
authentication to protect your
transaction it knows it's using your
phone it's not just a number a credit
card number so let's take a look at
android pay all that you really do is
you have the same payment request
creation but you give it a different
supported type a different supported
payment method and here of course
android pay has some app specific
parameters so it tells you what gateway
it's going to use what key it wants you
to use what version of the API and of
course that would be different for
different types different payment apps
so you can get started with this today
it actually is supported but it's in
Devon beta builds of Chrome for Android
it's behind a flag until we launched
late this year and then we plan to add
more platforms including desktop and the
ability for third-party payment so other
payment applications to register with
chrome in 2017
so we've been working with the large set
of partners on this they've been testing
this kind of improving it i explicitly
put this up because i wanted to prompt
people if you're interested in this it
would be great to share feedback on it
for you to play with it talk to us talk
to the w3c's working group because I
think that we really want to get to a
great place with this API okay so now
you've got users who are logged in they
can pay for things the final area that I
really feel unlocks the potential for
progressive web apps for the web as a
platform is connecting to hardware now
the web of course already has access to
a lot of hardware devices accelerometers
on my phone game controllers camera
audio input audio output midi devices
lots of other stuff but i want to focus
on one area that we've been working on
lately which is bluetooth now when I say
bluetooth I'm not talking about headsets
I'm not talking about mice those are
bluetooth devices but I'm talking about
things like heart rate sensors and the
latest made major version of bluetooth
version 4 which is actually like six
years old by now I guess introduces this
thing called Bluetooth Low Energy now
I'm sure you've probably heard Bluetooth
Low Energy but you probably don't know
why it's really exciting but the
interesting thing is that it's also
really weird because unlike other tech
like Wi-Fi or ethernet which
consistently increase their bandwidth
version over version if you look at
bluetooth on the right hand side here
version four seems to have fallen off a
cliff like why did they go from a
transfer rate of 54 megabit 21 a point
three megabit well the answer is
actually pretty straightforward its
power and costs Bluetooth one the
Bluetooth creators wanted to evolve
Bluetooth into a technology that could
be integrated into thousands of devices
like dozens of devices that you would
use on a daily basis and when you do
that you have to make sure that it's
trivial to pay for you know trivial cost
upfront and it's trivial to maintain and
it's trivial to fund the battery it's
like
continue to keep it powered so when you
look at this end and it comes down to
batteries and batteries are frequently
something like this it's a CR 2 cr2032
battery like this is what actually
powers the clicker that I usually use it
doesn't provide a ton of power like this
this won't power my laptop for very long
at all and this explains why the
transfer rates are so low because it
needs to consume less power so if it
runs at a slower rate and runs the the
transfer at a slower rate it'll save a
lot of power now you don't have to worry
too much because most of the scenarios
where you're going to use bluetooth you
don't you're not trying to push like 4k
video through this right like you're
pushing control instructions for racing
cars or you're pushing data for a
Bluetooth le printer or you're
controlling bb-8 because this is
actually a bluetooth remote control
robot there are also devices like this I
actually have one of these up here this
is a dotty LED notification display
which you can have this display anything
you want you can put custom patterns on
it but you can also set it up so that it
flashes red when something bad is
happening or whatever and i usually have
this sitting on my desktop and doing
doing weird stuff now i want to take a
look at how this works in practice i'm
going to start with a little demo here i
have a bluetooth LE device here called a
play bulb candle this is a mood setting
LED candle so we're going to you know
bring the mood in here you can buy these
for about 20 bucks online you can
actually buy them a lot cheaper if you
buy them in bulk but the cool thing
about this and you can tell already is
that it changes color it's a full color
LED and let's switch over to the remote
here let's pull out my phone all right
so I have to leave the light off on on
this because the color actually shows up
then so I'm going to open up my demo
page connect to the device and it asked
me what I want to pair with so I'll tell
it the candle and now from a web page
with JavaScript I can directly control
this candle kind of cool the candle
actually it has a few other things in
here to like I can set modes in it so it
flickers a little like a real candle it
flashes or pulses or does the rainbow
effect which personally I tend to think
of as the seizure effect let's turn that
off now the really cool thing though we
actually just just put this up a few
days ago is this has a sensor in it
there's a tiny little hole you can't see
it from there can't even see it really
in the camera but it's a sensor for when
you blow the candle out so I'm going to
blow the candle out and watch the watch
the screen instead oddly you can blow it
back on to which is kind of strange but
ok all right let's go back to the slide
deck ok so before I dive into the code I
need to give a few basic terms from
bluetooth there's two two two roles in
Bluetooth or the central device my phone
a peripheral device the candle and this
weird thing called gat and dad is how
these things communicate it's a generic
attribute profile the peripheral device
has what's called a GATT server and that
basically lets you ask it questions
about what kind of services do you
provide what characteristics to those
services have and let you read and write
those values so you know that's pretty
much what I said here so basically each
service contains one or several
characteristics can have multiple values
some of these are standardized like
battery service to tell the battery
level is a common thing you can query
any device that supports the battery
service
how you know what level is your battery
out and it will tell you in a consistent
way now I want to run through some
JavaScript code super fast on how to do
this we actually have a code lab on how
to do this we have a number of the
devices here that you can play with
tomorrow if you want but in general you
just call navigator Bluetooth request
device you pass it some options that
lets you filter what devices there are
because there's tons of Bluetooth
devices around in most common scenarios
today and actually this filter list is
not optional you have to filter it down
some what you have to say well I'm
looking for something that's you know
named play bulb or I'm looking for
something that supports battery service
or something like that so this that's
what this example actually does it looks
for anything that supports battery
service once you've selected a device
you know once we popped up that dialogue
the users chosen to pair it you have
access to a Bluetooth device object
which you can connect to the GATT server
and you can ask it ask it what it
supports or you can ask it for a
specific service two things that I
should note here one when you request
the device to begin with it has to be
incited a user interaction like a click
on a button and secondly of course like
all powerful features that in the web
platform now you have to do this from
secure HTTPS pages works fine on
localhost too of course so then you can
get services and characteristics so here
you get the service the battery service
you get the battery level revalue tells
you what the battery percentage is
pretty straightforward writing to
services actually just as easy this is
the code to write the color to the plate
bulb candle so you start out you request
the device you connect to it you connect
to the candle service you connect to the
candle color characteristic and then you
write it like you write about you to it
so this is pretty straightforward
although you're probably asking wait a
second there these magic candle service
uuid values and candle color uuid so
it's possible your Bluetooth device
comes with the programmers guide
some of them do you can actually get one
for the Dottie but if not you can also
install their whatever their control
software is like there's a play bulb
candle app for Android and then enable
the developer option in Android settings
that lets you snoop on the packets and
you can tell what characteristics and
everything there they're using now to be
notified when a characteristic changes
like when I blew out the candle all you
have to do is add an event listener on
when that characteristic changes
whenever the characteristics value
changes the event handler gets called I
did by the way I want to briefly connect
web bluetooth with another project the
physical web so physical web is about
beacons low-cost Bluetooth devices like
this that just broadcast a URL like
Bluetooth devices broadcast their
presence anyways these broadcasts
specifically a URL so people in the
first few rows you may actually be
picking this one up but then the goal of
them is to make interacting with smart
devices as simple and fast as possible
so as long as physical web is enabled on
your phone you will actually see
physical what web pages are nearby and
they get filtered by a web service so
this won't be too spammy and the train
that you're on can actually broadcast
the link to their schedule a parking
meter can broadcast the payment app a
dog collar can broadcast its owner's
contact information now in the future
though this is the cool part this is why
I'm connecting these because this isn't
a physical web talk in the future we're
going to integrate the physical web with
web bluetooth with a feature called
referring device so if you navigate to a
physical web beacons URL this actually
gets exposed when we load the page that
it came from a specific Bluetooth device
and when you know that this exposes the
GATT server the Bluetooth device
directly so if you walk up to a parking
meter you don't have to figure out then
which actual parking meter and my at
because it just went to a URL you can
actually make sure of that because
you're connecting directly to the device
so web bluetooth
requires you to flip on an experimental
flag in chrome today it also works on
Chrome OS Chrome for Android marshmallow
Chrome for linux we're diligently
working on the OS 10 and windows
implementations if you're on lollipop
you can still use it but you have to use
a chromium build and it's also
implemented in Opera so to get started
if you're interested by the way just
google web bluetooth samples it's really
the easiest thing like i said we've got
a code lab that we're running tomorrow
and a bunch of devices to play around
with we also have a pile of physical web
beacons that you can keep we don't have
enough for everyone i don't think so
we'll figure out how to you know throw
them at people was my idea but they said
no with that you know I I hope this
gives you an idea of some of the
exciting areas that are going to make
progressive web apps even more exciting
in the future I hope you've learned a
lot today please come back tomorrow
we've got lots more talks from other
browser vendors partners and you have a
chance to talk with us in office hours
and experiment in the code labs so thank
you very much and I think Paul Kinlan is
going to come back up and close things
out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
