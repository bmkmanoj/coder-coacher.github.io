developer advocate on the web platform
at Google and I worked on the web
platform for a super long time I
actually just had my 23rd anniversary of
working on the web platform and I have
to say this is one of the most exciting
times in that history because
progressive web apps are an amazing
breakthrough and user experience like
this lets you build stuff that really
just works for users and this is the
first time I can actually say that and
not kind of grimace a little bit inside
when I say that so I hope that we filled
your heads with a ton of really
interesting stuff today I hope that you
know we've given you a lot of grounding
of what you can build and how you can go
about getting started I hope we've
impressed you with the opportunities
both in market opportunities and as tile
just talked about in addressing emerging
markets which i think is a really great
opportunity for the web as well so in
this talk I want to discuss a few areas
that are still kind of under
construction this isn't stuff you
necessarily want to be putting into
production today a couple things in here
are but but most of it is sort of to
spark what what's going to come next in
the future so this is kind of the next
next level of user experience and if you
saw my Google i/o talk pretty recently
what's next for the web you might think
this is just a replay of that and it
totally is not this is not a whirlwind
deluge I charge of new features I
actually just want to focus on three
important challenges that are relative
to progressive web apps
first and foremost knowing who the user
is
aka authentication and sign-on and
enabling the user to pay for things on
the web it should be kind of nice and
finally connecting with hardware just
kind of near and dear to my heart
personally but I'm going to talk through
some developments in each one of these
and starting with knowing who the user
is sign-in in particular now let's take
a look at an average sign-in screen
today like this is what users land on
most of the time
and they often have a lot of problems
with this I know I do because every time
I go back to a service I can't remember
did I sign up with this with my Google+
account did I use Facebook which email
address do I you did I use because I
have multiple email addresses all I want
to do is get to the application and of
course my favorite button on this entire
page is forgot password is there anybody
here who's never used a forgot password
button oh you're my hero
right there okay or you're lying
which is actually not calling you a liar
but anyhow on top of that mobile devices
which of course a lot of browsing has
been moving to mobile it's really really
hard to type particularly things that
are not you know words in your preferred
language and especially when you're
using different characters like you do
in a password I know for example I have
optimized at least one of my passwords
to have characters that are more easily
accessible on a mobile device screen so
I don't use tildes in my passwords
anymore because it's two extra taps away
on an Android on-screen keyboard and I'm
sure you can understand this leads to a
problem I'm sure some of you know what
this is already so just call it out what
do you think this number is most
commonly used password that's right this
was the most popular password in 2015 it
edged out the previously most common
password password and of course you know
this isn't even getting into how many of
us share passwords across different
services I mean I mean how many of you
share passwords across services because
I would never do that the point though
is the complexity of remembering
passwords leads users to use weak
passwords or to share them and that of
course is a significant security risk so
Chrome and pretty much every browser out
there try to encourage stronger
passwords by using a bunch of heuristics
to automatically detect when you've
signed in successfully and prompting the
user to save it
and then Auto filling it when the user
returns to the site you don't need to
remember - you don't need to type
anything hopefully this will just work
and chrome actually also has and several
other browsers have features that will
synchronize that across different
devices as long as you're signed in to
Chrome and in Chrome for Android this
also applies to Android native apps so
Android native apps get the same
password data but even just Chrome's
password manager alone assists eight
billion sign ins a month like eight
billion times during a single month is
how many times that saves somebody from
typing in a username and password now to
a large extent this should just work
like you shouldn't have to do anything I
should have stopped talking about this
like three minutes ago but since this is
auto-detection this is guessing it's
best to give password managers hints so
that they can guarantee that their
password forms are being treated
properly the best thing is of course
that these hints actually work across
all modern browsers this isn't Chrome
guidance that I'm giving you this just
kind of works so despite this talk being
mostly about what's next go do this
right now
since password managers are heuristic
based sometimes extracting that semantic
information is difficult just give us a
hint like here we can't really tell what
the what the user name is is a display
name phone email so you can solve this
simply by putting in autocomplete
attributes username and password and if
you're marking out passwords use current
password because when you have account
creation or changing password forms you
can use new password for where the new
password is going and this has two
effects I'm only mentioning this because
there's one really interesting one the
first oaring one is simply this prevents
password managers from plugging a
password you already used into a new
password field but when you mark up your
forms with new password the browser can
also tell that you're trying to generate
a new password and you can do it for
them like we can we can go ahead and
just Auto generate a password for you so
instead of a password like this you will
get this
well not exactly this I mean don't write
this down or anything something like
this like we've been experimenting with
auto-generating passwords in Chrome for
a while it's actually in Chrome Canary
dev and beta channels hope to deploy it
to stable soon but if you properly mark
up your fields with new password
that'll it will make this possible we'll
be able to do this and other browsers
will too but setting aside that stuff
what's really next generation for
sign-in is using something called the
credential management API and we've just
shipped this in Chrome it's still kind
of early days certainly not implemented
across all browsers yet but the
credential management API gets you away
from using form fields with wacky
autocomplete properties attached to it
and lets you integrate more deeply into
the sign-in process of the browser so
you can also by the way use this to sign
into federated services which is kind of
hard to do in a form so Aliexpress which
I think we talked about earlier is
actually a really great example of a
user flow because it's a shopping app
it's really important for users to be
signed in right away to ensure that if
they have items in their cart they're
still there if they have preferences or
stuff that they've been looking at or
wish lists it's already there but at the
same time you really don't want to force
the user to login as the first step like
you don't want to take that active step
of saying okay give me your user name
and password before I show you anything
because if they're our new user of
course they may just want to browse or I
may just be searching for something new
I don't want another step in my way so
with Aliexpress when in a user launches
from the home screen it loads up this
app shell and during the start up the
app asks the browser for the users
credentials if it can get them without
bothering the user and then they can
sign the user in you can see this at the
bottom here and they don't need to ask
the user at this case in this case now
they do this in the credential manager
API and the code for this flow is really
pretty straightforward there's just a
navigator credentials object and you
have a get method you can ask it you
pass it in some options you say
is a password based credential and most
importantly here I want this to be
unmediated I don't want to prompt the
user from this call so this code is
actually safe to put on every page in
your app to try to trigger sign-in
because it won't ever interrupt the
users flow it doen't won't ever pop up a
dialog it will just fail if it can't do
it automatically
now Auto sign-in is kind of new for the
web we're starting out pretty
conservative so the browser will only
hand over these credentials if the user
is turned on automatic sign-in and if
this user only has one credential for
the site if they have multiple
credentials we don't want to pick for
them we want to make sure that they they
get to choose and of course this would
be an interesting security place so we
need to make sure it's kept secure so
credential manager API is restricted to
secure contacts like many new features
and passwords are never actually
directly exposed like when you do get
what you get back as an object that has
the password which you can then hand a
fish to post to a same site endpoint and
it has to be a same site endpoint you
can't be pushing this off to other other
sites of course so once you get these
credentials when you actually want to
sign in you call fetch and pass it in a
post
now when automatic sign-in is impossible
credential manager API can still offer a
one tap login it can still say I want to
sign in and then trigger a chooser
dialog so the user can enter new
credentials or they can pick between
multiple credentials that they have so
Chrome will present an account chooser
like this one this one only has one
available but if you need to do this you
use almost exactly the code that you saw
a minute ago the only difference is
there's no unmediated in this so you can
use this flow when the user clearly has
an intent to sign in like if they click
the login button then obviously you can
run this so this is all great you
actually do need to forcibly store
credentials and this is where our
heuristics often fail but the credential
manager API
she lets developers have the ability to
choose when the save your password
prompt is triggered so chrome isn't
going to miss out on when the right time
to to trigger this is so if the user has
just entered their credentials into a
form you just create a new password
credential and tell it to store that
constructor will deal with parsing your
form pulling all the fields out that
kind of stuff and you can use this as I
mentioned before for doing federated
login Google+ Facebook any other
federated login you just have to create
that credential using whatever whatever
the particular federated credential
wants to use as an ID and a end a
provider so an identifier and then the
browser kind of just deals with the rest
of the process for you and finally of
course we can forcibly sign you out we
can say hey don't ever automatically
sign me back in always prompt the next
time that that the that you call the
credential manager API to do an
automatic sign-in so a number of
companies are already using credential
manager API or started working on it in
some cases deploying this in bits of
pieces in bits and pieces you can play
around with these today in chrome
because we ship this in chrome 51 so
it's actually turned on already but now
I want to move on and talk about paying
for things now obviously we've been able
to pay for things on the web for quite a
while and it's no surprise that given
the rise of mobile computing a majority
of commercial traffic is coming from
mobile devices like this one what is
surprising though is that 66% of
purchases are actually happening from
the web on mobile devices so by and
large users are using the web to
purchase things more than they're using
native apps to purchase things so I
guess the web isn't dead after all
but unfortunately there's a lot lower
conversion rate too and conversion rate
is a weird concept so I want to make
sure that I sort of capture the 66
percent fewer conversions equates to if
on
average you make three euros per visitor
to your site now on a mobile device
you're gonna make one euro per visitor
on your site an average like this is
pretty bad right this means mobile users
are not paying you as much or they're
not spending as much on your site now if
you if you wonder why I think the answer
is actually pretty simple just checking
out particularly on a mobile device it's
still a pretty messy problem I'm pretty
messy project
so check out forums have improved since
the beginning web Commerce of course but
fundamentally it's still kind of the
same thing I still have to manually
input my credit card info my billing
address my shipping address this has
gotten so bad for me personally by the
way I get really really excited when I
go to a forum and they have put the zip
code first and they automatically fill
out my city and state for me like I'm so
excited that they do this when if you
back up for a second I shouldn't have to
enter any of that like it should just
know what that information is and of
course this is worse on mobile devices
too because you know if you thought
typing your email address was bad try
typing a 16 digit credit card especially
when they forget to label the field
properly and it gives you the QWERTY
keyboard yeah it's a mess so just like
with sign-in our first step to solving
this problem is autofill now autofill
works on existing forms you don't have
to modify your site although it does
actually do the same kind of same kind
of autocomplete types but stores a
user's address and credit card info you
can manually save this in settings
yourself you can let it auto detect it
the chrome will synchronize it just like
with with user sign ins but so Auto
feels great I mean it does actually
improve the problem it raises our
conversion rates about 25 percent on an
existing site with no changes but
although autofill gets rid of the manual
nature of data entry it does make it
simpler for the user but it's
fundamentally the same kind of existing
checkout flow you're you're still
handing the user the same form it's just
they have a stamp for parts of it and
they just have to make sure they end up
in the right
places so the web checkout process
really needs to be kind of reinvented
overall now like I said before the
current checkout process is really
pretty forum heavy for users though the
ideal experience would really be the
server just works it out with a browser
like the browser is your user agent like
that's why we call it a user agent it
works on your behalf so sites should be
able to focus on creating an amazing
engaging shopping experience and not so
much on that last set of pages that you
have to navigate through that has a long
checkout form so this is where web
payments comes in with the payment
request API so payment request is a
simple JavaScript API it allows the
browser to handle that heavy lifting of
payment collection and give the user one
tap checkout but still make sure that
the site is going to get the right set
of information not the wrong set of
information and the user has explicitly
said yes I want to pay them this much
money so this is an openly developed
standard API no matter what browser
platform or payment method you choose
everyone should be able to pay pay
without a checkout form in the end we're
still working on this but obviously
we'll come back to that this is under
development in the w3c web payments
working group that groups goal is to
create a universal so cross browser
standard for any website to accept any
form of payment so this isn't a chrome
only API we want this to be supported
across all browsers in fact I really
want to give a shout out to Microsoft
because they've done a ton of work in
the web payments group as well I some
love all right and
and although we're targeting mobile
first with Chrome's implementation
because that's where it's most impactful
payment request is explicitly designed
to not be tied to a given platform the
goal really here is to create an open
ecosystem where any website can I accept
any form of payment
with minimal code changes and without
any proprietary one-off payment api's so
with autofill we can eliminate that
manual and tedious bit our
implementation actually uses the same
data from autofill too so you won't have
to enter your credit card details one
more time if you've already done this
and since the browser is taking care of
this the steps of collecting the right
set of information we go from having
multiple taps multiple forms to just one
you just have to approve it so the flow
here is really the site initiates a
payment request the website passes to
the browser what it needs for that so it
says how much is being are you charging
what set of items do you need then the
browser determines the intersection of
what types of payments that base of the
site supports and what payments the user
actually has what payment payment
methods and then presents a selection UI
to the user to choose which kind of
payment app this can be anything from a
simple credit card to an installed
payment app like Android pay and then
the browser gets a response back on this
and returns it to the merchant and
emergently website the merchants website
now has everything they need to process
the payment so credit card info or the
right set of tokens so looking at this
in code I know this ends up being kind
of small because it has a lot of
information on it but the real this is
by the way based on the first published
working draft this may change so like if
you go back at this slide in a year it's
probably not going to be totally right
on but we'll see when you create a
payment request which is the first line
of this all that you do is the first
parameter is an array of what supported
payment methods the merchant supports so
here they'll take Visa Mastercard Amex
Discover but that's all not any other
credit cards or other payment apps or
anything like that now the default here
is that is this right it is using credit
cards to pay for things because that's
kind of still where we go but they also
pass in the line items the set of things
are paying for whether they want
shipping options so the website can
actually support those shipping ops and
options and negotiate them later and
then update the total price now I did
talk about payment applications I wanted
to describe this a little bit in a
little bit more detail so Google
launched Android pay late last year not
late last year early last year and we've
seen phenomenal growth in people using
it to pay for things on Android devices
and and with merchants physical
merchants but what makes this even
better than using your credit card using
your credit card directly I should say
is that it uses a tokenized version of
your card and when it passes it to the
merchants so they can't reuse your card
information and of course it uses device
authentication to protect your
transaction it knows it's using your
phone it's not just a number my credit
card number so let's take a look at
Android pay all that you really do is
you have the same payment request
creation but you give it a different
supported type a different supported
payment method and here of course
Android pay has some app specific
parameters so it tells you what gateway
it's going to use what key it wants you
to use what version of the API and of
course that would be different for
different types different payment apps
so you can get started with this today
it actually is supported but it's in
Devon beta builds of Chrome for Android
it's behind a flag until we launched
late this year and then we plan to add
more platforms including desktop and the
ability for third-party payments so
other payment applications to register
with chrome in 2017
so we've been working with a large set
of partners on this they've been testing
this kind of improving it I explicitly
put this up because I wanted to prompt
people if you're interested in this it
would be great to share feedback on it
too for you to play with it talk to us
talk to the w3c s working group because
I think that we really want to get to a
great place with this API okay so now
you've got users who are logged in they
can pay for things the final area that I
really feel unlocks the potential for
progressive web apps for the web as a
platform is connecting to hardware now
the web of course already has access to
a lot of hardware devices accelerometers
on my phone game controllers camera
audio input audio output MIDI devices
lots of other stuff but I want to focus
on one area that we've been working on
lately which is Bluetooth now when I say
bluetooth I'm not talking about headsets
I'm not talking about mice
those are Bluetooth devices but I'm
talking about things like heart rate
sensors and the latest made major
version of Bluetooth version 4 which is
actually like six years old by now I
guess introduces this thing called
Bluetooth Low Energy now I'm sure you've
probably heard Bluetooth Low Energy
but you probably don't know why it's
really exciting but the interesting
thing is that it's also really weird
because unlike other tech like Wi-Fi or
Ethernet which consistently increase
their bandwidth version / version if you
look at bluetooth on the right-hand side
here
version 4 seems to have fallen off the
cliff like why did they go from a
transfer rate of 54 megabits
to 10.3 megabit well the answer is
actually pretty straightforward its
power and cost Bluetooth 1 the bluetooth
creators wanted to evolve bluetooth into
a technology that could be integrated
into thousands of devices like dozens of
devices that you would use on a daily
basis and when you do that you have to
make sure that it's trivial to pay for
you know trivial cost upfront and it's
trivial to maintain and it's trivial to
fund the battery it's like
continue to keep it powered so when you
look at this end and it comes down to
batteries and batteries are frequently
something like this it's a CR 2 CR 2032
battery like this is what actually
powers that clicker that I usually use
it doesn't provide a ton of power like
this this won't power my laptop for very
long at all and this explains why the
transfer rates are so low because it
needs to consume less power so if it
runs at a slower rate and runs the the
transfer at a slower rate it'll save a
lot of power now you don't have to worry
too much because most of the scenarios
where you're going to use bluetooth you
don't you're not trying to push like 4k
video through this right like you're
pushing control instructions for racing
cars or you're pushing data for a
bluetooth LE printer or you're
controlling bb-8 because this is
actually a Bluetooth remote control
robot there are also devices like this I
actually have one of these up here this
is a dotty LED notification display
which you can have this display anything
you want you can put custom patterns on
it but you can also set it up so that it
flashes red when something bad is
happening or whatever and I usually have
this sitting on my desktop and doing
doing weird stuff now I want to take a
look at how this works in practice I'm
going to start with a little demo here I
have a bluetooth LE device here called a
play bulb candle this is a mood setting
LED candle so we're gonna you know bring
the mood in here you can buy these for
about 20 bucks online you can actually
buy them a lot cheaper if you buy them
in bulk but the cool thing about this
and you can tell already is that it
changes color it's a full color LED and
let's switch over to the remote here
let's pull out my phone alright
so I have to leave the light off on on
this because the color actually shows up
then so I'm going to open up my demo
page connect to the device and it asked
me what I want to pair with so I'll tell
it the the candle and now from a web
page with JavaScript I can directly
control this candle kind of cool the
candle actually it has a few other
things in here too like I can set modes
in it so it flickers a little like a
real candle it flashes or pulses or does
the rainbow effect which personally I
tend to think of as the seizure effect
but let's turn that off now the really
cool thing though we we actually just
just put this up a few days ago is this
has a sensor in it there's a tiny little
hole you can't see it from there can't
even see it really in the camera but
it's a sensor for when you blow the
candle out so I'm gonna blow the candle
out and watch the watch the screen
instead oddly you can blow it back on
too which is kind of strange but ok
alright let's go back to the slide deck
okay so before I dive into the code I
need to give a few basic terms from
Bluetooth there's two two roles in
Bluetooth or the central device my phone
a peripheral device the candle and this
weird thing called GATT and GATT is how
these things communicate it's a generic
attribute profile the peripheral device
has what's called a GATT server and that
basically lets you ask it questions
about what kind of services do you
provide what characteristics to those
services have and lets you read and
write those values so you know that's
pretty much what I said here so
basically each service contains one or
several characteristics can have
multiple values some of these are
standardized like battery service to
tell the battery level is a common thing
you can query any device that supports
the battery service how you know what
is your battery at and it will tell you
in a consistent way now I want to run
through some JavaScript code superfast
on how to do this we actually have a
code lab on how to do this we have a
number of the devices here that you can
play with tomorrow if you want but in
general you just call navigator
bluetooth request device you pass it
some options that lets you filter what
devices there are because there's tons
of Bluetooth devices around in most
common scenarios today and actually this
filter list is not optional
you have to filter it down somewhat you
have to say well I'm looking for
something that's you know named play
bulb or I'm looking for something that
supports a battery service or something
like that
so this that's what this example
actually does it looks for anything that
supports battery service once you've
selected a device you know once we
popped up that dialog the users chosen
to pair it you have access to a
Bluetooth device object which you can
connect to the GATT server and you can
ask it ask it what it supports or you
can ask it for a specific service two
things that I should note here one when
you request the device to begin with it
has to be inside a user interaction like
a click on a button and secondly of
course like all powerful features that
in the web platform now you have to do
this from secure HTTPS pages works fine
on localhost too of course so then you
can get services and characteristics so
here you get the service the battery
service you get the battery level read
value tells you what the battery
percentage is pretty straightforward
writing to services that actually just
as easy this is the code to write the
color to the plate bold candle so you
start out you request the device you
connect to it you connect to the candle
service you connect to the candle color
characteristic and then you write it
like you write a value to it so this is
pretty straightforward although you're
probably asking wait a second there
these magic candle service UUID values
and candle color UUID so it's possible
your Bluetooth device comes with the
programmers guide some of them do you
can actually get one
dottie but if not you can also install
their whatever their control software is
like there's a play bulb candle app for
Android and then enable the developer
option in Android settings that lets you
snoop on the packets and you can tell
what characteristics and everything
they're they're using now to be notified
when a characteristic changes like when
I blew out the candle all you have to do
is add an event listener on when that
characteristic changes whenever the
characteristics value changes the event
handler gets called I did by the way I
want to briefly connect web bluetooth
with another project the physical web so
physical web is about beacons low-cost
Bluetooth devices like this that just
broadcast a URL like Bluetooth devices
broadcast their presence anyways these
broadcasts specifically a URL so people
in the first few rows you may actually
be picking this one up but then the goal
of them is to make interacting with
smart devices as simple and fast as
possible so as long as physical web is
enabled on your phone you will actually
see physical what web pages are nearby
and they get filtered by a web service
so this won't be too spammy and the
train that you're on can actually
broadcast the link to their schedule a
parking meter can broadcast the payment
app a dog collar can broadcast its
owners contact information now in the
future though this is the cool part this
is why I'm connecting these because this
isn't a physical web talk in the future
we're going to integrate the physical
web with web bluetooth with a feature
called referring device so if you
navigate to a physical web beacons URL
this actually gets exposed when we load
the page that it came from a specific
Bluetooth device and when you know that
this exposes the GATT server the
Bluetooth device directly so if you walk
up to a parking meter you don't have to
figure out then which actual parking
meter and my app because it just went to
a URL you can actually make sure of that
because you're connecting directly to
the device so web bluetooth requires you
to flip on an experimental flag in
chrome today
it also works on Chrome OS Chrome for
Android marshmallow Chrome for Linux
we're diligently working on the OS 10
and Windows implementations if you're on
lollipop you can still use it but you
have to use a chromium build and it's
also implemented in Opera so to get
started if you're interested by the way
just Google web Bluetooth samples it's
really the easiest thing like I said
we've got a code lab that we're running
tomorrow and a bunch of devices to play
around with we also have a pile of
physical web beacons that you can keep
we don't have enough for everyone I
don't think so we'll figure out how to
you know throw them at people was my
idea but they said no with that you know
I I hope this gives you an idea of some
of the exciting areas that are going to
make progressive web apps even more
exciting in the future I hope you've
learned a lot today please come back
tomorrow
we've got lots more talks from other
browser vendors partners and you have a
chance to talk with us in office hours
and experiment in the code labs so thank
you very much and I think Paul Kinlan is
going to come back up and close things
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
