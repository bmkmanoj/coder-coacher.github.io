is the current direction that we're
moving in the pioneering progressive web
app technology in Africa so my name is
Andrew Morey and I'm the director of
technology at conga conga is an online
shopping mall an online marketplace that
has a wide range of products from
electronics to to home and garden to
livestock we've reduced the the amount
of data that's being used so for first
time load we've had a 92% reduction in
data to load the home page to input my
search term or navigate to a product to
add to cart to check it out we'd reduce
the amount of data that's being used to
achieve that by 82% it's been a very
interesting journey I don't think most
companies have this opportunity but for
us we were able to start from scratch we
are currently going through a reap LAT
forming project and that allowed us to
say hey we would like to rebuild our
mobile web
so let's not connect it to the old
system let's build a new mobile web user
experience it connected to the new
system
it's add an app manifest to your
application and allows you to add an add
the app to homescreen and also launch in
standalone mode we use part of the app
shell architecture to load our static
content that's particularly HTML CSS and
all the JavaScript that we require to to
bootstrap our application we store that
in the app shell architecture and then
we implemented the serviceworker whether
you're in an urban area or a remote area
of Nigeria network connectivity is a
problem and generally if you haven't
thought about offline capability first
you'll end up with a user looking at a
white screen or some sort of spinner by
using progressive web app technology by
implementing this network proxy with the
serviceworker which is actually quite a
lot more than a network proxy is you
gain control over that their behavior in
that network they're in that the
creative network and you can respond in
an immersive way an engaging way that
doesn't push the user outside of the app
the things that inspire me are
witnessing people come to our company
for services
and watching their business grow on our
platform and literally seeing how their
sales improve and through that
improvement in sales people's children
who go to work can go to school their
lives becoming enriched through through
the services that we're providing them
and the actual underlying technology the
programming that we're doing to to just
produce those services that's what's
inspiring to me
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
