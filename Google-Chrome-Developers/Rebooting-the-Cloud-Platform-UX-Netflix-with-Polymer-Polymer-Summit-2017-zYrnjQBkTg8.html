software engineer on the cloud platform
team at Netflix today I'd like to talk
to you about our journey to reboot the
cloud platform user experience within
Netflix and how we're using polymer as
we go about doing that so let's get
started here's a quick overview of the
topics we'll be covering today I'll
start with the brief introduction to the
cloud platform engineering organization
at Netflix and what we do will then go
on a quick whirlwind tour of a few
different types of apps we've been
building using polymer 5 apps in about 5
minutes
next I'll talk about reboot our internal
component library and some tooling that
we built for a better developer
experience then we'll look at the road
ahead with polymer 2 and I'll share an
incremental approach that we're taking
the migrate with minimal pain and
finally we'll circle back to apps
specifically state management in larger
apps and some experimenting we're doing
in that space so cloud platform
engineering who are we and what do we do
at Netflix it all yours are fiends
charter at high level we provide a
common set of foundational building
blocks to Netflix engineers so that they
can focus on core business value rather
than recreating these infrastructure
layers so some examples of these
building blocks include data stores like
cassandra dynamite and elastic search of
the service capsicum messaging and
stream processing as a service Atlas our
internal system for aggregating
operational metrics across all of our
services and so on so all of this sounds
like a lot of like server-side stuff
raid but all of these services we
provide as an organization become much
more usable when we offer self-service
apps that empower our engineers to get
on-boarded quickly and leverage the
capabilities of our systems without
roadblocks inside tools like dashboards
and visualizations together with control
plans also help our engineers detect
issues and fix them quickly and
effectively without having to switch
between multiple
tools and command line scripts when they
get paged in the middle of the night and
building all of these apps is where we
come in so let's go on a tour of some
examples of apps you built for these
various systems they're all quite
different from each other so this
segment should give you a good sense of
the variety of app types that can be
built using polymer and web components
let's start with lumen lumen is our
dashboard builder for operational
insights and it's widely used by
engineers across the company the plot
time series data collected and
aggregated by add Atlas are metrics data
store so they can observe meaningful
changes in these metrics over periods of
time so here's an example of a time
series dashboard that's used by a cloud
databases team to track ways to send the
cluster metrics like i/o operations and
latency is over time so web components
are a great fit for this use case
because we can have a simple public API
for these graph components encapsulate
all of the logic to fetch these metrics
and render them and then enable anyone
to drop these components into any other
internal app that we have including
those that are built in other frameworks
like react angular and ember which we
have within within Netflix as well but
lumen also supports more than just time
series data it also supports the concept
of cell types which are components that
visualize the data that's passed into
them in different ways so for example
there are cell types for pie charts
histograms bubble charts data tables
what have you and each of these is
written as a custom element using
polymer so here we can see a single real
time data source that's been connected
to six different cell types to visualize
the data in different ways users can
also write custom data mappers which are
just JavaScript functions that take the
data that's passed in to them and then
convert that to a format that can be
understood by any visualization type so
here's an example that shows data from
elasticsearch being mapped to different
cell types and visualizing that data in
different ways
next let's take a look at Casper a
custom health check dashboard that we
built for our fleet of Cassander
database clusters so at a high level
Casper visualizes the entire health of
all of our saundra clusters in the fleet
as a tree map showing simple red yellow
or green states the sizes of the boxes
are proportional to the footprint of the
cluster itself obviously the cluster
names have been anonymized here you'll
often find this page projected onto a
wall-mounted TV right next to our cloud
database team sits in the office so what
makes this dashboard quite unique from a
front-end perspective is that the data
source is a is a high volume firehose of
data being streamed in via WebSockets
from it from a job that's aggregating
all of this health check data from over
10,000 different Cassandra cluster nodes
so in order to not completely lock up
our main rendering thread we process
this incoming data in a web in a web
worker and post message back when we
need to rerun their changes so when a
specific cluster goes red an on-call
engineer can look at gasworks cluster
details page you quickly get oriented
with the current state of the cluster
without having to switch between
multiple apps or command line scripts so
this page describes the topology of the
cluster how many instances it has what
regions it's in any running maintenance
jobs that may be impacting cluster
performance and it even includes charge
of some of the most relevant metrics
like read and write operations and so on
and in fact the the Atlas charts that
you see at the bottom here are the same
ones that you saw in lumen earlier
that's the power of components there now
you'll notice that this dashboard also
sports a dark theme which is unlike most
of our other apps so this was a good
test for the theme ability of some of
our components so our polymer elements
expose CSS custom properties that Casper
could override with its own color scheme
to get them all to blend in with it with
its look and feel so now that you've
seen a couple of examples of dashboard
style apps let's continue our tour with
something a little different so Keystone
is our new real-time data pipeline that
allows
Engineers to send events and logs to
hive tables elasticsearch clusters and
kafka topics this is the collection
pipeline that's used to gather data for
hundreds of the a bit of a B test that
we run as well as some of our
personalization algorithms and this is
Keystone self-service a web app for
engineers to manage their data streams
so we use d3 to build out a visual
representation of the data stream as a
directed graph with colors motion and
tooltips along the edges reflecting
actual data flow metrics Engineers can
also use this view to make any config
updates for any of their outputs or to
change the topology of the cluster of
the data stream by simply dragging and
dropping nodes to rearrange them so the
encapsulation provided by custom
elements and shadow Dom was really
beneficial here because we could build a
simple graph this graph component as a
as a self-contained component with a
simple public API and all of its complex
implementation details neatly hidden
away since all of the SVG nodes are
within the elements shadow route they're
protected from the rest of the apps code
and CSS styles moving on to the Netflix
data Explorer and as the name suggests
this is a tool that allows our engineers
to explore and update their data in our
cloud data stores so here we're looking
specifically at the data explorer for
dynamite our key value store that's
built on top of Redis although the apps
architecture allows us to layer in
support for other data stores as well so
using the reddit API dynamite X flow
allows users to search for data by keys
now we need it to scale to handle
millions of keys for cluster so we use a
virtualized list like the awesome iron
list element an infinite scroll style
pagination to keep the UI running
smoothly without skipping a beat so you
can see that it's handling about like
145 million keys in this case so in
addition to simple data types like
strings dynamite Explorer also supports
complex data types like JSON values
hashes lists sets and sorted sets
and the data explorer engineers no
longer need to figure out like which
boxes to hop on to and what data store
specific commands you need to run when
they simply need to look up or update
some data so you may have noticed that
this app heavily makes use of the paper
and iron elements along with the
material design styling it so having
this rich palette of well built well
tested components available to us
allowed us to rapidly prototype and
build out this you are in a very short
period of time so we could spend time
also building out and optimizing or
nodejs API layer as well as like adding
additional features like single sign-on
auditing and so on and last but not the
least is Winston studio our app for
operational runbook automation so let's
say you're an on-call engineer and
whenever you get paged in the middle of
the night for a particular issue you
perform a series of steps from a run
book to diagnose and fix the issue
so Winston is our internal platform lets
you automate those steps in response to
alert and Winston studio is the web app
that they use to wire up author and test
these automations so here's an example
of a simple automation that collects
logs from a server and emails them to me
when a health check failure email fires
so you can edit the Python code for this
automation right in the browser itself
with syntax highlighting and basic
syntax checks and before promoting it
the tester prod you can actually test
this with incremental e with a fixed set
of input parameters so this is another
unique app compared to some of our other
examples because it's almost like an IDE
in in in the browser itself we're using
code mirror for the editor component
here and the nice thing about a
component based app architecture is that
we can lazy load some of these larger
third-party dependencies only when a
user actually gets to this page in the
app so those were just some of the many
apps that we've been busy building using
polymer with a Netflix
to recap here are some of the
interesting takeaways that emerge from
some of these app examples so custom
elements and shadow Dom give us a great
encapsulation model allowing us to build
complex components
with simple public API s and shadow
roots that shield them from global
styles G mobility can be achieved using
CSS custom properties and the add apply
mixin we're also looking forward to the
part and theme specs that we talked
about earlier web workers are a great
way to do background work off of the
main UI thread virtualize lists like the
iron list for example combined with
paginating api you can give us fast
fluid performance even when we're
dealing with huge amounts of data and a
component based app architecture allows
us to lazy load just the dependencies we
need for the views that a user has
requested all right so now if you're
looking closely you may have noticed
that many of these apps have a lot of
things in common right so modern web
development across most libraries and
frameworks these days is centered around
apps composed of components in the case
of polymer these components are web
components or more specifically custom
elements in this section I'll talk about
our approach to building component
libraries and some tooling that we built
for a better developer experience so
being a small team with lots of apps to
build and improve and maintain we take a
some more pragmatic approach to building
new components when we can find high
quality style components in the vibrant
open source ecosystem and there are many
we use them and build on top of them
rather than reinventing our own we then
augment these with our own elements that
are specific to our internal use cases
and we use CSS custom properties and the
app apply mix-ins from our internal
style guide to apply consistent styling
across all of these components in terms
of colors typography spacing and so on
now when it comes to building our own
components we also wanted to have a
consistent and streamlined developer
experience this includes things like
scaffolding out new elements and
iterating on them generating API Doc's
demo pages and making it really easy to
do semantic versioning when you need to
new versions of your element so a couple
of years ago before the awesome sea
polymer CLI as we know it today existed
we built the reboot CLI internally so
this is a command-line tool that a
developer can install using NPM and then
use it to scaffold up new components
with the consistent structure a common
es link profile and a set of common NPM
tasks to perform various actions the NPM
run them tasks like you probably expect
this files up a poly so of dev server so
you can begin building and iterating on
your new component but there are a
couple of other interesting things that
the reboot CLI can do the first of these
is auto generating API Doc's for an
element's properties and events so we do
this by piping the element definition
through a custom babel plugin that
reverses the syntax tree and generates a
markdown file containing the list of
property names there types and
descriptions list of custom events the
element emits and so on and this also
includes links to the specific line
numbers in the source code for all of
these things so having this in a
markdown file makes it really easy to
look up the API Doc's for an element
either directly in the get get or stash
repo where it lives or in our element
catalog where we convert that to to HTML
the second is easy and consistent
semantic versioning of elements so when
you're ready to release a new version of
your element you simply run npm run
release and you tell it if this is a
major minor or patch version bump reboot
version then automatically figures out
what the current version number is auto
increments the appropriate position the
version string updates package.json
creates the get tag and pushes to origin
all in one one quick step so as you can
see we've been using polymer one for a
little while now and we've built a bunch
of components and a bunch of apps and
now it's time to start migrating all of
those over to polymer 2 so we just
started going down that path fairly
recently so I thought I'd share an
approach we're taking depending on what
the app type
and so on so to start with from making
the latest stable version of polymer 1
the baseline across all of our shared
elements and the apps that use them this
is this basically ensures that we can
safely use hybrid style elements
everywhere it's a good practice to
regularly keep up with the latest
polymer versions anyway so this step
Shirin and mol many big breaking changes
now we easily start working on a couple
of brand new apps these were perfect
candidates for actually starting out
with the the new polymer 2 library and
es6 classes for the app specific
elements but these new apps also depend
on some shell elements from our
component catalog grade so we took this
opportunity to convert those shared
legacy element to the hybrid style so
that they can work in both polymer 1
apps and the new polymer 2 apps that
we're building when we eventually have
es6 class versions of those shared
components we can simply swap those in
and now we have a fully migrated polymer
2 app but what about existing apps rate
existing apps I think we can take two
different approaches depending on the
size complexity and rate of change so
for small apps and apps that aren't
being updated much anymore we start
using polymer 2 and upgrade their app
specific elements directly to es6
classes because these apps are small and
not changing very frequently we can skip
the intermediate step of converting
these two hybrid elements and again once
when we have the shared elements
upgraded 3sx classes as well we can
simply swap those in and we have a fully
might get it out for larger apps and
once there are still like in active
development things get a little trickier
it's a bit more challenging to do a Big
Bang migration all at once so for such
apps we started converting their app
elements to the hybrid style first while
still running the polymer was 1.9
version of the library once that's done
we can just replace polymer 1 with
polymer 2 and continue running in hybrid
mode any new app specific elements that
we write
now will then be written as es6 classes
and we can director actively start
converting some of the older elements to
the es6 style as well and again like the
previous two cases once the shared
elements are upgraded as well we simply
swap those in and we have a fully
migrated app so those are just some of
the different strategies we can take
depending on what type of app we're
talking about and that brings us to our
last topic which is state management
also happens to be my favorite one
probably just because of the stranger
things reference so as you are working
on a number of apps especially larger
ones composed of lots of nested
components we started running into some
pain points around state and shared
state specifically so let's briefly dive
in to what the problem was using a
couple of examples so say you've got a
parent component in its child that share
in some common bit of state a common
pattern in such a situation is to make
the parent component the source of truth
for that state and pass it down to the
child as a property if the child that
needs to change the value of that state
it simply emits an event that the parent
listens for the pen then makes so change
their property and passes it back down
to the child and everything just works
but consider this example here is a
deeply nested child that cares about the
same bit of state as a parent a few
levels up in this case the property has
to be passed down every intermediate
component the hierarchy even though
these intermediaries don't really care
about that state besides just passing it
down so they're just acting as pass
throughs same thing with the events
bubbling up from the child and here's
another situation in this one two
sibling components need to share a bit
of common State so now you have to find
a common parent ancestor and store the
state in that even though it doesn't
actually do anything with that state
besides passing it down to the children
as properties this example also
illustrates a potential problem when the
refactor or design change causes one
of these child components to move
elsewhere in the individual hierarchy
you now have to move this component
there find a new parent a new common
parent and then play the property
passing game all over again so it turns
out this is a very popular project Redux
that aims to ease some of this pain it's
described as a predictable state
container for JavaScript apps and you
heard Kevin talk about this a little
earlier today as well so we've had
several teams within Netflix using Redux
quite successfully with react but
there's nothing really easy Act specific
about Redux so we've started
experimenting with it in some of our
larger polymer apps as well so the
central concept in Redux is the store
which is an object tree containing all
of the shared state for an application
properties on individual components can
be mapped to specific slices of the
store so they're automatically updated
when the state changes components can
also dispatch actions to the store when
they need to update some part of the
state so this is great because our
shared state now all lives in one place
and is only passed to components that
actually care about it so an open source
library called polymer redux by
Christopher Turner makes using redux
with polymer quite simple once your
component class extends the mixin
creator of this library you can add the
state path to any of your property
definitions and they'll basically change
whenever the store updates that value of
the path of the state tree components
also inherit at this patch method from
the mixin that they can use to dispatch
actions instructing the store to make a
state change so what's next for our
experiment with with redux
well firstly we are still evaluating so
redux may or may not be the right
solution for every app type or every use
case so we're still trying to figure out
where it makes sense to use it versus
not second in apps that are using redux
most of our said app state already lives
in this redox tour
but there's also this additional state
that lives in the URL in the form of
path parameters and query parameters so
could we have the the Vidocq store
capture some of that as well so the app
can now handle all of that state in the
same way can we keep the the URL in the
Redux store in sync
why directionally that's something that
we've just started exploring recently
just a few weeks ago in fact it looks
something like this so similar to how
the the polymer redux library has the
state path concept we can declare like
this query parameter here and then our
mixin now is responsible for keeping the
the URL always in sync with the piggy
duck store so our app now needs to it
our app can basically read the the state
exactly the same way so diving into the
depths of redux can be a whole talk in
and of itself and we don't really have
much time for that today
props down and events up works really
great in many many cases and you should
stick to that pattern if it's working
for you but if you'd like to learn more
about redux here and how it can be used
with polymer your some resources that
you can check out so there's the the
Vidocq site itself of course there's the
polymer he talks library that I
mentioned and then there's these couple
of Awesome polycast videos on YouTube by
by Rob Dodson that actually show you how
to use the polymer redox library as well
as do some of the the async stuff with
it using thunks yeah and that covers
everything I wanted to talk to you about
today again my name is Graham kunda J
and you can find me on twitter as at
Kunal thank you for being a great
audience and have an awesome time at the
rest of the summit
