Yvonne yep I am the author of neon
animation and I'm gonna talk to you
about how it helps you make awesome
animations in polymer so animations are
really important part of material design
if you look at the spec you find
examples of animations everywhere like
how UI element reacts when you interact
with it and if you use an animation to
switch between two views it helps the
user understand how the application
works by creating a relationship between
the thing you interact with and new view
that's coming so it's such a core part
of the design language and not just like
Google we want to build something in
polymer to help you build these effects
so in polymer we like to say everything
is an element and that includes
animations it turns out if we make
animations elements to that leads to
some really nice properties so the first
thing is animations become reusable you
can build it once and it will be nicely
encapsulated in elements we can easily
reuse it in different places so to go
with that we want to build a system
that's pluggable so think about a
dialogue where when it opens and closes
you want a different transition to run
or maybe the animation that comes with
it's not what you want
you want to be able to swap out
different effects easily and also it's
really awesome if the animation you're
trying to reuse is exactly what you want
it often it's just not quite right so by
mechanical components we can build in
the flexibility to let the user
configure it so it's uh it's the fact
that you want it instead of what the
author of the animation intended and if
you're the author of the animation
the abstraction allows you to do
whatever you want and you also get with
great polymer features that make it so
easy to use that's super important for
us because became performing and
performing animations it's already
really difficult we want to be able to
encapsulate best practices to make a
good animation especially when they
become more complex so in polymer we
always want to use the platform and
embrace any new emerging technologies so
we can build this using CSS animations
and transitions or you can just do it
wrong JavaScript but there's actually
something better so in neon we use
something called web animations
it's a w3c specification it defines a
unified model for CSS and SVG animations
on a web platform it provides the
scripting API to the animation engine so
currently version 1.0 of the spec is
implemented naval in chrome and parts of
it in Firefox and there's general
support among other browser vendors but
for now for these other platforms of a
polyfill so the API gives you a bunch of
great features including nested in
sequence animations you can program
animations with groups and timing delays
at runtime without running CSS it gives
you playback control so you can play
pause slow down or speed up in animation
and webination so one run off the main
thread so they're junk free and I really
think it's the future of animating
things on a web platform we want to make
it even easier to use in your polymer
elements so let's dive in there how neon
animation works so let's look at how we
build this example in neon this actually
comes in the package is one of the demos
so in neon we divide all the different
elements into either either their an
animation or they can be animatable
so an animation element is the animation
effect is independent of the target
that's animating you can apply to
different elements so one super simple
example is like the sliding effect in
the purple bar or it could be something
more complicated like this effect where
all the cards are flying up so what this
effect is is basically a slide up effect
apply to all these different cards but
with a delay in between and we call the
animation target D animatable element so
it could be a dialog which is animated
in different ways or just like regular
Elmen can compose can be composed of
different elements one animatable
element could have child elements that
also animate all elements so in our
example this whole view is a single
animatable element okay so building an
animation in neon so here's the actual
source code for slide on animation in
neon it implements the neon animation
behavior and we register the animation
with the tag name so in this case lie
down
so the configure function is where the
animation get set up with any with the
animated target and also where you pass
any options like different timing
parameters so each animation could
define other can fake properties so for
slide down you can also pass in a custom
transform origin so to build the actual
animation we return the keyframe effect
from configure and keyframe effects is a
object in web and agents that animates
keyframes so what are keyframes it's
associates as properties and their
values at a particular point in time so
the system interpolates between these
values to create a smooth animation
you can use any CSS properties in the
keyframes but for performance you should
stick to your pass today and transform
and that's because modifying these
properties they don't trigger paint or
layout in the browser so you avoid jank
and usually browsers who have
optimizations for animating these
properties so you can't fathom any
keyframes as you want you're not limited
to by default they're spaced out evenly
but it's configurable and you have
multiple properties in a keyframe and
the thing to make sure is in each
keyframe you should define the same bag
of properties so you just assume knows
where what value all the properties have
in each keyframe and if you do have
different ones then you can put them in
a ray in a group effect so guerilla
effects you can use that also if you
want to make one animation that animates
different notes so they're running
parallel so it'll be really painful if
all the basic animations that you want
to do you have to create something like
that by yourself
so in neon we have a library of built-in
effects that you can use to build your
animations so we include different kinds
of transforms and fades and there's a
bunch of other ones that we'll talk
about in a little bit okay so we know
how to make an animation how do we use
it so one way is you can just create the
animation elements and call the API
yourself but there's tons of boilerplate
every time you want to animate something
so we made a behavior for that and this
is called neon and it made of all
behavior so when you make something neon
animated old behavior that means it
contains objects in those local Dom that
can be animated or it itself can be
animated so in our case we made a whole
grid animatable so I omitted the
template here but you can imagine a
template would contain the Perl toolbar
and then all the cars that are flying up
it also elements the neon and
runner behavior and that gives you the
API to play the animation so you might
wonder why we need a separate behavior
for that and that's because usually we
like to make our elements and behaviors
really focused and you can imagine a
case when something is animatable but it
itself is not responsible for running
the animation and something external is
responsible for doing that
so nyan animatable behavior it has
support for a configuration object named
animation config which is where you
declare which animations you want to use
for this element so here we're setting
it in ready so you always get the same
options but you can change this object
anytime before the animation is played
so to use slide on animation we set the
name property to slide down and we want
to animate the promo bar so we set no to
this dollar purple bar so let's talk
dollars a polymer feature where you can
reference the note in your template by
the ID you can also pass in any options
to the animation in the configuration
object so a common one is timing that's
where you can change the default
duration delay or apply an easing to the
animation so any timing you pass in is
10 milliseconds so in this case we're
set to 2000 and you can see that the
purpose bar slides down more slowly okay
so you can pass multiple animations in
the configuration option if you want
more than one animation to run at the
same time so here we once lie down and
cascade an animation to run concurrently
cascaded animation what it does is it
applies another animation to a groove
nose with a delay in between so here we
are using a custom transform transform
animation it's just like
something up so we could have you slide
up also but it was a good time to show
another animation that comes with the
package and another thing you might
notice is in cascaded animation we don't
set nose here that's just because
there's no space in the slide and we can
just use query selector to pass the nose
in okay so the animations in a raid they
all start running at the same time so
you want to sequence it you can add a
delay using timing so here the purple
bar slides down a little bit after the
Cascade effect so you can associate
different animations within a component
that's useful for when the same notes is
being animated in different ways at
different time and to do that you set
animation can fake to a map so we'll
just call the one which is Bill entry
and we'll add exit that auto assisted
slice up the purple bar so we saw play
animation API earlier if you have more
than one animation defined you can pass
an argument to this function and here it
will play entry so something to remember
is the animation effect it doesn't
persist by default after it completes so
that means if your animation is changing
States so for example you're animating
something from visible to invisible
when the animation finishes you need to
apply the finish date so invisible so we
have an event called neon animation
finish which gets play which is fired
when all the animations are completed
and in the event handler is where you
should apply your final state so the
reason we make you do this yourself is
for debugging so right now if you if a
style gets applied because of web
animations
it's not really easy in the dev tools to
know why it got there so it'll be easier
if we manage to stay outside your other
methods like a CSS classes or if you're
applying inline styles or something like
that okay so now we know how to make
animations and use them in an element so
let's talk about page transitions so we
call something a page transition when
you're switching between two views so it
could be something really simple like
here where we're sliding a view away or
it can be something more complicated
like switching between two views that's
totally different in a single page app
so let's add another page to this
example so when we click one of these
cards we want to scale up like this the
element we use to do this is called neon
animated pages so it itself is based on
top of the ideas that we talked about it
implies the own animatable behavior
because it contains the pages they're
being animated and it influenced neon
animation runner behavior because it's
responsible for running the animation so
the way we think about an animation is
we break it down into two parts so
before I was talking about multiple
animations in an element I picked the
name entry and exit and actually the
down on purpose because they're the keys
that neon animated pages looks for when
it runs the page transition so entry is
the animation that gets played when this
view where this page comes into view and
exit gets played when it goes away so
when you switch from page a to page B
the exit page the exit animation come
place an alchoholic page and the entry
animation plays in the incoming page and
together they form the whole transition
and remember that the configuration
object is you don't set at one time you
can set it wherever you want so if the
pending on the 2 in front pages you want
to run a different animation you can
totally reconfigure that before you do
the actual page switch so to use neon
animated pages we nest the page of this
managing in the neon animated pages
object so we'll make the first page the
grid that I show before so the second
page would be the bigger card with a
color background and both these pages
they should implement neon animatable
behavior so the currently drawing page
is selected so when you change the
selected property yon enemy pages will
shows and hyesoo appropriate pages for
you and also place the animations so I
talked about well use neon you have to
manage the states yourself but for neon
animated pages we do that for you so
usually the way I like to do something
that has a page transition is I would
build a static Dom without animations
and and get a lot your working first and
then work on using animation config to
add the effects I want so let's go back
to the example we want the card to
expand to fill the screen so in both
views you have the same card so how do
we get this working how do you get a
single animation working across two
pages so we call that share element
animation so that means we're animating
elements in totally different dom
subtrees so they look quite they're
single element so the way this works is
in both incoming and outgoing page we
define the shared element property so
when a system runs the animation it uses
to this property to look for objects
that should be matched together so this
matches this doctor the card in the
full-size page with the tap target in
the grid so we identified the pair with
the key
the animation that does that is called
hero animation so what it does is it
finds to share element in the incoming
and outgoing page and it scales the
element in the incoming page so it looks
like the outgoing page and then makes
the transition go
so we also tell it the ID to share
element ID to look for so in general if
you have two configs that have the same
ID they merge together so you can
actually use that to define different
configuration properties and different
places and if the two can fix they
define the same probably with different
values then the behavior is undefined so
here's what the transition looks like
with just the hero animation anyone else
start a background just come popping in
doesn't look super awesome so let's add
another effects to make it ripple out
from where you tapped that comes in the
neon package as the ripple animation
it's also a share element animation
because what it does is it takes the
background from the incoming page and
scales it to the according to a geometry
of your tap target so okay so let's wrap
this up by adding a few more animations
so we also have a transition that to
switch back to the grid so we should
spider grid we can slide up and scale
the big card and we'll fade out the
background and for the incoming page and
the grid we'll just reuse what they'll
be for of the Cascade and the slide down
okay so here's the full transition with
one way and the other direction so um we
haven't written very much code to build
this we're just reusing elements that
come in the neon package that's
something that flows naturally when we
make everything and
you know you might think that one Lego
block is not super interesting but when
you combine a bunch of them together
then you can make something really cool
okay so we cover a lot of material today
so here's a bunch of additional
resources you can look at when you check
out the neon package it comes to a bunch
of different demos and also on the
element our website you can find the API
Docs and a guy that goes into a little
bit more detail about how all the
configuration works and Rob Dodson our
emcee made two awesome polycast episodes
one on using neon animation to make an
animated element and also one on using
neon anime pages and debri awesome so
you should check them out okay so that's
it for me I'll be around the floor after
if you have any questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
