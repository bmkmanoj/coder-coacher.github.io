so that knows absolutely nothing about
web push so ask me to give this micro
tip when developers start working web
push it's not entirely obvious how you
can test the logic in your push event
for example you might send different
kinds of payload and you want to see how
your push event handles it so instead of
sending actual push messages here's a
simple little trick to testing the logic
inside your push event in chrome go to
website that's set up to work with push
open up dev tools and go to the console
tab from here you can change the context
from top to your serviceworker now after
you've done this any commands that you
type in will actually be entered and run
in your serviceworker
now this enables us to dispatch our own
fake push events and they're like just
like a normal push message would so for
example we can fake a push message with
no data by running self dispatch event
new push event push now this is cool but
it's really useful when you start adding
data which we can do by passing in an
object into our push events constructor
with a data parameter for example to
emulate a JSON payload and just passing
in Jason's or stringify some data and we
can see how the push event would handle
this now with this you can start testing
different kinds of data that you'd
actually send as well as different edge
cases perhaps like where you're sending
payloads that you weren't actually
expecting so good luck with your testing
and thanks for watching if you haven't
read rural symptoms of pull and Surma
you can watch more supercharged here but
if you subscribe to channel above you
can watch a much better show called
