back to the show so it's been a little
while since we last talked in the
previous episode we started off a series
using carbon route to build an
application and actually since we did
that episode the polymer team has
renamed that element to a Prout so we're
gonna picking up where we left off the
last time this time they will be using a
Prout to continue working on our blog
and what we're gonna do is we're going
to make sure that we can lazy load
content on this blog and we can also
manage the flash of unstyled content
that we see when we switch between pages
on a slower connection so 2 to grok what
I'm talking about here let's switch over
to the laptop and you'll see that I've
got the the blog as we left it last time
showing here and I'm going to just go
over to the the network panel and I will
click this tab right here and this will
let me actually throttle my connection
down let me zoom in on this a little bit
so it's easier to see so I'll go to you
the network tab
I will go over to right over here which
is throttling and we can set our
connection to something like regular 3G
so this is what someone on a typical
cell phone connection is going to
experience when they're trying to use
our site so maybe I go and I click on
the film section and maybe I go and
click on one of these when these posts
and I go back to the art section and you
just see how there was kind of like a
like a moment where we saw a flash of
the old film section when we switch to
the art section that's kind of the thing
that I want to address today I want to
deal with that flash of unstyled content
make sure that when our users are using
our application the only thing they're
seeing is kind of the the relevant page
and something that's really fresh and
up-to-date so to do that we're gonna
switch over to our code editor and this
is where we we left the project last
time and I've already gone ahead and
renamed and and downloaded our app route
renamed it throughout our project so we
don't have to do anything there any
place you see carbon route in the old
project we can just update that to a pro
out the API and everything is still
essentially the same just kind of a
small name change so thankfully we don't
have to do a lot of work there now one
thing that we do need to do which I
noticed in the previous episode is I
made a little mistake in this blog app
element so if you see down here when we
set up our
selector menu in the previous episode as
passing category data as this two-way
binding like this and while this you
know is is cool and it this this this
approach did actually work what was
happening was it was creating this weird
situation where when you clicked on this
binding because it was a two-way binding
what happened was first it would look
down at this data page element and it
would say oh you're trying to go to the
film section so I'm just going to update
Carbon location to slash film then it
would see that well actually we clicked
on an anchor so we want to go to / films
/ list and I say okay cool well I'll
update it too / films / list now what
would happen then is we would change the
URL twice really really fast so fast
that no one would notice it if they're
just looking at the site but if you hit
the back button they would go back to
slash film we don't actually have a film
page so everything would just break so
the fix there is pretty simple what we
want to do is we just want to change
this to a one-way binding so basically
the menu always gets its information
passed down to it from carbon location
and you know if you click an anchor or
something it'll dispatch that event
that'll go back up through carbon
location back down to our elements this
is nice
one way loop and that solves that but
now the next thing we want to do is we
want to tackle that funky weird flash of
unstyled content and there's two things
that are going on here the first is I'm
loading new JSON for the page so our
text is gonna swap and the second is
we're loading new paths for our images
and those actually have to go out and
fetch the images and sort of redownload
them so i want to tackle each of these
problems individually I'll start with
you know what to do so we don't display
kind like stale or outdated text and my
thinking here is I'm probably gonna
display like an overlay over the screen
with like a little spinner so that way
you know the user doesn't see like a
weird swapper rule with our headings
they just see a spinner page and then
when that contents finally ready it just
sort of reveals the new heading and the
new paragraph content so to do that I'll
go over to this blog pages element and
I'm just gonna go ahead and drop in a
div I'm gonna call this overlay and
inside of here I will drop in a paper
spinner and I'll just leave it with this
this active attribute
and I need to go up to the top and make
sure that I have imported paper spinner
okay so far so good there and then I'm
going to go to my overlay and I want to
give it some CSS style so it's actually
like fullscreen so going to drop in a
little bit of CSS I've already got the
CSS save because I'm totally cheating
here and I'm gonna boost this up a
little bit so you can read it a bit
easier okay so here I'm positioning the
overlay so it's absolute top left right
and bottom are all 0 so it's actually
gonna stretch to fill the entire screen
I'm saying it to you display flex and
setting flex direction to column and
align items and justify content to
Center Center and that basically means
that paper spinner child that I added
there is just going to be vertically and
horizontally centered right in the
middle of the screen now finally I'll
set the background to an opaque white so
it hides whatever page content is behind
it so we can actually just verify that
this is working I can go back over to
the blog that I was working on I can
probably go ahead and close the dev
tools and refresh the page
alright so now we're just seeing that
overlay and that spinner it's blocking
all the page content so I at least know
that that is working but I only want
this to display when we have a page that
is kind of in a loading state so what
I'll do next is I'll go into my list
page element and remember list page is
the one that lists all of our individual
blog posts I'm going to give it a
loading property so down here in its
properties we have active for when the
the the page gets swapped to by our
route but it could still be in a loading
state then so we'll add a loading
property this is also gonna be a boolean
the values going to default to false and
I'm gonna start notify true because I'm
gonna need to have the outside world
listen to this as well so next I'll go
up to my iron Ajax element now this is
the one that's sort of loading all of
our blog post data for this page and it
actually has already inside of it iron
Ajax has a loading property so here I
can just bind my loading property to its
loading property right so that's pretty
nice so now this page can kind of tell
the outside world when it's loading
and really what it's doing is it's just
sort of telling the outside world when
iron-ajax is loading so back in blog
pages which is sort of a common parent
of all these guys I will add a property
or an attribute here so I'll listen for
the steeds loading property and I'm
gonna call my attribute just so I can
differentiate them a little bit I'll
call it like is loading right so I can
do that here now down in my overlay what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bind the state
of the overlay to that loading property
so we'll say okay we'll use the HTML
hidden attribute I use a dollar sign
binding so I can bind right to the
attribute itself and we'll say that this
is one of those fun double negative
things so we'll say when is loading is
false
hidden should be true yes okay so when
is loading is false
hide the overlay when we are not loading
hide the overlay okay this is one of
those like things where you got to think
about it for a second and then the
active state of our spinner we're
actually gonna do the reverse we're
gonna say okay well if it's loading then
we do want the spinner to be active okay
so that means now as we switch back and
forth between the list page we should
see that that overlay for just a second
and when all that content comes in from
iron-ajax it should hide itself I'm
gonna go ahead and then and actually do
the exact same thing for my post page so
I'll give it a loading property as well
all right it's boolean defaults to false
and we want to notify true so I can bind
to it and we will also bind it to the
loading property of iron Ajax and I can
sort of duplicate that work that we did
for list pages over in post page at this
point you know you might be saying these
pages the sort of the signature of them
is looking very very similar in our
markup so it might be a good time to
consider perhaps rolling some of this
common behavior into behavior I should
say so actually sharing that
functionality between the elements
instead of duplicating the code in both
places so that's something that we might
do in a future episodes to kind of like
tidy things up a bit but for now let's
just verify that this works so I'm gonna
switch back over to my browser I will
refresh the page
zoom out a little bit we're pretty
zoomed in there and what I can do is
because this contents gonna load in
really fast because I have it local I'll
go back to my network panel and I'll
throttle the connection way down so I'm
gonna set it to GPRS and now when I
click on film I should see that loading
state for just a second now you notice
that my image still did that weird swap
a roo thing but we're not seeing any
stale text when we go and click on these
items one thing that does happen though
when we switch between these is we can
actually still scroll the page while
that overlay is displayed and that's
kind of a bummer we definitely don't
want that so I'm gonna add one more
little trick to blog pages I'm gonna add
an observer for is loading so my
observers array got some more space down
here so I'll create an observer for
we'll say we're gonna lock scroll
whenever is loading changes and lock
scroll will just be a method that I
define where we say all right what is
the state of is loading and if is
loading is true then we're actually
we're gonna cheat here we'll reach
outside of ourselves we'll go to
document about body and set the overflow
style to hidden if it's loading is true
and what that's going to do is that's
just gonna like chop off the page and
that way the user won't be able to
scroll and see that content underneath
there otherwise if is loading is false
then we'll set document body style
overflow to you mm well I think is the
correct value
let's swap back over and bust out our
dev tools so we can throttle this thing
again so refresh the page all right so
far so good we'll go to our network
panel we'll set throttle linkage GPRS
and now we'll click on like the film
section you notice my scroll bar even
like goes away so I can tell I can't
scroll or anything until that content
actually has loaded in okay cool so we
handled the issue of the text being
stale and that loading in but now we
still have these images and this is a
really tricky problem because when our
data loads all it's loading is a path to
a new image but we still have to go make
that HTTP request to fetch that content
and that could take a super long time
too low
but I don't want my user to you know be
waiting when they could be reading the
text of the article while they still
wait on that image to load so we could
kind of do a little trade-off there we
would give them the text of the the
article but maybe we serve like a like a
downgraded image so something lives
faster and then we wait and kind of
upgrade that image as the nicer version
loads in so let me do that and this is
kind of a cool trick that I discovered
recently by looking at a project the
poorer team did called shop which you
can find over at shop.com are -
project.org if you go to the site you'll
notice that when we first boot up the
page it kind of does this like fade in
effect on this image you see like a
little res version right and then just
kind of fades in and what the polymer
team is actually doing is they're taking
the original image and then they're
downsizing it to one percent so you get
something that's like 200 bytes and then
in CSS scaling that back up to the full
size of the image and then we're loading
the higher res version and we just
crossfade them when the higher res
version loads then so this gives sort of
a perceived performance improvement
these are can access our content a lot
faster but they're not waiting around on
a super big image so we can do that with
our site what I'm gonna do is over in
finder I will find the blog that I've
been working on here blog vlog okay
images and I've already gone ahead and
and downsampled these images but I'll
walk you through the process of doing it
so we'll take this photo of a lion that
we've got so we got Photoshop here well
drop in this image of a lion now this is
a really high res image it's like 900 by
512 so so pretty beefy and I'm gonna go
to the image panel property whatever
this thing is called and set image size
to percent and we'll set it to one
percent so that brings it down to 9 by 5
pixels and if we eat super zoom in you
can see this thing it's just like just a
bunch of random squares now but it
roughly approximates our final image and
then they can export that for web and I
usually use like a like a medium quality
setting and I'm just going to give it a
different name
so I'll call it like picture one low-res
or something now the next thing I'm
gonna do is take that low res image and
base64 encode it into a string so that
way I can load that string along with
all of the text content for my article
now there's a number of ways that you
can base64 encode an image you can do it
from the command line I believe with the
base64 command in UNIX or there's
there's a bunch of websites out there
where you just look up base64 image and
you can upload an image and I'll give
you back a big string of text and that's
that's one technique that I used in this
case because I'm lazy so I've already
gone ahead a base64 encoded all these
images I have all the strings for them
and I'll go over to the data that I'm
loading in my application open up the
list page and along with the title and
the slug and the image and the alt tag
and everything I've got this image
placeholder value now and inside of
there I just have this humungous base64
encoded string let's not vacuum I guess
it's like 200 300 bytes or something
which is really actually quite tiny and
this is what I'm gonna actually load
into my application now I can't just use
a regular image tag to load this thing I
need to use a a special element and the
pollen team has just such an element so
if I go to the polymer catalog
let's see polymer iron image is the name
so we can check this out on the polymer
element catalog this thing is awesome
and what I'll let us do is load a
placeholder while it waits on the
high-res version to come down so I'm
gonna just grab let's see there's a
snippet of code here that I want here we
go so I'm gonna grab the snippet of code
and I can go back to my list page and
find this image tag that I was using
previously I'm just going to replace it
with an iron image so let's see so we'll
set width to 900 pixels height 512 you
could also do this in CSS 50 if you
wanted to have like media query
breakpoints to change the size of the
image I'm working quick and dirty here
so I'll just do it in line for the
placeholder right if you if you go back
and you look at our data we called that
value image placeholder so I'll grab
that I can use that in our binding all
right
image or item because we're Nodame
repeat item image placeholder sizing
cover yep that looks good I totally want
to do that preload there is a fade
effect that iron image gives us if we go
and look at their docks this is kind of
a nice thing so there's a fade attribute
we can set on this guy so I'll set a
preload fade the source is gonna be item
image and then we can add an alt
attribute too which is important for
accessibility so we'll say it fault
equals I believe it is item dot image
underscore alt okay so this is gonna go
out it's going to quickly display a
placeholder and then fetch the higher
res version and fade that up when it is
loaded I'm also gonna add the same chunk
of code over to our what is it our post
page so our post page we got an image
here right place that with iron images
and here we called it post content so I
just need to update you know wherever it
says item post content hide that old
image okay give it a shot so I've turned
off throttling I'm going to refresh the
page and you'll actually even see even
though we're on a fast connection we'll
actually see some of that crossfade
happening because it's able to load that
placeholder super super super fast cuz
it's so tiny but this makes a huge
difference if you're on a slower
connection so again I'll go to the
network
let's turn throttling on now so we'll
set it to like regular 3G okay and now
let's switch to a different page so we
go from art to film okay cool so we
didn't see any stale images and we we
were able to get that kind of nice fade
in effect while we were waiting on these
other images to load I mean if we go to
a really slow connection like GPRS here
what you'll see is as I go and maybe
click on one of these posts we see the
spinner for just a second then we see
the page content though and then that
image fades up and this is really really
nice let's actually do our like a super
hard refresh to clear our cache so you
can really see this in action okay so
let's say I hit this page for the very
first time I'm gonna switch it to GPRS
and now I'm like super super super slow
phone I switch to the film section
and my text loads in super quick right
and these images they're kind of like
rolling in along after it but I don't
have to wait for those images to be able
to actually start reading the page and
interacting with the page content so the
final product is just super super nice
and it's very very responsive and very
friendly to folks who might be on slower
cell connections okay so that about
covers it for today we've built an
amazing site that is super quick on
mobile using some of the fancier new app
routing and iron image trickery that the
polymer team has given us now if you
haven't done so please go check out some
of the talks at the Balmer team recorded
at i/o these are all up and available on
the chrome Developers YouTube channel
