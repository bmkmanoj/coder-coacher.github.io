Helberg I work as a developer advocate
at Baden I've been doing web stuff for
the last ten or so years everything from
front-end to enterprise Java systems
with me I've got yoni so hi my name is
yoni and I'm a product designer I
brought in and I've also been working on
the web for over 10 years now and
actually I bought in also over 10 years
already and today we're here to tell you
why we think and like Comcast just now
showed us why web components and the web
platform makes so much sense in business
or enterprise context great so just to
give you a little bit of context of
where we're coming from our company
Vaadin has a 16 year history of helping
developers and companies build web
applications with a java based framework
that we have now that framework comes
with a really big library of components
so in a way we've been building web
components for about 16 years so you can
imagine that we were pretty excited when
web components standard is starting
coming out what that allowed us to do is
take everything we've learned over the
past 15 years and translate that into a
new set of components that we can run
directly on the browser by doing that we
can have a much larger audience of
people who are able to use it and also
all the framework users that we already
have get access to a much wider library
of components so in the talk today we
want to really make the case for why we
believe that the web platform with all
these new features coming out really
makes sense for business applications we
also want to highlight the things that
we have bought and do to help this
become reality so how we build high
quality components internally how we
improve compatibility with other
frameworks such as angular 2 and finally
how we make web components customizable
so that they fit into your company's
look and feel now in this talk we want
to focus on business applications I know
a lot of the material and a lot of the
talks on progressive web applications
and web components tend to focus more on
websites and maybe web shops but we want
to make sure that people developing
business applications also understand
that these are technologies that really
make a lot of sense when doing these
applications what I mean by a business
application is the types of applications
that really help run a business they're
in a very critical part of running that
business they're more often internal
applications and they tend to have very
long lifespans so even if you start
building one today with the latest and
greatest technologies five years down
the road it's still going to be in
production and running something you
probably consider a legacy technologies
and I think business apps get a pretty
bad rap they don't need to be slow and
ugly in fact these are the applications
that a lot of your users spend their
entire working day working on so it's
really important to be able to deliver a
good user experience to these people and
that's what we at button have made it
our mode motto to really fight for
simplicity we want to make it as simple
as possible for developers to build
great end-user experiences the way we
try to accomplish that is by giving the
developers the tools and the components
that they need to really build these
great experiences so if you're checking
the bingo card day you can do it that
right now let's take a look at the
reasons why we think that businesses
should use the platform so first off
when we're talking about business
applications especially the internal
facing ones these are typically built
with a very tight budget because they
don't directly bring in any revenue to
the company so building on the web
platform we can really save time and
effort by focusing all of our work on
building one great application instead
of spreading our effort into building
two or three different applications on
different platforms so that means that
there's less for us to build and
maintain it also means that we don't
need to have separate teams within our
company that had the skills that's
needed to build all of these different
apps
different platforms also it takes care
of the distribution problem we don't
need to go around updating people's
computers and devices we can just have
everyone use the latest version and this
ability to stay updated is something
that I think is really a strong suit for
the web platform so if we think about
these web app business applications that
have a long life span means that
somewhere down the road you'll have a
need to update it to stay relevant and
to kind of address things that you
couldn't think of in the beginning but
at the same time the application is in a
very critical position in your business
so you can't just like toss it all in
the garbage and start a new project with
the web platform we have the possibility
like Taylor mentioned yesterday to
incrementally upgrade our app in place
so for instance we could take our
application add a serviceworker to it to
make it work better in poor or no
network conditions we can also find the
kind of problem areas in our application
and start replacing those with web
components so that can allow us to start
bringing in this component based
thinking into our existing app without
needing to re-architect the entire
surrounding application then later on if
we do decide to do our entire rewrite of
the application we can bring those
components along with us
so this reusability that web components
allows us to do not only across projects
with the same framework but a lot across
projects that are using different
platforms or different frameworks it's
really something I think is unique to
the web and in a business context where
you have apps that are written years
apart with different technologies that's
a really big thing that allows us to
bring a consistent user experience
through all the different applications
now we're not quite there yet there are
still a few things that we need to work
on to get this level of reusability that
we want to achieve one is how do we make
web components work great together with
all the frameworks out there and - how
do we make web components so easy to
customize that we can just drop them in
any project and make them look like as
if they were built for that project but
before I get into that I want to bring
you Oni here to tell us a little bit
about what it takes to
old high quality business great
component yes so what do we actually
mean when we say business great
components or Enterprise Group great
components is that like stuff for people
in suits and fancy offices or
gold-plated buttons or something like
that well of course not
so for body elements that means
components that you need when you build
these complex business applications now
these components might be more complex
feature-rich
ones or more seemingly simple use case
specific components now all of our
elements are open source on github and
we test them with all the latest polymer
versions and we provide support for them
to ensure compatibility and
functionality and we build the elements
as a seamless extension to the polymer
element catalog so combining all of
these element sets you kind of have most
of the components that you need when
building a complex application like the
expense manager demo application that
you're seeing right now so we used our
data grid date picker combo box and
upload elements together with some paper
elements there but apart from the visual
feature that you the end user sees what
else is required from a business grade
or high quality component to put it
briefly it's quite a lot of work so
first of all you need to consider both
end users and developers alike and
starting from end users there's already
multiple aspects there that you need to
take into consideration first usability
can the user accomplish accomplish a
certain use case with your component and
hopefully with ease this accessibility
can the user perform that use case
regardless of their own abilities
there's performance does your component
load initialize and respond to user
interaction quickly responsive design
again can the user accomplish those use
cases regardless of the device screen
size or input
methods and last robust or complex
interaction design does your component
handle the user input and interactions
as intended in all of its different all
of its different states now this is
especially true for these more complex
business oriented components with a
large number of different features that
need to work nicely in concert no matter
what the combination of those features
by beep my tailor also mentioned
yesterday in yesterday's keynote doing
all of this work on the web is very hard
so it requires a lot of specific
technical knowledge and attention to
detail to get things right and I also
want to thank the polymer team for
actually providing us tools that make
this a lot easier so that covers
end-users somewhat but there's
developers that you need to treat with
equal respect for a component to be
considered high-quality and again for
developers there's usability but this
time from the point of view of the API
so is the API of your component
intuitive and flexible so can the
developer make the component do what
they need to do in their app there's
compatibility because your component is
it usable together with various text
sacks or layout environments where the
developer might want to use it and last
but not least like comcast mentioned
many times great documentation is really
necessary in order for developers to
learn how to use your components
efficiently now this seems quite a lot
already even though it's not really an
exhaustive list what you need to
consider so how do we actually succeed
in building these high-quality
components how do we attain the
complexity so I'll give you a brief look
at how we do this advant in internally
it's yeah we basically do the regular
agile process with these so regular
design development and testing cycles
even though it's not a really formal
process that we follow there it is on a
high level how we how we do things and
my student like the whole components as
well as to the individual features
features of those components when as we
worked on them piece by piece so we
start with design and that begins by
identifying the use cases that we try to
cover with the component or with the
feature and those use cases usually come
from existing projects customers or
users directly and as examples when
building a date picker you might have
just simple use cases like well select a
date near today or select your birthday
and for us it's not very difficult to
come up with these use cases as we're
rebuilding some like well-established UI
patterns but it's it's still a good idea
to check that those patterns are still
valid today and accommodate accommodate
any new requirements such as small
viewport sizes or touch input and it's
also a clear place to apply our motto
and fight for simplicity now
researching existing solutions and
reusing the parts that still hold up is
a natural next natural next step but
we're still not afraid to pursue and
experiment with alternative or on
unconventional designs like with our
date picker here so we could have easily
gone with this more traditional page
calendar design but we wanted to see if
this alternative design of an infinite
scrolling coloring list would actually
perform better so once you have some
designs you usually want to validate
your assumption somehow so you might not
be sure of your alternatives which one
is the best or you might have some
technical uncertainties that you want to
validate or clear out somehow
after that you build something you test
so prototyping is is the next step and
the type of prototype you build or use
depends on the level of complexity of
the use case how confident you are in
the design or what type of feedback
you're looking forward to get with
prototype so for example if a design if
you want to know if a design is
technically feasible you probably want
to actually call that in the browser to
get a like a really concrete feel a feel
of that or if you're just unsure if
something is visually permanent enough
for end-users you might just go with a
static or animated mock-up instead now
again as examples for our date picker
one early prototype that we did once
this iOS or a version that mimicked the
iOS calendar app with this zoom like
interaction and we wanted to see if
that's actually feasible to do in a
browser so we ended up coding that
actually and seeing that work in
different devices another one later on
was that we wanted to get a more
tangible feel of the dual scrolling list
that we had as an alternative design so
before investing time in prototyping
that in code we actually just did a
clickable image based prototype and up
we did some early usability feedback or
user testing with to get more confidence
before actually doing something in code
and yes like I mentioned testing that's
the primary purpose for your prototypes
you want to learn something from them
and those code based or clickable image
based prototypes work great for end user
testing but for developer and API
testing we need or we usually do
something different so we have an API
design available we have some use case
that we try to cover with that API and
then we draft some code examples based
on those so we use kind of the API
already even though it's not implemented
here and then we just show that code
example to different developers and get
feedback directly on that early on and
before we ship a larger set of single
features like 1.0 we do these more for
more usability usability tests both for
end-users and for developers so we bring
in more users and actually give them
tasks that we want them to accomplish
with our component
and then we just observe and take notes
during the session and so forth and of
course we do the more traditional
compatibility testing on top of this so
to make sure that our components work
with as many framework browser and
platform combinations as possible and
based on the learnings sometimes we end
up changing the designs so with this iOS
like zooming design we noticed that well
the performance wasn't that great on
some devices so we ended up designing
something else and with our we learned
also with the image placed clickable
prototype that users didn't actually
have any more trouble selecting dates
using the infinite scrolling list and
many actually preferred it so we went
ahead with that design but we also
noticed that we can actually combine the
separate calendar and the year and month
scrolling list into a single view with
this dual scrolling interaction that you
see here and that's what we ended up
shipping and yeah that's actually one of
the last important steps in the cycle so
once you have confidence in your designs
and your implementations you actually
want to ship some features and other
fixes after you have the confidence and
that's one really important aspect of
business great components that they have
a roadmap how those are going to be how
the components are going to evolve and
how they are going to be maintained
maintained
so we use semantic versioning for our
components and what's the same for all
of those versions basically that we're
constantly looking for feedback so
please try out those versions early and
provide us feedback as much as possible
because that plays a big part on our
maintenance and support efforts so we
try to respond to poor requests and
issues as quickly as possible and we
also have an active chat and forum where
you can ask questions from the team
directly so don't hesitate in contacting
us and in addition to these we also
offer premiere
support in case you need that now
speaking of support one question that we
get a lot is how about angular 2 so I'll
let Marcus tell you more about that
great so yeah as you probably know since
web components are built using web
standards they work great with a lot of
the frameworks and tools out there
namely those that work directly with the
Dom directly with the web standards now
there are some other frameworks that
abstract a little bit away from the DOM
and Bill bring in own concepts for doing
stuff like data binding which means that
in some frameworks like in angular 2 web
components don't really work as great as
we would hope than to do so in order to
help fix this issue we at Vaadin have
created a universal angular 2 to polymer
adaptor so this handles things like
custom CSS and shady Dom operations it
ties in with the data binding system and
it makes sure that the components work
in in forms and with the validation that
angular 2 has you can install this on
NPM and once you've installed it you
just import it in your module as polymer
element with the polymer element
imported you will declare it for every
polymer component that you want to use
in this case we're using both of on
combo box and a paper input there's no
special support needed to build into the
polymer component itself the wrapper
will take care of all of that
so with those declarations in place
we're able to use these polymer
components just the same way as we would
any angular 2 components so here we can
see that we bound the value of the combo
box to the input and we're able to do to
blow a data binding between them next up
we're going to talk about something and
I think is really exciting something
we've been working on for a while and
something I know a lot of people in the
community have been asking us about what
if we can't do material design what if
we want to have web
bonus that look like our company so yoni
yeah so how do you customize the look
and feel like Marcus said earlier it's
one of one of the aspects of reusability
and compatibility that you want to
affect how things look from project to
project and one thing where you get
asked a lot in is that yeah web
components look like a cool technology
but our company design guidelines don't
really allow material design so how can
we change the look and feel and we're
running a survey currently and I pulled
some direct quotes from there and
highlight this issue so there's one one
person saying that well it doesn't
provide look less elements you're pretty
much stuck with material design and
another one saying they would like
better decoupling of look and feel from
code like paper essentially buys you
into material design so it's a real
issue for for web component users or
polymer users so well paper elements are
awesome the features that it is great
just changing fonts and colors is not
always enough and you might get this
face when you're trying to do something
but you might also be thinking that
aren't there multiple existing CSS
frameworks for theming wet applications
out there like bootstrap foundations and
what-have-you like why can't we use
those well one thing one big thing is
that those existing frameworks rely on
specific Dom structure and specific CSS
classes to apply those styles and as you
know that doesn't really play well with
shadow Dom because you need to have
complete control of your internals of
your components in your whole app and
that kind of defeats the purpose of the
reusable components right so you should
be using custom properties and mix-ins
instead another thing that the existing
frameworks commonly do is that they
require a build step when you try to
want to customize some things in the in
the theme so while that might be a okay
thing to do on a high level when you're
theming or a custom
your complete app or multiple components
at the same time might be fine but for
individual components like they should
not rely on any build step to provide
their theming capabilities like that
also again kind of doesn't make them
really portable or reusable in multiple
places so we want to get rid of this
build step as well and we kind of
already can so sanity is this already
has most things that we need for theming
so just a quick check checklist of
things that will preprocessor to user
they offer so variables check we have
custom properties now shipping in
multiple browsers natively already
mix-ins that's in the spec coming up and
I think it's natively shipping anywhere
yet but the shady CSS polyfill or shim
does that for us
basic math it's something that you
sometimes need when doing customizable
themes well that's really well supported
already with the calc function in CSS so
we got back covered and these three
things are just the bare essentials
basically that we need and it could be
also almost all that we need now there
might be some limitations with the
sadie's shaky CSS shim
but once native support gets better we
actually get more benefits with the like
Native inheritance and cache cascade of
CSS and one extra thing that I'm really
looking for in the future is color
computation which is already in the CSS
specs but also not shipping anywhere yet
and we don't actually have a good shim
for that either
but once that comes out it finally
closes the gap between CSS preprocessors
and standard CSS so we get color
computation in the browser and all of
this is actually then runtime which
opens even more possibilities for
theming so you can adjust things runtime
now now so the future Fathima looks
bright I would say and we've been
researching and prototyping this for a
while with our our components and we
want to bring you or offer you the
possibility to really
nice starting point quickly which you
can then start customizing further to
get the app that you or get the look for
your app that you really need so these
are just mock ups at this point but an
early prototype code but it should give
you a feel of what we're after here so
similarly to paper elements you should
be able to customize the high-level
stuff of your theme using custom
properties like the main colors in your
theme the overall sizing and spacing of
your components and fonts and that kind
of stuff
now in addition to these you should be
able to quite easily adjust other visual
aspects as well like rounded corners
border styles gradient shadows and stuff
like that and this level of customized
ability is a real key feature for web
components like when to make sense in a
business concept when you can have these
reusable components from projected
project and you can still make them look
consistent consistent within an app and
looking for them from an implementation
point of view each component should
expose similarly named mix-ins for
different parts in their internals like
sub parts and for different states of
those sub parts and at that point the
components should basically look quite
localized as as the one one person said
in the survey so they shouldn't provide
that much theming capabilities per se
like if you've compared to a native
input so they should be quite bare
minimal bare minimum styling there and
then we can start building on top of
that like a theming layer and defining
our for instance here like the global
stands for our for our input elements
wherever they may be so we want our
inputs look to look like this and then
we can you apply those Styles at the
same time to any of our components that
actually use an input elements um or
text input somewhere
and the idea is that then we have these
multiple starting points different type
of themes for you to begin with and
might offer different kind of features
themselves and then you can take one of
those as a starting point and then start
fine-tuning and customizing and tweaking
from there on using the mix-ins and
custom properties that theme offers like
to really like adjust that just that
border radius on that one button right
there so we have all of the elements
that have you seen in this presentation
available already so go check out the
website for more information on those
and we're really excited to get you this
theming stuff hopefully already this
year some some early stuff so stay tuned
for that and briefly back to Marcus
still alright thank you so I hope you
see that we're very excited about all
these new advances on the web platform
and we really look forward to seeing how
we can use them to really make our
developers lives easier make it easier
for them to provide great and user
experiences so we have most of the
button elements team here today so and
we'd really love to talk to you so if
you see anyone with a reindeer shirt on
come and say hi we would love to talk a
final thing I want to mention is that
we're running a survey currently on
trying to figure out how people are
actually using web components and
progressive web app technologies in the
real world so if you have about 10
minutes to spare on your way home today
and really want to help us kind of
affect the future of these technologies
please go to the link and fill in the
survey thank you Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
