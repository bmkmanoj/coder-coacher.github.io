welcome back to the alley cat show today
we're going to be continuing our series
on assistive technology by looking at
switch devices so a switch device is for
anybody who's got limited dexterity or
limited range of motion probably one of
the most famous switch device users in
the world is Stephen Hawking and what
we're going to be doing today is showing
how you can use the switch device to
interact with a mobile device in
particular Android so the the device
I've got with me today this is the blue
tube by ablenet this is a
bluetooth-enabled switch it's got two
switches that are available on it and if
we go into our accessibility settings on
our phone we can go down to where it
says switch access make sure our device
is turned on go into settings and we can
assign actions to these switches so I'm
gonna go over to where it says assign
switches for scanning and for select
which is you know like I want to do a
mouse click essentially I can click on
that and in this case I've actually
already mapped that action to this
yellow button right here but if you
don't have a switch device you can still
test this on your phone by using the
volume keys so for instance I can use
the the volume down key on my phone and
assign that as a switch as well then
you've got next in previous actions
since I only have like one or two volume
keys I'm gonna use the only the next
action and I'll sign that to this other
volume key right and then we can
actually skip using the previous action
we don't need to worry about that for
now we'll just use next to kind of jump
around the page and then use select to
click on things so next let's switch
over to Chrome and what I've got here is
a little website that I've created
called lifestyle this is sort of like a
little Pinterest cologne and when I when
I demonstrate is how we can do some
basic navigation on this page so I'm
gonna use the switch in this case or you
can use the volume keys and the first
thing we're going to do is we're going
to start scanning there's a few
different kinds of scanning modes that
switch devices make available to folks
there's auto scanning so in that case
the device itself will actually do some
scanning for you and then you just click
the switch to interact with something
and then there's different kinds of like
you know row versus column versus group
scanning what we're gonna do here is
just a really simple manual scan so
we'll just go item by item through all
interactive controls so I start by
hitting the switch the first thing it
does actually is it shows this menu
option and we'll come back to this in
just a sec then it lets us go through
the chrome of the browser itself and
then it jumps into the page and then we
can actually go through and look at the
different interactive elements so in
this case life style itself this text
here is an anchor if we go to the
shopping bag that takes us to like our
checkout page that's also interactive so
that's an anchor as well and then the
the image and the heading for our
article that is an anchor as well so if
you've watched this series for a while
you know we often talk about using the
keyboard to navigate through interactive
controls and what you're seeing here is
it's basically the same thing when
you're working with a switch device
right we're landing on all the
interactive elements than we want we can
go ahead and click this other button
here to interact with one of them so in
this case I can click that button to
click on this article now there's not a
real article on the end of here I've
just put like a little placeholder page
here but that's basically you know the
gist of it you can navigate using some
linear scanning and then click on
control now the next thing might wonder
is well if I've only got these like two
buttons how exactly am I supposed to
scroll the page so what we can do here
is we can go through and can start
scanning and you'll see that there is a
point where the entire page is
highlighted if we click on our switch at
this point it'll actually give us some
options to either scroll forward or
scroll backward right so pretty
straightforward
they'll keep in mind right like it's
it's a fair bit of work to scroll to
navigate through all the different
controls and then finally hit a button
to interact with it and so this is why
we often encourage folks you know if
you're if you're you know building a
shopping cart or anything like that
where you've got some like primary
action buttons to put those high up on
the page to make those early in the tab
order so that way it's really efficient
for everybody who's using a keyboard or
in this case to switch device to access
that content okay so if you remember in
some of our episodes on screen readers I
was showing off some you know kinda
common pitfalls and gotchas that we see
when using assistive technology in
particular on like responsive websites
so let's look at an example of that so
this is the same page that we've looked
at before with screen readers as is our
little responsive website you can see
here we've got this hamburger menu we
open it up we've got a bunch of anchors
here and things that are
screen usually and in this case those
anchors and everything they're not
displayed no and they're not
visibility:hidden they don't have to
have an x- one on anything so they are
entirely in the Dom they are entirely
interactive and you'll see that as I'm
navigating using my switch there comes a
point where even though it's not one
screen we're actually focusing the
content of that that side nav and I'll
go through and you can see it's trying
to select the different regions in the
side nav and I'll go sort of like item
by item and look for those different
anchors so again the the trick here is
if you have stuff that's off screen you
really want to make sure you're making
it display:none or setting it to
visibility hidden so it's no longer in
the tab order it's no longer focusable
because for someone who is using a
switch device it might be you know time
consuming or tedious or challenging for
them to have to hit it over and over and
over again so you want to remove those
impediments and make sure that they're
having a really good efficient
experience now the last thing I want to
show you is how someone interacts with
unique controls like this slider down
here because I think this is actually
just like super cool so switch devices
on on Android and on iOS have the
ability to do kind of like a virtual
mouse click and so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna go back to this menu
button well click on that well go down
to where it says point scan and then
watch was it is gonna happen here cuz
it's gonna try and do this kind of like
cool animated crosshair thing we're
gonna interact with it so as soon as I
hit the button you'll go we have this
like vertical scanning line so we wait
till we get down to our slider control
we click we have a horizontal line we
click and that actually moves the
control over so that's kind of cool
right if someone's using a switch device
though it might be a little time
consuming they are still able to do
essentially like a simulated mouse click
which I just think is like pretty
fascinating now today we've covered how
switch devices work basically on Android
and house which acts this works there if
you're interested in learning how switch
controls work on iOS I'm gonna include
some links down in the show note to a
youtuber named Christopher Hills videos
he is a switch device user who
predominantly uses Mac OS and iOS so you
can go check out his channel he's got
videos that show how he uses his switch
with his laptop with his was iPad how he
like makes music and plays games and
there's all this other cool stuff so
definitely go check out those videos
otherwise that about covers it for today
so if you have any questions as always
you can leave them down below in the
comments or hit me up on a social
network of your choosing
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
