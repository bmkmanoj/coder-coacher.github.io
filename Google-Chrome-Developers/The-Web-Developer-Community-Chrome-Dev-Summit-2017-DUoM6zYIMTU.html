second time from Dev Summit.
SPEAKER 2: I went last year
and it was amazing experience.
SPEAKER 3: It's like
20-something hours flight here,
and it's always worth it.
SPEAKER 4: It's my first
time here and in the states.
I flew 17 hours.

SPEAKER 5: Food.
Just joking.
SPEAKER 4: Come to see that the
energy here is, like, enormous.
SPEAKER 6: It's a really
collaborative, open workspace.
SPEAKER 7: It is so nice to see
two women I love in the tech
community up on stage.
SPEAKER 8: I love learning
about all the new tools that
are being released.
SPEAKER 9: The BWS.
SPEAKER 10:
Progressive web apps.
SPEAKER 11: The new APIs
available for the platform.
SPEAKER 12: I get to hear about
all the good things that's
come into the modern world.
SPEAKER 13: And it's so
exciting to be in a place
where, like, we are
literally on the cutting
edge of how stuff gets built.
SPEAKER 14: I would love to
investigate new technologies
on how we can make the web
faster, safe, and bigger.
SPEAKER 15: How can I enhance
the performance of my website?
SPEAKER 2: What changed
during this year?
SPEAKER 14: At the
Dev Summit, I'm
looking forward to meet a lot
of the internet experts who can
help answer these questions.
SPEAKER 13: It's
really fun to be
with a group of people that's
as passionate about web
performance and web
products as I am.
SPEAKER 16: This is my first
ever conference I've gone to,
and I feel like I've already
met so many amazing people.
SPEAKER 17: As a student that
is sort of starting her career,
my favorite thing
about Chrome Dev Summit
is meeting a lot
of tech engineers.
SPEAKER 18: Went to
women's social last night.
So it was really great to
hear their perspectives
on how they're using all these
new technologies to bring
their products to the world.
SPEAKER 19: What I love
most about Chrome Dev Summit
is coming together with
this community of people
that are so concerned about
building a global web.
SPEAKER 8: Why do
I love the web?
That's where all
my friends live.
I promise they're not
just in a little box.
SPEAKER 20: For me,
web is diversity.
SPEAKER 21: It's
all encompassing,
and it does not discern or
discriminate from anybody else.
SPEAKER 22: You could be a young
kid trying to publish, like,
your very first
blog, or you could
be someone trying to ship, like,
the next massive Fortune 500
company.
We've all got the
same people reach.
SPEAKER 23: Chrome has become
a really significant part
of the infrastructure of
how people use computers.
SPEAKER 6: As an
engineer, all you need
is a little bit of
know how and you're
able to actually
create something, which
can interact with literally
every single human that
has access to a web browser.
SPEAKER 23: Everyone is invited
to see and participate and give
feedback.
It's no small feat to do that,
especially as a big company.
So good on you,
Google, for doing it.
SPEAKER 19: Yeah.
