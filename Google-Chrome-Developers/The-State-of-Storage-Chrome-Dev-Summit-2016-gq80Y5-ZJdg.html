drew Knox I'm a p.m. on the storage team
work on a few other projects but storage
is really what I'm here to talk about
today before I get started though my mom
told me right before I came on that my
grandma was gonna be watching this talk
so please laugh at all of my jokes
otherwise we'll be cripplingly
embarrassing just throughout so again
please thank you for that so before we
get started I want to do a show of hands
I'm the talk right after lunch so you
guys are all probably in food comas not
really paying attention catching up on
email so a little calisthenics to get
you guys going first how many of you are
still capable of raising your hands you
didn't eat too much you can yeah all
right good a few a few few people lost
but that's okay all right now on to the
real question how many of you have used
client-side storage in a meaningful way
not just playing around with
serviceworker in a demo app in one of
your sites all right now keep your hand
up if you view that primarily as a
critical performance optimization not
offline all right yes about about right
so when we look at these kind of numbers
through Chrome usage metrics we see that
about 2.5 percent of page traffic uses
things like indexdb or cache storage so
my goal today is to convince all of you
so hopefully you all have your hands up
next time around at CES that client
storage is the most important
performance optimization you can make
for load time in all browsers and most
importantly because we all know that
caching and all this is important I want
to convince you that it's available
today and that it's kind of low-hanging
fruit for you to pick up everywhere for
all of your users so why is this
important we've heard this number
repeated a lot which is that you lose
half of your users if your site takes
more than three seconds to load I won't
belabor the point but it's pretty scary
right it's kind of a horror movie but
when you think about it it's actually a
lot worse than that because on the
average 2g network it takes three
seconds just to get the first byte so
we're kind of already hosed right
we're fighting an uphill battle and
what's worse 320 milliseconds is how
long it takes to load 1 megabyte off the
network this is really hard the deck is
kind of stacked against us so we need
some tools to help us not just improve
our loading performance but avoid the
need to hit the network at all all right
so we know it's important we know we've
got a we've got to do something but I
don't just want to preach you know
horror movie I want to give you guys
some actionable steps so in my talk
today I want to walk through how you
should reason about spending your time
on client storage where the biggest wins
the least amount of work for 80% of the
value some technologies that you can use
along with some libraries that'll make
it easier more ergonomic how much
storage space you have available and
then if you guys are all really good you
laugh at all my jokes and my grandma is
really proud of me at the end I'll give
you guys a view of some of the future
things we're looking at that are kind of
exciting now before I move on I was told
I should explain the first line because
nobody thought that how you spend your
time that these emojis were conveying
that my girlfriend said it made no sense
but she's also an iOS developer so what
does she know
all right how are you going to invest
your time web developers are pulled a
thousand different directions lots of us
are full stack engineers unfortunately
we're working in a place where flexbox
is still one of our most powerful layout
primitives we don't really have infinite
resources to do infinite things so
before I get started I want you for this
the purposes of this talk to think about
storage as cache not offline support
offline support is really important and
it's something it's been touched on a
lot I just want to focus on cache as a
performance optimization here today
alright as a cache you kind of have this
spectrum of investment that you can make
browser cache all the way on the left is
sort of the default it's relying on the
browser to get things right for you
hoping that your responses are cached
and they aren't cleared before the next
I'm the user visits and on the other end
you're building a spaceship right this
is serviceworker cache storage you're
optimizing everything to the nines
you're hitting like three seconds load
time this is sort of what you've been
hearing from a lot of folks so looking
at the first one browser cache doing
nothing
it does have some real benefits right
you speed up repeat visits for your
users and that's that's not
insignificant but unfortunately it only
works for Network responses it's
unpredictable you don't know when it's
gonna be cleared out and it's got pretty
coarse granularity right it's the level
at which you served up files so this is
not great it's kind of sad optimized
browser cache it's probably what a lot
of you are doing today and it's a really
good step this allows you to not only
get repeat visits sped up but you can
actually get some proactive page load
improvements using things like link rel
equals import or any number of things to
try and load things before they come in
but it still only works for Network
responses so these are a lot of the
optimizations you see people you've seen
people suggesting sort of offhanded as
they've been giving talks it's still
unpredictable because again you're
relying on where the browser is storing
things and there's not much granularity
here either because it's still on the
level of network resources that you've
served up
still not great content caching is where
the first big step function can come in
in terms of improving performance you
get proactive page load improvements
like before but now you can work for all
response types so this is when I say
content caching I mean things like
saving image blobs in cache storage if
it's available or in index DB and then
serving your image tags with a blob URL
all kinds of things like that you have
some predictability right because the
things that you're storing in cache
storage or an index DB you have control
over but you're still using Network
responses from for some other things so
it only gets a yellow here it's not it's
not perfect you have content granularity
and this is really important granularity
is something where you want to be able
to change something and not have to
redownload your whole bundle so the more
you can break things up and have your
cache invalidate for only small pieces
the better so again you get granularity
for content but not for your network
request so it only gets the yellow this
is still pretty valuable though it gets
a smiley face from me full cache control
the spaceship this is a lot of work I'm
gonna be honest with you guys
I've never effectively done it and I
work on this team and I should
theoretically be able to say I've done a
thousand of these so it's it's great
when you can nail it and you've seen a
lot of really big production apps that
have but with this comes a lot of work
you get proactive page load improvements
like before you get all response types
again that's great it's fully
predictable because now you're pulling
in even the network responses into a
cache that you control and that's really
valuable you can guarantee your user a
certain performance level you also have
content granularity for your network
requests and your content that you're
serving and as a major bonus you get
offline support which people have talked
about a lot so I would be crying tears
of joy if everyone start building their
apps like this today but I understand
that that's pretty hard realistically I
think you guys are going to want to sit
somewhere between the optimized browser
cache that most people are doing today
and content caching this is kind of the
sweet spot right if you can serve all of
your content from indexdb or cache
storage or something like that now
you really have access to storing all of
your content even if you're not building
that spaceship with serviceworker so you
can get full performance levels for your
site not just the app shell or something
like that all right I've I've talked a
lot about how this is maybe not too hard
it's kind of low-hanging fruit it's
really important but let me put my money
where my mouth is
and dig into some code so first of all
as I put this together I really fretted
about whether or not I should put my
thenns on a new line or attached I was
afraid I would get flamed one way or the
other I went with their own line but
please don't hurt me that's it's my best
my best go so here I'm using a redux app
it could work with any framework right
you could use your own view binding
library I just create my store get it
set up here's the magic part I'm using
an index DB wrapper library to store my
state essentially whenever there's a
change right this is done asynchronously
so it's not gonna block the main thread
and then later when I'm reinflates eight
instead of hitting the network or
pulling from firebase or something like
that I grab it and fire a database
loaded event which will we say reinstate
my my state without having hit the
network so this kind of pattern as you
can see was only three to five lines of
code and can avoid it can avoid an
entire network hop for your whole app
where you have your entire app state all
saved local disk really really easily so
this is a pattern they think works
really well with Redux style apps but it
really can work for anything maybe it's
a little more work if you don't have a
single object you're trying to save if
you wanted to tweet this here's a here's
a good a good slide with all the syntax
highlighting in general there are a few
best practices I hinted at them but just
to make them clear when you're managing
your cash on the user's device you want
to make sure you're doing client-side
chunking this means you might pull in an
initial bundle and then kickoff requests
for smaller more granular pieces so that
you can revalidate only small chunks as
things change this pattern is a little
more complex but can really save you
network bandwidth you also want to
preload pages the user might be about to
visit so if you imagine you're on some
new site you might want to load all the
articles that are showing above the
or something like that you also want to
save commonly repeated components so if
you have a hero image a logo anything
like that just save as many of them as
you can get rid of as many Network hops
as you can what should you be using to
do this though you guys might be aware
that the web is not really one for
having a single answer to a problem
there's lots of different ways to do
things but thankfully it's pretty simple
in terms of what you want to use on the
browser so if your data is URL
addressable you should use the cache
storage where it's available it's really
simple it's kind of like a key value
pair what's really great with
serviceworker so it's your you know
nonsense
easy easy solution if you've got
structured data or if you have a lot of
users who don't have access to cache
storage indexdb is where you want to go
these two combine they're asynchronous
their modern they're giving lots of
attention from browser makers this is
sort of your bread and butter this is
where you want to be doing all your work
now in terms of availability of cache
storage I have here can I use usage
weighted slides it's available in a lot
of places already so I know some of you
are thinking I don't want to deal with
having to do progressive enhancement or
fallback the index DB but you can hit a
lot of your users with cache storage
today and it's only going to improve in
the future so I have here just a few
libraries that we think on the chrome
team are great for helping to improve
your interactions with
indexeddb they all give promise support
some of them give database sync some of
them even try to recreate SQL syntax but
these are all great libraries in terms
of ergonomics but also they've thought a
lot about making themselves minified so
they don't impact loading performance so
that is a really big win for cache
storage it's a newer API there's not
quite as much available we heard from
Jeff about serviceworker toolbox
serviceworker pre cache and web pack has
the offline plugin but otherwise there
aren't quite as many things that are
available now for use all right if I had
to guess I would say this was probably
the area you guys were most skeptical
when I started the talk you are making
websites right we aren't using device
this is the whole point of the web is
ephemeral it doesn't stick things around
I'm sure that's been changing is we've
been talking about service workers and
kind of convincing you guys of offline
but it's still a real question how much
space do you get and how reliable is it
so at first I started looking at
empirical ways that I could do this
right small demo apps to try to fill the
cash fill the storage partition and see
what would happen but then I realized
why don't I just email all the different
storage teams when different browsers
and ask them how much space is available
and turns out that worked way faster so
the browser's recorder limits today are
they kind of fall into two camps so we
have percentage-based chrome gives you
6% of free disk space per origin firefox
gives you a little more it's 10% shared
across ETL de plus one so this is like
play google calm and movie stock google
calm would share storage Safari gives
you at least 10% of free disk space an
edge is well it's a little bit more
complicated but thankfully it's still
fairly reasonable right like edge is
largely a desktop browser it's got you
so you can rely on being in one of the
higher tiers so you know you don't have
to worry about all four of these all the
time and based on usage statistics and
sort of looking into our own telemetry
we found that a simple number simple
rule of thumb is you have 50 megabytes
available on all devices and all
browsers today so this will get higher
as you're working on higher-end phones
but you can think of this as your
minimum budget that you can use to try
and improve performance on your site if
you remember my slide before or a ways
back if it takes 300 20 milliseconds to
load a megabyte across the wire and
you've got 50 megabytes available to you
that's 16 seconds of load time that you
can save averaged across all your users
visits that's pretty huge right 16
seconds could take that 19 second
loading app down to 3 if you are able to
condense all of those Network hops into
something that you could cache if I
could I would take this off and do a mic
drop because I think that's probably one
of them
exciting things to me about client-side
storage all right but with great power
comes great responsibility right we're
now using resources on the user's device
and this is kind of reinventing what we
think is the contract we make with users
so first and foremost you need to make
sure you're measuring and thinking about
your apps overall storage footprint so
this is something like figuring out your
eviction strategy to make sure you don't
just balloon up to 6% after 3 visits but
the whole point was we wanted to be
using the users device so we can't just
keep arbitrarily lowering our storage
footprint right that would give us back
to where we are today so the second
number that comes in is your read to
write ratio and this is something that
chrome storage team thinks about
globally as well which is where we try
to make changes to our eviction policies
that reduce the storage footprint
without lowering this ratio that means
we're trying to clear out data that's
never gonna be read again now sometimes
you'll clear something and maybe it was
going to be read in three months right
and sometimes it's right but sometimes
you actually do want your cache to stick
around for three months so another
metric that you can look at is when you
have when you store something check to
see if you had cache the resource before
and if you had look at the time
difference between the two and that'll
give you a sense of how long of a
horizon was just sitting there for kind
of useless on the user's device so these
are the three numbers that Chrome looks
at and chrome really cares about and I
think it's a really useful way to think
about storage but I would love to hear
from other people if they have other
metrics that they think are important to
track it's really a really interesting
space all right your eviction strategy
is not the only thing at play though the
other browsers have eviction strategies
of their own or at least some of them do
so for Chrome and Firefox we evict your
storage or any source on the device when
chrome or the the disk is full we evict
the most least recently used most least
recently used that's not great the least
recently used domain from the list now
it's important to note this is very rare
chrome clears a domain storage less than
0.1% of the time so for the most part
when you store something in sticks in
but it is something to keep in mind
Safari and edge however don't clear
indexdb so you can treat that as
persistent now on mozilla or on firefox
and on chrome there is something to try
and help you work around the eviction
policies when it's important it's called
persistent storage it shipped in chrome
55 and it's in development with firefox
so the way this works is you essentially
request the persistent storage
permission and then chrome will exempt
you from automatic clearing well also
when the user clears browsing data pop
up a prompt for any persistent storage
sites that says you're also going to
clear these is that okay so this is
trying to help make sure that if you've
entered a contract with your user that
something should be available offline
you can guarantee that unfortunately
when you do user surveys and you ask
them about storage it becomes pretty
clear that it's not something they
either want or are able to effectively
reason about upfront if you ask a user
hey I'd like to store 100 megabytes of
your data is that ok they'll either
freak out and say no or they just won't
really understand the question but they
are very good at reasoning about your
storage is full which site would you
like to clear so because of this we try
to avoid showing a permission prompt
when you request durable storage or
persistent storage instead we have a
heuristic which we use to either
automatically grant or deny and the
heuristic is essentially if you're
treated like an app you'll get app like
storage persistence and that means if
you've been added to home screen if you
have push notifications if you've been
bookmarked or if we've seen if Chrome
has tracked that the user is engaged
with you with your site a lot so if any
of those holds you'll get the permission
otherwise it'll be denied we recommend
that you hold off on showing offline UI
until the until you've received that
permission so you know it'll be around
it's certainly not a requirement but it
you know it's a little bit of a best
practice and then use the quota estimate
API to make sure that you aren't
ballooning your storage but you want to
make sure if you have a regression where
you get some kind of storage leak you
can clear it up because now you can't
rely on the browser to protect you
anymore you have to kind of take your
take a life in your own hands all right
that's sort of the end of my
a practical area of the talk you guys
laughter to fuel my jokes so I like you
I feel like we've grown close over this
time I want to give you a look into what
we're thinking for the future because I
think it's important I think it's gonna
change the way we think about storage
and apps and offline and all of these
things so first and most importantly we
want to give you guys more space we're
kind of channeling our inner Elon Musk
and get more people more space all the
time this is kind of a new paradigm on
Chrome we're thinking about how can we
start giving p.w A's or you know web
apps in general access to as much device
storage as native apps get and we want
to do this because we think as pwace
become more common that divide between
apps and PW A's and these things are
gonna become less clear and so you we
want to give developers all the tools
that they need to make great experiences
some of you might be cringing or
freaking out it is a little bit of a
divide right you could go to a website
and it could take all of your storage so
this is something we're thinking about
very carefully and again those three
metrics I talked about before or
tracking those very closely and we're
gonna be ratcheting this up slowly to
make sure that bad ecosystem changes
aren't coming into play so this is
something though to be looking for
storage increasing over time we're also
thinking about some new functionality
and it kind of falls into two stages
right we have one one set of things that
are in development they're actually
pretty far along indexeddb observers are
a way for you to help synchronize
transactions with indexeddb across tabs
so if you have a kind of UI that uses
something like that it's really
effective for making it quite simple
async cookies are gonna be a big win
they'll also be available in
serviceworker so that's pretty awesome
both of these are wicked or ycg specs
that have some degree of implementation
so they're coming soon sooner rather
than later
then we've couple areas of exploration
that we're looking at so I mentioned a
lot of libraries that will give you
promised support for indexdb we know
it's great we know it's the way that
people want to work with async code
moving forward or at least a large
subset of people
work with it that way but it turns out
layering on indexdb promises to
transactions is kind of thorny it turns
out to hit all the edge cases it's hard
so this is an area that in terms of
baking into the platform we're still
thinking about and figuring out the last
one is kind of exciting and it's
personally very very cool to me we're
calling it writable files but it's the
idea that we want to start giving web
apps the ability to get reusable handles
to files on the user's device so I'm
sure a lot of you have gone to some
website where they asked you to upload a
file or they offer to download a file
and you downloaded it as a zip or every
time you made an edit you had to
redownload the file re-upload the file
it's not a great user flow so instead
what we want to do is create a way for
apps to get a handle to a file such that
they can just track changes to it like a
normal app would again this is an area
of exploration we're figuring out how to
get the privacy and security models
right but it is a spec that's available
on the wicked and we would love to get
people commenting there telling us what
use cases they might have for it what
concerns or mitigations they have
planned it's all in github we would love
to get collaboration from everyone all
right I hope that I've made an okay
hopefully great case for the idea that
caching with client-side storage is a
huge win that you have available to you
today it's not the easiest or the first
thing you'll jump at write performance
optimization is kind of in a lot of ways
at least for me when I'm developing a
secondary impulse to making it look
right or adding a cool new feature but
it can be a huge win and it can really
correlate or translate to increase
bottom lines so it's very important and
I hope that I've convinced you guys that
there's stuff that you can do via link
rel preload loading blob URLs for images
storing things in index DB that work
across all browsers and that you can do
today and that it's not too much work to
get it working a few concrete takeaways
is that storage isn't just about offline
think about it as a performance
optimization just as much if not more
offline is amazing but until your pages
load
quickly there's not gonna be anything
available offline anyways fifty
megabytes is available to you on all
browsers on all devices and this is
gonna go up as time goes on and it will
go up with your using when you have
users who are using higher-end devices
but this is sort of your bare minimum
budget you have from proving Performance
Index Phebe's for structured data cache
storage where it's available is for URL
addressable data and that's it thank you
guys I really appreciate you taking the
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
