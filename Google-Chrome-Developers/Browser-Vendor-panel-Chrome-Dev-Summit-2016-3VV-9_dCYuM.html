first guest alex russell you keep going
and we have jacob rossi from microsoft
we have Harold Kirchner from are you
coming the reward from Mozilla undress
bobbins from opera keep going keep
walking as low-mass Logan Bosh from
Samsung hello and Alex Russell I've
already done tall open holman there we
go well this was well rehearsed wasn't
it is it I go away now no what ya don't
give me around for this big round of
applause for the panel oh now you know
that nightmare feeling when somebody
invites you to a fancy-dress party and
then hours before they let everybody
know that it's no longer a fancy dress
party and yet you show up in your fancy
dress I don't feel like an idiot not one
bit now the other thing that has
occurred to me is that live questions
are actually quite a lot of fun and I
thought well I have mugs and they could
act as an incentive so there are
microphones there and I think maybe over
there so if you have a question for our
panel please do feel free to avail
yourself of the microphone and
afterwards you get to come and pick up a
big web quiz mug that is exciting huh ok
we'll get on with our first question
then ah let me see so everyone's heard a
bunch from google about what crows
priorities are for 2017 for the other
vendors what is your what are your 2017
priorities please so I guess we could
start with Microsoft Jacob Jonah yep um
I hate to say it but actually it's
progressive web apps
uh you know Patrick talked a little bit
about this earlier but we're in the
process of building service worker and
push and all these things and I think we
might be one of the first to try and
bring it full pwi experience to a
desktop that gives some weird challenges
that we're trying to figure out um but
yeah can you elaborate on what some of
those weird challenges might be so if
you think about adding a pwa to your
home screen on on a mobile device right
like you can hit the button and the
browser Chrome can kind of fade out and
now you're in the school full screen app
experience what happens in a windowed
browser does it lift up out of the tab
does it like magically become super
powers like so there's weird things like
that that we have to figure out there's
also things like how do you transition
from if you have it installed but go to
the browser and type in the URL what do
we do do we do we keep you in the
browser do we jump you back out to the
app there's a there's things like that
in a windowed environment they're a
little different but are a little bit
more gnarly ok cool Wow mouse we got on
a mozilla yeah house well yeah i think
the the general theme here was
performance so that's also something for
us to focus on to probably saw the
announcement for a project quantum which
is where tried to get pieces from servo
to paralyze things on a web and also
make better use of the GPU and that will
bring bring the web for with service
workers and web push we can provide them
the greatest experience and animate even
more things so that's that's EA the
parties for the user experience on on
just on a platform level but on browser
level working on wet payments and other
services that what we're also mentioned
here they're just crucial really 22
reget for men to and for user like the
lift experience of one of my payments i
want to have to be able to sign in OHP
said also definitely focuses so that's
you simply got four from a philip i
think pwa side we're looking at at the
home screen for fennec for the firefox
on android version there's this kind of
where there's a beaten path there's
definitely room to explore other ways
like how do you get people to add to the
home screen things are clear like for
many users there's a big benefits we saw
numbers for
performance but what are the benefits
for users providing to home screen other
than the three apps that we spend eighty
percent of your time so in some room to
to see how you understand apps and how
they want to be engage with them
especially if we see awesome stories
here how first users come come to the
web and then buy something just because
it's really easy on a web so what's the
return value there it's interesting to
hear you talk about the the web payments
just come back to you Jacob what's the
status with Microsoft and web payments
yeah we have a prototype of this it's
under flags in NJ today we're in the
sandwich group work on this and we're
excited about you know making the web on
the equal playing field with native apps
in terms of just you know buying lots of
stuff I do it it seems like a good thing
for everybody good ok Oprah andreas hi I
well we we have been working on
implementing progressive web apps over
the last year and a half or so I think
we have an implementation that's pretty
much on par with the implementation of
Chrome on mobile there's one thing
missing which is background sync but
it's coming real soon as in next week or
the week thereafter so that's that's
nice in 2017 some of the things we want
to work on is we want to bring to the
browser is web Bluetooth as well as web
payments is also coming we also still
want to experiment a bit further with
how to bring the user back from a
progressive web app into the browser
sort of break out of the install
progressive web app in full screen or in
standalone mode and bring the user back
to the browser we did some early
experiments with that earlier this year
but we you know it was sort of an
initial idea we have to further
fine-tune that a little bit and sort of
see how you know which kind of flow
makes sense also general web app
discoverability should there be an icon
in the address bar that you know
indicates that web convinced web web
site can be installed as a web app and
things like that so there's a lot of UX
research and things we have to figure
out there one more area is
missions should they be you know how
prom should you be should there be you
know modal should they be a slide up
 what is that what is a good you
know way of interaction there and a new
X pattern so those are the things we are
exploring and sort of trying to yeah
make it a overall better experience okay
and la slow so I have to start with
progressive balance as well just to make
sure that the core experience is their
service worker bad push son and supports
be been also part of the chromium
ecosystem solar implementation is
generally on par with the chrome and
opera in addition I want to emphasize
back payment as well we have a lot of
learning in that area coming out from or
Samsung pay initiative so you wanna
bring that learning into the Bab and add
it to the Samsung Brazil as well in
addition we focusing on virtual reality
there is something we've been involved
it for over a year now we have a VR only
browser that basically only works in VR
and it's a separate download and so we
have a lot of learning in that space as
well around 360 videos and Bev ER and so
on and so forth so that's that's a
priority for us for next year as well ok
so mostly it sounds like progressive web
apps from everybody web payments and
then a smattering of VR on top for
samsung we have a live question after
which fail yourself of a mug won't you
go for it perfect thanks although you
look really good in that tux thank you
but you voted for me to wear it didn't
you yeah I did
thanks for nothing yeah your question
and so my question is about HTML imports
I know it's a you know kind of a touchy
thing and I know there's a lot of
opinions about what we want and what we
want you know what would be a great
thing but I mean what's the harm in just
implementing it I'd say I get the sense
that some of the audience would really
like to see HTML imports you would like
to go first so we go with yep happy to
go first I think this so we be its we
put it on hold until the the modules
land and it's not that we declined basic
respect it's just like it might have
food from the blog post if you read it
that way but I think I died in that way
yeah seemed like it was like a fair lady
no maybe ok ok but so we waiting for for
how we will people use the next module
for us Firefox as my work doesn't have
thousands of Engineers so there's always
the question of priorities and which
which specs how far respects along and
are the concerns addressed and it's it's
just a standard process basically yeah I
put that and put that answer a lot
before but I'm it looks like it should
be pretty simple to implement anyway I
have mean it works in chrome and it's
like it would be really helpful for a
lot of frameworks and a lot of your web
components really yeah the scenario is
AG lately valid I think you heard it
even from the google folks yesterday
right but what we land on i think is
Dimitri that said this it's it's gonna
we're gonna have to solve this problem
but it's probably not going to be a shoe
importance as it is today which as a
browser vendor is like red flag like you
know I don't know how many of you like
to go code something that doesn't end up
making it to your customers right so I
mean you have to think about how these
pieces cohesively fit together and
modules with on and that's part of our
job as you know sort of standards
conciliators is figuring out how they
all work together copy go all right can
we get him I know that's how you did
that's what you wanted for um I
oh there is an elephant in the questions
that I want to address very quickly I
should start by saying that we actually
did invite Apple to join us on stage but
they declined and we are glad that
they're here at CVS and I pretty sure I
speak for everybody when I say that we
would like it if they could be available
for these kind of panels and the
question is how does collaboration with
Apple actually work they're generally
not present of these kinds of events so
I was wondering how that translates into
the tc39 / standards process which I
mean knowledge you've got a lot of
experience at tc39 so um I obviously
can't speak for anyone at Apple right i
can only give you the perspective that
we've got on the blink team and from the
standards team on the chrome team and
what i can say is that apple has some of
the strongest engineers that we've ever
worked with from any browser no no
offense Apple employs some extraordinary
people who really do want all the right
things for the web and there's no
sugarcoating that there's no there's no
asterisk there's no like ? next to that
that's absolutely true and we are
grateful every chance we get to work
with them now we all work for companies
and those companies have needs and those
companies have priorities and so it
would be amazing if we got more
opportunities to work with them and we'd
like that so the answer is it's great
when we get to so could we get more of
it we'd love that perfect just because
it keeps cropping up and I thought we
should handle that one right in which
actually somebody's like Apple and
service worker when and I'm thinking
somebody from Apple would be the right
person to answer that so I'm not sure we
really can good an in-person question
you I think you were there first no
that's very decent of you you could have
just been like whatever yeah I was here
first over this way then okay um so last
week Mozilla announced the fly Web API
to launch a web server from home page
and google has the
the physical web so I wanted to ask are
you guys talking what are the other
vendors plans about the ginetta things
regarding this recent api's okay
regarding Internet of Things and yeah
sort of think so fly web is a different
approach so the Internet of Things is
everybody tries to put URLs right now
somewhere it's a verdict simplest
approach that's pretty all your own spot
the fly web approach is the way you
could do it offline like your your light
bulb could provide you a service you
just open a page so it's kind of that
the micro network off like I just want
to either light bulb and I kind of just
use it so it's it's basically working
against like I have to install an app
for everything and I have to be online
for everything I want to control and has
to be a surfer that I communicate with
and then talks back to my device so it's
it's taking it to a more local level and
giving the these powers that the web has
that they just have a link to some local
service in into like this this saying
that that you can then connect to this
probably doesn't scale to all devices
like there's still micropore devices
that just want to like upload the data
to your router and I go to cloud but
it's probably a set of just in a museum
you walk around and you can connect to
different things so there's a ton of use
cases where it's really interesting yeah
an opera we implemented a while back we
released the labs built with beacons
support so you could look and lists
beacons around you back then we also
thought it was a good idea to sort of
show you I believe to look at your new
location and show you Wikipedia entries
around you as in you know objects or
buildings around you and so on so sort
of mix-up sort of virtual beacons if
you're well basically geo location
coordinates and real-world beacons and
to sort of see how that would work we
learn a lot from from that labs build
and we further fine-tuning and
rethinking a little bit how we want to
how we want to move forward with it in
in our case the new opera we've been
building for android I sort of more a
card based approach with news items and
so on if you if you down
the Opera beta you can you can see that
and so if anything we will probably look
further out can we do something with
these cards to show you beacon info
around you and so on and so on so it's
it's it's definitely still an area of
interest and then of course also web
bluetooth as well already mentioned
which is also you know strongly related
to to Internet of Things is also still a
focus so yeah and and within Mozilla we
also have a connected devices team which
which has a project which also looks at
how can we show beacons to the user to
discover so we attack it from both sides
so 12 is actually an platform your one
is in connective I system but they're
having different approaches on how to do
this that's the cast off and fly web is
definitely the newer approach like a
very different angle ah no problem and
re excited that there's now out so that
look great what people do I'm for for us
we have there's a version of Windows 10
variety as well that it enables what we
call hosted web apps which you can kind
of think as a precursor to post a
progressive web apps that's without
service worker in that type of thing but
it's running on the machine it pulled
from a server you can access it running
on like a raspberry pi or something like
this so I i would say Internet of Things
is my personal area of expertise these
all sound like proprietary or sort of
separate sort of ventures into this area
are these kind of coordinated and I
don't know about it or these sort of
individual kind of vendor things that
like one may survival whatever for our
design the it's the same edge HTML
engine that runs inside of the edge
browser so the same standards support
etc today it's supposed to web apps
tomorrow it would likely be progressive
web apps as well so we're not in that
realm there's nothing really here that's
proprietary isolated it's all based on
the standards were developing for all
devices good stuff all right there's a
question here which i think is actually
pretty good uh like everybody which is
get yeah good enjoy it what a browser is
doing to combat intrusive adverts on the
web which ruin the web experience for
everyone in the middle of reading an
article mid pages load and suddenly full
screen art
or suddenly and that starts playing
video or audio and it just makes me wish
I'd use the native app how and I guess
that same mobile browsers but generally
speaking well obviously we you know we
mentioned Google's mentioned to things
like interventions and sort of egg you
know actually starting to kind of push
back on some of these things that users
find horrible what are what does
everybody else doing I think a big part
of it starts with talking with that
producers and one of the features that a
bunch of us are working on including
edge is intersection observer in terms
of giving them the right tools to be
able to get out of the way and meet
their needs because they're very real
just like yours and and help them build
their business model without impacting
your user experience and I think the
intersections deserve is a great example
one of the tools were giving them okay
but your do it you'll take on this is go
to the ad networks first rather than a
stronger push back well I think it's
important their customers like anybody
else and I think like you know some
people make their their business thrives
off of ads and yeah some people do and
looking at a few people but no um they
but you know the they have real
scenarios they have real needs and their
web developers also and and I think
instead of just simply you know hitting
them with the banhammer like we can we
can try and help them build what they
need in a more user-friendly way I do
think there are places where things like
interventions play an important role in
helping be paternalistic and pushing
them forward with the rest of us nobody
else yeah in in Opera we have a data
savingsmart and that it only compresses
HTTP traffic so it doesn't touch HTTPS
traffic but if you're on HTTP sides you
can offer HTTP sites you can check a box
that blocks ads maybe bit controversial
I don't know but so that we see usage we
see users taking that box and actually
getting a faster browsing experience
like that so but it's as I said it only
works on on HTTP sides
so for HTTPS that that wouldn't have any
impact but that said I don't think it's
it's sort of more of a hack or of
something you know giving some putting
some power in the users hands when
they're very concerned about data savers
and I don't want to waste just ban to it
on they can also turn off images oprah's
not against images but it's just you
know so oprah's also not against stats
but it's sort of more a tool that users
can use to get a better web experience
they can also compress videos and things
like that but that said I think it's the
whole ad or a sort of intrusive app
problem overall is something that is can
also be only be solved by talking with
with ad networks and that's one of the
things we've been doing sort of see what
can be done to make it less intrusive
and also probably tweak some of the
api's such as for instance the vibration
API it's now available I've noticed
sometimes I was on well you see on web
sites some websites that have some
really crazy intrusive advertising where
they make your phone vibrate I was a
mirrored oto UK and certainly I got a
vibration at in the background somewhere
so those kind of things shouldn't happen
actually so there it's a matter of you
know is raise the vibration API should
be possible that you know just any site
that you've never visited starts using
this or should there be a prompt first
for the user to do you know things like
that so there's different things that we
can design to make those kind of
terrible adds at least disappear so it's
a bit like pop-up blocking for instance
that also browsers took care of and then
yeah yeah so in some some internet
password we have Osama delval on client
side we allow looking certain content or
request we call this a Content blocker
extension and this is something where we
refer that is a is an overwhelming
demand for a feature like this but we
don't necessarily think this is the
solution I think this is just part of
the conversation on how to actually
proceed and one of the interesting
aspect of our solution is that it
doesn't actually
leaked browsing history back to the
extension so that is something that the
engine sort of self self contained and
execute these rules and another
interesting use that we we've seen of
this feature is that people actually
some of the people actually more
concerned about the tracking and privacy
aspects of ad blocking and not so much
about the ads themselves so so we have a
few extensions to specifically targeting
blocking tracking yep you think that
shows how how to multi fault style is a
problem like you mentioned like this is
before screen out which is a UX problem
then it's a data problem there's the
privacy problem I think we were mostly
like we have a test pilot open for their
tracking protection which basically just
block strikers that they don't obey to
do not track so that's that's the one
angle like you just won a half private
secure browsing session and the other
angle is just I think talking to ad
networks and let them down say like here
new IP ice you don't have to hook on
it's a scroll and make everything slow
and there might be other things like
there's payments API like making the
ecosystem healthier that websites may
she have better ways to engage with
users and ask exist I could be one pay
for this content or CS like this and we
talked about publishers on on the web
and some have control over that that
works sometimes it's into in house and
they can talk to people sometimes
they're just basically bound to the app
bidding process and you had got 40
redirects before you get the ad so it's
just just a whole radius right now and I
think to you in this video like they're
they're moving forward they're
definitely don't sort of the user in the
first place for most in some cases I
think there is definitely feedback for
that has to be solved okay I'm mindful
of time and so I know you've been stood
up for ages I'm so sorry could've taken
that spot earlier it would have been
great user okay okay I'm last and then
like we have a saying something like it
don't throw away dirty water before you
have some clean to replace it but that's
small as exactly what you chrome guys
did with the removal of apps on the non
Chrome OS devices so in our case
particular hardware connection
we have a problem with that so I was
thinking in a positive note ah the
different browser vendors actively
working together on getting some of
those more useful features into web
extensions rather sooner than later
because right now I'm sure it's not only
us where the carpet was just pulled okay
so but anything on that can save me
sorry I can say from the chrome side
that we're actively working on a bunch
of API is to help connect you better to
hardware so I think last year we
launched web MIDI to connect to you
better too many devices hmm we've
launched web USB and web bluetooth as
origin trials which are sort of
experimental API so you can try out if
you register for a key and those will
connect you to a lot of the available
hardware it's not everything it's not a
serial port I get it and it's not all of
Bluetooth it's just a gap profile so
there are some aspects about this so
we're trying to work in the standards
process to design api's that address
most the needs that we hear about
frequently that does leave a long tail
and that long tail is difficult to deal
with and so we are actively looking at
ways of may be addressing it there's a
new generic sensors API for instance
that's a proposed a lot of Intel sort of
we're interested in seeing where that
goes so those are the sorts of
approaches that are coming but um I feel
your pain I'm sorry yeah just follow
equity on that the the thing is that as
I say Weber USB and many other things
are focusing a lot if I can be frank on
like hipster technology companies not so
much legacy legacy big industry
potential partners who have a lot of how
to out there you can't just change many
of them use off-the-shelf chips that you
can't reprogram in all this I mean they
left behind where you have a huge
opportunity in enabling those guys which
worked with the chrome apps okay so
confident I'm well we will I think it's
probably worth having a conversation
afterwards and going but okay we will
move on we heard a lot about development
in emerging markets in the keynote and
in axes talk what is the most important
thing to do to try and break into those
markets that's probable for unico
proudly
so in general my usual answer to that
question is build a progressive web app
I given this particular audience that's
probably too vague but one of the things
we do see in general is progressive web
apps especially compared to native are a
lot easier to get the user to actually
interact with your experience in the
first place and when native app
developers are facing entering these
markets they're realizing that people
might find their experience but they
don't have their room on their phone to
actually download it they don't have the
data or the connectivity to download it
and even if they get it on their phone
you have the same problems to actually
get it up to date so it's sort of a
one-time bet and all those sort of move
away with progressive web apps but for
those of you that are hopefully already
invested or thinking about progressive
web apps I think the biggest takeaway is
actually quite similar to what we think
when you think globally which is
performance it just means a very
different thing in a lot of these
markets it means different networks it
means most of the users are probably
going to be connecting to your
experience on a 2g network they'll be
losing connectivity much more frequently
and unpredictably so it's not that they
went into airplane mode because they got
on a plane it's that they just lost
connection right now and in line with
that they will sometimes go into
airplane mode because they don't want to
spend data and so it's really the
performance that you're thinking about
has to take a bit of a different angle
but I do think that the the key takeaway
as you're thinking about progressive web
apps experiences for these markets is
around performance I don't press well
we're we have a lot of our user base in
emerging markets so for us it's also
very exciting to to see the potential of
progressive web apps in those markets at
the pleasure to join the some people
from google in on the progressive web
apps Roadshow in sub-saharan Africa and
so it was really interesting for me to
interact with local developers and I
really urge you if you haven't talked to
the Polk's building conga for instance
to go and talk with them because they
give a very interesting insight into you
know why progressive web apps matter and
how they can make a difference one of
the things there's connectivity of
course and service worker and so on
what's the background sync and
you know plays important role also the
small size of download of initial
download not that you have to you know
start with a 20 meg download of a native
app of course makes a big difference and
also device storage a lot of people you
know run on underpowered phones that run
out of space much faster maybe then you
know if you have the latest and greatest
you know Western market phone so to
speak and so progressive web apps fill
that niche really nicely so they solve
this problem by not taking up so much
space on the device and generally being
much lighter so this is very exciting I
would also add the web fonts and talking
about performance it's fascinating
things chat to Monica dink Alaska she
was recently away I was stuck on a 2g
connection and then became like a
one-person sort of war machine against
against web fonts she was like they're
the worst thing ever and I'm thinking if
you're going into an emerging market and
you're like blocking on web fonts then
they might not be you know be that
appreciative of that phone it was just
mine thing that occurred to me on the
way through that when you're talking
about performance right we probably
can't just sneak one final question in
if it's a quick one which if you were
there first right yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm not missing this one all right let's
make this a coy wonder yah so this
question is about the progressive a
performance itself why I think it's not
really true now one of the problems is
like you know most of the time in
emerging markets there are a lot of
phones that are not really that good and
because they they have these older
browsers you end up with polyfills and
shrimps and you end up actually
downloading more libraries and so there
is this chicken and egg problem where
you know a developers like us who built
for emerging markets wait for the
features available in all the browsers
so I mean the point is if if we wait too
long and if you are looking for data
that the developers adoption or there I
don't think that's going to happen so
even if it is minimal feature and it's
available across the browser I think
that should that should take priority
rather than moving fast and fail fast to
find out developed
option for these kind of progressive
about features does it make sense it
feels like progressive enhancements part
of that story that the planning if the
planning requires lots of polyfills and
libraries and shims and so on in order
to get going and this comes back to what
ilex was saying about using the platform
and maybe just considering the user
experience I shouldn't really be
answering these questions about
necessarily all the same it just feels
like there's a there's a fundamental
question there about what experience is
trying to be delivered and I totally
hear that some of the things you can't
necessarily polyfill and shim like
service workers but it feels like if
there's other things that are standing
in the way you're downloading large
frameworks and libraries and so on
before you go there then the platform
you should be maybe thinking about that
first maybe it means yeah I think
there's a is a trend now going backwards
to building on the server side the
package for the phone like that just
works for that phone so i think that's
that's where just because we want to
minimize the network use to just the
server knows hopefully enough about the
phone to make a good decision on what
what he needs our surf so because some
hats but and kind of kills the whole
because web idea but adding like doll
these like polyfills and you want to
make it this way if not would fall back
to the other way and that doesn't work
they fall back to the other way so it's
i think that there might be just a trend
like if if you get a low and phone serve
him Dylan package so just cut down on
the CSS and then fidelity and just make
it work I think he'll so if you kind of
Mary Alex's talk yesterday with
Patrick's talk earlier like you have to
think of new approaches start from a
clean slate and maybe a lot of these
polyfills and frameworks that were
developed were developed in a world
where desktop was primary from years ago
especially if you consider the year that
these browsers you're talking about came
out and the state of the art of like
polyfills then was very much a desktop
world and they were also meant to be
full fidelity polyfills in a lot of
cases right there trying to be spec
compliant and prove that you could have
full backwards compatibility but maybe
your scenario doesn't require it and
and so going and looking through the
grab bag of older features that might be
available in those platforms and just
looking at the pieces of the platform
that you need maybe maybe a strategy
that helps I think those two strategies
married together kind of are a good way
to go well we are all out of time don't
go until you've got a mug but I'm not
taking these back to the United Kingdom
with me I mean I mean they're highly
prized are we are all out all out of
time please give panel a warm thank you
