performance lately and the term first
meaningful paints as I have a bunch I've
been avoiding all those discussions just
purely from the standpoint of everyone's
gonna have opinion they're always gonna
be different and it doesn't matter
because everyone's gonna have a
different web app that needs different
things you realize your site is it going
to become the focus of this episode so
the chromium loading performance group
had this really nice thread where they
they walk through what they thought
first meaningful paints was and I
thought it'd be good to summarize that
so there's sort of three key user
moments yeah people need to keep an eye
on when it comes to this stuff there's
is it happening so time to first paint
is it useful so times the first
meaningful paint and is it usable so
time to stable layout okay so let's
let's walk through all of that stuff in
the context of your site so this is your
staging site which you tell me is fast
it's faster faster we're going to try
this out on GPRS so of GPRS stood up
currently in timeline and you've got
you've got all these transitions and
things in your side so we've clicked on
a link and we've got this loading
indicator it's nice that oh look at that
it's it's nice and so that has a first
render mm-hmm first it's important you
don't just load up my site and you get
that so this is this is so your your
first paint in this particular case
you're doing a navigation yeah when
you're doing a navigation and then you
go straight for the content right after
that yeah so all that's happening is
when you go from the first page is your
static render Lana made out and before
it starts the animation it does a query
to get the extra content through
whatever you're gonna go to so once it's
done the animation now if the query
isn't finished then it shows up the
spinner saying right well wait until
that's done once it's done load it all
up and animates in cool now the isn't
happening
user moments the time to first paint
usually the things that that would
include are like your splash screen
loading up if you have a splash screen
and loading indicator so your site's got
a loading indicator basically any
feedback that lets the user know that
you
navigation has started in the page so
I'm gonna debate that somewhat because
my site only does the loading indicator
when it's going from one transition to
the next the first render if you control
refresh it is just a static render it's
important because it's faster I think
it's important because it makes you look
better no so I think everyone should be
going for a static render for their
first load because otherwise you're
you're sending HTML you're sending CSS
it's any JavaScript just to do a load no
like just showing a loading spinner a
splash screen with in some cases maybe
it's unavoidable avoidable but I think
generally people should try and avoid it
as much as I can so the is it useful
moments or times first meaningful paint
is usually focused on paints of your
above-the-fold
like your body text your headline text
may be a hero image in your case you're
using like a static server-side render
all this stuff so it's it's all coming
down really quickly yeah we're gonna
take a look at your home page which has
things a little bit differently so again
you're a server-side rendering your
content so this is like about five six
hundred milliseconds in you've got
content on the screen so you've got your
first paint
you've got body text here as well
arguably this is first meaningful paint
but it's I guess it's really down to you
because you don't have headline text or
navigation in place just yet yes the
headline text and navigation are using a
custom font I am pretty much waiting for
the front display parameter to live
because basically the font isn't
important in my head but I want it to be
there so it's one of the things of well
I can't manage the caching or anything
like that yeah
I just basically want to say if it's
cached in there use it if not then don't
bother but I can't yet okay I mean in
this in this case just to keep things
super super clear we could say okay well
this is time to first paint and then
once you've actually got your headlines
and everything else in that's that's
only meaningful yep in this case because
again you've got navigation and stuff in
place the next the next things happening
are sort of your CSS I guess I
synchronously being loaded in in your
case yep so I've got the critical path
is there so the first thing we'll have
like inline CSS so it stops the layout
from popping and everything else but
then I load all the extra stuffs the
background images that aren't important
or little bits of UI that are nice to
have but not critical cool so at this
point I imagine a user you could
probably navigate
you're say yeah so you've got you've got
stable layout and everything at that
point beyond those key user moments and
again time when you once you've got
stable layout the person should be able
to like interact with the output or your
navigation right yeah I think it was
Paul Irish that are actually enumerated
some of these so when your page feels
ready to interact with you know it could
be the case that the user agent is
completed with its loading indicator
you've got your primary text and images
painted all of your layout has
stabilized once all of that stuff is
done you're in a fairly good state you
could consider that there's stuff after
that that applies to rail the
performance model we've been talking
about in the past you know is it
delightful is there anything else that
needs to load on the page in order to
enrich that user experience yeah but I
think you know looking at normal speeds
or cable speeds just so it's actually
doing pretty pretty well I like the way
that I treat a lot of this stuff is if
all you receive was the HTML and nothing
else the page should be stable it should
be usable and it should paint everything
there's needed to just be usable because
the I like the way that I see all of
this is if you treat that as just like
the very first thing that you get is
HTML it all works everything plus that
is just useful so yeah that's how I try
and treat it as much as I can because I
feel like one more another that's the
fastest I'm gonna get let's so what we
recommend people to check out their
first meaningful paint times on dev
tools now a panel timeline yeah I'm
gonna see so webpagetest is another
really great thing to check it out on is
you get the film strip for you the
filter and I which is nice and shows you
the breakdown really good on sites
they've got like just a lot of activity
going on so that's we're checking out
there that's about it for first
meaningful paint yeah just see what
you're doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
