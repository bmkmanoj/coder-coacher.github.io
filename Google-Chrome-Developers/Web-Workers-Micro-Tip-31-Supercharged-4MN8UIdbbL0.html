JavaScript is inherently single threaded
so multi-threading works a little bit
differently than in most other languages
even though web workers have been around
for ages that even the Internet Explorer
10 supports them they are just now
picking up as a performance primitive
you create a worker with a new worker
constructor and pass it a file and that
file is going to get executed in a
separate thread your app and the work I
can communicate using post message to
send messages back and forth but keep in
mind that you can't access the Dom from
a worker and that you can only send JSON
style objects the advantage is that you
can do really expensive and long-running
task in a worker and it won't affect the
performance and the responsiveness of
your web app so everything and it's all
essential to manager UI should be
considered to be moved to a worker see
the web even has threats who would have
thought see you next time I just
finished my commit log series where i
built a PWA using wordpress so if you
click here you can watch the entire
series start to finish and see how I
built all these little nifty features
and while you're at it you should also
subscribe because we put out new
supercharged every Thursday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
