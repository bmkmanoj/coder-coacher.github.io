observers which will notify you when
element size has changed modules can now
access host specific metadata with
import metadata the pop-up blocker gets
stronger and plenty more I'm Pete LePage
lifts diving and see what's new for
developers in chrome 64 tracking when in
element size has changed can be a bit of
a pain most likely you'll need to attach
a listener to the documents resize event
then call get bounding client rect or
get computed style but both of those can
cause layout thrashing and what if the
browser window didn't change size but a
new element was added to the document or
you added display:none to an element
both of those can change the size of
other elements within the page resize
observer notifies you whenever in
element size changes and provides the
new height and width of the element
reducing the risk of layout thrashing
like other observers using it is pretty
simple
create a resize observer object and pass
call back to the constructor the
callback will be given an array of
resize observer entries one entry per
observed element which contains the new
dimensions for the element checkout
cermets post for more details and
real-world examples I hate tab unders
you know them it's when a page opens a
pop-up to some destination and navigates
the page usually one of them is an ad or
something you just don't want starting
in chrome 64 these types of navigations
will be blocked and chrome will show
some native UI to the user allowing them
to follow the redirect if they want when
writing JavaScript modules you often
want access to host specific metadata
about the current module chrome 64 now
supports the import meta property within
modules and exposes the URL for the
module via import meta URL this is
really helpful when you want to resolve
resources relative to the module file as
opposed to the current HTML document
these are just a few of the changes in
chrome 64 for developers of course
there's plenty more
chrome now supports named catchers and
regular expressions
the default preload value for audio and
video elements is now metadata this
brings chrome in line with other
browsers and helps to reduce bandwidth
and resource usage by only loading the
metadata and not the media itself you
can now use request dot prototype cache
to view the Kaczmarek West and determine
whether the request is a reload request
and using the focus management API you
can now focus an element without
scrolling to it with the prevent scroll
attribute oh and one more well this
isn't really a developer feature it
makes me happy
window dot alert no longer brings a
background tab to the foreground
instead the alert will be sewn when the
user switches back to that tab no more
random tab switches because something
fired a window dot alert on me I'm
looking at you Google Calendar all the
details including links to Docs and
specs are in the description below and

chrome 65 is released we right here to
