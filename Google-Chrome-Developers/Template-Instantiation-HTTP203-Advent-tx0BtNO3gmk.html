2017 and usually we make plans for the
next year which is 2018 yes and so I
thought I would give myself two minutes
yes to talk to you about my pants
okay what are your plans so my plan is
the template proposal from Apple Oh
Apple template proposal the Apple
template proposal so what like what they
proposed so we've already got templates
things like moustache and like you know
handlebars that sort of like templating
engines in this case we're talking about
the template tag in HTML that's Orion
shipped that is shipped and it's their
total you can like clone and Stan she
ate sup like partial Dom trees really
really efficiently but ever why so I've
never really used it I just use it as a
power half exactly and that's kind of
what they want to augment they want to
add the capabilities of adding bindings
like we know from mustache tree so like
in this particular position in the
template I would like to use this value
from a variable so how we already have a
template language on the web because we
got Java scripts template language so
what's the difference the difference is
that in this case this would be baked
very efficiently to the browser it would
basically do things like we talked about
hyper HTML with HTML do these many
things that it remember which bits are
actually mutate able and then you can
just update the instance by giving it a
new state object in which like you rip
out the value that needs put some in the
right positions and you have an updated
Dom fragment oh so it is very much like
yet hyper HTML HTML on it seems to be
very simple I don't know how the
implementation would look like under the
hood but from the developers perspective
it is very similar but in this case you
could just write it in your HTML markup
rather than to have to wire up a
importer library and to use the HTML tag
string template or literal
there's a so however browsers interested
in this as far as I know the reactions
were fairly good to it it was discussed
at e pack and the proposal is out on
github and everything looked fairly
prosing there's like some Kings that
have to be either figured out but other
than that it seems like browsers are
very much interested sounds like a nice
high level thing to augment like web
components
for example yeah shatterdome all these
little things can make good use of
templates and I think it's gonna be
interesting to charge a team good time
and I think I'm going to describe to you
is a flat map and flatten what good
question
these are methods that are going to go
on a race</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
