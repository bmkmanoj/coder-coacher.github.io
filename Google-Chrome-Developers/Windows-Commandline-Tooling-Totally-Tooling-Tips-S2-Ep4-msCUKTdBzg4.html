laptop hey I I was I was curious whether
it's been a few years since I've really
like used Windows heavily and I was
curious what the the front-end workflow
and the command line workflow look like
there so what was this a front-end
totally system about light now so the
command line workflow there's the front
side swing we're closin isn't massively
different but to get your command line
workflow on part of these days still
requires a little bit of work so what I
was used to when I played between us a
few years ago was like the Windows
prompt which like it's really very very
basic update to the DAWs prompt no
always seems like better for just
managing files than anything yeah it's a
serious just feel like I was exploring
my hard drive and yeah it played with
utilities there and stuff but Microsoft
then did PowerShell which is like way
better and design for automation had
much better support for objects and
variables and had these really rich
prompts for for commandlets but it comes
with support for auto-completion right
out of the box yeah so I kind of expect
that's what I want from it's kind of
things that you take for granted with
things like OSX and Linux like that time
let's just come a little that stuff is
yes it's dog yeah and so another thing
that we we commonly do a Mac is we we
have like da files set up with all of
our aliases and you can create your own
PowerShell profile that's got the same
type of stuff set up okay so you can
like create aliases for you know sublime
text so supple or st will go and fire
off sublime you can so you can create
like system level aliases you can use
das key as well which is a another
utility for just creating you notices
but PowerShell is great it doesn't
doesn't quite get you all the way
there's still a few things missing so
yeah like another tool that I use is
Connie mu which is a console emulator
and it's got support for multiple tabs
so you've got multiple tabs in there you
can do vertical tab splitting as well
and all sorts of other layout
that's quite nice hog pigs so that's
that's pretty nice the again it still
feels like you're it's just things I've
grown to expect I guess or one like it's
what I see if it was removed for me I'd
probably in certainly just be like
please can I have the tabs back now yeah
so I use count EMU but there's still
other things missing so the tool that I
mostly use these days is commander and
commander is awesome why is it was cuz I
said so it's also in for kids is like a
Perry 2d with all of this stuff so it's
got Connie knew it's got power show it's
using all that stuff it's just like a
group of all the best things just in one
bundle exactly it's also got clink which
is basically it's the Windows shell
combined with read line which is a new
library for working with like - gives
you better auto completion gives you
history search - utilities nice really
nice
and my favorite thing about commander is
the integration that you can set up with
other apps so something I've tried to do
with the last couple of years with
sublime is try to get like my editor on
screen with my command line just like
this stuff in the UI yeah and none of
the integrations I've ever seen it
looked half decent yeah I tried one
plug-in on at him and it was just it was
sort of like my terminal but it wasn't
quite and it's a bit clunky yeah so this
just adds it in yeah it just adds it and
you have like a single window drag it
around you've got your command line at
the top you've got your complete editor
window at the bottom and it's completely
configurable so like you can you can
tell it to take up how much of the
command line window you want you can
script that yep it's kind of neat you've
got that commander also encourages you
to install posh get okay which is a set
of utilities on top of git so if I go
and I clone
you know project on github and you know
I see the into it I can like make
somebody make some mix medics and do get
and type in a command let's get C and
then I can tab through all the options
likes committed and all that other stuff
no I sort of nice nice contextual Auto
completion ISO bit sugar and so yeah
exactly what do you what do you think
about package managers could you uh you
use another one in your life no like
I've got apt-get on Linux and that that
to me just makes the whole sense
homebrew is the closest thing I think on
Mac that I have but then it has its own
weird oddities on my machines normally
I'm hearing that you want another
package manager you're hearing me wrong
so you want to go there package manager
and Windows has got one okay it's called
it's called chocolaty it just it doesn't
sound like a package manager but fine
just how it took the is it good
chocolate is decent you you're using
your using Adam you've got your like
your hipster yeah get your sticker so
you can do like choco install Adam just
install it gives you you know an update
progress bar and your command mind
everything to be fair with things like
that the minute you start getting used
to it it's really really nice like I I
don't know it's nice not having to go to
a website download the thing open up the
AC and then do all the other stuff so
first nice does it update as well I
think so nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
