back to ask polymer the show where you
send in your hashtag questions and we do
our best to answer them okay our first
question of a comes from Marco who asks
what about internationalization do I
have to use an external javascript
framework or is there some specific
polymer solution for that so that's a
really good question and one that I get
all the time right now we have an
element that will help with
internationalization you can check it
out over here it is called I 18 in
message it's actually written by a Eric
bidelman one of our team members and
used on a few of our sites and basically
the way it works is you take your text
you wrap the I 18 message tag around
your text and then you give it a message
ID which is synced up with a JSON file
that loads different language packs so
that is one solution that you can use
for internationalization today it's not
you know the the bulletproof perfect
solution for all scenarios but it is
something to get you started and we're
also currently working on a new set of
elements called carbon elements and our
hope is that for those element sets
we're rolling out some
internationalization solutions as well
so thank you for that awesome question
Marko alright our next question comes
from Michelle who asks with the emphasis
on mobile can ripple and other
animations be turned off for 3G and does
that matter so that's a really cool
question for something like the paper
ripple animation you actually can turn
that off on your elements if you just
add a no ink attribute to the element
itself it will disable the ripple so for
instance if you add that to paper button
it'll turn it off now for something like
mobile what you can do is you can use an
iron media query to set up a handler to
check the screen size and if it's a
smaller screen you can then remove that
attribute perhaps if it's a larger
screen you could add it back so that way
you could you know have it on desktop
and maybe take it away from mobile to
get kind of maximum performance there as
always you want to be measuring your
performance if something does seem like
a bottleneck then yeah you know use a
strategy to try and remove it so thank
you share for that really awesome
question all right our next question
comes from Mark who asks how do you
generate documentation for
and how do you document packages so to
document an element what I typically do
is I start with this thing called the
seed element project you can check that
out over here on github and what that's
gonna do is give you a boilerplate
element as well as in the index file
this thing called iron component pages
and iron component pages is gonna read
all the comments in your element itself
and generate documentation for you now
there's special annotations that you
have to use and you can check out the
style guide over here which explains the
different annotations but if you
basically work with that project as your
starting point for your new elements
then you're gonna get documentation
basically for free it's a pretty cool
setup so definitely check out seed
element and see if that meets your needs
so thank you mark for sending in that
really cool question okay our next
question comes from Nicolas who asks how
do you use CSS mix-ins with media
queries so that is an interesting
question right now with the current
limitations of the style shimming system
in a media query you can consume
variables however you can't set new
variables or custom properties so what
you can do is use an iron media query
element to check the different screen
sizes and when it's a smaller screen
size you can call polymers update styles
method and actually like pass in new
properties that way there's actually a
github issue which discusses this and
shows an example of how you can work
around it so you can check that out over
here and you know for working with
mix-ins what I can do is I can throw
together a little jsbin and add that to
the show description so you can see how
that works there as well so thank you
Nicolas for sending in that awesome
question okay our last question comes
from Jonathan who asks could you talk a
little bit about the difference between
paper listbox versus paper menu so yeah
first of all way to have an eagle-eye
Jonathan and I don't even think
paperless box is in our catalogue yet it
is up on github so you're totally on the
ball the way that I understand things is
paper lists box is kind of like the
Select element when you add a multi
attribute to it so you get you know
multiple things that you could choose
from perhaps you want to even choose
like one or two items at the same time
however the paper menu is sort of more
like a traditional drop-down menu so
that would be the difference between
those two again thank you so much for
sending in that question Jonathan so
that's it for today thank you everyone
who sent in those awesome questions if
you yourself have a question you can
ping us on a social network of your
choosing at hashtag ask polymer or leave
it for us down below in the comments as
always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
