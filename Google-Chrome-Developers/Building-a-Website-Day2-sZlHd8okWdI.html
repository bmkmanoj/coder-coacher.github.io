because I've had a good day and a bad
day
I think that's normal isn't it you have
some little victories and then you spend
a lot of you time wrestling with
something and but yeah one of the things
I've been trying to do is get I
mentioned it in the last entry that I
wanted to get lighthouse running because
I want to be able to check that I've got
a progressive web app and everything's
in place and I know that it works but
the problem was I wanted to push to
Travis and every time I push to Travis
hit to do the thing but it turns out
like debugging Travis locally because
you want to kind of test it locally it's
pretty pretty tricky and there is a
thing you can get like a docker image
but I just couldn't get to work he kept
timing out and did a bit of a search and
it seems that there's some built-in
thing some kind of time out within
docker and it couldn't get the image
fast enough and so it was just it was
just failing and so I ended up having to
kind of step by step on my Mac kind of
repeat the steps and eventually I kind
of I kind of got there let me just
switch across and you can actually see
basically most of it was actually ok it
turns out like most this actually came
from the lighthouse Travis yeah mo which
I just updated the thing is it's this
little bit here where it actually
downloads a version of Chrome because on
what you want to do is you want you run
chrome against a virtual display which
is what these two lines do but the
download chrome script in order to get
on it you have to kind of mmm explore
with the global switch and go to the
lighthouse module and then within there
you can basically tell that to download
chrome and the thing is it looks for
this lighthouse chromium path variable
which it then seems to sort of ignore
and it's strange because the download
chrome script will fail if the
lighthouse chromium path isn't set but
the pot lighthouse chromium path is set
to 2 our path prior to here
so anyway enter at this line where I
move from slash lighthouse chromium
chrome Linux sorry which is where it
puts it to the current folder and then I
can actually run it you know just check
its version or something and then after
that it started work it's that was a bit
of a fight that I didn't expect having
there wasn't I found there was just no
easy way to debug like my Travis script
because I was hey I couldn't get this
docker image stuff to work so yeah it's
a bit messy and I spend a bit of time
doing that but on the upside I wanted to
quickly show you around the design so
good news is because I'm designing this
the designer and the developer get on
famously the designer is
I guess quite understanding of a
developer's need to change things on the
way through the process and the
developer well it's almost like they've
you know fully understand what the
designer was trying to achieve it is
kind of nice when you do both parts of a
project because like this because as I
said we you know you get the push and
pull and it doesn't matter if I'd if I
sort of think I actually I won't do it
that way I'll do this other way it's
fine right
anyway so the mocks I've got some box so
I did some wireframes and I did some
Moxon's and all sorts of stuff like that
let me show you the home page I'll pop
that onto chrome there so this is kind
of what it looks like now actually if we
do chrome dev summit oh no I did I did I
built this and I kind of wanted to take
this idea Ron I liked this sort of
slightly angular looking patterns and
shapes but I've kind of felt unbalanced
when I looked back at this that it was
kind of the colors were I took the
colors from the chrome logo a little bit
too literally and so I felt like you
know actually I'm gonna I'm gonna sort
of subdue it a little bit make it a
little bit more you know a little sort
of contrasting and I've done this I'm
told by one of my colleagues that this
is called a hyper gradient
I don't know basically all it is is like
desaturate the image bump up the
contrast and then pop a gradient over
the top with like a hard light transfer
mode and you get this kind of look Nate
I could probably build this with CSS
blend modes but they're not well enough
supported so I am almost certainly gonna
do these as actual images like this
anyway so that's the homepage it's it's
you know fairly simple with a link to
the code labs a link to the schedule and
a link to the location which is the SF
jazz center in San Francisco bottom
privacy terms and the code of conduct as
well so that's that's fine it gets a
little bit more interesting over I think
in the schedule similar kind of header
must header header and then on down here
I've kind of got the the session
information and I to be super clear this
session information is placeholder hence
there that kind of lorem ipsum kind of
text there this is actually the content
from two years ago I just kind of copy
pasted that the content and the times
and everything else so this is me
telling you what's going to be at chrome
dev so because I have no idea
but I wanted to mean there was a little
bit more realistic rather than total
lorem ipsum have rewear same kind of
masthead and when I'm going at what I'm
doing is I'm going to do a static build
from section to section to section and
then I'm going to progressively enhance
to something that uses JavaScript to
swap out these sections and I'm still
debating in my own mind how I'm going to
do that I feel like maybe I'm gonna do
something where things shift up and down
as in image fades out and there's this
yellow this kind of yellow strip at the
back here I'm thinking that might move
up and down because when you look at for
example the live page
you can see that this is the video
player here with the session going on
and then this is kind of actually it's
that little yellow strip but it's come
slid down and made way for what's live
now which apparently meet Jake arguing
over minutiae he does that so well
and up next is Alex Russell and you can
see them we've got a kind of coming up
later this is what I'm hoping for the
kind of live section when you when the
conference is actually live that we give
you what you need which is give me the
actual content and give me what's live
what's coming up next
and then what's like in line for the
rest of the day I don't know if I'm
gonna get to doing notifications I put
it there in case I want to do them a
night and I get chance to do them but
time it may be against me right that's
probably enough for right now it's
exciting it's good I have done a little
bit coding of coding today but I'm gonna
say that probably for the next entry
where I can talk about it in a bit more
detail so don't forget you can subscribe
and thanks for coming along on the
journey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
