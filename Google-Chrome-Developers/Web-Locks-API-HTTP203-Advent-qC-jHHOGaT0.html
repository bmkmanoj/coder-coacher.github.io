we talked about some of the features
that are coming in 2018 and I'll try and
describe it to you in two minutes but
you can ask the questions okay I want to
talk about the web blocks API go it's
that like warlocks know so it's like lot
like mutex locks and stuff yes
what correct what is it what how right
okay so the idea is in a page or in
worker you would say I want a lock named
the and you can give it a name any name
you want it's just a string okay
right and then it will wait until
nothing else has a lock of that name
open
mm-hm and then once it's open you get a
callback you usually use an async
function here yeah it's expected to
return a promise and you like you know
return the promise to resolve the
promise they return from the async
function yeah once you have done the
work that you are wanting to look for
okay
and so that lock is shared across the
origin I would presume yes the whole
origin yeah okay so I mean we we have
locks on or above us right we have
oh it's the atomic things right wait and
lock yeah right so you can build a lock
yes but you cannot wait on the main
thread with an atomic true you can only
wait in a worker whereas with this this
is an asynchronous thing whoo so it can
work on a page as well and it also lets
you do shared locks right so okay right
so it in in a shared mode you can how
you can say like I want a lock on this
but I'm prepared to share with other
shared things okay but then when a non
shared thing comes along for the same
name it has to wait for all of the
shared things to finish for the night so
an exclusive I got read/write mutex way
lots of people can read but only one
person can write like read and write
stuff and it means like you can kind of
do some of this similar stuff with like
local storage or with yeah but it you
run into problems have a tab crashes or
if it closes before it can are the clock
whereas this will all happen because
it's okay yeah you convinced is that
signed off can we have it now I
I'll think about it okay fair enough we
have three seconds to go
architecture that's buildings it's not
as if the web may you got confused well
the thing is that lots of other fields
like enterprise engineering and gaming
have like these architectural patterns
when they build like really complex
things no fields don't have architecture
you're thinking your cities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
