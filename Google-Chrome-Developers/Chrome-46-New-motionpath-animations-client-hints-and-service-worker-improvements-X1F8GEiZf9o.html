animations in the browser often looks
like stop-motion animation
it's janky and can block rendering or
input in chrome 46 the motion path
module changes that the mark-up required
for responsive images becomes much
simpler with client hints and service
workers just keep getting better let's
take a look at what's new in Chrome for
developers animations in CSS has existed
for some time now but if you want it to
do something a little bit more complex
for example animate an object along a
specific nonlinear path well you needed
to use JavaScript for that thankfully
the CSS motion path module changes that
you can now animate objects along an
arbitrary path in CSS and because it's
CSS it doesn't block the browser the key
is the motion path property which is
used to define the path you can specify
the shape you want the object to follow
like a circle ellipse or polygon or you
can specify an SVG path you also need to
provide the motion offset property that
defines how far along the path the
object is put another way the distance
from the start point you're now ready to
start to animate something but there's
one more helpful property you might want
to set say for example you're animating
a car around a box when it's time to
turn the corner the car should actually
turn the corner not just start moving
sideways motion rotation allows you to
set the direction that the object is
facing in this case I'd use an angle but
there are other values you can use so be
sure to check the examples linked in the
description below
i've long been a fan of source set and
the picture element to serve the right
image to the right device but it can be
a little hard for example say i wanted
to display an image
50% of the users viewport and I want to
send the right image to each device my
phone has a very different viewport than
my laptop so I need to take that into
account I need to take into account the
screen resolution my laptop has a 2x
screen versus my desktop monitor which
is only 1 X and finally it would be nice
to send a JPEG XR to edge browsers web P
to Chrome and JPEG to everything else
but that's just too hard but this
becomes much simpler with client hints
adding the meta tag meta http-equiv
except CH content equals dpr viewport
width width to the document head tells
the browser to advertise the device
pixel ratio the layout viewport width
and the intended display width of the
resource to the server the server can
then serve the best image one that is
served to the exact needs of the device
that picture element we had earlier
becomes much cleaner client hints are
disabled by default so you'll need to
add the meta tag to your page check out
Ilyas post linked below including how
you can use serviceworkers for resource
selection speaking of service workers
there are a few new additions and
changes here to protect users the cache
API is now restricted to HTTP cache at
all is now supported removing the need
for polyfills when dealing with bulk
interactions in the cache resource
timing and user timing are now available
in service workers and the fetch API now
supports request dot redirect these are
just a few of the new features in chrome
46 for developers you can get more
details from the links in the
description and please subscribe to our
new chrome Developers YouTube channel
I'm Pete LePage and as soon as chrome 47
is released I'll be right here to tell
you what's new in Chrome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
