the new CSS typed model object access to
the clipboard is now asynchronous and
there's a new rendering context for
canvas elements I'm Pete LePage let's
dive in and see what's new for
developers in chrome 66
if you've ever updated a CSS property
via JavaScript you've used the CSS
object model but it returns everything
as a string to animate the opacity
property I'd have to cast the string to
a number then increment the value and
apply my change not exactly I deal with
the new CSS typed object model CSS
values are exposed as typed JavaScript
objects eliminating a lot of the type
manipulation and providing a much more
sane way of working with CSS instead of
using element style you access the
styles through attribute style map
property or style map they return a map
like object that makes it really easy to
read or update compared to the old CSS
object model early benchmarks show about
a 30% improvement in operations per
second that's something that's
especially important when you're doing
JavaScript animations it also helps to
eliminate bugs caused by forgetting to
cast the value from a string to a number
and it automatically handles rounding
and clamping of values plus there's some
pretty neat new methods for dealing with
unit conversions arithmetic and equality
eric has a great post and several demos
and examples in his explainer linked
below in the description
synchronous copy and paste using
document exec command can be okay for
small bits of text but for anything else
there's a good chance that it's
synchronous nature will block the page
causing a poor experience for the user
and the permission model between
browsers is inconsistent the new async
clipboard API is a replacement that
works asynchronously and integrates with
the permission API to provide a better
experience for users tags can be copied
to the clipboard by calling write text
since the API is asynchronous the right
text function returns a promise that
will be resolved or rejected depending
on whether we were successfully able to
copy the text
similarly text can be read from the
clipboard by calling read text and
waiting for the returned promise to
resolve with the text check out Jason's
post and demos in the explainer linked
in the description he's also got a great
set of examples that use async functions
the canvas element lets you manipulate
graphics at a pixel level you could draw
graphs manipulate photos even do
real-time video processing but unless
you're starting with a blank canvas you
need a way to render an image onto that
canvas historically that's meant
creating an image tag then rendering its
content on to the canvas unfortunately
that means the browser needs to store
multiple copies of the image in memory
starting in chrome 66 there's a new
asynchronous rendering context that
streamlines it to display of image
bitmap objects they now render more
efficiently and with less jank by
working asynchronously and avoiding
memory duplication I just need to call
create image bitmap and hand it an image
blob to create the image then grab the
bitmap pre-render context from the
canvas and transfer the image in and
done I've created and rendered the image
these are just a few of the changes in
chrome 66 for developers and of course
there's plenty more text area and select
now support the autocomplete attribute
setting Auto capitalize on a form
element will apply to any child form
field improving compatibility with
safaris implementation of auto
capitalize and trim start and trim and
are now available as the standard based
way of trimming white space from strings
