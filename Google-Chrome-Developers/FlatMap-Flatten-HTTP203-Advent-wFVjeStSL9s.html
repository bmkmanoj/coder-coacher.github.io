pretty much dead to us it's all last
year but the next one in a linear
fashion 2018 very much interested about
that so I've been thinking about some of
the features of the web that going to be
sort of landing on discussed around then
and I wanted to see if I could describe
one of them to you in two minutes
and I think I'm going to describe to you
is a flat map and flattened what good
question
these are methods that are going to go
on a race oh this is like the I think
the array protip hasn't been changed in
a long long time so this would be the
first new array prototype function along
yeah it since we had things like some
and finds find index yeah but what does
flat map and like what flatten what is
Latin okay frightened if you have an
array of arrays it will go for it and
just turn it into one long array as if
each array is concatenate one your level
will recurs down aha good question one
of the arguments is depth which
basically says how many times it will
run you know give infinite infinity a
step that is a good question of which I
do not know the answer that is that is a
fun thing to look up flood map map dope
or just what I might do
it's you know map I know map so you take
you take an array and you apply function
to every element yes and it will always
produce an array the same length of yeah
of the array you operate on it be a new
array but you can like you know change
every item for another item yeah I'd
seen you change Dom nodes for Strings or
whatever whereas reduce always takes you
down to select one element is the idea
taking away down to one element flatmap
lets you look at an item and you return
an array of items oh so it's like map
and then flatten exactly hence the name
map yes you've spotted the two words in
there that join together to form what
this does but it's something that I
found that I've needed quite a bit yeah
like I usually use reduced by like push
to my accumulator value and it kind of
feels like hockey z-9 right right
exactly so it's a way to remove
of the annoyance and you just get to you
know create an array of arbitrary length
from an array of arbitrary length by
returning history or a games and that's
stage free in TC 49 I'm looking forward
to that we're getting good at this
yeah async iterators and generators okay
now I'm aware of iterators I am aware of
generators exactly what you've done
there is put the word async in front of
them right okay the poppers anything
we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
