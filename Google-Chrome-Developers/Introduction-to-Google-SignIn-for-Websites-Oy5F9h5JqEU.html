4 5 no QWERTY no how about admin No
what's up guys what's happening you know
this guy sure he's stuck low he visits
me every day do you need the ID Thanks
can I get it now yeah go ahead right see
you tomorrow
we all know that passwords can be a pain
every website asks for one users have a
ton of them they can remember or even
worse some users have one or two
passwords we used across various
websites and apps which could be a big
security risk this is not fun for users
or developers
my name is AG and there's a handy and
simple solutions to this issue called
federated logging predicted logging
means that user authenticates using a
third-party identity usually without
reentering credentials or profile
information google sign name is google's
take on federated logging and is
designed to be as easy as possible for
you to implement and for users to sign
in let's see how it works here's a
sign-in button when the user steps on it
I sign in window appears the user
chooses an account and then sign the in
if he is not signed in already the user
allow access to profile information now
the pop-up window closes and the user is
sending notice that the current best
practice for asking permissions is
incremental authorization this means
that rather than signing in and
requesting user permissions at the same
time you should first sign your user in
and request for permissions only when
they are needed
check out my authorization video for
further details on this now let's take a
look at how to implement Google sign-in
in just a few steps first head over to
Google developers console create a
project at the credential configure
consent screen and create a client ID in
HTML add the client ID to the head
section using meta tag then load a phas
this is the core of Google JavaScript
library when API J's is loaded call G
API load to import us to module to
enable Google sign-in then call the API
also in it to initialize once these are
done you are ready the next step is to
render a sign-in button the most generic
option to do this is to use a custom
button put an HTML tag and use regular
CSS to design the button don't forget to
read our guidelines for designing the
button you also find the button assets
in the same dock add an event listener
and inbox sign in when the button is
pressed the sign name function returns a
Google user object use it to get basic
profile information such as user name
email and the profile image finally
users can sign out simply by calling
sign out review our sample code here who
are more detailed walkthrough ok
this was the basis of authentication
using Google sign-in but what do you do
if there's a server involved or how
would you access the Google APs
on behalf of the user I will talk about
these workflows in the following videos
in this series thank you for stopping by
and stay tuned
