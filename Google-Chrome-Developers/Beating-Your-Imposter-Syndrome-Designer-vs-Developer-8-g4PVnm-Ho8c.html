or how does someone know that they're
good so in order to be good at something
you need to practice that skill but in
order to judge whether you are good at
something you just kind of need
experience so if you work in software
development for a long time and you
exercise your design skills you can
still understand that you're bad at it
over time like you get a more and more
sense of just how bad you are was if you
actually exercise those skills you'll
you'll get even more experience and you
will see how bad you are compared to
your idea of perfection what do you
think stocks developers from really won
because I mean this is a kind of thing
why don't you do some terrible design or
what like when we do design sprints is
like you tell people that one point you
have to sketch and everyone panics I
can't draw it's like you can if you try
a little bit I think that is the the gap
between skill and experience if you work
in software development you will you'll
come to understand what a good design
looks like just by working with
designers who are good you will see
designs that work see designs that don't
work you'll get a good feel for what
works and then if you try that yourself
it won't be as good you'll know from
your experience that your your design is
not is not good enough and or at least
feel that it isn't good enough and that
will put you off from trying the future
there's no point I can't design you know
I shouldn't I shouldn't even bother so
be the thing that a developer needs to
do if they want to be if to be able to
do the design same time is just practice
just do it do it even though you know
that it's bad because over time you will
get good yeah and you might still think
you're bad but that's fine you're in the
practice of doing it even though you
think you're bad there's some point in
your development career
I mean I don't know how'd you feel
you're a good designer about the lunch
you have us all view on yourself I feel
like I'm a really bad designer and I
think that's because I have a lot of
experience and I have never personally
really taken that leap in progressing my
skills at least on certain kinds of
design so like laying out a webpage I
like I know how to mechanically make the
webpage look like a design that I've
been given but I couldn't produce that
design like I I don't have that visual
imagination but I know that that's
because I haven't exercised that skill
and places where I have exercised skill
in things were like user interaction
those places I feel like I do a better
job you know I I know I'm not an expert
but I also know that I'm better than it
not being done by anyone you know yeah I
mean again I suppose the thing which erm
still for stratum is like you're a
developer you've done development stuff
for quite a long time you know the
process of learning it's like once
you've learned something you realize
that the kind of mysticism and magic
that takes to being good at something
it's just time like and time and effort
so as a as a developer like I don't buy
that I'm not creative but yeah writing
software is a creative process it just
uses very different techniques to visual
design or user interfaces to both design
so it's not the creativity that I feel
that I like it's just that time served
doing the designs seeing what was wrong
and going back and doing it like you
know just practice practice practice so
me I do agree deck and creativity like
there's all creative encoding but it's
like what is that thing that I stopped
someone from wanting to explore so there
are several reasons why I might or might
not want to go on to be the designer or
one is just like practicality if you
have a designer that you can lean on you
know why not I mean that that is a
there's a perfectly valid choice and say
you know I don't have the skills and
rather than spending
in getting those skills I can just take
someone who does have those skills and
we can build a symbiotic relationship I
don't think that's necessarily good long
term in your career you should have some
design skills you should have at least
an understanding of what the designer is
doing you should do some stuff I also
know that I my time is limited and I
could spend the time honing my craft as
a developer or as a designer and for a
lot of people the choice will be just to
stick with what you know if it's not
even about like natural ability I think
it's purely about comfort zone so yeah I
know that I will get better as a
designer if I try and for me it's just
being that I've never particularly had
the impetus to try at least on visual
design though more recently I have been
actually trying to be a better designer
in less visual things like the VR stuff
you be working with more interaction
design exactly so working with web we
are I have to place things in a scene so
that they will make sense to the viewer
when things could be out of your line of
sight you need you need to draw people's
attention to the correct things you need
to make things show that things it's
obvious how to interact with things you
need to design your experience and
understanding the limitations of like
the hardware thing you don't have
someone's spinning around too fast you
don't have someone moving too much if
the if the headset isn't going to record
the movement because there's a lot of
things that will just make the user feel
ill so you have you have design
constraints as well as technical
constraints and you have to work to
those I guess the trick is just to plow
on when you asked when you're bad and
it's easier at the beginning of your
career because you don't understand that
you are bad and also you've got so much
patience in the beginning and at the
and you think well it's not this stuff
you have to do it matter habits as well
yeah and I guess you also maybe the
feeling of safety to put yourself out
there with something that you're pretty
sure isn't going to be good but to be
able to put that design out to your team
and say look here's what I came up with
and we can work on it in the future
without feeling like you're going to be
mocked or ridiculed by your teammates
yeah so just having a supportive team
can help cause I think we'll so much of
design is some of its problem solving
right so so many people forget that when
they think of design they think of the
finished product but there are so many
different stages of how you got to that
finished product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
