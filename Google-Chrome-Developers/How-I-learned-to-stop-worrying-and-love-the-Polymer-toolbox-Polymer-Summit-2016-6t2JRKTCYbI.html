day and introduced all these lovely
speakers so I thought it was only fair
somebody introduced him today so fun
facts about Matt if you're familiar with
his previous Twitter profile photo
it was a professionally done photograph
of his dog - who is the tiniest little
mop of a dog he's very cute his are
polymer mascot he's also a terrible
driver and our co-worker Kevin shrieks
usually when he's in the car the shriek
that you heard on Chris's video wasn't
Chris it was Kevin because at home right
now and he was just shrieking out of
like sheer excitement so there you go
Matt McNulty um so while you're looking
at my speaker notes p.w always a cool
new thing you guys um we've heard about
it we know our app should be well sure
I'm Monica I'm not Oliver from Twitter
and github that is my poly WAN may it
bring you luck in battle it's a meow
ecad it has a lot of eyes because it's
an unchecked Unicode experiment but peed
out beautiful you a cool new thing we
like VW ways we want our apps to be
pwace it should have the need to feel
they should work offline they should be
awesome they should make Jake Archibald
really happy um but that's like a really
daunting thing to do if you start from
scratch I have an index on HTML it's
really blank how do I actually get to
have a PWA would it be nice if we had an
element for that two years ago we used
to say this a lot there's an element for
that turns out there is and I'm going to
tell you how to use all of them and
write the least amount of code possible
so here's the thing I've never actually
built an app and I'm super bummed
because Eric bidelman stole my joke
without knowing because the joke is I've
built single page apps and they're not
what you think a single page app is it's
like literally just an index.html but
like a lot of crappy JavaScript on it
and it's just client-side and has one
route and it's index.html that's the
kind of things that I normally write I
write a lot of elements I've worked on
other people's apps but I've never like
started with the thing and I was like I
will make an app and it will work
offline and it will have a database so I
thought if I make the most complicated
app that I can think
and it only takes me three days that
means you guys can make literally any
app that you can think of in also three
days so I looked at everything that I
used everyday and I didn't look like any
games that I play on my phone because
the challenge with games isn't to make
them a PWA is to you know have a game
idea and I don't have a game idea so I
look to Twitter and Facebook and inbox
and write it and whatever I use and
they're basically the same app they look
a little bit different and they serve
different kind of data but they're the
same app they have the same things in
common they've got users is not just me
and my cat hanging out tweeting at each
other these users are authenticated and
they're not authenticated because we're
trying to steal their like names and
credit cards they're authenticated
because they look a different kind of
data based on who they are I have
different Facebook friends that you do I
follow different people on Twitter the
timelines that we see are very different
and that comes from authentication this
data that they look out it's in the
cloud
I don't download the entire Facebook
written word to my phone so that I can
you know read it on the bus I get it
from a cloud and when I'm done with it
like goes away and ideally this data
should also be available offline because
you know if I'm on a bus and I run out
of Internet I don't want to make eye
contact with a stranger next to me I
want to keep staring at my tweets it
should obviously be responsive it should
not look the same on desktop and mobile
it should be awesome it should be fast
because you know I'm on a bus if I'm
looking at something it better also not
be a 12 minute loading screen it's gonna
have routes because you got a hard code
two things I can you know link to a post
I can link to a Twitter list and finally
it should be accessible and here under
accessibility I'm doing a lot of things
it should be accessible by keyboard and
my voice over and stuff like that but I
think it should also be
internationalized and this isn't a thing
we talk about a lot here we're in
England everybody speaks English
I'm Romanian that not everybody speaks
English in Romania so I would like
Romanian users who don't speak English
to also be able to use my app what I
didn't write on this slide here was push
notifications because at the time I was
like a nobody riding a server I'm not
riding a server no push notifications
because Michael Bly didn't tell me he
was going to serve solve push
notifications with firebase so maybe in
a week we'll have that done so let's
build this up
this is my app is called emoji brag you
can oh nope nope let's try this let's
try to click on the button nice so this
is the app it's basically like a Twitter
slack clone everybody posts emoji things
you can like them you have different
channels you can create private channels
with only your friends you can create
global channels that everybody can read
and every time you type in it any
English that you type you gets
translated to emoji because obviously
why not if there's multiple words that
translate to the same emoji you get to
like pick your favorite one this app is
also internationalized which means
you're about to see it in traditional
Chinese which is kind of exciting it's
not a language that I speak all the
languages that you saw out there are the
languages that the people in the polymer
team speak so basically I just harassed
everybody that I know and I was like
translate these strings for me it'll be
great um do let's be lazy so Steve has
said this everybody has said this all
day I said it in Google i/o do you let's
be lazy I somebody asked me on Twitter
Steve said at first you got it from this
weird podcast that he listens to where
it's a man yelling at you to do less and
be lazy and be more efficient but I've
like embodied this in my life I try to
do the least amount of things possible I
am the laziest human being I enjoy
sitting on the couch and like getting up
and I run out of food on the couch um
and this is exactly how I built this out
I looked at all of the elements
everybody else wrote and I took them and
I was like not writing anything else
other than that and thankfully the
beginning is a polymer CLI you run one
line of code and you get a freaking app
you download the starter kit template
which has got everything that you
possibly need look at it it looks
amazing it's responsive it looks
different on mobile and on desktop
it has routes it has three different
views that already have different
content you can link to them I've got
like two items off the list even have a
serviceworker so my app already works
offline setting up a serviceworker isn't
that easy but the polymer CLI does it
for you it even has a built pipeline so
it bundles all of your things so that
you only make one HTTP request for all
the
bucket of dependencies that you need is
amazing I've made so much progress and
all I want all I've done is a copy/paste
something from our website let's talk
about authentication this was this thing
that I was the most scared out of
because previous times and I've tried to
look at Oh F Oh what oh ass in the eye I
can't even pronounce it this is trauma
it was awful it was not great there's
like many different kinds if I call
backs in a ward my tokens weren't right
and nothing ever worked but you heard my
goal firebase firebase is like that
knife that cuts through the shoe and
also the co can you can use it for
literally everything in firebase in
polymer are kind of magical together
because they both have the same goal
they will try to do all the heavy
lifting for you so that you get to be a
lazy developer and get everything for
free Friday sap is an element from
polymer fire which I will call poly fire
because that's what it is in my head for
some reason sorry Chris so with this one
element you get like three things off
the back you initialize our connection
to firebase which gives you BAM a
database sorted BAM an auth domain so
that you can actually authenticate with
your favorite authentication provider
you get a storage bucket so that it can
actually deploy your code on something
that isn't github pages you get SSL you
get HTTP just like many steps towards
being a PWI and with one line you can
actually authenticate here I'm choosing
Google to be my authentication provider
and one authentication completes I get
this user property so I can bind things
from this user property I can bind the
avatar or the name somewhere in my app
and display it and if I got you know an
entire app with one line in polymer I
get authentication with one line in
firebase that is the one line this is a
plus for lazy this is how you log out
and every time you change your state you
get a call back it's on off state change
you can like respond to this user
property this is amazing that's it
that's all we have to do for
authentication problem solved the next
thing I was scared of those databases so
story time I used to work for a bank and
if you know anything about banks they
run on you know they have big databases
they're usually like really terrifying
SQL or Sybase and they have really scary
tables that are indexed weirdly and have
to do a lot of joints and ordered buys I
don't really
what that means so the idea that I had
to do this on my own but like nobody
holding my hand not a good idea guys
highways byways is everything for you it
does a database and it's a really nice
database and polymer poly fire gives us
elements firebase query is oh no no what
wasn't ready
firebase query is basically like a
declarative select start it gets like
the entire contents of a query and it
puts them somewhere an app index to be
mirror is this like amazing magical
thing that basically proxies that data
and holds it so that it can serve it to
the application whether your application
is online or not this is amazing because
this means you're getting offline data
basically for free and what I mean is
this your normal situation you have a
database and you have your app and you
get stuff from the database and you show
it on your app and it's really great the
mirror sits in the middle so you get
your data from the from the firebase
query you put it in this intermediate
mirror and then you serve that data to
the app this is really great because if
your internet connection goes away you
no longer have live data
you can't talk to firebase to get this
amazing new emoji feed the mere still
has those posts it can continue serving
all of this offline data until the
database comes back online and it can
get a new data from it
and it's really easy to set up from your
query your querying from a path and it
returns to you some data and I'm putting
it here in a private variable you can
tell because it hasn't underscored the
beginning and that's our polymer
convention that if it has an underscore
you probably shouldn't muck around with
it and then for my index DB mirror I'm
basically going to index it by like this
query that I made so that I don't stomp
over my data and I'm going to take this
data that I got from firebase and put it
in this like little intermediate place
where like the index DB mirror has to
massage it and when it's done massaging
it it produces this post variable and
this is like my persisted date my
persisted data it's the it's the data
that I'm going to use in my application
if the fire base query goes away this
posts will still be populated and will
still continue being used even if i
refresh my app you can debug this and
the chrome dev tools and the
applications tab which is the most
useful tab for everything it tells you
like white
serviceworker is misbehaving y-your
indexdb Mira is misbehaving and here on
the left you're going to have a little
entry for indexdb I guess it is on my
left and what you actually see as the
values are like all these queries that
I've made channels is all like my
private channels and then there's a
there's a list of posts for a particular
channel that like super confusing name
is like the the key of a channel and
that's my data that's my data and it's
hanging out there in the browser and it
gets updated every time you push new
data to firebase which is pretty great
so now take a step back I wrote like two
lines of JavaScript to sign-in and
sign-out I copy pasted some elements
from like other peoples demo apps and I
basically have like a real app it has
authentication it has a database it has
a serviceworker it has views I'm doing
really good I can actually like you know
make my app now I can start thinking
about how it works and thinking about
how it works is really important because
I find that if you think about what an
app does rather than how it does it it's
actually really easy to reason about it
and you don't get like muddled down with
like features that you don't need to
think about yet and if you think about
features as Elliott mentioned earlier
features translate really well to web
components so think about this somehow
we need to authenticate our user and
once we authenticate our users we can
like show them something and that's
something can aggregate a whole bunch of
different elements it can probably you
know give you the option to look at all
of the other emoji posts that people
have written and you can write an emoji
post because that's how we get a list
and once you figure this one out
you can like look back at each of these
individual elements and figure out what
they should actually do well when I look
at posts maybe I should be able to
interact with them maybe I can delete
them maybe I can like them and when I'm
writing a post I definitely have two
emoji late that so that's going to be a
thing that I'm gonna have to figure out
but if you want to figure out what your
application does just look at the
features that it needs to do and once
you do that they translate really easily
to web components that authentication it
is probably going to use something like
firebase auth because you know that's
the one element that we know it does
authentication the app is probably going
to be like this my app element that's
going to contain a whole bunch of other
elements like a new post where I'm going
to bang on mash on the keyboard the list
of potent
Iren list is going to show my post and
be really fast and this is great I have
an architecture now and I still didn't
actually have to implement these
elements I just have to think about
implementing them and this was actually
my original architecture for the app but
then as the app was growing this like
mess that I've highlighted with super
messy I was growing out of control and
it turned out the off element it was
like poking at the insides of the Maya
Parliament which is usually like a code
smell you have to take a step back and
be like probably shouldn't be doing this
so then I reworked it and what ended up
happening is that I have one element
that may want my app and it delegates to
two different views if you're logged in
it will show you the main screen if
you're logged out it will ask you to
login and then the main screen again
will delegate to like elements that it
has and once you think about your
application this way data comes really
easily as gray said earlier or I'm just
going to paraphrase if you didn't
properties go down and events go up
elements at the leaf nodes shouldn't
really be poking up on anything above
them they shouldn't like be trying to
figure out what data other elements are
storing and things at the top shouldn't
be really poking directly at like
functions at elements below it they
should just pass data through data
bindings and it kind of looks like this
if you think about your main screen and
your new post new post lives inside the
main screen the main screen has some
information about you know what the
state of the world is am I know what
channel you're looking at and what
channel you're trying to post in the new
post doesn't really know that it's just
the main app that does so we're going to
have a property that is going to come
from the main app to the new post and
then when you're done mashing on the
keyboard and you press the post button
the PO the new post elements will say
hey I got a post does anybody care
anybody care then you then you the main
app cares it's going to listen to that
event and intercept it and do something
with it
similarly the main app might know that
we have suddenly gone offline and we
need to hide some UI and the new post
will have a observer to that property
and then you know do something like hide
its post button or something like that
then that's basically how properties go
down and events go up if your app
doesn't really do that and your find
like you find that you're calling too
many like private or public
the feds maybe you want to like
reconsider and take a step back and
think about how you can like rewrite it
to have a good unidirectional data flow
so let's talk about offline because you
saw me there responding to this offline
property one of the big things of a PWA
is that any to work offline and as much
as I love the dinosaur game if it
doesn't work offline I really want to
look at all of my emoji and I really
want to look at my entire list of things
so this is why it needs to work offline
and we have a serviceworker already so
we know that it does that the
application will load and the firebase
will serve the right data but one thing
I do want to want to consider is that
you might want to show different UI
based on what your actual estate is if
your it doesn't make sense maybe to show
your authentication screen where when
you're offline because you can't
actually authenticate you need to speak
through a server so the way we do this
is with excuse me the navigator dot
online API which basically gives you a
boolean whether you're online or not it
also fires events online and offline
very creatively named and you can
respond to these events and you know
store the value in a property once you
have it in a property you can start
binding through it so your UI can
magically show and hide based on what
the state of your application is and
this is how you would do it if I have a
sign-in button for you to authenticate
with your provider and your offline this
button will just magically go away and
you can replace it with a nice
informational message that hey buddy can
really do anything if you don't have an
internet connection but let me know when
you're back and mode you brag does that
on the right-hand side you see a nice
yellow sign in a sign-in button that
lets you connect to Google but if you're
not off if you're not online if you're
offline to get just a message instead
and this UI doesn't actually need any
JavaScript it's just like bindings to
that offline property you can also do
this for individual elements in your
application so if you've gone offline
that new post goes completely away and
any like interaction that you can do
with the application it sort of frozen
you can still scroll and read things you
just can't post or modify any of those
posts amazing so you have an app it's
like the app that we need and we deserve
right now it does everything that we
want we just have to make it fast
because nobody really wants to look at a
slow app we already did things as Steve
told us to do we did less we used an
iron list we didn't use a dom repeat
that had a hundred posts in it we use an
iron list that's an element that's
explicitly made to display this play a
really long list and make them really
fast so that's cool
we were also really late lazy because we
did not import things if we didn't
actually need them and that's where the
import a trip that you also saw in Steve
stock so importation of basically lets
you lazy load an element so that you can
only bring it if you need it this bit of
a but this is part of the purple pattern
I have to mention it is basically like
polymer bingo at this point the problem
is that because I don't have a server I
actually just have like the purple part
of purple which I want to call ripple
and I want to brand it as my own pattern
but nobody's gonna let me and the way
that anyways like this this is my main
app and I'm importing that sign in view
because if you're signed out there's no
point in me doing all the works like
assemble that list and the list of
channels and the beautiful yellow
background and stuff whatever I have I
have the moji feed element so if I'm
ready to import it it's there in the Dom
it can eventually get upgraded but I'm
only going to do that if my
authentication state changed
remember firebase fires is like callback
for me when I finally get an user and if
I do get a user that I can lazily load
that element and when the you know the
callback of the success callback is
called I can start doing things like
maybe hide the existing splash screen I
can do something to that other element
you can also do this again for little
components in your app one of the things
that mojo Brown lets you do is create a
channel you can create a private channel
or public Channel whatever you want your
likelihood of every user that goes to
this app on every instance is going to
click on that button is incredibly low
and I know this because the app has been
live for like four days and people have
only created like five channels so
there's no point in me actually loading
the Dom to create on your channel when I
press that button I'm going to go ahead
and like lazily import that little Dom
element and I can't a spinner because
this loading might actually be a little
slow so you can like I
spinner while it's loading and then when
it appears magically but don't do any
work that nobody asks you to do again
this is like a life lesson don't do any
work that nobody has asked you to do
nobody's gonna care they're going to
test that your app is really awesome is
with lighthouse lighthouse is a cool
extension a Chrome extension that tells
you you know how how much of a PW your
PWA actually is my PW way it was an 88
which was neither good nor bad it was
doing some terrible things but I was
pretty proud you know 88 is a good grade
it's not amazing but like you're doing
okay um and then I talked to Paul Lewis
and here's the thing about talking to
Paul Lewis at no point in your life well
Paul Lewis look at your app and be like
you did good son you did great all of us
will look at your app and be like your
app is slow make it faster I'm done
looking at your app so he looks at my
app in my app on the slowest connection
the slowest 3G connection in which is in
Dulles took 8 seconds to load and eight
seconds is a hell of a long time here it
is slightly faster this one only takes
about 6 seconds to load the white part I
can't control it's the time it takes me
to download a bite on that connection
the blue part is the time it takes the
browser to upgrade my element I'm
literally staring at nothing while this
is happening and then you saw that like
elements finally started coming in and
upgrading 5.3 seconds is a long time to
look at your phone to discover this is a
dumb app that just uses emoji I could
have bailed so maturely Iran but I had
to wait for 5.3 seconds because I wrote
a shitty app that took 5 seconds too low
for me to figure out I didn't want to
use it let me give you better um
fake it till you make it is part of
being lazy so here's the thing about how
the parser works this is like browser
parsing 101 the parse is going to go
through your element um let me actually
show you the screen as then I get to the
my app tag doesn't me like I don't know
what a my app is I don't really care I'm
gonna skip it it's going to go to the
div and be like oh I definitely know
what a div is so it's going to start
rendering this content that it actually
knows this is like the second it
downloaded this byte and then later on
when he gets to the import because you
at some point you imported this my app
element so in that import complete
and all the dependencies have been
downloaded the browser is going to be
like oh I dunno what if my app is
hold on and it's going to go created
here and it's going to like stamp over
everything that already existed and it's
gonna like replace the content and this
is this is what I mean by fake it till
you make it
while the browser is trying to figure
out where your custom element actually
is you're still showing some content to
the user your you know after that two
seconds that it took me to download the
first byte I can tell the user buddy
this is a really dumb application about
emoji if you're not invested in it you
can let go now it's fine and this is
what mode you brag does this is the
loading screen this is like plain HTML
it's not a custom element is just like
that local Dom that I had I throw on the
page and then when my app upgrades it
changes a loading screen with a sign-in
button
you as a user don't really know that a
lot of magic and like a goat sacrifice
happened behind um but like the browser
actually did a whole bunch of work but
you're delighted you're like sweet
you're going to ask for my location I
know what it's going to be for for the
record nobody reads that message and
then everybody's surprised on mochi rug
asks you for a location and then you bug
me on Twitter why I'm asking you for a
location even though I try to tell you
read your splash screens people and the
end result is much better so when I have
the change so two seconds later I
instantly show you a message and then I
upgrade and it also got a little bit
faster because I deleted some shitty
code but um but it was still great look
we can do it again look how nice it's
like with even though I run the
slowest internet connection in America
you were like sweet I got something
super fast I feel good about myself
every other website that I visit on this
phone takes like eight seconds to load
but moji brag that's like dumb
application with emoji is four seconds
it's amazing
fake your content people give first
point is really important for Spain is
really important when your internet is
incredibly slow first pin is really
important if you have to work with Paul
Lewis who's going to bug you about it
until your first paint is going to be
really fast have a little poll Louis the
back of your head that tells you all the
time
is too slow it's too slow is too slow
make it better the last thing we have to
talk about is internationalization and
it's not because it's like not important
that I left it at the end is that it's
so easy that you can leave it till the
end and here's the story about that the
way you make a button in your
application
is by typing some code some letters out
I speak English I could sign out as my
sign out Watson but imagine that he
didn't hard code your string and instead
you bound it to the result of this
magical localize function that just took
a key and this key can live in a JSON
file in a language you have a whole
bunch of like a list of keys and they
represent translated messages so you
would have sign out in English be sign
out in French will be deco nexium in
traditional in Chinese it would be that
and all of this works because of an
element it's called app localize
behavior that's what it does is job is
to translate stuff for you it has like
two properties one of them is a language
one of them is a resources file as a
resources object sorry and the way you
do that is by calling this dog load
resources and you give it a JSON file if
you don't want to use a file you can
actually just like you know type out
your Dom your JSON object in the element
app localize behavior doesn't care if
you're trying to load the same file
multiple times it caches it for you so
that it doesn't actually load the same
file multiple times it tries to like do
everything for you and the result is
super easy all you have to do is just
replace all of your hard-coded text with
you know these keys and localize
function and ask all of your friends
what languages they speak and make them
translate 25 strings and the result is
this this is moji bragging english this
is a whole bunch of languages this is
moji brag in traditional chinese and
it's so easy and it so exciting because
in the last four days that I've like had
the shift on Twitter I received three
different pull requests for people
adding new languages they were like
sweet here's German here's Portuguese
here's Ukrainian I don't speak any of
these languages but now this app is
available sort of because it only
translates English emoji but it's a
different problem but now this app this
app is available to a whole bunch of
users that I wasn't able to access
before bringing emoji to the people that
is my job so what did we do I can tell
you what we didn't do and that's write a
lot of code because remember lazy is
developer out there didn't want to write
any code I basically just took all these
awesome elements on my co-workers Road
put them together and wrote a little bit
of like HTML and CSS in JavaScript just
to make it look not terrible we use a
polymer CLI
- you know start with a basic
application that gave us a play out so
application was really nice and
responsive it gave us a serviceworker so
our application worked offline we used
Poli fire to talk to firebase godbless
firebase my hero
you got enough that you get you got easy
authentication you got an easy database
a little bit of work we thought about
our application as being this collection
of elements and the way elements talk to
each other is by properties go down
events go up properties go down let's go
out repeat this to yourself your new
mantra do let's be lazy properties go
down events go up make your application
faster make your application faster we
use navigator dawn online to figure out
if we're online or not and show
conditional UI space on that and make
our users feel happy and not like click
on a button that doesn't do anything
because you're not connected to the
Internet
we made our application fast by doing
less and using elements that are fast
and try to render less Dom and we're
lazy we didn't import any elements that
we didn't actually need
and finally we localized things we
translated to different languages with
Apple oka lies behavior which is does
that for you which also doesn't have a
UN the name because I'm for it I'm
Canadian English people you appreciate
this I put a you there for you it works
they forced me to spell behavior without
a you and it's incredibly painful so I
thought in my slide I can finally win
this one back mode you bragged on
firebase.com is where it lives if you
look at this this talk or at the repo
it's open-source and you make an app of
your own please tweet at us please show
it to us we're going to be very excited
