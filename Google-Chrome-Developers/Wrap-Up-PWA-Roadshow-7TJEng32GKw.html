with lots of information about how to
build progressive web apps that are fast
integrated reliable and engaging and
that you're inspired and motivated to go
build a progressive web app yourself I
want to give you a short teaser about
some of the new capabilities that are
coming to the web platform that have
recently landed or will be landing
shortly the first is the credential
management API the credential management
API is a standards-based browser API
that provides a programmatic interface
between your site and the browser for
seamless sign-in across devices it
removes friction from sign-in flows
users can automatically be signed back
into your site even if their session is
expired or if they've saved their
credentials on another device it allows
for one tap sign-in that leverages the
native account chooser it allows your
application to store the users
credentials either a username and
password combination or even federated
account details these credentials can
then be synced across devices the
credential management API is supported
today in Chrome and opera and Apple has
already started working on it web VR
creates a fully immersive 3d experience
in your browser using a VR headset and a
VR capable device well still in its
infancy it's supported today in Chrome
Firefox Microsoft edge and Samsung
browser web assembly or wasm provides a
new way to run code written in languages
like C and C++ on the web at near native
speeds it provides the speed necessary
to build an in-browser video editor or
to run a unity game at a high frame rate
utilizing existing standards based web
platform api's and of course there's
plenty more too many to talk about
constructible streams and persistent
storage for service workers or the
ability for an app to handle a certain
number of silent push messages with the
budget api
the web platform will continue to
improve making it easier for you to
radically improve your user experience I
want to provide you with a few resources
that may be helpful as you're building
progressive web apps the first
developers.google.com slash web is our
opinionated resource for building
amazing web experiences you'll find
guidance tutorials case studies and all
the latest information there second we
have a lot of code labs for you to get
real coding experience at code labs
developers.google.com now it's time for
you to dive into some code labs and put
what you've learned to use I'd recommend
starting with the your first progressive
web app code lab then take a look at the
debugging serviceworkers code lab after
that you can either jump into the push
notifications or web payments code lab
better yet do both check the description
for links to slides from this video and
to some of the other links that I shared
I'm Pete
I hope these videos have left you
inspired and that you're excited to
start radically improving your user
experience thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
