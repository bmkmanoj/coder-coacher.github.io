visual point of view I wanted to go back
and take a look at accessibility now I'm
not an accessibility expert I know it
much less than I understand other things
like performance or CSS or whatever so I
wanted to kind of show it because it's a
journey I'm kind of going on to kind of
improve my understanding in this area
and so at least wanted to show you the
changes that I made or at least kind of
how I checked some of the changes that I
made on the site so on screen I have I'm
gonna enable voice over to OS 10 voice
over is on system preferences
accessibility window Help button okay
it's definitely on because it's talking
at me which is kind of what you'd hope
only on the button to click this button
press control option space okay I don't
want to do anything don't don't talk I'm
talking I'm talking you don't talk stop
it okay I'm gonna what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna dive into the page and then
this is before I made my changes okay
all right
chrome Chrome to zero one six
visited link chrome dev summit okay
it'll talk again yeah it's the thing
about talking you are currently on a
link inside of a banner to click this
link press ctrl option space the hell
tag is don't you homepage okay go to
homepage seems like a good thing okay so
um to keep this video brief I'm just
gonna kind of show only a couple of
changes that I've made but you can
extrapolate that I've made changes to
all the templates around the site off
the back of this all being well let me
see if I got this right navigation for
items oh no this is the old build oh
dear let's have a look this term npm run
build
hmm chrome chrome dev summit 2-0 what
banner three items
visited link chrome dev summit list four
items scheduled okay so this is the one
this is the old one right now Samedi yep
I know you're gonna talk I'm gonna go
crazy and cross to the list list for
endings no it's not a list this is the
thing it's actually enough we're
currently on the list inside of a banner
see I'm not I'm not I'm in a navigation
admittedly inside of a banner I'll take
that so that's one thing that isn't
right and actually when we look at the
source code in a moment in fact let me
just switch off yeah you know I'll show
you the other bit as well so we can use
its like control at left right arrows to
kind of skip through elements visited
and a list and if let's look at visited
link watch the livestream now seemed
good end of that padding level one
chrome dev summit also seems good
complimentary one item not a
complimentary connect with chrome
engineers and other leading developers
for a two-day exploration of building
beautiful and performant experiences
sounds good
end of complimentary not a complimentary
visited link schedule take a look over
the agenda feels like you should be
giving me a little bit of a gap there
like a full stop
visited link code labs check out our
step-by-step coding guides visited link
location chrome dev summit is NSF Gaz z
SF jey is easy not really it's at SF
Jazz and I understand why screen reader
you are currently on a link inside of
HTML content to click this link press
control option space I can understand
why a screen reader wouldn't understand
that it's SF jazz that it would think is
FF s FJ a Z Z or Zed Zed for me cuz
English so what I will do is I will
temporarily switch off voiceover let's
do that so it's just a bit quick oh oh
no no no no stop it okay whoo
whoo so there's a small chance it can be
a little bit stressful when it's when
it's talking at you especially when
you're trying to record a video
explaining yeah right let me move the
build on
I think the build I want is that one
yeah I labels and whatnot and we'll do a
fresh build so now you can see when I do
that and let's see if the code is there
as well let's go and find where would be
a good place I think the masthead is
certainly one place you can see that the
masthead graphic which is that SVG's
debacle let's call it what it is the
debacle that was has an aria-label of
now masthead and then I've added this
masthead image title so that's gonna be
something that should hopefully be
announced as well things like titles
that's gone on as well in the head maybe
or in the header did a pretty matter
it's in the header in the header that's
weird that's not the right thing or is
it got itself confused
it might have got itself confused hmm
okay I'll tell you what we'll do we'll
just look at it in the source code of
the page that'll do it
instead we now have a nav called
menu nav and instead of there being a
list they're just divs and because this
is set to display flex this is fine
there are individual items each with an
anchor I probably don't even need the
dibs actually I might just remove those
and put the the clasp straight onto the
anchor that'll probably be even tinier
less markup I might just do that today
in fact what an idea
and then here's another little little
thing that I did which I understand
you're sure here this is it after a chat
with I mean zoom in after a chat with
Jake Archibald my colleague hopefully
many of you know Jake if you don't he's
one of my colleagues
I said that so now chrome dev summit is
at SF and then jazz in lowercase and
then this in between it you might be
thinking what on earth is that the
answer is it's the Unicode character for
a non visible space so then it renders
as SF jazz together but it's actually
pronounced as SF jazz so we're kind of
doing the visual thing as well as the
screen reader thing and then I use a CSS
text to transform to bring that all to
uppercase which is why it's wrapped in a
span you see hmm
that will do the trick now with that
said I can now switch on voiceover once
more it's gonna tour cutters again
welcome to OS 10 voiceover is on system
preferences accessibility window help
button okay and we'll start hopefully at
the top again schedule select visited
link chrome dev summit banner 3
navigation for items navigation for
items better
visited link visited link location phone
end of navigation
visited link watch the live stream now
end of banner heading level 1 um
masthead Darin Fisher delivering the
keynote at chrome dev summit 2 0 1 5
image how to set 2015 whatever connect
with chrome engineers and other leading
developers for a 2-day export yeah
visited link schedule take a look over
the agenda that's because I used an
after there to put a full stop in
visited link code labs check out our
step by step coding guides and that
after has an opacity of 0 and visited
link location chrome dev summit is an SF
Jazz yes visuals to preferences sure
right so basically that's the what I've
been doing is I've been going through
making sure that there's tab focus and
when you tab between things or you use
the the focus shifting in voiceover I'm
not even sure that's properly called
that it announces the things that I
expected to announce in the way that I
would expect them to be announced so
most of the time it's a case of putting
two titles on things or alternatives or
things like the masthead where there
isn't a like I'm using multiple elements
to kind of achieve the effect or
whatever I'm having to use Aria role or
just role equals image for example and
then Aria label equals and then what I
would put in an alt text should it have
been an image the other thing let me
just see if I can switch it on quickly
if not I will show you how one does it
yes so it's not switched on on here so
let's go to chrome Flags mm-hmm and
developer tools experiments will enable
that relaunch and now inside of the dev
tools settings we have the experiments
and there's an accessibility inspection
and it is always worth pointing out that
these experiments could be dangerous and
but let's make that bigger home they
could they could be dangerous and may
require restarts and they could cause
other issues so switch them on at your
own peril but anyway I'll switch on the
accessibility accessibility inspection
and then let's take our inspect here
we'll do that and there's now an
accessibility tab down here and you can
see the name which is location chrome
dev summit is at SF Jazz contents and
what its role is so you can very quickly
if you just want to check without
actually switching on a screen reader or
anything like that
you can have a do with that and switch
that on and play around with that and
hopefully will tell you all the right
kinds of things or your labels and just
try that on the masthead let's see I
think it's almost had itself maybe well
maybe the most head graphic master
graphic there we are roll of image and
Aria label of what we'd expect and as
you can see it bears out that when I
actually use at least voiceover anyway
that I'm getting the right kinds of
things and I was still more work to do
in this area because the side nav I'll
need to
put on an inert and if you're not heard
of in it we will link to Rob Dodson's
inert polyfill ally casts which you
should definitely watch it's a very
straightforward way of saying this thing
is not visible right now and I'll
probably need that if I'm gonna do a
sliding in and outside and have in fact
he actually talks about a previous
sighting have I built in that episode
and also I need to find a way of making
sure that the tab focus is sort of
locked into the side nav when it's out
because it's kind of like a modal anyway
all that and more you'll discover if you
watch Ally casts so as always check out
the code on github you say hello to me
in the comments I've been responding to
a lot if I've missed your comment I'm
very sorry keep trying you can say hello
to me on Twitter at arrow twist and I
will of course see you in the next entry
yes that's when I'll be back
brilliant have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
