of new stuff coming to dev tools in
chrome 62 including two new ways to take
screenshots to take a screenshot of a
specific HTML node such as this header
here select the node in the elements
panel open the command menu by pressing
command shift P on Mac or ctrl shift P
on Windows and Linux type node then
select capture node screenshot to take a
screenshot of a portion of the viewport
click inspect hold command on Mac or
ctrl on Windows and Linux then drag your
mouse over the portion that you want to
screenshot here's what's new in the
console as you may know the await
operator lets you write synchronous
promise paste code that doesn't block
the main thing when you're tinkering
around in the console you can now use a
weight in your top-level statements if
you've got a lot of the messages log to
your console you can now filter out the
noise by typing a minus sign in the
filter box followed by some text if that
text occurs in the message or the file
name that created a message then the
console hides that message you can also
filter by URLs now in the filter box
type URL colon followed by a portion of
a script file name and then the console
only shows messages that came from that
file when you want to inspect all
objects of a certain type you can now
call the new query objects API to get
the job done quickly just pass in a
constructor and dev tools returns an
array of all objects in the heap that
were instantiated with that constructor
here we've got a page with four buttons
within the iframe we can see a
JavaScript reference to button 1 and
down here in this script block we can
see references to buttons 2 and 3 when
we pass HTML button element to query
objects the console returns an array
that includes buttons 2 and 3 for
security reasons to use this array in
subsequent statements we need to
manually store it as a global variable
button floor isn't included because
there's no reference to it
in the JavaScript heat and button one
isn't included because it's in a
different context when we changed the
console context to the iframe and then
run query objects again we can see
button 1 as expected in the elements
panel you can now visualize CSS grids
hover over an element that has display
grid applied to it and you can see the
grid that's affecting the elements
layout this also works when the parent
of the element has display grid applied
to it in the network panel it's now easy
to share Network recordings with your
colleagues thanks to the new horror
imports feature to load a har file just
drag and drop it into the network panel
and in case you didn't know
to save a network recording right-click
the requests table and select save as
har with content in the coverage tab you
now get even more detail about which
code your page actually uses before the
coverage tab marked every line of a
function as used so long as the function
was called but now the coverage tab
shows you which blocks of code within
each function are actually being used if
you've built progressive web apps you
might have noticed that cache debugging
can be a little rough around the edges
the big problem was that the dev tools
UI didn't reflect cache updates in real
time in chrome 62 the experience is much
better here I've got a demo that lets me
create update and delete the cache the
dev tools you I now updates in real time
when a cache is created same with
creating a resource also new in chrome
62 you can now view the contents of a
resource by clicking on it the preview
also updates in real time when the
contents of that resource change that
does it for chrome 62 thanks for
watching
tweet us at chrome dev tools or start a
thread in the mailing list to discuss
these changes and subscribe to the
chrome Developers YouTube channel to
keep up with the latest trends in web
dev we'll be back in six weeks for
chrome 63</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
