Q&amp;amp;A I'm Paul and I'm Surma now today
we're gonna answer another question and
as usual it seems Surma has chosen one
what have you chosen chosen a question
once again and this week is going to be
I'm in general very interested in
gesture driven animations that use
physics based equations would be great
to hear about that ok cool uh well
actually as a side note I was playing
with this fire tech preview and they've
just recently added this spring timing
function have you seen this yeah I heard
about it I haven't actually looked at
what it looks like yeah so basically
what they do is instead of saying you
know timing function ease out you can
say spring and then it's like mass the
dampening factor the initial velocity
and a bunch of other supplies there's
really physics based it is the weird
thing is at the moment you can actually
put a duration on it and after that time
it will just snap to the final location
which kind of felt strange that's not
sound very physics based no it doesn't
it sounds kind of weird hybrid but
nonetheless it's an interesting proposal
to introduce physics based stuff to
existing CSS animations but how that's
gonna pan out I do not know what your
thoughts on the whole area something
that you actually taught me I guess or
told me was M when it looks right it is
right yes which is something that we've
been employing encodes all them for
example with the swipeable cards that
you wrote you just went with a strong
way which said current position minus
end position or the other way around /
for every frame will have like you
realize smooth out effect which is not
physics space at all it isn't even frame
rate independent but in 99% of time it's
gonna feel right to the user and that is
the only thing that actually counts I
think yeah cuz I got that from my one of
my teachers at school when we were doing
some like drawing work basically was
like if it looks right it is right and
it's kind of stuck with me and yet I
think there's two parts to this which is
firstly if somebody is interacting with
something on screen it's got to feel
like it's sticking to their finger
assuming that's the kind of feel you're
actually going for sure after that you
can get away with quite a lot because
it's not a real
all thing that they're exacting with
right I mean this is the whole idea
behind material design is this kind of
these layers that sort of respond sort
of like a real world they had also kind
of magical as well and it's a metaphor
and he stops there right think but and
even with skeuomorphic stuff of yes the
it was kind of realistic but also kind
of not as well and I think so Long's it
as you say as long as it looks right or
so apparently for what I say as long as
it looks right I think it is right and
and and the thing about doing something
that's physics based generally is this
increased computational cost of doing
the physics calculations to you real
game for arguably questionable gain I
think I think it's narrow phrasing yeah
I mean in some cases it's going to be
right it's gonna be the right thing to
do
depending on the the UI that you're
making but in other cases I think if you
can fake it and you get close to it yeah
absolutely do that and especially if
it's gonna mean that you're spending
less time on the CPU and you're much
more likely to hit like a 60 frames a
second
it's get unwieldy when you go for
physics based really fast because you
have to basically pretend that a certain
item has weight so you can kind of
figure out how fast it's going to go
scan all these kind of things yeah they
get really annoying because you're like
I have a div let's pretend it weighs
five kilograms and then you get more
variables you can tune it gets really
hard to juggle all these things in your
head and I think most of the time
especially when you're talking about
simple UI that is not worth the effort
or the computational time that comes
with it exactly so there you have it I
think if you can do it great don't
stress out about it and you know just
give it your best shot
and I think that most of the time as
long as you're doing 60 frames a second
stick to finger and you know everything
kind of plays out generally quite nicely
with the ease and so forth most of the
time that'll actually cover you pretty
well so thank you very much for joining
