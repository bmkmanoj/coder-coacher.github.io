user experiences that are fast reliable
and engaging they can be added to the
home screen send push notifications and
implement sophisticated casting
strategies these capabilities give us a
lot of power you can do things we were
not able to do before but it also means
that if they're using potpourri
bad things can happen to both the site
owners and the site users because of
that these technologies can be used only
on top of communication platform that
offers some fundamental security
guarantees for both our sites and our
users essential component of the secure
underlying platform is the HTTP protocol
which allow us to send and receive data
in secure way let's take a look at what
it really means and some of the factors
to consider when implementing it
yourself hypertext Transfer Protocol or
HTTP is a protocol used to exchange
between the browser and the website you
connect to http is a secure version of
that protocol where the s at the end
stands for secure it indicates that all
communications between your browser and
the given web server are encrypted using
cryptographic protocol called transport
layer security or TLS by showing the
screen lock and the word secure in the
URL bar the browser indicates to the
user that the connection between the
site and the user is using TLS and
therefore it's safe having a secure
connection merely means three things
identity when you type HTTP colon slash
slash google.com into your browser your
browser receives a cryptographic proof
of identity from the server called
certificate the browser used that
certificate to prove that it's talking
to the léo Google com not some other
server that's pretending to be Google
com
so when you type a URL into your address
bar the browser gets proof that it
the real domain that you are talking to
confidentiality once the browser knows
that you are talking to the Leal Google
comm both those parties the browser and
the server have a guarantee that only
they can me the data that's being
processed between them not any attacker
spying on the network and finally
integrity the browser and the server
have a gallon t under HTTPS that when
they send data from one to the other the
data they send is what the other party
receives so an intermediary on the
network can modify or tamper with the
data that's being sent only the browser
and the server can but you may also have
some other association in your mind with
HTTPS when you see the screen lock you
might think that Italy pleasant a
performance cost or financial burden or
maintenance problem many of these
associations were true five or ten years
ago but many of them are no longer true
today and that's because people all over
the world have been interested in
promoting a safe feature for the web
where HTTPS is everywhere my website
doesn't ask the user for any personal
information so you might think I don't
mean II need HTTPS but by having our
site delivered over HTTPS we get
protections against things like a
man-in-the-middle attack a
man-in-the-middle attack is an attack
where the attacker secretly delays and
possibly alters the communication
between two parties who believe they are
directly communicating with each other
these attacks can have a very negative
impact on our apps because it can be
attacks on the Levin ooh and the
limitation of your site and the worst
part of it is that me may not even
realize that attacks are taking place on
unsecure connections
an attacker could essentially take over
the control of the communications
between your site and your users users
would think they are communicating with
your site but they are not also an
attacker could infect your users
computer with malware and malware is
leading
dangerous for users and King calls
immediately citation damage to your
brand on unsecure connections we are
vulnerable to third parties looking at
the data being exchanged an attacker
could grab cookies with that users
credential or see other data that's
closing the network and there's one more
very important reason we must consider
clone and other browsers are starting to
limit access to important api's when
they are not served from secure source
this is a list of features that have
already been removed when accessed over
non secure HTTP and a few more of that
are coming down the pipeline app cache
specifically is coming up next and
longer-term encrypted media extensions
will be sure to be responsible with
announcing timeline and adding a
notification in chrome dev console but
if you are relying on app cache or eme
we encourage you to start thinking about
HTTPS now if you want to use the video
or all your capabilities of your devices
your site needs to be served over HTTPS
most importantly service workers are
amazing as you've already heard they are
the secret superheroes behind a pwace
that enable performance in the face of
sketchy network conditions service
workers sit between the browser and the
network so they actually manage every
request that comes through and you can
imagine it's clinically important that
the site owners own their service
workers this is why service workers
require HTTPS the bottom line is that
HTTPS is a critical part of delivering a
good user experience everywhere so how
about the performance issue well all the
encryption and negotiation of secure
connection slow down my site this is a
valid concern but with modern hardware
and a few simple optimizations we can
eliminate the performance issues to
understand what's going on and how we
can ensure fast experience let's take a
look at how an HTTP request is made when
the user requests a page
unless they specifically on the secure
version the browser will request the
page over HTTP if your site is only
provided over a secure connection which
it should be Allah spawns wittily
dialect telling the browser to request a
secure page next comes the TLS handshake
which takes two more round trips to
establish the connection and exchange
keys finally the browser is able to
securely request a page there are two
places that can slow down the users
experience first there is a
computational cost of generating the
cryptographic keys and encrypting data
thankfully modern hardware has made
great improvements to help minimize
these costs and what once may have
required additional Hardware can now be
done well by the CPU the second issue is
that additional round trips require fold
initially dialect and the tias handshake
we can easily get it up the first
dialect using web security feature
called HTTP strict Transport Security
HSTs lets a website tell browsers that
it wants to communicate only using HTTPS
and therefore avoids Delhi dialect if a
browser and the server have spoken to us
before the browser can remember a
session ID and the next time it goes to
make TLS connection it's in the session
ID which allows the browser to shave off
part of the TLS handshake this is called
TLS session assumption and it also
allows you to shave off a round trip TLS
false start is an optional protocol
extension that allows the client to send
application data when the handshake is
only partially complete during the TLS
handshake as soon as the client received
the first response from the server it
has all the information it needs to
start encrypting and sending data
combining this optimization with TLS
session assumption we can cut one round
trip from the TLS handshake for both
first-time visitors and returning
visitors this will also reduce the
overhead of public key cryptography for
returning users finally HTTP 2
the next version of HTTP which is
supported in many browsers including
Chrome Firefox edge and more HTTP to
unlock some pretty dramatic performance
improvements for HTTP using HTTP to you
can do things like multiplexing and
server pushing which majorly
optimize the performance of HTTP
requests while it is true that HTTP is
not free by applying optimization like
the ones I've shown your site can
actually get performance boost from
switching to HTTP 2 for example whether
comm so a small performance impact from
moving to HTTPS when they moved to HTTP
2 they saw a significant performance
increase with an overall drop of 250
milliseconds per page view with the
proper planning and optimization it is
possible to have high performance HTTP
implementations to obtain a certificate
you needed to prove your identity to
certificate authority who then provides
you with the certificate in the past
buying a certificate could be expensive
especially if you needed to handle
multiple domains or wanted to get an
enhanced certificate but this is not the
case anymore so what's the cost a
project called SSL main has for many
years been offering certificate for $16
so even if you need multiple
certificates or one of the fancier
options it shouldn't break the bank
a newer project called let's encrypt
offers free certificates both SSL made
and let's encrypt also offers
command-line tool that help you buy and
manage your certificate so that you can
lean you or set up configurations
automatically so certificates should not
be the reason not to employ HTTPS some
of you are worried about search ranking
you can imagine that if you move your
site to HTTPS search engine might get
confused and you might lose search
ranking because traditional negative
wisdom is that having two different
versions of your site can have negative
impact on search ranking
Google in particular have a few best
practices that you should follow when
moving your site to HTTPS the first
thing you want to do is serve 301
redirects to show search engines that
the site is at the HTTPS version and
once the search crawler gets to the
HTTPS site it's important to serve
canonical link elements reinforcing the
idea that this HTTPS version is the
canonical version of your site there are
several other best practices that you
should follow to keep your site in good
shape but we're not going to get into
that there are plenty of resources
available to you the final thing I want
to look at is the third-party
dependencies
I'm sure many of you have lots of
third-party dependencies on your site as
you move to HTTPS all your content
including third-party content also has
to be served over HTTPS when you move to
HTTPS you also have to think about
whether all your third-party content is
available over HTTPS serving as over
HTTPS should not be a blocker nowadays
for example Google's Adsense and other
exchange requests are always served over
HTTPS and this isn't just a Google thing
this is an industry-wide trend in 2013
IAB published a blog post in which they
indicated that 80% of their member ad
systems or supporting HTTPS and they
underscored their commitment to getting
all the way to hundred percent if you
depend on the liver header to get paid
for traffic referrals the browser will
strip the header when the user follows a
link from your secure site to their non
secure site fortunately there is a web
platform feature called liver policy
which can be used to set liquor policy
HTTP header to allow our partners
running in secure HTTP to know that our
site is sending traffic to them without
showing the full URL that the user was
visiting so user privacy it's still
somewhat protected for understanding the
details of security the
depswa security panel can help you in
conclusion AC TPS will protect your
users is required to use some api's but
moving to HTTPS needs some planning in
order to make the move smooth if you
want to know more we have lots of
resources to help you on the way thank
