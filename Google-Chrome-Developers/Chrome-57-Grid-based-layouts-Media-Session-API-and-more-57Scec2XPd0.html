a new CSS grid layout specification you
can now customize and respond to user
input on the lockscreen and
notifications using the new media
session API and there's plenty more I'm
Pete LePage let's dive in and see what's
new for developers in chrome 57 flexbox
is a powerful layout tool it makes many
complex layouts possible but it can only
do layout in one dimension chrome 57
adds support for display grid the new
CSS grid layout specification adding a
powerful new tool for creating
2-dimensional grid based layouts
optimized for responsive user interface
design elements within the grid can span
multiple rows or columns and regions in
a CSS grid can also be named making a
layout code easier to understand
ferma has an updates post about it
linked in the description and when
you're ready to dive in deeper check out
Rachel Andrews grid by example.com site
one of the missing features from web
media applications has been the ability
to deeply integrate with the core media
experiences on mobile devices in Chrome
for Android you can now customize the
lockscreen and notifications with media
content using the new media session API
by providing metadata to the browser
about the content being played you can
create rich lockscreen messages that
include information such as the artist
title album name artwork and more you
can also listen for and respond to user
actions taken on the lockscreen or
notification such as seeking or skipping
if you want to get started quickly
francois has a great updates post about
it or check out the official chrome
media session sample repo on github both
are linked in the description below and
there's lots more there are some
improvements to the payment request API
you can specify the color of the text
input cursor with the caret color
property visual effects such as
wine color and style can be specified
with new text decoration properties the
fetch API response class now supports
the dot redirected attribute to help
avoid untrustworthy responses and reduce
the risk of open redirect errs
all WebKit prefixed index DB global
aliases have been removed after their
deprecation and m38 and one of my
favorites new pad start and pad and
formatting methods that simplify strange
hiding when lining console output or
printing numbers with a fixed number of
digits these are just a few of the
changes in Chrome 57 for developers
check the description for more details
and links to the documentation and
specifications if you want to stay up to
date with chrome and know what's coming

LePage and as soon as chrome 58 is
released I'll be right here to tell you
what's new in Chrome
