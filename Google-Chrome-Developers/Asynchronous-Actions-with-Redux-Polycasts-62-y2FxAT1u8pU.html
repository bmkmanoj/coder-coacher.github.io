back to the podcast show so today we're
going to be talking about doing
asynchronous actions using polymer Redux
and to do this we're going to use a
little library called redux thunk so
relaxed kind of in a nutshell basically
teaches redux to treat certain kinds of
actions as functions so I can give it a
function and I'll run it as if it's any
other action and inside of that function
I can do all sorts of cool asynchronous
work and I can share those functions
amongst my different components that way
I don't have to like duplicate that work
all over the place so I'll teach you how
to do that as well today so follow me
over here to my text editor and the
first thing we're going to do actually
is bust open a terminal and inside our
project we're just going to npm install
- - slave redux funk
now I've already got polymer redux and
I've got Redux installed from the
previous episode so if you haven't seen
that episode definitely go check that
out we'll include a link to it maybe a
little picture and picture window will
pop up somewhere I go check out that
episode over here though we're just
going to install Redux font from NPM
I've already got it set up so we're good
to go the next thing I'm going to do is
go over to my text editor and here I'll
bump this up a little bit make it a bit
easier to read and I'm going to start
off by creating a Redux store so here I
am importing polymer Redux and then I'm
going to strip the element inside of
this HTML import called Redux store and
the first thing I usually do is create
some initial state so I'll say cost
initial state and what we're going to
build today is a really really really
simple example it's just going to be
like a little form that someone can type
in a username and click signup and then
it's going to go off and do a little bit
of asynchronous work and when that work
is done it'll display that person's name
so while it's doing the work it will be
like loading and then once they're done
we'll be like welcome so when so you
know whatever use your name they put in
so our initial state here will say
loading is false and we will say we'll
give it a name
initial state say loading is false and
username equals no okay cool so once I
have my initial state in place the next
thing I want to do is write a reducer so
reducer is going to take in the actions
that are just batched and modify our
state so we'll say reducer is a function
that takes state and action as arguments
we'll say hey if there was no state
passed in then we will return turn our
initial state otherwise we're going to
switch on the action type so switch
action type so the first action we'll be
looking for is a sign up started okay
we're going to just return our state
object and as it sounds like the typical
Redux pattern we're going to make a
clone of that state object and we're
going to mutate the the loading flag
inside of there so we'll say return
object of slide and we will pass in an
empty object we'll pass in our state to
copy it over into that empty object come
in will pass in loading true okay so
someone says sign started we're just
going to display a loading message the
other thing we're going to do here is
we'll have sign up completed okay we're
going to do something very similar we're
going to return object not a spy pass an
empty object passing state and then the
two things we're going to do here is
we're going to set loading back to false
and we're also going to assume that
someone is going to pass in the username
as part of that action so we're going to
say username is equal to action dot
username okay so this is our very simple
reducer just handling a couple of sort
of like asynchronous States okay once we
have that in Poli we need to we need to
create our store do it this way so I
don't make a typo there we go the store
equals Redux create store we're going to
pass it the reducer and then we're going
to call Redux apply middleware can give
it this Redux func thing and again Redux
func is going to a teach our store and
our dispatcher to take a function in
certain cases and treat it as if it is
an action so you can still dispatch
regular actions just like we did in the
previous episode we can also dispatch
function now or give it to the
dispatcher and we'll run that function
and it will actually sort of like treat
it like it's its own action but that way
we can do a bunch of async work inside
of that function so I'm going to create
our store that way we're going to create
a Redux behavior this will say cost
Redux
behavior equals polymer Redux we'll pass
it the store okay and then I want to
create another behavior that's going to
contain my asynchronous action so in the
last episode one of the things I did was
actually kind of like hard-coded the
action just batch to the component that
I was working with and you know the
issue with that is if you have more than
one component that needs to dispatch the
same action that would be sort of
annoying and repetitive to have to like
implement that every single component so
we can do is we can create a behavior
for the actions object the polar Redux
uses I'm going to share that amongst any
sort of components that want to dispatch
these particular actions so I'm going to
create a new behavior called
async actions behavior this is just
going to be an object it is going to
have an action object on it and the
action that we're going to be doing is
just going to be called sign up with
timeout so we're not actually going to
let go talk to an API or anything to
simulate an asynchronous action I'm just
going to write a set timeout inside of
this action reader so our action will be
sign up with timeout
it's a function that is going to take as
an argument a username and it's going to
return a function that takes a
dispatcher as an argument so that's
going to be the actual redux dispatcher
basically redux func is going to handle
passing that dispatcher into this return
function for us and then we just want to
dispatch a few actions so the first
thing we'll do is we'll call a
dispatcher dispatch
ah let's see make sure they do this make
sure I do this right here really quick
so passing in dispatch oh ah this is
what I got wrong and you'll have doing
something wrong
instead of passing in the dispatcher
object we're actually just patching or
we're just passing in the dispatch
method so we don't actually have to you
know say dispatcher that dispatch nicely
just batch and the person will do is we
will just batch an action or sorry an
action whose type is signed up started
right so this is going to kick off our
asynchronous process then we're going to
do a set timeout
so set timeout give it a function here
say wait maybe like 3,000 seconds all
right and then inside of this function
we're going to dispatch another action
this time we'll assume that our you know
asynchronous sign-up process is
completed our server responded or
whatever
so we'll say sign up completed and then
we're going to say username is equal to
this user name value that was passed in
here username is equal to user name
right okay I think that looks about nice
to me so what we're going to be able to
do now is share this behavior amongst
components and then those components can
just say this dot dispatch sign up with
timeout and they can like pass in a
username value and we'll go do all this
asynchronous work or whatever and then
eventually that will update our state so
let's actually go implement that I'm
going to create a little sign up form
component so I've got a sign up form dot
HTML that I've created here
I'm already importing polymer I'm
already importing our Redux store right
so I will just step out polymer element
called signup form inside of here we're
going to have a label for our our
username field so the input ID go fixed
let's say username fill that in there
and then we'll have a button where we
say signup and whenever someone tap this
button we will call our sign
function okay and down here we're going
to implement that sign-up function and
it will be pretty straightforward we're
just going to say so let's use your name
equal let's see let's give this input
text an ID so say ID
yeah user or something so let's say
username equals this dot dollar sign
user dot value okay and we'll save just
got dispatch sign up with time out and
we'll pass in that username now we need
to also make sure that we are mixing in
the correct behaviors for this element
so we you know empower it with cool
Redux abilities so we'll say a behaviors
I'm still going to spell this like wrong
there we go ahead pavers want to make
sure that we put in the Redux behavior I
think it's just called redox behavior
let's check our store really quick so
Redux behavior and ethnic actions
behavior my copy both fees so that I
don't make any typos here so drop that
in we'll say one rejects behavior I'll
say I want a sync actions behavior okay
so now what this is done is if you watch
the previous episode we actually like
gave our actions dispatching element and
actions object like a properties object
in this case that we're just sharing
that because we've got that acing
actions behavior and we've already sort
of define the actions object there so
that's just going to get shared with
this component so it can just call
dispatch it can reference this line up
of timeout action creator and then it'll
do all this work for us okay so I think
that this looks good so far
now the next thing I want to do is I
want to create another element to just
sort of like display as a state as being
updated inside of our app so I'm going
to create another element just called
notification bar so it's a notification
bar dot HTML just like the last one
we're going to import polymer we're
going to import the redux store start to
stub this one out we'll say notice
vacation bar this one is actually going
to have some properties
properties right and these are going to
be coming from our Redux store so the
first property is going to just be
loading type boolean and then remember
from the last episode of the way that we
record something in the Redux stores
will use this state path property so
state path in this case because it's
like right on the root store object we
can just say the state path is loading
again if it was like method you know if
it was you know at like food bar not
loading we could reference it this way
using dots but we're just going to say
loading and we're also going to say the
username is going to be passed in so
that it's just going to be a string and
again the state path for that will just
be using name right on the route object
there and so I'm just going to do this
quick and dirty like I'm not going to do
a bunch of you know elaborate checks or
guards or anything about things being
undefined or whatnot I just want to
demonstrate how this works so I'm going
to write two templates one that displays
a loading message and one that displays
the username just assuming that you know
everything works and it's fine and dandy
if it doesn't though you know inside a
signup form for instance you could have
our site inside of this anything actions
behavior here sign up uptime up you can
have error handling inside of here you
could dispatch like an error state
action or something like that as well
this is where you would do that work but
in our case we're just going to keep it
you know pretty simple
I'm going a couple Dom if templates plus
eight what is Dom if if we are loading
then we're just going to have a little
paragraph whoa that is way more than a
paragraph we'll just have a little
paragraph there Muriel that says loading
dot okay and then we'll drop in another
template is Dom if if we have a username
drop in another paragraph and we'll just
say welcome use the name
like that okay so again I'm not doing
like a bunch of fancy error checking or
anything like that but I just want to
demonstrate how this thing works so
let's go back to our index file we're
going to uncomment these elements we're
going to make sure notification bar is
in we're going to make
your signup form is then we'll make sure
we've got both of them down in the body
and then note here in my script tags
what I'm doing I'm pulling in web
components light J s I'm pulling in
Redux and I'm pulling in Redux thunks
remember to pull this in as well don't
don't don't wire all this up and be like
why the heck isn't it working
so make sure you pull in rejects bunk as
well and now I think we've got
everything set up let's go over here
refresh the page I'll zoom this in so
you can see it so I was on a console in
case something explodes so it's always
good to see if that happens so what we
want to happen is someone's going to
type in their username they're going to
click sign up it'll put the app in a
loading State and then for three seconds
because we got that set timeout in there
you'll just say loading and then
eventually it'll come back and I'll say
welcome and whatever username we type so
we'll say put in Bob Dodd oh there we go
signup and nothing happens it's totally
broken where did we go wrong
all right oh let's see so just dispatch
signed up with timeout username so let's
see let's just make sure that is even
being called well log username make sure
that's being called so Bob signup okay
that part's working all right make sure
in our Redux tour actions sign up with
time oh oh oh
mmm I know so our notification bar here
I totally forgot to mix in the behaviors
so I always do this so I want to pull on
this Redux behavior he does not need the
async actions behavior because not just
bashing any actions it's just going to
be displaying whatever we type in let's
try this again
so we'll say Bob Dodd say sign up is
loading
tick tick tick tick tick boom welcome
Bob Dodd all right so there you have it
that is a very easy way to add
asynchronous actions to your redux
polymer app I'll include some links down
in the show notes for some more
information on redux funk because it's a
it's cool but it's also sort of another
big topic and it's kind of outside of
the scope for us to explain in the show
but I'll definitely view some reading
material so you can learn
more about it as always if you have
questions you can leave them for me down
in the comments or hit me up on a social
network of your choosing at hashtag ask
