geocities website there was something
about like building that and you like
showing it to people in me like hey this
is think i'm like i made i remember
creating like silly little apps that
would would do things like just like
have a cat face that wouldn't me out you
and I were you like picked on it when I
was a kid I used to love mechanical toys
because it was easy to pull them apart
and see how they worked but I started
work on the web I felt that again i felt
like i was able to open it up and see
how it worked what i love about the web
is how quickly it's changing and how i
get to be sitting on the leading edge of
it i reckon the one thing I love the
most about the web is the fact that
anybody can put up a site anyone can
just pick up a tutorial I'm within like
10 minutes they've got a website
something visible on the screen having
the ability to talk to someone it's on a
completely different part of the world
having them like contribute to your
project being able to just imagine
something and build it it can also be
frustrating because sometimes there are
tools and things like that that you want
to use that's maybe aren't available yet
you can sort of see them off there in
the future right maybe one browser
implements them but not all the other
ones the real frustrating experience
about the web is anything that gets in
the way of content it's this massive
inconsistent area of api's and
technologies everything has a catch like
if you want service workers you need TLS
if you want push that's fine but you
kind of payload if you want payload you
have to encrypt it when a website says
hey do you want to go and download our
native app that's such a bad experience
because I'm already there I'm already
asking you for the content it would be
like going into a shop and having the
thing like a kit kat in your hand and
you go to the checkout and they say hey
would you like to go to a shop in
Norwich like no no I'm at this shop now
when I think about the future of the web
it's always about that promise and it's
not being fulfilled yet the idea that
everybody on the planet can communicate
the next billion users people that are
in other parts of the world that maybe
don't have as good network connectivity
is we do making things faster making
things more accessible these are really
important challenges that we're facing
chipping away at some of the all
preconceived notions we try and listen
we try and drive conversations
I just makes my day I'd love to see more
people doing that like just empowering
other people to build awesome stuff
we're going to be able to build apps
that we've never even dreamed of before
I think it's cool to be living through
this period in time right now I think
generations will look back and be like
wow that's like an inflection point for
Humanity and suddenly communication
became global and instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
