caching but they're also really good for
giving you instant loading performance
benefits when it comes to repeat visits
yep right and you can achieve that using
an application shell architecture ya
know that's kind of the idea of kind of
separating content from the actual
visual UI so in my head it's kinda like
a native app so you always have the
banner you've got the navigation drawer
at the side you know I have some other
bits that could be common through like
90% of your app yeah you always want it
there so when we talk about the shell
we're talking about the HTML the CSS and
the JavaScript that's making up the bulk
of your UI yes stuff that you know if
you cache that you can still just like
load up content in the very middle yeah
and save yourself having to constantly
reload that stuff right yeah and it's
super nice when it comes to like let's
say they're visiting page they've never
been to before if you know the layouts
always gonna be the same you can still
load that while you go and get the
content in the background and it just
makes sure that your user has like
really good perceived performance yeah
so the first time your app loads you
might show you might like you're gonna
have to render the shell itself you'll
cache that in your serviceworker and you
might show like a toast just to let them
know hey this application now works
offline yep
and that means that when they come back
another time like let's say they're you
know in airplane mode that shell will
load up really really quickly and then
it might go to the network to fetch the
rest of the content you can then cache
that content so that you know that
entire view is then available whatever
they try accessing it without a network
connection yeah exactly
it's bad we've got some performance
testing we've done with the application
shell model this is using webpagetest so
on first visit we've got a relatively
fast time to first meaningful paint and
this is super important because I think
there can be scenarios where someone
might take advantage of serviceworker to
be like oh don't worry about your first
logo I'm just gonna serve up like
megabytes of stuff that I'm gonna cache
afterwards you'll be super fast but that
first load if that takes so long to the
point where the serviceworker doesn't
even get registered that's pointless and
plus for other browsers that don't
support serviceworker you're then kind
of
just damaging yourself users go and cry
in a corner exactly so you still want to
be serving up just that static render of
your site just so then it just loads up
as fast as humanly possible and then
progressively enhance a serviceworker to
then use the app shell model and if you
are using the app store model as you can
see here we've got really good we've
actually slashed our load times for
first meaningful paints on repeat visits
speaking of like actually taking a look
at what impact server-side rendering has
on this you don't have to use
serviceworker you know to actually be
able to get good gains if you're
building with the app shell model in
mind with server-side rendering in mind
you will get like a really good first
paint even in like Safari and unlike
Mobile Safari on iOS yep all the other
browsers they just don't have
serviceworker yeah now if you're
wondering okay well should I be using
the application shell model on all of my
applications they're gonna be types of
apps like super simple apps this this
might be overkill yeah but if you're
building something that's you know a
little bit more complex a little bit
more dynamic this type of model makes a
ton of sense at Google we're using it
for things like inbox it's working
really well there yeah I think it's one
of those things you end up falling into
the sit there and figure out whether it
makes sense for your site or not but I
think it's a good overall model that
works for a lot of different scenarios
there's a whole ton behind this model
that you know we weigh too much to
explain in just one video but we wrote
up a pretty amazing article on this if
we do say so ourselves well you wrote it
off and I just read it how did your
name's the end of it yes how are you so
much impact that's worth checking out
the format but it's got pretty graphics
yes people should go check that out you
have any more about app shell and then
there's also the getting started guide
for your first progressive web app where
it actually talks about the application
shell model how you can make like take
advantage of it as well as how it
applies to the demo app that you can
build in this lovely code lab and in
that article we also link out to tools
that can help you get started with the
application model like really quickly
that we're working on so go check that
out yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
