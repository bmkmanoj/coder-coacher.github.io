action on notifications with custom
buttons the new developer tools security
panel makes it easier to debug mix
content issues and ensure your site is
properly served over HTTPS and you can
now add presentation mode to mobile apps
easily casting content to a second
screen these are just some of the new
features for developers in chrome 48
let's dive in and see what's new in
Chrome
until recently rien gauging with users
of your website has been a challenge
often involving bulk email but
browser-based notifications changes that
allowing you to send users timely
relevant notifications for example
letting them know that tickets to their
favorite band or on sale or about a new
chat message in chrome 48 you can now
add custom buttons to notifications
enabling users to complete the task
entirely within the notification imagine
that previous example a notification
that tickets to your favorite band just
went on sale with a Buy Now button to
add buttons to your notifications add an
array of actions including a title an
action ID to the notification info
object if the user clicks on one of the
actions that information is passed in
the notification click event be sure to
provide buttons that are specific and
allow users to quickly respond to the
notification and make sure that they're
different from the default action peter
beber Liu has a cool sample you can try
at the URL below we all expect sites
that deal with our personal information
to be served over HTTPS it's just
standard practice as we start to build
apps that take advantage of powerful
features like serviceworker it's simply
a requirement some api is that we've
used for years without HTTPS like GL
occasion or device motion may require
secure connections in the future HTTPS
helps to protect the integrity of our
apps and our users information there's a
new security panel and developer tools
to help with this at a glance it tells
you whether the page is secure not and
can help you diagnose HTTPS issues it
shows information about the certificate
the protocol and cipher and the status
of all of the sub resources to see how
it works in some of the different errors
it'll help you debug open the new
security panel and developer tools and
check out HTTP bad SSL calm how often
have you gathered a group of friends or
coworkers around your phone to show them
the latest me more work video or
something wouldn't it be awesome to be
able to send it to a second larger
screen directly from your phone chrome
48 on Android now allows sites to
present to Google cast devices using the
standard space presentation API and a
cast web SDK the presentation API allows
you to leverage a second display while
using your mobile device as the
controller not only to move between
slides or choose which video place next
but as a game controller or input device
imagine a racing game that uses your
phone as the steering wheel or an
interactive tutorial to help students
improve their math skills there's some
other cool new features in chrome 48
like network information but download
max which provides the maximum bandwidth
of a device one use case warned users
about large transfer on cellular
networks that might eat up their
allotted bandwidth and there's the new
get all methods that simplify bulk
indexeddb interactions these are just
some of the new features in chrome 48
