Jack Henry and associates which probably
none of you have ever heard of but we
write US banking software so why am I
talking to you today well in that role I
get to contribute to a lot of open
source projects polymer being one
another being Google's closure compiler
but today I want to talk to you about a
new project and that's using polymer
with web pack now I can tell from the
amount of questions I've already had
that there's a lot of interest in this
subject so hopefully I can give you all
the detail you need to actually use this
today before we dive deep into the
internals of how polymer and web pack
can operate together I want to talk a
little bit little bit about why this is
important and how we got here
so my team has been building JavaScript
applications for a long time number of
years but lately we've become pretty
disenfranchised with modern monolithic
JavaScript frameworks what we found is
over time even though we tried to guard
against it almost every file in our app
became tightly bound to the framework so
if we started up a new project we didn't
have a good set of choices we were
either making the same framework choice
we had already made which kills
innovation or we were rewriting and
duplicating code we had already written
which is never fun the other thing we
found with his is modern JavaScript
frameworks tended to have a much shorter
life span than the products we were
developing so once they became
deprecated we were either forced to
upgrade or basically maintain old code
and no one likes that so the idea with
polymer and the web component standard
says these are baked into the platform
and as we all know there's a rule out
there you can't break old code in the
platform so if we're using platform
based code
we're guaranteed backwards compatibility
great this is perfect this gives us our
long lifespan in addition polymer as a
library was just really light syntactic
sugar over the standards and in fact
they went out of their way to get to not
re-implement or even make easier in some
case native api's which we loved well it
might require us to at write more code
locally that code was then closer to the
platform that's producing our longer
lifespan so with the promise of polymer
one
I go into it fully with my team and help
develop this rich component library that
we can share among all our projects of
UI elements the idea being that as each
project spun up we could reuse the
elements we had already built just like
Rob so aptly demonstrated and talked
about but not be locked into this huge
framework so we did it and in most cases
things works great at the element layer
when we put a polymer element into an
old angular project it worked
now there's caveats angular couldn't see
into shadow Dom but that's that was
intentional we expected that but once we
got beyond hey this actually works how
do we build it life was not near as fun
the really interesting thing came down
to polymer being mixed content of HTML
CSS and JavaScript now like most teams
we've been through the full gamut of
front-end built systems you know we
started with grunt we moved on to gulp
and we even experimented with just using
NPM scripts and rewriting gulp ourselves
and kind of actually truth be told today
have projects that use each of these it
didn't matter which of those build
systems we choose integrating polymer
was not fun one of the problems we
encountered is when you did this polymer
used HTML imports
everything else out there uses modules
of some four sort command J s es modules
AMD modules didn't matter they used a
module a syntax so those dependency
trees there was just no good way to mesh
them what we ended up having to doing
felt pretty icky actually what we have
to do is create a synthetic polymer L
import element and add any component we
might want to use anywhere in our app to
that import and then use it then we can
use it over and reference it over in the
JavaScript but when we switch back or
refactor we have to remove remember oh
now I no longer use this I need to
remove it from my HTML import over here
and be careful because I need to make
sure I really am not using it anymore
what happens is on larger projects we
ended up writing custom tooling to try
to make sure and add checks that those
two didn't get out of sync again not a
lot of fun what we found ourselves
struggling with was just the sheer
weight of the build system code over and
over in my team's retrospectives it
keeps coming up it's got to be a better
way I don't like writing all this build
system code the other clue that there
was a problem that needed fixing was the
build system itself started requiring
substantial documentation not the code I
set out to write was a build system I
set out to write a product for my
company inter web pack so let me first
be clear web pack is a build system and
I'm talking about solving build system
problems with a new build system it's
okay it's totally worth it I know you've
heard that a hundred times give me a
chance to prove that this is the case so
web pack is a little bit opinionated but
tends to be opinionated in the ways that
help you as a developer instead of
getting in your way for instance there's
a lot of tedious tasks that we work on
in build systems that web practice bakes
in calculating the hash of a built
filesystem so that you can add it to the
name to do cache busting you know
there's 14 bajillion plugins that do
that in grunt and gulp and name your
build system here web pack has it
included
don't even mess with it just use the
naming convention and away you go one of
the other big benefits of webpack is it
comes with the webpack dev server which
is a local development server and an
extremely stable file watcher and i
reference that because if you've tried
to roll your own dev server you know how
easy it is for an exception in your
build process to crash your dev server
that doesn't happen with webpack one of
the other defining points about web pack
is the dependency graph this is nothing
new
lots of build says some type of
dependency graphs where they crawl your
site and find all the used code the
difference with web pack is it's all
your code not just your javascript your
CSS your fonts your images all your
static acids also get added to the build
graph and copied to the distribution
folder that means when you stop using
them in your code they don't get copied
to the distribution folder this is magic
and just works and it's something I
never want to deal with out again
there's one caveat with web pack though
it only handles JavaScript modules so
how can we add static resources to our
dependency graph when they're not a
JavaScript module that's the job of a
web pack loader a web pack loader takes
one input file and its sole goal is to
transform it into a format that the rest
of web pack can handle a JavaScript
module in some way so this makes most
sense when we start out with eggman
script modules so maybe we're writing
latest and greatest stage 2 proposal
eggman script and we just want to
transpile it down to es 5 for delivery
okay the babel loader does that
javascript of javascript no problem
the next part comes with typescript
that's a little bit different IMO in a
lot of ways I'm in a different language
well the type script script loader
simply does what the command-line
typescript compiler does and converts it
down to a JavaScript module still ok now
they now we start getting interesting
what about s CSS files
so there I might need two loaders and
you can chain loaders in webpack so
we're going to pipe I file through a SAS
loader which is going to create a CSS
file and then we're going to convert
pipe it through the CSS loader which
will make a style module which is
JavaScript and can be dynamically add
styles at runtime pretty cool so web
pack just handles that after we've got
our loader set up the next thing we deal
with in web pack is plugins and plugins
can deal with any part of the rest of
the compilation lifecycle so the easy
thing that the natural thing everyone
thinks about is something like
minification uglify j/s or whatever
other minify er you want to use I tend
to prefer closure compiler it's not for
everyone but in that case that's only a
small piece of the puzzle web pack has
plugins to do framework specific things
web pack has plugins to handle licensing
web pack has plugins to do
internationalization optimized modules
so that modules don't get duplicated or
get bundled in correct ways on and on
keep in mind a plugins works a little
bit different than a loader because it's
working across multiple files where a
loader is concerned with a single file
one of the other strong benefits of web
pack is how easy it makes code splitting
and lazy loading again these are not new
concepts but they've been strictly
painful in most build systems you as a
developer have to maintain some one set
of files with how does my input map to
my output files and in your code you
have to mean keep in sync as well and
make sure you import them in a way that
that actually works web pack does away
with all of that instead it looks at how
you wrote your JavaScript and builds the
modules for you it also adds the loader
for runtime work so you don't have to do
that either you don't need a separate
module loader web pack adds it as part
of your build let's take an example so
in this case we have a main JavaScript
bundle where the whole app is a single
bundle but let's say that last section
aptly called huge is rarely used we want
to split that
often lazy load it and make our initial
page payload smaller all we have to do
is change how we import the module so
instead of using a standard import
statement which is static we change to a
synchronous import statement and don't
worry we'll talk about a couple
different formats for this this is the
new dynamic import statement fragment
script it's promise based so we're
importing the same module just in a
different way web pack recognizes this
automatically pipes out huge KS code to
its own file and adds the necessary
runtime code to wire it up for me by the
way I keep saying injects run typed code
that's typically pretty scary to anyone
who really likes to know what's going on
on their JavaScript the runtime code for
this uncompressed is about 150 lines so
don't feel like a lot is going on here
it pretty much stays out of your way and
does the bare minimum and does it well
so with polymer we're obviously going to
need a loader again the tricky part here
is that a polymer element is mixed
content it's the problem with build
tooling in the first place so the
polymer web pack loader recognizes the
types of content in your file and
processes each one a little bit
differently so the first thing it do
does is it goes through and looks for
any HTML imports instead of relying on
HTML imports it simply changes this to a
JavaScript import statement great that
one's easy the next one's a bit trickier
what to do with the Dom module in the
template in this case we just make a big
string out of it and call a custom
runtime function which registers it with
polymers dumb Dom module loaders at
runtime so just adds it in and then the
last part is the script tags so external
script references also become module
import statements and inline script tags
just become the module body so splitting
up handling all three different contents
what we were end up with
is an all JavaScript bundle one of the
side effects of doing this wait for it
you're no longer using HTML imports at
all so now you're not relying on a spec
that's not going to be implemented
outside Chrome and you've got a
JavaScript bundle which then the rest of
your tooling is free to optimize in the
way it sees fit
so one sticky point with all polymer
developers has been I just want to
import from node modules and use it in
my element with web pack you can you
don't have to do anything it just works
you're already in a JavaScript module
one little note here we're going to
start and I'm going to talk about this
multiple times the script element has
type equals module this is a clue to
everyone who looks at your code that
you're opting into module syntax and
that's a little bit different than
normal you may have code that's not all
using NPM yet if you're using polymer so
you can also configure web pack to do
the same type of look up from your Bower
components all right so we talked about
adding static files to the graph what
about images well typically with HTML
files in web pack you would use the HTML
loader it would scan your file look for
any image image sources and adding to
the dependency graph now adding an image
to a JavaScript module dependency graph
may seem a little bit odd but in here
web pack again really shines so all it
does is you typically use a file loader
for images and that jha the load that
loaders job is simply copy this file
using the naming conventions I specify
to the distribution folder and the
JavaScript module part of it is the path
name I just copied to so then I have a
valid JavaScript module which in this
case just returns the image path and
everything just works
the trick is polymer elements we've
already done all this manipulation on so
we can't use the normal web pack
bundlers and n' loaders to handle this
the polymer web pack loader does this
for you
it's internally going to pass your HTML
content off to the HTML loader and let
it do the same thing and it's going to
do a similar set of steps with your
Styles both of these can also minify as
they go giving you more bang for the
buck so there's a few differences in how
you write your code when you're using
webpack one of the things to note is
that in polymer to lazy load an element
we typically use polymer import href so
that uses HTML imports that's not going
to work instead we need to use
JavaScript asynchronous imports and I
like a reference there's a couple
different varieties the atma script
dynamic imports statement you can hear
more about this tomorrow in Sam's talk
is the easiest way in the recommended
way to do this
it's promise based so you put your path
to your component and then say dot then
and use the results but perhaps you're
not there yet and you'd like to use
commonjs so this has actually been
supported for a long time no one just
knows about it but there's a common J's
require call called required on insurer
which takes a callback and does a very
similar thing it's job is asynchronously
load a module and then call the callback
when it's ready so we can use that in
web pack today and then we've got our
dynamic import both of these import
statements work in web pack and will be
treated as a split point for code
splitting now you'll notice in my paths
that I'm importing HTML files
don't let that trip you up at this point
those files have been packaged as a
JavaScript bundle so it's totally
appropriate to import them using a
JavaScript function the web pack config
itself is kind of interesting to look at
I think of it as kind of the best of
both worlds between the grunt
configuration file and gulp program and
a program ability you don't have to be
near as much work and doesn't get near
as out
tolas grunt does but it's a lot more
declarative than gulp ever was
so like most systems wetback is going to
start from an entry point or a set of
entry points with polymer your entry
point is probably going to be an HTML
element and that's just fine the loader
will do its job and everything will just
work but like I said earlier we probably
also want to tell web pack where to
resolve and lookup named modules from by
default it's already going to look in
node modules but we might want bower
components to so we just override the
module lookup algorithm and specify two
folders it will now look in both and I
don't even have to worry about it
now we need to configure our loaders
loaders are just a set of rules each
rule has a test that helps filter down
what files it needs to look at normally
the test is just a regular expression on
the file extension followed by that is a
use block with the list of loaders I
want to run through one note on this it
runs last to first so in this case we're
running the polymer web pack loader to
create a JavaScript bundle and then
running babel to transpile that bundle
to es5 and last you can use include and
exclude definitions to further restrict
where it where it looks in this case I'm
restricting it to my source components
folder so that the rest of the HTML in
my project doesn't get treated as a
polymer component now member everything
in web pack is a JavaScript module
modules do not have the same semantics
of scripts probably the biggest
difference here is as soon as you use a
module you're no longer in the global
scope the easiest way to address this
with web pack for your own code is
simply to Claire your elements on the
window element thus forcing them to be
global now everything works again
you only need to do this if you need to
reference the class constructor or the
class itself somewhere else if you don't
need to reference it if you just need to
define it
you don't have to do this but if you
need to reference it somewhere else you
can declare it as a property on the
window element but perhaps you'd like to
use a more modern resident you can also
use module importing and exporting to do
this again notice the script type equals
module the import and export keywords
are not valid in a browser unless you're
already in a module so they weren't
working a script tag so by adding type
equals module I'm telling the browser
that I'm I'm in a module now OneNote
webpack doesn't care one way or the
other you're going to be in a module
this is just an indication to anyone
else looking at your element what's
going on
so now that I've script typing module I
can just say export default class
whatever and that's now exported other
things can now import it one little note
here you can't actually import from an
inline script tag so while this is valid
syntax it doesn't really make any sense
unless you're using webpack and then
that block of code will become my module
body and I most certainly can import
from it so if you're trying to live in
two spaces at once this might be a good
way to handle it but a lot of the code
we deal with is in our own it's library
code and for that case we can't go
change how it was declared webpack has a
whole set of shimming options where you
can at Build time make minor adjustments
to how code is declared to make it work
so in the top I've got a script tag and
I do mean script at this point not
module it's in the global scope and it's
called add some mixin I need to use it
in another module
well since it's no longer going to be in
the global scope web packs exports
loader helps in that I can declare
exactly what file and talking about and
I say I need to export the add some
mixin symbol web pack will automatically
add the export statement to the bottom
of my file which doesn't interfere with
source maps and everything goes from
there
on the reverse side is the provide
plugin so let's say a different piece of
library code expected that add some
mixing function to be global now it's
not the provide plugin says if any part
of my compilation tries to reference add
some mix in globally add an import
statement for it so that it's defined
locally so you can shim back and forth
in that way now if you have a large
existing code base that uses a lot of
script semantics you're going to be
doing a lot of shimming so just keep
that in mind don't expect this to be
just a plugin and it works in it for all
scenarios there is a little bit of play
around here you can do it that there
will be a lot of configuration to make
that work one of the other really cool
things about web pack is it natively
normalizes modules and by that I mean it
understands an echo script static import
an ESX dynamic import statement the
common J's require call and the
asynchronous command J is required on
insure call if all the rest of your code
is using language semantics that are
already supported in your development
browser you don't need a transpiler for
modules why is this a big deal well one
it speeds up your builds not to have to
run them through a transpiler like babel
but to debugging is a whole lot nicer
when you've got the native untranslated
there to look at one of the gotchas here
though is that as you start using
webpack and module syntax especially
with polymer 2 and earlier you're going
to lock yourselves in very easily to web
pack specific syntax that's okay for
your own elements just be aware you've
limited the ability to share your
components with others here's an example
we're importing from node modules
awesome this works we're using the node
module resolution format except that
anybody else who uses his ailment
also has to be able to use the node
module resolution format so we've just
limited our ability to share this to web
components org that's just not allowed
so just keep that in mind another thing
to keep in mind is that how a browser
resolves a URL and how it resolves
modules and how nodes resolves modules
all three of these things have different
semantics for instance the top link in
the HTML imports section is my component
HTML will you look at that and you know
that that means find my component HTML
in the same directory I'm currently in
except that if you're translating that
to a JavaScript import that could mean
import from node modules or a sibling
folder so to get around that ambiguity
we require that the import statement has
a dot slash so the polymer web pack
loader is going to add that for you but
what happens if you wanted to use a
named import for a component
well web pack has specific syntax for
this and it comes up in any place that
URL is use like CSS background images by
adding a tilde character in front of the
URL you tell web pack I really want this
to be a new module resolution and not a
URL lookup but again that's very webpack
specific so be careful where you use it
one of the really tricky things that
happens when you get away from HTML
imports is that the polyfills start
feeling very fragile to get bootstrapped
you have to do this precisely in the
right order so a couple things one if
your transpiling
you'll need the custom element cs5
adapter and any browser that has native
custom Ellis support but you can't
transpile that folder and you shouldn't
bundle it with any other polyfills
because by design it can throw an
exception so watch out for that the next
thing is the rest of the web components
polyfills if you're using the web
components loader load a synchronously
so you have to delay your main bundle
load
till after the web components ready
event fires now this all seems a bit
tricky it is but there's a demo folder
in the polymer web pack loader that
shows exactly how to do this and I
recommend you just reference and follow
that and try not to overthink this a lot
of polymer developers always seem to ask
how do I use a CSS preprocessor like
sass with my polymer elements the
standard answer is you really don't need
them which is true but not what they ask
and sometimes when you're working with
other frameworks you just really want to
reference those global color variables
without using it the problem is that the
shady CSS polyfill features can't see an
external stylesheet adding an external
stylesheet reference like I'm showing
here is completely supported by the
shadow Dom spec the imported Styles will
automatically be added to shadow DOM and
properly scoped but again the shady CSS
polyfill doesn't see it so older
browsers you can't use custom CSS
properties and in no browser can you use
the add apply mixin syntax the polymer
web pack loader has an opt-in option
that in cases like this it will inline
your CSS into the element so you can run
your preprocessor on it and then the
inline elements will let this shady CSS
polyfill match it and you can have both
worlds at that point point all right
what about polymer 3 so all of the
functionality that the polymer team is
moving towards with Palmer 3 can already
be used with this loader in fact it's
doing almost exactly the same thing you
can bundle and use echo script modules
as you need right now where are we going
with polymer 3 well so maybe you're not
thrilled with the idea of authoring your
HTML inside a template literal in egg no
script modules don't worry
web packs should be able to do that
for you so we'll just run the same
process we run today and stick it in the
template property once polymer 3 is far
enough along in the development that
that makes sense my team in fact I
didn't actually do most of the code the
developer who did is with me we wrote
this to reduce a lot of the build
friction we were seeing we're using this
in production today with angularjs
applications I also know of developers
who are here who are using it in
typescript projects my team is going to
continue to collaborate with both the
polymer team and the web pack core team
to improve the experience in web pack
and polymer for both of these to give
you as a developer the best of both
worlds we really try to design this to
leverage the strength of both systems
rather than try to let them fight
together a couple takeaways for you in
the polymer web pack loader project
you're going to find that demo project I
referenced earlier Rob Dodson actually
wrote it it's a great reference point
for just the bare-bones examples of what
to use
but in addition mine team maintains a
copy of the polymer starter kit which
shows the changes needed to make to a
polymer app to build with web pack that
link is also reference you're free to
reference both thanks and I'll be around
later for QA
