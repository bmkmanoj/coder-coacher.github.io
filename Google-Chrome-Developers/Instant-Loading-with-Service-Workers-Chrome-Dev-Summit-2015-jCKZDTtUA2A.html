developer relations team we've heard a
lot about the benefits of progressive
web apps and we've also heard a lot
about service workers and we'll be
hearing more about those and sessions to
come but I want to take the time to talk
about one approach to structuring your
progressive web app using what we're
calling the app shop the app shell
architecture works really well with the
serviceworker caching as progressive
enhancement so during the session we'll
talk in detail about the sw-precache and
sw-toolbox libraries which make it easy
for developers to add service workers to
their web apps web apps that use the app
shell pass serviceworker model
effectively can feel like they load
instantly and before we go any further
let me demonstrate what I mean with a
real-world example so I build a web app
to browse I fix it repair guides using I
fix its excellent public API the iFixit
API returns a mix of text and images
like you'd find in many content browsing
applications and in the screencast we're
using iFixit API to load in a list of
featured guides and then browsing
through a few of them so you can imagine
each of these pages being something a
user discovers on the web as a search
result or it finds a link to from some
other site you know it's the web so
there's nothing special to install in
advance so loading obviously looks fast
but let's put some hard numbers behind a
few different loading scenarios so all
of these examples were run in a
simulated 2g mobile network against the
App Engine instance we've deployed on
and we're showing off top-level
navigations here so what you see on the
screen is experience loading the web app
for the first time with nothing in the
cache and no serviceworker in place yet
we're able to get all the above the fold
content on the screen in a very
respectable of 650 milliseconds so let's
compare that first visit to what your
users will experience the next time they
visit the same page with a serviceworker
in place and your cache populate
we're able to get the above-the-fold
content on the screen and around 200
milliseconds as a point of comparison
the same page load with a populated
cache but without a serviceworker
maybe because your browser doesn't
support it takes around 560 milliseconds
and let's take a look at the learning
experience for the page that we haven't
previously visited so because a Web Apps
Service Worker is already installed in
the app shell is cached new pages load
instantly as well so we could get above
the fold content on the screen in 225
milliseconds with the same cache content
but without a serviceworker we're
looking about 650 milliseconds to get
the content on the screen you can see
that even on a slower mobile network
great load times are possible across the
board so regardless of how you structure
your web app that initial requests for
the HTML landing page can take time on
the left is their network traffic
requesting or I fix the demo app for the
first time with no serviceworker and
nothing in our cache takes 423
milliseconds before we get our full
response back and this includes the time
it takes the server to make the iFixit
API request for us so on the right we're
serving the same page directly from our
cache it only takes five milliseconds
once the serviceworker gets involved so
with the serviceworker and with the
right caching strategy the network no
longer stands in the way of getting your
app on your users screens so we strongly
feel that adopting the model we'll be
talking about today is the surest way to
build web apps that consistently load in
under a second which is a target we
recommend in the rail performance model
you'll hear more about rail during
tomorrow's sessions but keep that in
mind and as my colleague tall pointed
out loading instantly can make a big
difference in your web app success
studies have shown that an additional
one-second delay in page load times can
lead to 11 percent overall fewer page
views as well as a 16% decrease in
customer satisfaction so in some loading
isn't just nice to have there's a direct
impact on your bottom line
so hopefully everyone out there is ready
to go and adopt this model in your own
web apps but before you can do that
let's run through an explanation the key
concepts you'll need to understand so
first what's an app show so your shell
is the HTML Javascript CSS and any other
static resources that provide the
structure for your page - the actual
content specific to the page so the
shell should be cached obviously and
should load quickly think of your shell
as being kind of similar to the native
code that would get uploaded to an app
store if you're writing a native
application but you don't have to
sacrifice the link ability and
discoverability of the web and unlike
with native apps you need to play
updates to your app shell in a second
the concept of an app show is going to
come up again and again throughout this
presentation anything you see any time
you see something colored green you know
that we're talking about the app shell
so once the shell content loads we fetch
the dynamic content in our case from the
iFixit API to populate the view the app
show plus our dynamic content equals the
complete rendered page anytime you see
something colored blue you know that
we're talking about the dynamic content
so now that we've talked about the app
shell we could turn to the next question
what's the serviceworker technically
speaking a serviceworker you know it's a
network proxy written in JavaScript and
intercepts Rach HTTP requests made from
webpages but an analogy that I like to
use is to think of a service worker as
being an air traffic controller so let's
see how this analogy plays out you can
think of your web apps HTTP requests as
planes taking off with the Service
Worker you now have an air traffic
controller making sure that your
requests load quickly and efficiently so
the request plans might land using the
network runway
or they might land using the cash runway
in which case the request can bypass and
network completely so it's up to the
service worker to decide how to handle
each request and here's a quick visual
walkthrough of the life of a service
worker we start out with a page that
isn't yet controlled by a service worker
but contains code to kick off the
registration so this that creates a new
service worker instance and fires the
install event that the service worker
will respond to and now's our chance to
add our app shows content to the cache
let's dig in deeper so while every setup
may be different in RF I fix it sample
we're serving the HTML for our app shell
from the slash shell URL
keep that in mind throughout this
presentation when you'll see slash shell
pop up again so the populate Akash the
service worker makes an HTTP GET request
for / shell during the install events
and let's walk through the contents of
our shell so we're including some
site-wide inline styles they'll be
shared by all of our pages and next we
have a template insertion point and
within our body element so this doesn't
contain any real content but it serves
kind of as a placeholder for the
client-side templating that will take
place when our contents loaded and
finally in this example we have a
reference to external file a pas that
contains all the site-wide JavaScript
that our page needs so back to the life
of the Service Worker the next event
you'll get a chance to handle is
activate so here you normally perform
cache cleanup of any out-of-date
resources you no longer need in your
shell and once those handlers complete
your serviceworker enters into an idle
state so it's running but it's not doing
anything until there's a network request
that fires often new events and in
response to network requests a fetch
event handler will get a chance to
respond to intercept the request
Andras
as you see fit so that happens after a
period of idleness your service worker
script is stopped automatically so when
the next network request is made when
your page is loaded again and started
back up and can immediately respond to
to fetch events so the air traffic
controller analogy breaks down a bit
here because you probably wouldn't want
to tear down your air traffic control
tower every time you no plane lands and
wait for another one but yeah bear with
me here okay so let's take a look at how
our fetch handler serves up our app
shell our service worker can intercept
any requests for any URL under its scope
including pages that haven't been
previously visited so in our case we
want to respond to any navigation
requests with the slash shell response
that we've previously cached and this
will bypass the network completely so
this is a model that you might already
be familiar with it's what happens with
server-side rendering when there's a URL
pattern that's routed to a matching
handler which is been responsible for
returning the full page to the browser
and this is the serviceworker equivalent
of that routing and it's code that runs
client-side in the app show that ends up
populating the contact content in the
scenario and if you're using a universal
JavaScript framework it might end up
being the same templating code that runs
on both the server and the client but
that's not a requirement for using this
model so at this point I hope you see
the advantages of structuring your web
app using the app shell plus Service
Worker model and well you could write
your own Service Worker code we have two
libraries some will take care of many of
the details for you while following the
best practices and avoiding common
gotchas so going back to our analogy for
a second you know you may be an awesome
web developer but you might not feel
comfortable writing the code responsible
for landing and airplane and that's fine
you know these libraries will handle
that code for you so the first library
that we
talk about is sw-precache so it takes
care of caching and maintaining all the
resources in your app shelf the second
library we'll talk about is sw-toolbox
it provides a canonical implementation
of all the runtime caching strategies
that you'd need for your dynamic content
so we built these libraries to go
together hand in hand and using them
together gives you a serviceworker that
can load your app shell instantly while
giving you fine-grained control over how
your dynamic content is cached so both
of these libraries are battle tested and
ready for production
they've powered the serviceworker for
this year's Google i/o web app so
chances are you've already visited the
page that uses them I was a member of
the team that built the i/o web app and
we specifically designed these libraries
to handle the real world needs that came
up while building the site I wrote up
the case study about our experiences
which you could read at the URL on the
slide and we're also really excited to
announce the Flipkart is using the
sw-toolbox library directly as part of
their new progressive web app you'll
hear more about that tomorrow all right
so let's dive into the first library
sw-precache so most web apps already
have some sort of build process in place
and sw-precache drops right into your
existing build process and uses
wildcards to identify all the resources
that make up your app shell and we're
using gulp and the I fix a demo app but
sw-precache works equally well with
grunt and we have a command line version
as well all right so let's take a look
at what happens when your build process
includes sw-precache so here we have a
set of local files in our build
directory that make up our app shop we
perform a gulp build which includes a
step that runs sw-precache for us
sw-precache is configured with some wild
cards to match all those local files
and what it does is calculate hash of
each of the files that it finds that
matches the pattern and generates a
serviceworker code for you that contains
a mapping of the URL and the current
hash so this service worker JS file that
it generates contains all the code that
you need to maintain the cache of those
files you don't have to write a thing
you can just use it as is and the
initial visit to a web app that uses a
serviceworker triggers a pre caching of
all the urls that were identified and
you can think of this as kind of being a
closed onto like a native app store
install process okay so your app shell
changes over time and sw-precache will
make sure that your cache changes along
with it so let's assume you make some
updates to two files and you're ready to
push those changes out to your web
server when you run gulp as part of your
deployment it'll regenerate in the
serviceworker j/s file since - the files
now have new contents The Associated
hash will change as well and there's
logic in the generated serviceworker
file that will detect those changes for
you and automatically update the cache
entries just for the files that have
changed when users returned to your app
only new or modified resources are
downloaded you can kind of think of this
as a native app stores incremental
updates okay so those who prefer a
command line build process to gulp or
grunt can install the sw-precache module
globally from NPM and then run it
directly so remember to rerun the
command prior to deploying an update to
your site to ensure that the generated
serviceworker picks up on all the local
changes alright let's get our hands
dirty bit and take a look at how I'm
using sw-precache and the iFixit web app
demo that I showed earlier so this
snippet is part of the gulp build strip
for the project which gets from through
Babel Saiki use all sorts of es2015 good
and first and most importantly we have
the dynamic URL to Dependencies option
and this is how we keep an always
up-to-date copy of the application shell
cached so we use the URL slash shell as
a key and the value here is array of all
the files that uniquely define the
inline contents of slash shell next we
set the navigate fallback option to be
slash shell again our new Service Worker
file will automatically serve the
contents of slash show whenever there's
navigation to any URL on our site well
serve up the application shell even if
the actual navigation for request is
something like slash guide 1-2-3 and
client-side URL routing will handle
populating the content next static file
globs is also really important this is
where we list all the individual app
shell resources that might be requested
directly as opposed to those that are
included in line within the shell and
finally we have the import scripts
option and here's where we can extend
the generated Service Worker to include
additional logic that we might need in
this case we're playing in a
configuration file for sw-toolbox which
is the next library we'll talk about
alright so sw-toolbox
is the answer for caching your web apps
dynamic content so everything that we've
colored blue in this presentation
basically and well sw-precache
integrates with your build process
sw-toolbox is loaded by your
serviceworker at one time and there a
number of very common caching strategies
sw-toolbox provides a canonical
implementation of each so let's take a
look at some of those caching strategies
and one approach is to have the
serviceworker check the cache for a
response if it's there you know great
return it to the page if it's not there
in the cache already then return
response from the network instead so
this is good strategy to use when you're
dealing with remote resources that are
very unlikely to change like static
images
something like that and it corresponds
to SW toolboxes cache first handler
converse of that approach is check the
network first for a response and if that
successful return of some page the
network request fails you can fall back
to a previously cached entry instead and
this is a good strategy to use when
you're dealing with data that needs to
be as fresh as possible like say a
real-time API response but you still
want to display something as a fallback
when the network is unavailable and this
corresponds to SW toolboxes Network
first to handler so finally here's an
interesting strategy the serviceworker
fires off both the network request and a
request that goes against the cache at
the same time cache response will
normally come back first and that would
get returned directly to the page in the
meantime the response when network is
used to update the previously cached
entry and that keeps things relatively
fresh this updates them in the
background without blocking rendering of
the cache content and you could get this
you know for free just by using the
toolbox fastest strategy it's pretty
powerful alright so you do need to think
if it's strategically here you need to
take time and think about what strategy
is most appropriate and for the dynamic
resources that populate your app shop
but you know you don't have to choose
just one sw-toolbox is routing syntax
lets you apply different strategies to
different URL patterns
but you might be saying you could
implement those caching strategies
yourself so why use sw-toolbox
sw-toolbox has a couple of additional
options that help solve problems that
arise while fetching your content these
options make serviceworker caching much
more useful in real-world scenarios so
first a phenomenon that i'm sure
everyone hears encounted countered Wi-Fi
so it's when your device has a network
connection that's one that's extremely
unreliable or slow while your app shell
should always be cash as be fetch to
cache first
you might request dynamic content used
to populate your show using a network
for a strategy in some cases and life I
can be deadly in those cases if there
were no network at all you know your
requests would fall back to the cache
right away and when there is a network
request that just drags on and on and on
before eventually failing you end up
wasting precious seconds just waiting
for the inevitable
so using sw-toolbox you can set an
explicit Network timeout and here we're
sending it to 3 seconds when fetching an
image network first and after those 3
seconds have passed
we don't have responsive Network they'll
automatically fall back to the cache
content for us all right so here's
another real-world problem you might
bump up against what happens as the
users go from paged page on your site so
you're probably cashing those page
specific contents like images associated
with each page to use their visits at
one time to make sure that if they ever
return the full page will load instantly
not just the app shell if you keep
adding to your dynamic caches and
definitely you'll end up using an
ever-increasing amount of storage so
sw-toolbox will actually take care of
cache cache expiration for you saving
you the trouble of implementing yourself
here we have sw-toolbox
figured to use a dedicated cache for
images with a maximum cache size of six
so once the cache is full as it is now
new images will cause the least recently
used images to be evicted in addition to
the least recently used expiration
option sw-toolbox also gives you can a
time-based exploration option where you
could say automatically expire
everything once it reaches a certain age
so Flipkart was looking for a solution
to this exact problem and we're really
happy that they turned a stat beautiful
box for that all right so now let's take
a look at the sw-toolbox configuration
used in our iFixit demo app that we
showed earlier so this file gets
included with our serviceworker at run
time by using the import scripts option
in sw-precache alright so first we
define a route for our I fix it API
requests and we're using the toolbox
stuff fastest strategy here which
strikes a nice balance between
automatically returning like stale
content immediately and automatically
keeping our caches up-to-date in the
background so next we explicitly add an
image to our cache that will act as a
placeholder missing image if the request
for real image fails that's in turn used
as part of our image handler function
which takes in a request attempts to get
a response using a cache first strategy
and if that fails falls back to that
missing image placeholder and finally
you can see how we set up a route that
uses our image handler function to
handle requests for images served from
cloud front net we're also making use of
a maximum size for this dedicated cache
that we're using for images so after 50
images have loaded in the cache the
least recently used ones will
automatically be expired all right so
I'm sure that throughout this talk
there's been something in the back of
your mind this app shell model is great
but how does it work
that don't support service workers well
service workers are in general
progressive enhancement and that applies
when they're used in the optional model
as well so going back to our analogy you
know it's possible to land planes at an
airport without an air traffic
controller but you're probably gonna
want to do that very slowly and very
deliberately and I wouldn't really want
to be a passenger on that plane so
putting our analogy aside how do you go
about treating service workers as a
progressive enhancement well remember
that the first time you visit a web app
you won't yet be a service worker in
place so you need to make sure that your
web app renders properly without service
workers any way to handle that scenario
on browsers that support service workers
the next visit to your web app can take
full advantage of everything that
service workers have to offer but for
browsers that don't support service
workers the next visit to your site ends
up looking very much like that first
visit there won't be a service worker so
you just continue to serve things via
Network quests so your architecture
shouldn't have to change in order to
accommodate browsers that lack service
worker support all right so whether
there's a service worker in your browser
or not HTTP caching best practices still
apply so you should continue to follow
patterns like adding in hash
fingerprints into your file names and
using far-future
HTTP cache expiration headers this
doesn't change any of that
and sw-precache will happily work with
that setup but if you are in a browser
that supports service workers you now
have a key to unlock additional
performance wins so you can serve even
your initial HTML landing page directly
from the cache when you're using a
service worker which is difficult to do
safely with just HTTP cache headers if
you remember from the start of the talk
that means the difference between 400
23 milliseconds to retrieve your landing
page and 5 milliseconds hen if you use
that same cache for strategy even for
pages that are dynamically rendered on
the server because sw-precache will keep
those pages fresh for you when one on
the underlying partials or inline
content changes all right so where does
this talk leave you as a developer who's
interested in using this architecture
well we have a number of demos and
jumping-off points that you can choose
from to get started so first of all you
should realize that if you're building a
modern single page app you're probably
already using something similar to an
app shell already whether you call it
that or not the details might vary a bit
depending upon which libraries or
frameworks you're using but the concept
itself has definitely framework agnostic
so your next step can be just add in a
serviceworker to your existing web app
using sw-precache and sw-toolbox
libraries but you know if you're
starting from scratch and you want some
inspiration or just want to see a
finished real-world example here's the
source code for the iFixit API client I
demonstrated earlier so uses universal
JavaScript both server and client-side
rendering and can be adapted to go
against a different API or source of
dynamic content if you want next for
those who prefer a step-by-step hands-on
learning experience we put together a
code lab that walks you through adding
sw-precache to an existing web apps
build process those of you who are
attending person you could do it in the
code lab section that's outside I also
want to mention a polymer-based demo
that my colleague Rob Dodson put
together which makes use of an app shell
a serviceworker model in a blog web app
which I think it's called super cool
blog Rob will be talking more about that
project and cleaning the correct
pronunciation a little bit later today
in his session
next most recent release of the web
starter kit project includes sw-precache
and sw-toolbox and projects that use web
starter kit as a starting point we'll
take advantage of them by default so
this is super powerful in terms of
getting this technology out there to
folks who are getting started on web
development and finally my colleagues
addy osmani and Matt gaunt spent a great
deal of time putting it together this
vanilla JavaScript starting point it
gives you an app shell plus
serviceworker set up with minimal
opinions about frameworks or libraries I
highly recommend that folks check this
project out and it gives you a great
place to start with all the best
practices already baked in ok so we
strongly believe that the app shell plus
serviceworker model is the best way to
structure your web apps if you want
reliable instant load times without
having to worry about the network
getting in your way we hope you're
inspired to go out there and adopt this
model today there's no reason to wait
and we know your users will appreciate
not having to wait either thank you
