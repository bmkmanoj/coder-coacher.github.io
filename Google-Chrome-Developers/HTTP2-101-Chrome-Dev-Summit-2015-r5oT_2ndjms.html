Google Chrome team in London and I'm
here today to get you guys excited about
HTTP 2 so I know that this is a long day
and they've been great content being
thrown at you by good-looking people and
so I thought I'd start with the TLDR
which is switch there really is no way
for you that this could perform worse
than your current HTTP setup you
couldn't actually be a setup so what I'm
saying is basically HTTP 2 is
performance for free so you'll just go
ahead and able it and if you actually
can justify it and put a little more
effort into it
HTTP 2 offers even more levers for you
to put even more optimization in there
and get more performance out of your
site from now on by the way I'm gonna
call HTTP 2 h2 because that is a the
official symbol for the protocol so even
chrome inspector signifies a db2 that
way and it's so much easier to say so I
hope you can accept that as you've
learned in the last 2 days and
especially today performance matters and
as I said there's a lot of features that
are on top of h2 that give you more
possibilities to optimize your website
and I'm using the generic term
performance here because it can really
be applied to a lot of different things
that you have it could be the time to
first render it could be the total load
time of your page all of these are more
optimizable once you actually have h2
enabled so hopefully with this I got you
interested enough to actually listen to
me and I want to start with a little
history on how we ended up where we are
today so h1 is old HTTP one that is Tim
berners-lee Specht the first version
which is HTTP 0.9 in 1991 just think
about that that is over 20 years ago and
this is what you originally had in mind
it is a simple document you have text
you have a little bit of formatting
going on and you have links to other
websites and that is really what the H
in HTTP stands for it's high
texts you have a web of documents and
this is allegedly one of the first if
not the first website out there and this
is what the protocol was designed for
about five years later HTTP 0.1 came to
be and it added basically a few headers
a little of meta information a security
protocol so in HTTP 0.9 you had to get
post and hat and in h-e-b 0 @ 1.0 put
delete and our favorites link and unlink
came to which we all use daily right so
these are more methods that added not
all of them were operatory as you can
tell and that is basically what we start
with until then and then only a year
later HTTP 1.1 came which is kind of
weird to move that fast suddenly but
there were there were problems it had to
be addressed so h-e-b 1.1 basically
added the options method which you
needed to do like cross-origin
communication you had the host header
which was now obligatory because people
started hosting the multiple websites on
the same server and you had more control
of a caching but most interestingly Kiba
life was added and I say that it's the
most interesting part because websites
now started to look like this this is
not really a document anymore nor is it
just hypertext this is really just more
like hyper media you have things images
video sounds that refer to other things
on the web as well and if you look at
the last four years alone the total
transfer size of a web site has tripled
in the last four years and as I just
said HTTP is over 20 years old and
obviously since we are kind of starting
to abuse HTTP one here performance went
down it's really mediocre at that point
so people started saying that h1 had
flaws which is not really right we were
just abusing it for things it wasn't
designed for and so we came up with
workarounds workarounds to address these
problems and kind of kept it going up
until the state
and these best practices which are
really Rock arounds which are really
hacks wrote things like concatenation
sharding spriting caching and
vulcanizing and all these kind of things
that for some reason we have to do to
not have an abysmal performance nowadays
and all these hacks address problems as
I said and the most notorious of these
problems is head of line blocking head
of line blocking is the phenomenon that
when you send a request on a connection
to a server that that connection is from
now on useless and till that point when
the server has responded completely with
a response
and originally a browser was only
allowed to have two concurrent
connections to the same server so we had
two connections each of on each of which
you would put out a request and you had
to wait until one of these was finished
and here you could reuse the connection
so obviously there's kind of a
bottleneck there and we realized that
and people said ok let's raise the limit
let's go to 6 connections and you can
kind of realize 6 connections is not
really enough again and it just like
postpones the problem a little bit the
goaline guys are actually a lot of
people but the golden guys wrote a great
demo showing off this problem where they
titled an image into 180 smaller tiles
included all of these tiles in a website
with image tags and just served it over
HTTP 1 and as you can maybe hopefully
tell about this graph first of all you
see the six connections and the seventh
one to JavaScript from another server
but you see the six connections and
there's sort of like sparseness there
the connection is not really saturated
at this point so I also looked at the
saturation graph so you look at the
green lines of both of these graphs and
you can see that with h1 there's almost
no saturation whatsoever and with h2
it's at least a lot better still not
optimal but a lot better the second big
flaw that we had or that there is an HB
one is that headers repeat a lot across
requests the most notorious examples of
headers that you repeat our user agent
and cookies both of them are long and
static and they just keep being added to
each and every request
that comes from the fact that HTTP used
to be states are supposed to be
stateless each request being completely
independent from the next so people
needed to work around that and started
using sessions set and identify the
session with a cookie with a long UUID
in that cook in each of these cookies
would be appended to every request being
sent over and over which really is just
a weight of waste of bandwidth another
minor part is that people started like
okay I can compress my data obviously
like I can just gzip everything that
goes over the wire but that would only
apply to the actual data the headers
which are still highly compressible
would still not be gzip and that's also
just a missed opportunity so at that
point people realize that we were not
using 81 for what was designed for and
something else had to come up so we
started doing speedy and we tried out a
few things and let cap the stuff that
was working and on the basis of speedy
HTTP 2 was specified and this is what
the interesting part of this talk
actually begins because now we are at
the glorious era of HTTP 2 so the
question or the first scary things I
want to address is h2 has the same
semantics as h1 so you still have
request response you still have headers
which are key value pairs you still have
a body which can be any kind of content
so your apps will all be able to stay
the same as they are right now you don't
have to touch the code at all the only
thing that's different is how these
requests are going to be encoded on the
wire they're like wrapped differently on
a binary level the second scary part is
that h2 is a protocol upgrade so people
like you thinking how can I update going
to am I going to lose clients no you
don't because every connection starts
out as h1 and then it's an upgrade to h2
and if this client doesn't support h2 it
will just stay on h1 and everything will
work as before so but what is h2 really
first of all it's a single TLS encrypted
connection so technically in the spec
there is a protocol called h2 C which is
the clear text version of h2 but most
browsers have actually opted out of
implement
that so there's really no way for you to
get around the tos part of this but we
had a talk of Emily yesterday I think
and we have services like cloud player
and let's encrypt which is going to go
and open beta on December 8th so it
should be really easy for you to set up
till as a best point and yes I said it's
a single connection because head-of-line
blocking the issue of having only 6
connection is being addressed on a
protocol level so we can actually work
with a single connection the stream the
connection itself actually looks like
this and what used to be a request
response pair in HTTP 1 is now a logical
stream that's what it's called and all
streams actually share this connection
they're multiplexed on the single
connection and share the bandwidth of
the single connection and head of line
blocking another thing anymore because
these streams are being chopped into
frames and put onto the connection and
that means that if one stream goes into
the blocking state where it's waiting
for a response or for the client to push
more data to put on the wire another
stream can take over and utilize the
connection fully so you can see how this
will actually solve the head of line
blocking thing actually something an
additional feature is that the client
can specify dependencies and weights for
each of these streams so that it can say
stuff like this stream is only useful if
the other stream has already completed
and that the bandwidth are the whites
are there to distribute the bandwidth
more appropriately for the application
that you are doing and however this
feature is on the client side only right
now this it's not been exposed to the
server side just yet but it is being
considered so as I said it's split into
frames or chopped into frames and there
is multiple frame times but the most
important ones are frame to header
frames and data frames so as I said
before we had headers as key value pairs
of strings and we had data which could
be whatever you need so it kind of makes
sense to split these apart because they
have different content types right so
this is what's actually happening so let
the stream now actually
like this that you have frames of data
and hate data and header data being on
the wire and remember that all of this
is end-to-end encrypted because TLS
enabled and there's a lot of things new
and h2 and I'm going to address most of
them but this feature alone having no
head-of-line blocking and the single
connection that does multiplexing
actually invalidates a lot of the best
practices that we already known how to
do all of these best practices you're
like concatenation inlining vulcanizing
and spriting were there to reduce the
number of requests and to get more out
of a single request it had also a very
bad side effect that it made caching
really inefficient because if you think
about you would have a lot of icons on
website and you would sprite them into a
big image changing a single item a
single icon would invalidate the entire
sprite image and you would have to
redownload it all over again
and now requests are cheap and you can
just leave with the tiny images on the
server and have them cache individually
so here's a demo of the child image that
I showed earlier and one of the videos
is h2 and one of the videos is h1 and
it's your guess which is which and just
keep in mind there's no feature being
used here except the fact that head of
line blocking is gone it is all it's
happening here is a static website being
delivered over h2 with 30 milliseconds
emulated latency and a g3g immolated
network bandwidth so to speak and yes
cash is being busted so you can see the
impact of this feature alone is already
huge to visualize this visualize in this
a little bit more these are the
waterfall graphs and you can t see that
h2 is much much steeper which is because
on the left side we have the limit of 6
connections on the right side we don't
so you can see that we always have this
chunk of sixes with indentation on the
right side we don't really so h2 is much
like is to saturate the connection the
available bandwidth that you have so the
question really is how does this feature
of having a single connection without
health line blocking how does this
translate into real life
and luckily Financial Times did an
actual life test where they
move their static assets to an h2
enabled CDN of Akamai and they kind of
segmented their clients into three
groups the groups are the clients that
didn't support h2 the clients that did
support h2 but didn't use it and the
clients that did support h2 and did use
it and as you can tell by the graph that
this alone just moving the static called
static assets to an CDN with h2 has a
great impact for the amount of time it
takes to get to the mobile load event to
get back to the splits frame types of
header data and of header frames and
data frames this is a great opportunity
because now since they're separate from
the data we can actually compress
headers now and not only that they
actually came up with a compression
specific for HTTP headers and since its
glorious anew it gets stars HVAC which
is the compression for headers it
defines the notion of the compressor and
D compressor which is pretty normal for
a compression but the interesting thing
is that these compressor and D
compressors work on this on the
connection rather than on each of the
streams so you have one instance and all
the requests go through the same
instance which gives us the ability to
actually back reference header without
values that have been used in previous
requests while compressing the current
request so I want to go into this a
little bit more so we send out a request
to example.org and when I get the
index.html and the compression works
just like gzip is a Huffman encoding
kind of and additionally it has a lookup
table so it just has the first 62
entries off at lookup table have been
extracted from the most popular websites
are out there and the request that they
get obviously and also pseudo headers
have been added to accommodate things
like the method and the path which are
technically speaking not headers but
should also be compressed and what
happens is that the compressor goes
through the lookup table and tries to
find the values that are in the request
so as you can see the method get' is in
the table the
/ index.html passes in the table the
header key hosts in the table and only
the value is not and so what happens is
that it's actually being encoded as a
single as a few bytes in D say indexes
in the table and then just a - gzip of
the string example.org the interesting
thing now is that after this has been
completely transferred over the server
the values that weren't in the table are
being added to a dynamic part of the
table which starts at index 62 so now we
actually have host example.org in the
table that means once we set out the
next request and this time we want to
post to slash something we can reuse the
table and don't have to re-encode
example.org however in this case it's
less something isn't that is going to be
gzipped and going to end to be tabled
afterwards just as well and the nice
thing about this is this works
completely transparently there's nothing
you need to do once you enable h2 this
just happens you will read the benefits
of having less data over the wire just
by switching you don't need to change
your app you don't need to have some
kind of configuration magic going on
that is really something you should keep
in mind and again just by having one
single new feature a lot of best
practices that we have actually come
invalid or actually counterproductive so
as I said you have this this notion of a
shared compress in a decompressor so
having multiple connections is actually
bad for you so you still want to do CDNs
obviously because you want to be
geographically close to your clients but
you want to keep the number of origins
as low as possible to exploit the fact
of the shared compressor as much as
possible so the same thing goes for
sharding it's the same notion you don't
want to do multiple connections and also
non-changing cookies are actually highly
compressible now so what used to be kind
of an anti-pattern of encoding session
data into cookies could actually become
viable now because it's so highly
compressible up until this point
everything works the same that's what I
mean you can just switch and reap all
the benefits that I was talking about
there's nothing you need to do but as
also said there is features
which you can exploit when you change
your app a little bit and it gives you
more room to improve your website in
terms of performance and the probably
the best known feature of HTTP 2 is push
and then it's not to be confused with a
web push notification API push is a
technology or something of the protocol
that allows you to respond to a request
that hasn't even been sent yet and what
that means is that if I request
index.html off of a server the server
could be like okay here's your
index.html he's obviously going to
answer but then the server can go and be
ok you got index.html but I'm pretty
sure you're also going to need style.css
and script.js
so here goes well with those and those
are called push promise frames and once
the client is done parsing the
index.html actually is aware of the fact
that he needs style.css and script.js
it's already in its cache and the
request will never go out to the network
and Eric bidelman took a polymer app
removed concatenation and vulcanization
and then added push to it where he
pushed all the resources he needed and
so a 60 percent improvement in load time
for the app so a client is also able to
cancel a push if the client is sure it
doesn't need it but still be careful in
what you push because pushing mindlessly
can also have a negative impact so it's
something where best practices still
really have to arrive on what are what
is good to push in what it's not goes to
push so as you can tell h2 done a lot
for you but there's still things that
you as a developer need to take care of
so like setting sensible cache control
headers reducing the number of origins
and therefore DNS lookups taking care of
a good first render which we have had
talks about and most importantly
actually compression compression just
like h2 is performance for free just
have gzip enabled on your server you
don't need to upload gzip files
something your web server does for you
could compress compression on the fly
because at this point almost half of
HTML 1/3 of CSS and 1/4 of JavaScript
are still being sent uncompressed on the
wire which is just
wasted opportunity and as you can see
I'm emulating a 56 kilobits in here
admittedly but the performance impact is
huge just by enabling gzip actually
compression used to be enforced by
speedy but they remove that because it
doesn't make sense on every type of
quantity a pegs and movies for example
are already highly compressed so it's
just wasted CPU cycles to compress those
with gzip all over again so it is your
responsibility to do that
to enable gzip so I guess at this point
the question the most interesting
question really is true to do it now
when can you start how do we get h2 on
to your development machine to your
production environment ironically at
this time the browser's are actually
ahead of the servers for once all the
major browsers support h2 and can I use
as there's full support that is
technically not true because stream
waits and stream dependencies are not
well supported at least not consistently
but H pack and the multiplexing protocol
itself is supported across the board and
you can be sure to use and then there's
still the upgrade feature that if for
some reason the browser doesn't support
it it's just going to stay on h1 on the
server side at least very recently a lot
of the famous servers have merged or
subject bracketing on an h2
implementation Google cloud platform is
actually pretty interesting because the
second you enable TLS on your project
everything will work over h2 and some of
these servers and gtp is one of them
actually allow you to specify pushes by
setting a link header in your response
in terms of languages most languages are
working on implementation most of them
actually have an implementation for HTTP
too but they're not necessarily complete
for example the go implementation is
really good it's really high quality but
the push feature is not as exposed to
the user just yet
if you're wondering if your language of
choice actually has a library there is a
curated list by the HTTP to guys which
you can just load up and look for a
language and look at the libraries that
there are if you just want to play
around however
I wrote a tool for you which I called
simple HTTP to server and it is
basically the same thing as pythons
simple HTTP server it just serves the
current directory over HTTP to write so
this is just the same just with htv-2 so
you can just download a binary I have
binaries for all major platforms and
when you start the server it will
generate a certificate for yourself
signed once you don't have to worry
about it because gos thing right and
once you go to the actual URL of the
directory you will see the contents or
the index.html and it will be given to
you over h2 but just keep in mind that
this is not a production server this is
really full playing around locally and
seeing the benefits of switching so if
you're interested in that go to the
google chrome org on github and get the
simple h2 servers the binaries are in
the release section and you can just
download one single binary it does
everything for you talking of production
environments in low I see different
levels of commitment to h2 right now and
and they involve different levels of
effort for you to put in it to actually
do the switch the simplest part or the
easiest way to do it right now is the
same thing that the financial time said
we just move all your static assets to
an h2 enabled CDN because the biggest
number of requests for a website are for
assets so removing head-of-line blocking
just for them will already give you a
great benefit exactly and just so we
will see here on the slide that the
green arrow is supposed to be HP - and
your api would still be over HTTP 1 so
one impact would be for example again
the image where you over 3 reduce the
load time from 8.4 seconds to 1.8
seconds which is huge but obviously this
is a test case that is tailored towards
showing off for the issue of
head-of-line blocking so if you look at
a more realistic case and in this case I
chose the material design Lite website
the impact in how much faster it loads
is pretty negligible but in terms of how
much data is transferred we actually
save 10% of data which on mobile can be
huge - especially it'll it adds up right
so as always measure the impact so you
know if it
actually worth your time to to
commitment to h2 I would see as having
an h2 enabled reverse proxy in front of
your current app basically CloudFlare is
doing this right now but cloud forest
using speedy but it has the same kind of
benefits it basically removes
head-of-line blocking and dusty header
compression for you and head-of-line
that works because from back and to back
ends you don't have the limit of just
using six connections this would
basically speed up your app and give you
a better opportunity to do the caching
on the side of the client and then
obviously the full tier commitment would
be doing a full h2 deployment you use
push you use weights you have everything
set up but as I said is probably
unrealistic to do this at this point due
to the lacking server support so to end
this I kind of want to take a quick look
at the future of h2 static holsters like
Google Cloud Storage or get pages don't
give you a way to specify what resources
to push when somebody requests
index.html right so Eric bidelman lxr
and I have been working on a manifest
format that allows you to specify just
that and Eric and Alex also wrote
libraries to consume these manifests
when you write an app on App Engine in
Python or go
so the manifest looks like this where
you actually say for the index.html I
would like to push the app dot CSS and
for the page load HTML I would like to
push page CSS and you can define as many
resources as you as you would would like
to and as you can tell it's just
straight up JSON and so tell also told
you we are working on libraries in
different languages to consume these on
App Engine and also additionally
Eric wrote an NPM package that generates
these manifests for you by analyzing
your HTML files which is kind of nice
because that means it's just another
build step instead of you maintaining
these manifests manually at some point I
would like to see support for more hosts
to adapt these manifests but we just
came up with it so it's too early to
tell
WebSockets might not be a thing anymore
I mean they still work just as before
but they are a separate
to call and therefore a separate
connection they're not being multiplexed
over the h2 connection because separate
protocol so it might actually be
suboptimal for you to use and since long
polling is now really fine again in h2
because you are not wasting one of your
precious six connections you can pretty
much emulate the same behavior over a
pure h2 connection instead of using
WebSockets time will tell if this is
actually true or not to summarize this
entire thing should you do it now yes do
it
why because performance matters HTTP to
really will give you benefits just by
switching it on and not caring about it
anymore and when you're doing that also
and ever compression and it's a wasted
opportunity not to do this it's almost
girls negligence so I think everybody
should just switching over be good
citizen of the internet how to enable it
it really depends on your current setup
it really depends on how much time you
can put into it and how much you really
care but in the end if you take one
thing away look into your current setup
if it is violet for you to switch and if
so do it and if you have any questions
about this or concerns or you want to
keep shouting my name which is fine as
well I'll be around or you can hit me up
on Twitter and with that thank you for
your attention
