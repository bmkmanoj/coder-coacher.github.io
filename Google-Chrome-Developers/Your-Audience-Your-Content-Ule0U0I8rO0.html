an app or a website the first step to
building a great progressive web app is
to think about your audience let's break
that down a bit who is my target
audience how might that change do they
have the same requirements and how can I
work that out you can think about
different types of users and prioritize
that based on data and there is no
single answer for this you'll need to
adapt you need to think about platforms
what browsers operating systems and
hardware do my users have and what
should I support how can I find out
think about connectivity what types of
connectivity are available to my users
and what about offline is that something
I need to support if you want to compete
with native mobile apps you need to
think about that and what about data
costs the price your users pay per
megabyte of data for many users data
cost is the major constraint for usage
and I know this is true for me when I'm
on a roaming data plan when I'm
travelling in a country away from home
in fact you'll find that some people
don't want to use the web at all because
they know that some websites can eat up
all their data and of course to build a
great web app you need to understand
where and how your users will consume
your content where are they what are
they doing what's their state of mind
this really affects everything from
content and interactions to layout and
graphic design you need to think about
what you're building you need to think
about performance what is performance
for your users and what does that mean
for them what is acceptable performance
given your target audience or different
audiences and what about usage context
connectivity and data cost constraints
how can I quantify that you need to
build a performance budget thinking
about content now what content to my
users want when they visit my site or
app and how can i define that text
images media comments about pages you
know contact information terms and
conditions all that stuff
and functionality yet what are the core
functions of my site or app and what are
the nice to have and how can I
prioritize these content navigation
commenting and feedback mechanisms flaky
connectivity handling offline and so on
ok so now I want you to do some work I
want you to find answers for each of
these points who is the audience what
platforms are they on what data costs
can they handle and remember we're
thinking about your users and what you
are building</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
