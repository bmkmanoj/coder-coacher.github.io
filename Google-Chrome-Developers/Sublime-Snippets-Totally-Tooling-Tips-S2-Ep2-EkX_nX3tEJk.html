stiffest I think of like little chunks
of code i get from like a gist or
something like that pretty close you
don't you step into like sublime texture
no like I've looked I'm looking at him
right now and I have them I don't know
what they are I'm uh I'm deducting a
point from my yelp review with you how
can I have a Yelp like school like I'm
not a place you have people can visit
you you're totally a place I feel like
there's gonna be one review and it's
just you it's gonna be anonymous it's
just like worst person ever these are
your words so no I don't wanna sniff
this the snippets or basically reusable
chunks of code that you're using your
daily workflow stuff that you know you
find yourself writing out a lot but
would probably benefit from automating a
tiny bit yes the things like ESS classes
where you you've got to have the class
keyword name of the thing brackets curly
brackets whatever and then like that's
just boilerplate that's always gonna be
the case yeah so you could just have a
sniff it add that in and then just what
you gotta do is change the classic yeah
and it's kind of neat because you can
you can create your own snippets you can
go and customize them just hold packages
of snippets depending on like libraries
you're using snow so you can just like
import someone else is yeah a bit yeah
it's kind of neat um there's a bunch of
snippets that I I find myself using
pretty often the first set are the sort
of JavaScript in node snippets from zen
Rho and this is kind of a really neat
step because it covers everything from
little expansions for adding event
listeners to your Dom no it's creating
elements creating like fragments if
you're working on prototypes it'll give
you a nice little expansion for that now
also like highlight the relevant piece
of code that you're probably gonna want
to change like that
for the name of the class the prototype
and the function nice just kind of
useful and also dislike other things
like scaffolding out your your Iife s or
if he's if he's hippies what I refuse
there was like yeah immediately invoked
functional expressions you're just
raising more questions than you're
answering when you're just saying words
spirits check there's hope there's a
blog post by Ben almond you can go check
out Kara's all of this stuff okay it has
a great yelp review so I'm saying from
you for me what are the snippet packages
to you so you've been using es6 a bunch
lately right yeah what do you like in
ESX what are you sir um it's mostly
classes I started getting into fat arrow
functions and promises I've been using
for a little while just because the
service workers in all the real thing
yeah stuff like that those are the main
things okay so there's a really decent
package called es6 tool kit that
includes snippets for promises classes
for classes really neat because it will
give you again it'll highlight little
scaffold out the whole class with the
constructor and also highlight the
section of code that you probably want
to change first which is kind of nice it
also does that arrows generators week
maps sets so those things are no flavor
that sounds like this mine should be a
nice way of learning about new year six
feet yeah I think so and I think they've
also got um have you used the object
literal shorthands in es6 so the basic
idea there is that like you don't have
to type out as much code like we reduce
the booklet for functions and things it
also supports that and modules do kind
of there's a six toolkit another set
that I find myself using pretty often is
the polymer and web component snippet
package by Rob Dodson yep and that's
useful because it helps you when you're
writing not just apps but also like your
own elements so let's say you're you're
cutting a demo page for your app it's
got an expansion that will write out all
of like the boilerplate code for your
meta tags settle
include the web component polyfills and
then you can just go and start creating
your own elements and when you're doing
that there's a few things you always end
up doing like writing HTML imports and
he's written Rob Dodson's written like
this little shorthand h i4 legislate
same table eh i do me the entire line
that I require for threading and import
or write me out all the boilerplate code
I need for my element I most of it that
is the one like criticism I half of
polymer like I like the notion of Japan
to pull in some component just using it
my page it's it's all the stuff around
it like oh you have to add it to your
Bower you have to add it to the actual
HTML of your page and you've got to add
in the HTML import and it's just like
those steps are at a point where I'm
like I just want this thing to exist can
you just make magic happen so anything
this implies that i think is really nice
if only you had a friend / colleague
that the red something a polymer starter
kit taking potentially yeah okay there
damn drag you don't need it up just drop
it um so for people using other
libraries and there's a ton of other
libraries out there's things like
frameworks like amber things like
angular angular 2 and so on yeah um
react yep um there's actually a really
good set of packages that you can check
out for those as well the reactants I
think pretty popular works well with
dabble so yeah check them out so the
next time there's a new hot framework on
the side they'll just be a brand new
package for snippets and then BOOM yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
