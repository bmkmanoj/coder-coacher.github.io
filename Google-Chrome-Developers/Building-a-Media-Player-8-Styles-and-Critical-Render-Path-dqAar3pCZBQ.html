on in between all the talks and chatting
to everybody else and all that stuff so
this is just me wanting to kind of catch
you up to where I've actually got to by
this point which is mostly that a lot of
the very basic styling is in place and I
think I mentioned right at the start
that I will design death up first and
then build mobile first so what I tend
to do when I'm actually building insid
on screen and I do have a little bit
more work to do around this but you know
this is what it is in the moment yeah I
see quite like working this way just
because I find it pretty fast you can
use the responsive that didn't like the
device toolbar and responsive mode in
that I actually find that I get on
pretty well by just dragging the window
out in and out and I will start with the
320 normally because that tends to be
the size of an iPhone and that's where I
tend to start and basically drag out
until it breaks and then adding a
breakpoint and you proceed there are a
couple of specific break there's one
break point there where we go from the
new releases go from being the 2x2 grid
to a 4 by 1 grid and the descriptions
start to appear just beneath that's a
bit tight isn't it actually nonetheless
it works it's just about there just
about okay when you see as well that
this a little bit of sort of marketing
you type blurb that I added in is also
ago look there we go that's which is
there as well so I just basically work
have been working my way through the
breakpoints and just kind of going here
that looks about right yeah that looks
not so good whatever the other thing
that's pretty cool is the the color
scheme stuff I mean I mentioned this
before that I was going to I had the
code that did the median cut yeah if you
haven't seen that I think that was
number three entry number three feel
like history maybe is 2 3 2 3 3 ok if I
let me just grab my style
and if I say text content on the style
you can see here that I actually have a
lot of inline styles for the homepage I
should say that just for the home page
because when you hit the home page I
want to make sure that the styles are
ready to go really quickly because
that's where I think most people are
going to land
on the site for the other pages I
actually put the Styles in as a link but
for the home page I do it in line so
that it gets there pretty fast and over
there's a difference between what's sent
in line just for the home page and what
I put for the whole up or chunks of the
up into the links but it is our way to
do it
so you see anyway I've got a lot of
setup styles here that's just designed
to get you up and running really quickly
but at the end of that and dev tools
doesn't show it actually it it truncates
if you see here puts like the ellipses
stood up so yeah actually asked for the
text content you can see here I baked
out the primary color as background as
color and I do the same for the light
color secondarycolour tertiarycolour and
the quaternary and those come from that
code the median the median cut code that
I mentioned in that previous episode so
I'm I'm baking those into the page and
then when it's something like the title
here I can say that the title should be
the primary light color of the class now
I would have much preferred to use
custom CSS variables you know lighting
be like - - primary color and then just
set that in the CSS based off you know
what I have seen needs to be I can't do
that because they're not supported
everywhere and they're not easily polish
all designs done but in any case it felt
like I just couldn't quite get there to
use them yet so that's why if you're
wondering why I've not popped it in as
the CSS variable that's why just because
comp up mostly and that's it really
so as I say oh yes this little bit of a
little bit of a thing going on here when
you roll over these images I just do a
little bit of a scale I'm at this little
shadow that pops out just beneath that's
the pseudo element that I just fade and
slide down that's a bit of opacity in a
bit of transform you've heard me say it
probably too many times but I feel like
you can never say Tim in terms except
when I say it too many times that if you
stick to transform and opacity
performance will be pretty good I have a
little transform and opacity let me just
refresh this what's there the poster
image here they'll fade in the things in
capacity and transform scale and opacity
you know nice little touches like that I
think um you know they're fun to add and
they add quite a lot of life to what
you're building but just showing you the
color thing if I go to this one you see
that it's picked out the purple colors
which is not a surprise when you look at
that photo is it and I have way more to
do here because all I've got the month
is the description there should be the
make available offline
we should have being able to chromecast
all sorts of things so I've got loads of
work to do but they're kind of very very
basic styling is now in place which is
fabulous so take a look around the code
we'll link to it in the description
below and I'll catch you
well next time on it hey yeah buddy I'm
gonna stop talking now how many times
going to sign off this video one more
yes khulu hey folks thanks for watching
don't forget that there is more content
that you can find kind of over here ish
and if you want to subscribe is probably
a button oh maybe there may be somewhere
around there click that if you've not
done that brilliant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
