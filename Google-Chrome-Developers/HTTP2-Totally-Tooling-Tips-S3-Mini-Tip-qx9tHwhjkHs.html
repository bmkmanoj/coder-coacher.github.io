to a little tool which allows you to
play around with HTTP to locally I'm
Sora and I'm also the author of this
tool a GB - is supported in almost all
browsers at this point and brings off
changes both in how we design as well as
build our web apps the support on the
server side is a little bit more lacking
so just quickly playing around with it
gets a little tough especially
considering your needed TLS certificate
for a to be - to work generating a
self-signed certificate for localhost is
kind of tedious as well which was
motivation enough for me to write this
little tool most web developers should
be familiar with pythons built-in web
server called simple HTTP server you
usually started over the command line
and it serves the current directory over
HTTP what I wrote is called simple a2b2
server and behaves exactly the same but
uses hb2 instead and takes care of
generating a certificate for you
i Aurore it and go a sort of Python
because a I am pretty useless when it
comes to Python and B go has the nice
side effect that you only need to
download one binary and don't need a
runtime or an SDK you can find all these
binaries for Windows Linux and OS X in
the released section of the repository
on github you basically install this
tool by putting the binary in your path
if you start the tool it will generate a
key to PEM and assert that PEM which
other private and the public parts of
the certificate it then start up a web
server serving the current directory if
you open up dev tools go to the network
tab and add the protocol column you'll
hopefully see h2 showing up that is the
official symbol for hb2 and it means
that it's working one interesting
feature of HTTP two is called push it
allows you to send additional resources
to the client that the client doesn't
even know it needs yet so for example
you could put your JavaScript and CSS
files when someone is requesting the
index.html simple hb2 server has support
for this too you need to write a JSON
file that lists all the resources it
should be pushed when a certain file is
requested save that file as push dot
JSON in the root of the project and
start simple
hb2 server as you can see the era about
a missing push manifest is now gone the
server will now push as you specified in
the manifest and that's it already keep
in mind that this tool is for
experimenting and not a production web
server if you have any problems or
questions feel free to hit me up on
Twitter or open up an issue on the
github repository enjoy hb2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
