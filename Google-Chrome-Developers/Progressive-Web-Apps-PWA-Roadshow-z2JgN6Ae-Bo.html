latest buzzword but what does it mean
I'm Pete a developer advocate at Google
and in this video series you'll learn
what a progressive web app is why it
matters and how you can build one in
this first video I'll cover the key
concepts of a progressive web app and
how you can get started so let's jump in
web development has changed a lot over
the years when Ajax transformed the web
from static pages into dynamic
interactive experiences users
expectations went from clicking on the
side of a map and waiting seconds for it
to scroll to something like the Google
Maps experience with live panning and
zooming you don't have to live with that
horrible click and wait user experience
unfortunately the improvements we've
seen on the desktop web haven't
translated as well to the mobile web
consider this if I asked you to open
Google Maps on your phone would you do
it using the native app or through the
browser chances are you'd use the native
app mobile is the key factor driving
this revolution we now use mobile
devices more than desktop computers and
depending on which stats you look at
it's been this way for more than two
years on mobile users spend most of
their time in native apps rather than on
the web in fact they spend 87% of their
time in native apps versus only 13% of
their time on the mobile web when asked
why users often say that apps are more
predictable they're easy to find on the
home screen and feature push
notifications that bring them back so
should we abandon the web and go build
native apps of course not there's a
flipside to native app usage app usage
is highly concentrated and users tend to
only install and use a few apps if
you're not one of those chosen apps too
bad
users have told us
that they see native apps as a big
commitment in space-time and cost
according to a recent study the average
user installs zero apps per month zero
none
by contrast mobile users visit over a
hundred websites every month this is the
power of URLs and the ephemerality of
the web one way to think about the
difference between native and web apps
is on the capability axis when you tap
on their icon native apps start quickly
they tend to work offline they can fill
notifications sync in the background and
have access to sensors like camera and
microphone but the reach is somewhat
limited requiring a different version
for each platform the web is safer and
its permission model is more respectful
of your privacy but without some of the
same capabilities it doesn't matter how
many people can use it we want to
combine the capabilities and experience
users are used to in native apps with
the reach of the web we want the best of
both worlds a progressive web app is
simply that a great user experience that
feels integrated and earns a place on my
home screen without having to give up
the reach to get it the term progressive
Web Apps really just means radically
improving the quality of your end-to-end
user experience in order to do that we
need to focus on four things making the
app fast making the experience more
integrated ensuring that it works
reliably
and keeping users engaged let's take a
look at each of these properties in a
little bit more depth users expect apps
to load quickly and to have smooth
scrolling unfortunately the web has a
bad name for this especially on mobile
for now let's focus on load performance
which means making sure that your web
app loads fast now this is a
just esoteric we all know that time is
money
this chart shows just how true that is
20% of users will abandon a site if it
takes more than 3 seconds to load now I
could make a joke about kids today and
short attention spans
but I'm guilty of this too other studies
show even worse results after 3 seconds
53% of users will abandon a site in
short speed kills users shouldn't have
to reach through a browser tab to access
your app in fact the user shouldn't even
think about the fact that they're on the
web instead they should be able to
interact with it in the same way that
they interact with all of the other apps
on their device they expect to launch it
from the same place they launched all of
their other apps they expect to see it
in the task list they expect it to have
all of the capabilities and hardware
access that other apps have web payments
something that we'll cover in a future
video is a good example of keeping a
user in your flow instead of requiring
the user to fill out a complex checkout
form the payment request API simplifies
it down to a few taps and can even
integrate with other payment apps like
PayPal or Android pay another good
example is media playback with the media
session API you can provide metadata
about what's currently playing and even
handle media related events from the
user if the screen is locked the user
can quickly see what song is playing and
maybe skip to the next song users don't
expect the web to work without a network
connection and often they don't even
bother to try when it's a slow or
intermittent connection we need to
change that perception web apps must be
reliable when a user taps on home screen
icon they expect it to load instantly
and reliably apps launched from the home
screen should never show the dinosaur
thinking back to the 90s when the web
grew up this is how we got online going
online meant putting the whole house in
the online mode I remember having to
yell upstairs don't pick up the phone
and if someone did it would kill my
connection we used to know when we were
online but now in the broadband era we
don't even think about it
desktop connectivity is just always
there we've become used to always being
online and when we're not and we see
this cute little dinosaur it's a
disaster mobile phones aren't always
online maybe you've turned on airplane
mode or your subway stop doesn't have
service and even when you have four bars
you might not have a live connection but
it's not just the no connection that
breaks the users trust it's slow and
intermittent connections that affect
users just as much still mobile apps
never show the dinosaur nothing on my
home screen shows this in order for a
web app to earn its place on the home
screen we need to make them reliable
even when the network isn't an engaging
app goes beyond functional and ensures
that the whole experience is delightful
making it easy for the user to do what
they need to do using features like web
Plus it's always up to date
notifications keep the user informed an
engaging app uses the right capabilities
at the right time in a beautiful way one
example push notifications they've
existed for a while but I'm really
excited that we finally have access to
them as web developers and they even
work when the browser is closed on
mobile devices notifications are a
fundamental part of turning a monthly
active user into a daily active user so
enough exposition let's take a look at
Twitter light a progressive web app
designed to deliver a more robust
experience with explicit goals for
instant loading increasing user
engagement and lower data consumption
the Twitter light progressive web app
combines the best of the modern web
and native features it became the
default mobile web experience for all
users in April of 2017 on the first load
it looks and behaves like any normal web
app this is a well designed mobile
experience smooth scrolling responsive
design all of the rest when I revisit
the site chrome prompts me with an add
to homescreen banner making it easy for
me to add it to my homescreen when I
click add a little toast pops up letting
me know it's been added to my homescreen
in a future version of Chrome
progressive Web Apps will also be added
to the task launcher let's see how it
looks there it is on the home screen
tapping the icon starts it immediately
showing a splash screen well things are
loaded then it launches into a full
screen experience it feels like all of
the other installed apps on my phone
even clicking on the task manager shows
it as a top-level app using the icon app
name and colors defined in the manifest
being in the users field view is very
important for reengagement shortly after
launching Twitter Lite they were seeing
over 1 million launches from the home
screen every single day Twitter
implemented web push notifications that
work the same as those from their native
app and arrived even if the user's
browser is closed
users are prompted to enable
notifications or can go into the
settings and enable notifications their
notifications appear on the locked home
screen and when I click on the
notification I'm taken directly to the
relevant place making it easy for me to
reply like or retweet something when
tweeting users have access to all the
same features they expect they can take
pictures attach photos they've already
taken and so forth it was pretty cool to
see Twitter demo this at their launch
event where they posted a tweet with an
image in about a second and got hundreds
of likes all will still onstage reaching
a broad set of users is important for
Twitter especially those in emerging
markets where lower download speeds and
less powerful mobile
our common Twitter light helps reach
this audience more effectively by making
Twitter faster and easier to use on low
bandwidth connections Twitter light is
only about 600 K over the wire versus
almost 24 megabytes to install the
native Android app and for Twitter who
measures their success in the number of
tweets and pages viewed per session
their progressive web app has been a
flyaway success with a 75% increase in
tweet sent and 65% more page views today
Twitter Lite has more active users than
any other Twitter client Twitter Lite is
fast it launches as a full screen app
from my home screen it's reliable
working no matter what my network
connection is and it's engaging service
workers is one of the new platform api's
that's behind many of the new
capabilities that I've been talking
about the traditional web model requires
the browser to go to the network for
every single request and if the network
is down everything fails and you get
that famous dinosaur but you don't
always need to traverse the network
every single time the service worker can
cache all of the resources needed for
your page it gives you full control to
manage the cache and allows you to
decide when to hit the cache and when to
hit the network service workers can
handle more than just network requests
they can handle system level
notifications like post messages a push
message is just another type of request
that the Service Worker services when a
message comes in it wakes up the service
worker then calls its own push handler
earlier this year lancome launched a new
progressive web app compared to their
previous mobile experience time to
interactive dropped by 84% leading to a
15% decrease in their bounce rates to
re-engage with users lancome added web
push notifications alerting users about
exclusive promotions product releases
and to
reconnect with shoppers who have
abandoned their carts
this strategy has delivered an 18% open
right on mobile and conversion rates on
abandoned carts have increased by 8% the
new strategy also delivered a much
better experience across platforms iOS
is important to Lancome and 65% of all
users landing on their progressive web
app are on iPhones with their new PWA
Lancome saw 53% increase in session
lengths and a 10% decrease and bounce
rate among iPhone users despite the fact
that some features were unavailable to
them all told the progressive web app
has been a tremendous success driving a
17% increase in conversions lyft also
launched their new mobile site as a
progressive web app with the needs of
emerging market users in mind in
emerging markets where you can't take
bandwidth or even connectivity for
granted it's even harder for your
audience to get into your app instead of
making a simple landing page that asks
the user to install something their
progressive web app is a feature
complete version of lyft just without
the install step remember the goal isn't
to get the user to install your app it's
to get them to use your service the word
progressive and progressive web apps
isn't there accidentally
focusing on the end-to-end user
experience will have a dramatic impact
on your business even for users who
can't experience the full power of
progressive web apps because they're on
a device that doesn't fully support
service workers a progressive web app
doesn't have to be a huge undertaking so
how do you get started well first and
foremost you need security that means
serving your site from a secure origin
everything must be served via HTTPS it's
like table stakes for your progressive
web app in fact for many new and even
some old powerful web api's like
geolocation it now requires a secure
origin you
may know the green lock from the URL bar
the green lock indicates that there's a
secure connection between the site and
the user having a secure connection
really means three things the user can
trust that the site is actually you they
can be assured that no one has tampered
with a page and that no one is listening
in on the connection the web has
tremendous reach and it's frictionless
so keeping users safe is hugely
important
once you're serving everything from a
secure origin you're ready to begin your
journey of building a progressive web
app there are plenty of ways to get
started but they can be summarized in
these three approaches building from the
ground up starting with a simple version
and focusing on a single feature each of
these make sense in a different scenario
starting from the ground up makes the
most sense when a site is about to go
through a redesign if you're starting
from scratch anyways it makes sense to
build in progressive web a penis from
the beginning this approach enables you
to easily use the app shell pattern and
take advantage of the power of
serviceworkers OLX is one of the largest
online destinations for classified ads
in India providing communities and
high-growth markets with a vibrant
online marketplace they look to
progressive web app technologies to
provide a faster loading immersive and
app-like experience after launching the
progressive web app the time until the
page becomes interactive fell by 23%
with a corresponding 80 percent drop in
bounce rates
OLX also wanted to re-engage mobile
users just as they would on their mobile
app this meant taking advantage of
capabilities like push notifications and
Add to Home screen these two updates
increased engagement by 250 percent
monetization also improved with ads
loading faster the click-through rate
has increased by a hundred and forty six
percent of course not everyone can take
this approach
starting from scratch often isn't
realistic the second approach is to
build a simple version of the site the
light or mobile version and choose to
optimize around a specific section or
user journey an example of this approach
is airberlin their schedule and demand
didn't make it possible to start from
scratch so instead they focused on the
post booking experience their user
journey is one you might be familiar
with you're at the airport and you want
quick access to your itinerary details
destination information and above all
else the boarding pass their progressive
web app heavily leverages caching to
ensure that it loads super fast and
works reliably from the time the user
taps on the home screen icon until the
boarding passes up is less than a second
and it works even without an internet
connection
the final strategy is to define a
specific feature to focus on pick one
feature where you can have high impact
and focus on that this is frequently the
approach needed at large companies where
you may not have the backing to start
from scratch or even build a separate
simple version for example the weather
company has been interested in
progressive web app technologies for
quite some time but they needed to
prioritize based on what they believed
would be highest impact for their users
and their business they decided that the
most impactful feature was notifications
they decided to focus on a single
feature with web puss and they went big
rolling out notifications globally in
over 60 languages users on their mobile
web app can subscribe to multiple types
of notifications just like on their
native app this success sets them up on
their journey to build a full
progressive web app experience in the
first three months of rolling out web
push weather saw over a million opt-ins
web push notifications allow weather to
reach a whole new audience with the same
set of notifications as their native app
users as you think about your journey do
what makes sense for your users your
site and your company
speaking of we've been so excited to see
the incredible momentum on progressive
web apps around the world large
companies such as we go Expedia and
trivago have all rolled out successful
progressive Web Apps publishers like
info Bay and Forbes have launched
progressive web apps and Forbes has seen
a doubling of user engagement since
their launch ecommerce sites such as
Fandango Alibaba and Rakuten have all
invested in progressive web apps even
new services like ride-sharing companies
that we might think of as app only are
getting in on the action
lyft rolled out their progressive web
app last fall and Ola cabs the largest
ride-sharing service in India has just
launched their progressive web app this
is just a sample of some of the folks
who are shipping or actively working on
progressive web apps every one of these
companies has had their own path for how
they're investing on the mobile web and
starting down the path progressive web
apps in the next couple of videos Mariko
and I will show you how you can build
progressive web apps that are fast
integrated reliable and engaging then
once you've completed the videos we have
a collection of code labs that you can
use to put your newfound knowledge to
work
I hope these videos and the accompanying
code labs leave you inspired and
confident about building progressive web
apps with that thanks let's jump into
