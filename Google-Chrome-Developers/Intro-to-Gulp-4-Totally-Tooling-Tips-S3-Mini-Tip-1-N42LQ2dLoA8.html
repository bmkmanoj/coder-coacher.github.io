for and photo I thought I'd visualize
what it feels like to be in the
JavaScript tooling ecosystem I'm not
gonna lie it's not the greatest intro to
come before right now what are you
talking about there's this like this
babies here that they're reminding us
you know how great it is to upgrade to
Babel 6 and worry about webpack can be
told that you have to rewrite your gulp
file into an NPM script sounds like yeah
although it's probably too late because
make us back in fashion you know it's
not today we're gonna talk about go for
we've been using it for we've been using
gulp for a while over in our web starter
kit projects hitting up some es2015 and
I go file and that's been fun so before
we talk about go for we should probably
talk about gulp three and some of the
problems that go for tries to fix so go
three would allow you to define a
dependency to a task so here we've got
scripts and styles and gulp through just
make sure that the dependency tasks got
executed before the original task got
triggered so we've got a default task
when we run our scripts and styles in
parallel and then run the default task
now those tasks themselves could also
have dependencies of their own so you
might want to make your scripts and
styles clean the original bill
directories you can start off on a
really blank slate
now go three was smart enough so that if
it's so the clean was a dependency of
two tasks it would make sure that it was
only executed once so you know all that
work was only done once for maximum
concurrency which is kind of cool but
this approach had some problems
execution of that dependency set up
becomes a little bit mandatory once
you've got it set up this way
it's tricky if you've got like Watchers
or file the snares that are gonna be
looking at one type of file like your
you know your JavaScript for example
unless you made changes to that and then
it just blew away all of your style
sheets in your district tree it's not
exactly what you want and it can be
tricky to sequentially execute tasks
unless you're using something like the
run sequence plugin I think most people
whenever they have a cope toss they
might be surprised if any one go away
with not having run sequence in it yeah
run sequence is sort of a lifesaver for
a while
and using one secret looks a little bit
like that but we're gonna skip over it
because you're here to care about golf
or so golf or drops at a pendency
parameter the the square brackets syntax
completely and it replaces them with
execution functions that you can use
instead
so drumroll okay so we now have Godot
series for sequential execution and go
parallel for parallel execution and
these let you like have parameters the
name the task to execute another
function to execute they're pretty
flexible now if you want to go and start
using golf for today your first of all
going to want to uninstall your global
gulp three CLI and your local version of
cult or just install felt for locally
and use like your npm run scripts to run
them instead if you wanted so yeah i
want to do that otherwise just go and
install golf for CLI globally and
locally these instructions are correct
as of the time that we're recording this
screencast yeah do the NPM info gulp CLI
see if is version four if it is just
install it and ignore these young
hopefully by the time this comes out go
for will either be stable and the
community won't have replaced it with
something totally different and it will
still be relevant but assuming that we
are taking a look at one of those
alliance we looked at earlier if you
want to execute styles and scripts in
parallel it's as simple as this and if
we wanted to rewrite some of those those
larger lines that we had earlier they
look a little bit like this if we were
going for maximum concurrency and
replaced all of our dependency arrays
we've got that parallel this look good
that originally I said yes but I can see
your next slide so I know it's not no no
it's not this this is in fact wrong
because there's a ton of problems so the
dependency for our clean here still
hardwired in and actually gets cold
every time whether we call scripts or
styles go for doesn't do it at pendency
check here because they're not really
dependencies so you're clean gets
execute it twice now to get the original
execution order we want to do clean then
we want to run styles and scripts in
parallel and then our default task and
we can achieve that using this so here
using a combo of gulp dot series inculta
parallel we can first of all make sure
that each step is done concurrently and
combine in a gulp top parallel and
everything else can be done in a gulp
dot series function so the execution
order a default stays the same as before
but all the other tasks can be used on
their own so you can run call script
sculpt styles and not be bound on those
dependencies yeah now this is where I
kind of come back to the point like it's
super clear what's happening with that
whereas before you could argue it's kind
of by chance that gob 3 is doing the
right thing it's not explicit so we
talked about run sequence a little bit
earlier if you want to move over from
the old run sequence the new gulp dot
series and gulp that parallel here is
one example of what that looks like
we're gonna skip over that because
there's actually some decent blog posts
out that talk about moving over to golf
or there's the FET blog data you post
that we crypt some examples for but
these guys have actually got some really
really nice diagrams explaining the
whole execution in flow in golf forward
and comparing it sculpt 3 so check that
out there's also the we are wizards
migrating to golf for example they
include like code ifs and stuff so
hopefully this video was useful and if
you follow their their guidance not our
guns because their guidance probably
sucks yeah you drunken without garden
you see broken I guess um you too can be
ballin go for happy baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
