will solve common web problems with
standards these techniques are part of
the web platform and work with any
framework or library alright let's go
if you're out of space our text and want
to use icons for better
internationalized actions that's great
but there's an overhead you know I'm a
good web developer but I'm a pretty
rubbish designer so that's where icon
fonts come in there's many icon fonts
out there google has released the
material icons font which because it's a
font provides hundreds of scalable
assets you know like phones planes stars
actions all sorts of symbols these just
drop it anywhere in your site and you
can use this format which ensures the
icons still have semantic meaning you
can also include the font like any other
custom font or as part of your google
fonts API loader like all fonts these
icons are just vectors you can bold them
call them or scale them but to ensure
good accessibility be sure to always add
an alt tag so that folks using screen
readers can still understand that your
fingerprint icon is actually meant to
mean the world's most confusing maze
it's important to remember that these
are not emojis emojis are wonderful but
they look different across platforms but
as fonts these icons will look the same
no matter where you are use icon fonts
when you want cool vector-based icons
for your site and you need them to look
the same everywhere
that's icon fonts the standard way see
you on the next hip I meant to do that
if you're out of space feather use these
fonts when you click on correct I need
to write it down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
