tools for helping you stay productive
tools for everything from building apps
and elements through to tools that can
help make sure that your projects Arlene
when you're shipping them down the line
I'm also going to talk about a few new
tools that we've been working on that we
think you're going to find a little bit
useful now before I talk about any tools
I'm going to tell you a little bit of a
story so I was in Japan a few weeks ago
and it's a place that's really big on
automation automation being this idea
that you should take repetitive tasks
and try to get like a system or a tool
to help you avoid having to do that work
yourself now one example of where
they're really good when it comes to
automation is the idea of parking bikes
now if you're from Amsterdam or you know
you you live here you're probably aware
that every single pretty sure this is
accurate data every single person in
Amsterdam owns three million bikes that
seems accurate now in Japan they've
actually taken that idea of trying to
park a bike and they've taken it to a
whole other level so this is the Eco
cycle it's a system that will take your
bike it'll have like a robotic arm pull
it down into the ground and then find
you a parking spot for your bike if this
is the first time you're seeing this
you're probably wondering what sort of
matrix sorcery is this it's amazing kind
of want that but that's kind of cool
right now the reason that I care so much
about automation is that very much
believe in this phrase I believe that if
you want to be fast you have to give up
on the things that are keeping you slow
now this applies equally to reasons for
automation it applies equally to
performance as well so if you want to be
faster to give it the things that are
keeping you slow now you can't automate
absolutely everything if we did we'd
probably be out of a job now in Japan
they actually make a really good balance
they strike a good balance between how
much automation they apply on how much
manual craftsmanship is still in place
one example of this I remember I was
staying at a hotel and every time that I
would get lunch someone would make me
like little paper crane so this is like
something manuals
gone and made now paper cranes are sort
of really elegant they're like these
really well-crafted things they're
really pretty and I thought that I would
go and try making one of these myself
you know I know JavaScript surely this
can't be too difficult and it it just
didn't quite no one no one is more
horrified than the paper crane itself
and I'm not really allowed back in Japan
anymore but if you've been working with
web components and polymer for a while
you probably have asked yourself some
point where are the tools for this
declarative shift the JavaScript
ecosystem has got a huge amount of tools
available for every task you might want
to achieve when it comes to HTML there
are still a few areas that we find you
know are a little bit rough things like
you know maybe I want to lynch my HTML
and all the assets inside of there maybe
I want to run additional processes
against the files that are making up
that import and the good news is that
tooling for HTML and tooling for imports
and web components are getting a lot
better today I'm going to walk through a
new polymer toolbox a toolbox of things
that we've been maturing there's some
new tools in their stuff like linting
that we teased in the keynote and some
things that I'm really excited about
things like the the new polymer CDN that
we're working on now before we dive into
that some quick tooling requirements
very important to cover this so the
polymer team primarily used to package
managers the first is Bauer to the front
and package manager serves us pretty
well at the moment and the other is NPM
now if you've never heard of NPM it's
basically tinder for node modules
you never quite know what quality thing
you're gonna get in there they a
JavaScript so let's dive in now the
first thing we're going to look at is
how we write reusable elements we use we
put together this package called seed
element for this and see element is kind
of neat because we actually use a very
similar structure when we're building
out things like the paper elements and
the iron elements see down what comes
with boilerplate right out of the box
for you for helping you like create your
own element now one of the first things
that gives you is structure so it gives
you the same structure that we use out
of the box and includes things like a
demo directory test directory and some
of these other files like seed LMK and
index that HTML and your Bower die JSON
file let's dive into those now you might
be thinking if you haven't played around
with CLL before that your index is where
your demo loose but this isn't actually
the case the index file is actually
where a component called iron component
page lives this is powered by another
tool called hydrolysis what this gives
you is basically the ability to scrape
your element and pick up API
documentation I know what every single
person in this room is thinking API Docs
oh my god that's amazing now the API
Docs that we give you once they've
rendered they look a little bit like
this so you get a summary of all the
properties that are inside your page you
get access to being able to toggle back
and forth your private and public API
you get a summary of all of your methods
and the different events that you're
firing off its kind of me and inspires
you to do a little bit more of sort of
documentation driven development if we
look at the index for the demo itself
this is basically where you go and you
show the world what you've created some
people like go all out they style this
thing it looks really really neat but
this is you can you can go as basic or
as you know far out as you want this is
just where you demo the thing that
you've built and then we've got seed
element itself now seed element is where
you have the logic for your element out
of the box for seed element we actually
give you a lot of comments the whole way
through the file so it's very clear
where you know where property should
exist where your template logic should
go where stylist should go and this is
basically the single place where you put
things like your style is your template
and
we're down is where you put your
JavaScript I thought it'd be interesting
if we were to try doing something with
seed element now I'm a really big fan of
emoji so I thought it'd be kind of made
if we put together an emoji text element
something that you could just throw some
text that and it will pick you know the
relevant emoji for it this is backed by
a little library that Monica wrote so
here for example I've got you know I've
got it saying text equals tier and it's
showing up at ear and if I switch over
to tier clap it'll pick out the right
emoji for us what we can do for seed
element here is we can actually move all
of our logic for the emoji text element
into into seed elements boilerplate we
can replace the JavaScript lower down
replace all the properties replace
what's inside the template add some of
our own documentation and it slowly
starts to you know Starla starts to look
kind of neat we've got our render
documentation customized for this
element and before we you know before we
forget we've also got a bower install
we've got to install the dependency is
necessary for seed element things like
properly picking up polymer and the iron
component page element that we're using
and then we get onto another tool called
poly serve now Polly serve just makes it
really really convenient for you to
serve up your elements you don't have to
wonder you don't have to really worry
about using a bower configuration file
and a bower RC file or anything like
that it'll just take care of all of that
for you so you go and you get poly serve
and you just you know install it
globally CD into your seed element and
you can go and serve off your elements
just it just sort of works now quick pro
tip if you don't like the default port
number and I know some people get like
they really like you know customizing
the port numbers you can just use a dash
p option to customize the port for poly
sir what this gives you is a page that
looks like this so this is the
customized version of our iron component
page with my elements documentation when
you're sharing elements with other
people this is generally the first page
that they will see in the very top
corner they can go and they can then
toggle a demo off your element so here's
the demo for the emoji text element that
I've been working on and as you can see
i'm typing in some text here and you'll
you noticing that the emoji text is
automatically translating so i'm saying
hey people sit on planes that don't read
listen to or watch anything you look
like serial killers
which is probably accurate now let's say
that you then wanted to go and deploy
your element to somewhere like github
pages we have a workflow for that I'm
not going to dive into too much detail
here because we've got a guide on the
site that covers this but the basic idea
is if you go and grab this particular
repo so the polymer tools repo it's got
a script in there called G psh you can
use GPS h2 just publish elements that
you're working on straight to get up
pages and it literally just takes a
minute or two it's super convenient I
use it every day and it's kind of neat
now how many people here suffer from
element guilt so you've written an
element using polymer 0.5 and you
haven't ported it over to one point oh
just yet so lots of people have got out
McGill poly up helps with this quite a
lot we saw a preview of it a little bit
earlier and this just helps you automate
moving your elements from 0.5 to one
point oh so I actually had my emoji text
element written in 0.5 and I wanted to
port it over but I didn't necessarily
want to do all that stuff myself so I
went my installed poly up so it's a
global install and then I can run it
against that element and that just
magically takes all of my stuff to one
point oh now some of the stuff the poly
up takes care of for you or things like
HTML transformations so converting the
0.5 idioms like polymer element name to
dom module things like the template ifs
to template dom ifs and things like your
template repeats the template is dom
repeats for the proper syntax now in our
case um once it actually ported this
over most of it worked I didn't really
have to do a lot of work to tweak it
like a one or two small things but but
not a lot here's an example of some of
the places where it fix things up it
just made sure that the syntax is
exactly what I expected its be 4 1 point
0 now quick pro tip if you have an
entire app written in polymer 0.5 and
you want to try using poly up on it you
can actually recursively upgrade so this
quick one liner will allow you to go and
find all the different HTML files that
are currently inside your directory and
just run poly up against them and
overwrite any of the files there I've
used this on an app or two and it just
gives you a really quick baseline that
you can iterate on I think that's a nice
little
poly up has also got an online tool
available so if you've got you know
something that I ran into last night was
I want it support an element for use in
an app that was still written 0.5 but
somebody else I just dumped it into the
poly up online tool and this is just a
really neat quick online thing don't
have to install anything just dump your
code into here copy paste and it will
actually just low that you see what the
the transformed code looks like next
let's talk about unit testing so there
was a recent survey done in the front
end community where they found out and
this is this is sort of shocking to
everyone that almost nobody writes unit
tests it's just a wonder I didn't I
didn't really expect that speak case but
on the polymer team we care about unit
testing when we do think that people
should write unit tests so we created
web component tester for this now web
component tester is a pretty convenient
it basically gives you a tool that works
on top of mocha which is a really great
unit testing framework for writing a
synchronous test and chai which has got
some great assertion helpers you install
this globally the same way that you
install the other tools and you just run
web component tester against your tests
and it'll just go and run them now in
seed element we actually include some
boilerplate tests for you out of the box
this is an example of HTML sweet so you
can write tests and hate in separate
like HTML documents so here I'm just
loading up so i'm using WC tease
namespace and i'm loading up a test
called basic tests when you start off
you're not going to have any tests
written and when you load up your page
nothing's really going to happen you
might get a message in the console it
looks a little bit like this saying you
know you evaluated your tests in a
millisecond because they do not yet
exist here's another example of what a
JavaScript sweet looks like so I'm
testing out my emoji text element and
I'm going to just like focus on on this
little section because I'm a little bit
proud of this this is the first
opportunity I've had my career to
include emoji in unit tests just I feel
good so I'm able to run my tests here
and as you can see you can run what
component tests in the browser you can
also run them in the command line but
here we're just getting a summary inside
the browser but also inside the console
and we can dive in if we happen to find
that there are issues with any of our
tests when you run web component tester
at the command line
you basically get something that looks a
little bit like this it'll go and fire
off like all the different browsers that
is trying to run your tests against
it'll pipe the output from those
browsers back into the command line and
then it will close them I thought it'd
be useful to just you know remind folks
there are a few Pro tips through the
head and help if you want to run web
component tester with just a single
browser you can do that just use the
dash L option if you want to keep
browsers alive after your tests of run
so for example if you wanted to continue
debugging an issue you're finding in one
browser but not another in your tests
you can just reuse the dash p option and
if you only want to test files that you
specify directly you can also do that
too next let's talk about adding
elements to a nap we're going to do this
using polymer starter kit so we
announced polymer starter kit a few
months ago Google i/o and Rob talked a
little bit about it earlier but it
basically includes a few different
things right out of the box it includes
first-class support for components and
to end tooling offline first support
responsive app layout and a few other
nice bits and pieces now this morning
Taylor told you that the total number of
a downloads of polymer starter kit was
something around 65,000 I checked this
last night and I found out that the
total number was 66,000 and I checked it
right before this talk and it's now at
67,000 so I'm assuming you guys are
finding this useful at least I hope so
you guys have been building some really
neat things with polymer starter kit
you've been building everything from
like sites that help empower kids to
ride safely using the neon animation
elements you've been building 3d model
viewers this this is my favorite
examples are far you're building this
really badass looking character even
building things like this using WebGL
and polymer building deathfest sites
you've been building like meal helper
sites using ripples all over the place
it's been kind of neat to see this like
the progression of apps being built now
one thing I thought was missing was an
emoji quiz app found my niche in the
market in case anyone wants to invest
we're going to be building this today so
the first thing we're going to need for
an emoji quiz app is an emoji quiz card
something that allows us to throw a
question at the card render it to the
screen using the
rekt emoji and then we want to have
people be able to enter in text
representing what they think that
particular you know movie or emoji
actually represents we want to run some
validation rules against it paper input
is really powerful and it's a great
utility for helping us achieve this so
we use paper input and paper button on
this particular element next we have an
emoji quiz questions element this is
just a small piece of the logic but the
basic idea is that I'm going to be doing
a quiz using emoji in movies and i'm
just going to feed it a list of
different movies in and is it going to
iterate over that whole list and output
all of the cards to the screen finally
we're going to need emoji quiz
categories so something that allows you
to select what category you want on
screen and we've also got sort of emoji
quiz questions being used here so that I
can actually just make sure that we're
showing you the right list of things
this app is going to use neon animated
pages because I just love transitions
now if your front-end developer or
someone that's been developing on the
web for a while you're probably aware
there are quite a few different build
tools and task runners available today
everything from grunt to broccoli to NPM
scripts on the polymer team we're really
big fans of gulp and you'll be using it
for a bunch of the tools today I know
that some people still consider make is
a good tool to use unfortunately make is
the only modern build tool that doesn't
have its own logo and I thought long and
hard about this and thought that the
adequate logo for make was the platypus
so we're going to just go and NPM
install and Bower install all of the
things that we need this is a single one
liner for anyone that's experienced with
these tools if you're not we actually
walk through like all these individual
steps for you in the docs but um if
you're familiar with NPM or you you
aren't just yet but you might be in the
future something that you're probably
also familiar with is the idea of NPM
installing all of the Internet
I we're trying we're working with for
working with the NPM team or try to see
if we can you know fix this stuff but
you know might sometimes it'll take a
few minutes Thank You vit as you know a
good time to go learn a new hobby or
bake a cake or something but in a few
minutes it's done it doesn't take that
long it's like three or four minutes but
it's worth it so once we've installed
all of our dependencies we just go and
we do a gulp serve and what we end up
with is this application so this is my
emoji quiz app and what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to go and select an
option here so I'm going to select the
movies option tap on that and here's our
first question so this movie is ant-man
so just gonna go and enter that in looks
like I was right next one is Princess
Diaries still looking good this is
bloody needle and ring I you don't know
what this is and I fail but this app is
kind of working you know kind of work
and it could be a real thing now I did
want to mention one thing so Monica
agree to give a really great talk
earlier we've talked about custom
properties and I think probably everyone
in this room knows that CSS is just the
best thing ever it's truly truly amazing
do you want to know something funny this
actually renders correctly on this
screen but it doesn't up there this just
goes to show you how broken CSS really
is CSS is awesome but custom properties
make it a whole lot better and if you're
building an app using polymer starter
kit I do recommend checking out material
palette calm it's a site that has a
number of different options for
selecting a primary color and an accent
color and what you can actually do now
is there's a polymer option in the very
bottom of the screen that will generate
you a theme file an app theme file using
custom properties you can just go and
drag that into your polymer starter kit
app and then we theme your holes that
your entire app it'll like reefing your
toolbars your paper drawer panel your
buttons and it's you know it's pretty
low friction I tend to use this whenever
I'm building out demos and I find it
really useful next let's talk about
production izing our apps so I believe
that a build process is kind of
important if you're building anything
other than a prototype today it's sort
of a promise to your users that you're
going to make sure whatever your
shipping down the line is as small as
possible you know respect their
bandwidth and respect their data plans
now the build process in polymer starter
kit looks a little bit like this we've
got tools for quality and testing for
minification we've got things like
browser sing for cross device editing
and reload but I'm not really going to
talk about this too much I'm going to
focus on the polymer tooling in our
workflow that I think it's useful for
you to just be aware of and there's some
new tools in here that are get to the
preview so the first tool is vulcanized
now vulcanized is really useful for
concatenating all of your HTML imports
into a single file for production you
might be wondering why there's a picture
of Spock in the very corner of the
screen I thought that you know we should
just say screw it to Vulcan tradition
it's okay for Spock to smile so Spock is
smiling enjoy now vulcanized is useful
for reducing a nap and its dependence
into a single file we install it
globally using NPM similar to the other
tools and then we can just run vulcanize
against our emoji
app and convert it into a build file so
all of those dependencies end up in the
exact same file it's kind of neat it's
also able to do things like in line or
external assets into into a single page
now you might want slightly more control
over over what's happening with
vulcanized we've got a number options
we've got things like being able to
specify whether or not your scripts get
in line inside the page you can also
specify whether you want your style
sheets of your polymerised style shoes
to be in line two it's got an option for
that as well now if you were happen to
be working with content security policy
and you know you're you're concerned
about things like you know XSS and so on
crispers are great tools to be aware out
because it can help make your HTML files
CSP compliant so one of the things it
can do is just like split your inline
scripts from your files for CSP here we
globally install it we can then run
crisper we have a source option that
allows you to just take a current index
HTML file you can specify then where
your build at HTML and build that JS
files you're going to end up and if you
happen to be using vulcanize crisper
actually works pretty well with that too
so here we're taking advantage of piping
at the command line it's just that like
thin line we're taking advantage of
piping at the command line to take the
output from vulcanize where we've passed
in the inline script option and we're
just going to throw that over the fence
to crisper which is then going to go and
split those out into two separate files
for CSP now another new tool that we've
recently been working on is called a
Polly build I know that we've talked
about a bunch of different tools already
so far you might find it hard to keep
track of them poly build basically tries
to combine the best in class things like
vulcanize crisper and another little
known tool we wrote called poly clean
which helps us keep your HTML clean by
removing white space and stuff and it's
sort of the the Megazord of the the
polymer world I don't know how many
people here grew up around Power Rangers
I did and the one thing the Power
Rangers taught me was that if you've got
if you've got an adversary or you've got
anyone that you don't sort of get along
with if you stand in
of them looking aggressively for as long
as you can eventually they will explode
thankfully Polly bill doesn't quite do
this it works so one of the things Polly
built helps us of weight is is this
insanity so rather than piping like all
of our different tools together like
vulcanized with all the options Polly
clean after that crisper after that
probably needing to drink some beer
after that you can just run this just
install Polly the globally and run it
against your files good news is that
we're already using polity builds in
polymer starter kit today it's replaced
some of the current vulcanized pipeline
and it works really well with gulp so
the polymer starter kit gulp files
already using Polly belt and we found
that it works really well so far so we
hope you you know you try out Polly
build Polly both has also got a maximum
crush option I was in the engineering
meeting when they actually decided to
call this option maximum crush so it's a
decent option basically it helps you
decide you know whether or not your
output JavaScript should be minified or
just have white space removed and
there's a there's a good reason why I
thought that a wrestler image in the
corner would be sort of good here
wrestling is a sport that I don't
totally understand because you basically
have people that don't wear any pants
fighting over a belt it's
it just doesn't quite make sense to me
let's get on to some work in progress
tools the first of these is called poly
lint and we actually just open source
this less than an hour ago go last so
Polly might basically helps you by
helping linting your your file your
elements and your imports this helps you
stay true to the patterns and semantics
that the polymer team think make really
high quality elements but also makes you
just let make sure just like catching
errors that you think will probably not
render your elements correctly so you
can go and NPM install poly link locally
and run it against your files and it
does a few things that I think are kind
of neat so let's say that you ran it
against the file and the output that it
gave you was the expression square
brackets my virus bounced the attribute
class should be using dollar equals
instead of equals now just doing this
thing at the very top was a little bit
more of a polymer 0.5 idion rather than
at one point 01 and what you should be
doing is using the dollar sign at the
very end instead so daughter dollar
equals and it just helps you to make
sure that you're actually following the
right semantics when you're trying to to
bind to two different variables here's
another example so let's say that it
says property my VAR was not found in
properties for the specific element
what's happening here is i've tried to
use data binding on a particular
variable called my VAR when it doesn't
exist at all what you should be doing is
just making sure that anything you're
trying to bind in there has got a valid
a valid reference inside of the
properties object at the very bottom and
you're setting up your your types and
values correctly one more example this
one is kind of key is kind of cool
because it says you know computer
binding i'm using property not a
function which is not in fact a function
for element that we're using and if you
take a look at the very top what you see
is we're trying to compute we've got a
function that we're referencing called
not a function it's a computed function
we're passing in some variables but not
a function has for whatever reason been
defined as a number instead of a
function of the very bottom what you
should be doing is making sure that
those are valid functions that you can
actually pass variables to
to get valid output from and there are
lots of other use cases where Pauline
just make sure that you're writing code
that makes sense so I think Pauline is
kind of cool i hope you'll try it out
and please file bugs another thing that
I'm really excited about is Polly get
now something that I love doing is
working on prototypes I particularly
like using Jas bin for this and one of
the challenges have had before is being
able to load in imports from multiple
destinations lots of different server
since the same place and have them still
apply the rules of D duping without any
issue I don't really want to have to
worry about that I don't have to worry
about like cross domain issues and poly
get is sort of a stateless CDN that's
compatible with the duping and it solves
some of these problems and one of the
first things that lets us do is let's
say that we're inside you know a new a
new bin on Jas bin or one of the other
services that are a little bit like it
we can actually reference elements on
poly get org so it has the directory
path called components we can reference
an element named by the polymer team and
then the name of the import so in this
top example we're loading up polymer and
the paper toolbar I don't really like
the idea of writing these really like
long paths for everything so we can take
advantage of the HTML based tag just
simplify this a little bit so at the
very top inside of our head will include
a base H rough that points to poly get
better of such components and then I can
just reference polymer very very
conveniently let's take a look at
slightly more advanced set of examples
auto organizations selection so the
polymer team work across a few different
organizations we've got the polymer or
we've got you know polymer elements
google web components web components and
poly get is actually smart enough to
allow you to load in lots of different
paths and i'll just resolve this stuff
behind the scenes for you so i can
easily include paper button on my page
as well as Google sign-in it'll just
take care of the resolutions for me if
you're wondering whether you can do even
more complex things here are some of the
ideas that we're exploring at the moment
ideas like being able to specify what
version number of a particular component
you want to load in what branch and org
you want to load those in from and
whether you want to specify a completely
different org
I might have an or give my own
components of my own version of power or
even and I don't want to be able to try
testing this out most of these examples
actually work today and you can try them
out on Polly get org so we hope you will
try out polygon or gets it's very new
it's still sort of an experimental phase
so use it for prototypes don't quite use
it for production just yet but we hope
you'll try it out and give us feedback
on what you think and then we've got
some bonus tools things that I just
thought were super neat so the first is
an extension called polymer ready if
you're into polymer and I have a feeling
one or two of you might be you might be
interested in like just surfing the web
and seeing what you know pages are using
polymer and how they're using them they
might be using different elements that
you're yourself reusing on that note I'm
also happy to share with you that chrome
is now using polymer for a number of our
pages so here is the brand new downloads
page in chrome you can see that it's
using polymer one point oh it's using
some paper header panel you're using
paper material lots of their own custom
elements this is the new polymer powered
PDF viewer in chrome we dive into here
we'll see if they've got lots of their
own custom elements but they're also
using things like paper toolbar and some
other elements in there too and this is
a preview of the new upcoming material
design settings page it's not quite
ready just yet but it's also powered
using polymer and things like our paper
drawer panel and paper toolbar so
polymer is being used all over chrome
today and I just think that's super neat
another thing that i use my daily
workflow is rob Dodson's sublime and
adam snippets package what this
basically allows you to do is let's say
that you know you wanted to start
prototyping an element you can just type
in like pH little scaffold you out like
what you need for a demo page let's say
we wanted to create a new a new element
called awesome form I can type in hey
Jai and it will expand that into HTML
import for me I can then include a
reference to polymer i can use another H
I to refer to something like iron form
and if I wanted to go and write a new
element now I can just type in PE tab
and it will scaffold that out for me
this is what my sort of daily workflow
looks like I go inside my element I want
to start using something it's also got
auto completions for most of the eye
elements and the paper elements so I
don't even need to necessarily go back
and forth between the docs and the doc
demos to get started this is kind of a
really neat package available for
sublime and Adam something else that was
released just a day or two ago is a tool
called poly search to Chrome extension
but basically what this lets you do is
look up the paper elements in the iron
elements super easily you just type in
like a prefix like paper it'll list all
the possibilities and then I'll just
help you dive right up to the elements
page so that's poly search one thing I
wanted to suggest folks do is build an
experiment if you find that there are
particular workflows or particular tools
that you'd like to use with polymer and
you don't see that they're necessarily
officially supported just yet please
play around with them show us you know
shows the things that you were building
last night I was actually quite
interested in how well polymer I might
work with something like browserify and
so I started building a gravatar element
that would just like show a photo on a
page I found that there was a node
module called gravatar that basically
did most logic that I needed for my
element so I went and I grabbed this
node module and I wanted to create
basically this a gravatar photo element
where I could give it an email address
and a size no just render the right
photo on my page so you know needing a
user's avatar is a pretty common use
case for apps today now this is what
this looks like we have our gravatar
photo dot HTML element we have a script
that references an external version of
our script so we've got gravatar photo
that's going to be the source we've got
a file that's going to be browser ified
using the require statement so
browserify helps us use those require
statements then I just have a gulp file
it's going to help build out that code
for me so please go experiment if their
workflows you find work really well with
polymer please share them with us now on
to the future we're currently working on
to kind of exciting these tools that we
think are going to find useful the first
is the polymer devtools extension this
is a new dev tools extension it's sort
of still still very much work in
progress that it's going to help you
with performance and both Eric bidelman
and Paul Irish you're going to see some
more stuff about that their talks
also working on a brand new version of
the polymer designer this is an electron
based sort of desktop app you can also
run it in the browser that lets you go
and you know work on your polymer
elements we think that you're going to
find this stuff neat and we highly
encourage you to also send us your ideas
PRS are also very very welcome and last
but not least there's a brand new
version of polymer starter kit available
today this includes everything from
recipes for working on es6 using babel
to web performance recipes to recipes
for getting polymer starter kit working
with chrome dev editor it has a brand
new build process workflow using things
like poly build and plenty of bug fixes
I'm particularly excited about the es6
for using Babel because I just really
really love es6 and / es2015 whatever
your preferences for it and our support
also includes things like just making
sure that you're using JSC s2 to
properly like style check your code so
I've talked quite a lot about all of our
tools one last thing I'd like to ask you
to do possibly is give a big hand for
all of our tool makers the people that
make our lives a little bit easier on
the polymer team
so that's that's it for me thank you
very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
