tools big surprise but this is gonna be
a roundup of some tools that we've been
using that we've kind of discovered in
2017 and things we are still using today
all right let's take a look I all I want
for Christmas is a new tab key because
my tap key broke but you now get to skip
the whole tab sources faces argument
because you can only use spaces which is
the right choice yes moving on so we've
been using visual code quite a lot yes
code quite a lot in our team over the
last year I love it for its
configurability really really decent
performance as well and it's got this
kind of huge ecosystem of plugins so
many plugins yes but they're also adding
a ton of new features so let's start
with the first plug-in
import cost April cost is really nice
because whenever you're requiring or
importing in a module in line it'll show
you exactly what the size of that module
is gonna be including like the gzip size
that's really useful for evaluating
whether the cost of that thing is going
to be and plus with like low - where you
could like import all of load - versus
in particular function you can actually
see the size difference which is really
nice especially as we start using es2015
modules exactly next up we've got in
line get dip and this is baked into vs
code and it's super helpful basically if
you have anything like a merge conflict
it really nicely highlights everything
it gives you a set of options that
relate to us you could select like okay
I want the latest from the remote branch
versus what I've got here and it's just
a really nice feature I've been using
this a lot lately another really big
feature that landed this year was
support for leveraging some of es codes
typescript type checking features gained
regular JavaScript just by opting and
using this TS check comment and this is
using the J's comments right so it can
infer from what it knows from the ji
stop comments like the types of
variables and figure out if what you're
calling passing in or getting out is
actually what you expect and call up
anything and we're using this over on
the lighthouse team as well it's pretty
cool noise next up let's talk about
bundling so we've been using babel
vitalizer a lot
pretty much everything yes right
something I've been using lately is the
inverse of
leave a bio and what this allows you to
do is convert your existing
es5 code es2015 plus how good is this
it's pretty alright so it's been it's
been especially good for converting code
over to classes arrow functions things
like that
I found the margin of error to be
relatively small like the number of
tweaks that I have to go in and cut out
if you've got like a big enough code
base if you're doing this that actually
automated tool would help you
humongously just to get in there quickly
oh nice
Babel preset end if there's another
thing we've been using a lot lately yes
so back in the day you'd use to use babe
one it would convert everything to
polyfills or like code that will run in
older browsers babel pisa and if you
define like what browser support you
wants you could say chrome and i want
the last two versions and the nice thing
with this is it would just compile the
things that actually needed to be
changed rather than everything exactly
looks a little bit like this we've got
you covered for both ways to pronounce
babel as well i pronounce a babel and
pronounce it sam Ciccone told me how to
do this and I've already forgotten it's
okay you're both wrong yes what pal so
web packets were pretty popular with
this last year continuous gained in
popularity what tree came out one of the
nice features that it included was a
feature called scope hoisting that's fun
sounds great
so in earlier versions of web pack when
you were working with modules it would
wrap those functions it would wrap them
in two functions that isolated the scope
of those modules imports would get
translated into variables that would
hold the results of a web pack require
function and what web pack 3 is able to
do using the module concatenation
plug-in is basically flatten those
import chains and on the whole reduce
the size of the bundles that is
generating yes one of the nice things
about this is that for production apps
like tinder they were able to use this
and actually reduce parsing time by 8%
for their like JavaScript bundles so
they actually got a file size reduction
and a pastime reduction yes which is
super awesome super awesome except we've
got dev tools
OAS evolving I love step stools um this
year one of the bigger things that
landed was support for the White House
it's actually baked into dev tools now
which is really nice yes and it's
available in Chrome stable so if you
want to do performance audits
accessibility audits best practice
audits
ah that's available everything's in
there Co coverage Swiss us so basically
as you load up your webpage you put in a
ton of JavaScript code coverage would
then say okay this is amount of Java
seed you actually used versus an amount
of stuff that isn't used now the nice
thing with this is if you start
interacting with the page the code
coverage actually starts changing so
let's say you had a login flow that was
super important to your website you
would actually want to sit there and log
in and see how much of the code was used
and how much it was remaining after that
so this actually helps you figure all
that out it's great and one of the nice
things about it is if you click through
to any of these like red and green bars
it'll actually show you in the sources
panel the original script with a line
down the side of like what is red what
was executed what was an executed
another thing that was popular this year
CSS grid so popular so far so happy for
this yeah it's got decent cross browser
support now lots good material biracial
Andrew and West boss um the Firefox dev
tools did a great job of introducing CSS
grid highlighting it's so pretty and Wes
Bo's system a tweet we'll put in the
description where he explains about all
the lines in this mean which is and it
just it looks stunning like trying to
figure out especially if you're new
learning what everything's doing and
we've also got support for this in the
chrome dev tools of course of course we
do puppeteers so this year we also
introduced puppeteer it's a node library
which provides a high level API to
control chrome headless over the dev
tools remote debugging protocol really
nice for sort of scripting a bunch of
things so if you wanted to scripts
loading up a web page you know taking a
screenshot of it converting it to a PDF
logging in you do that I mean if you
wanted to do those like you can compare
two images and figure out what amount of
it change this would be perfect for that
two screenshots same browser bunk what
what's changed yep nice for testing nice
for scraping content from sites next up
we've got continuous integration your
favorite topic yes I'm so excited about
this so Travis came up with this this
beta feature called
Travis build stages so you used to be
able to have it where Travis you define
multiple builds and it would just do the
one off the other stages means you could
say well actually I want these number of
tests to run and then I want after that
I want to do a deploy script or I want a
github comment bot or X number of stages
so this is really nice if you can start
reorganizing your Travis file into
chunks it's still in
they're on the second iteration of this
but I am super excited so was it hard to
set up no it was actually pretty easy
the thing was just the formatting gets a
little bit wonky depending on how
advanced you want to get in terms of
nesting stages another thing that we've
seen quite a few different tools spread
out for is performance budgets and
performance budget tracking yes
like bundle sizes obviously like super
popular we've been using it in workbooks
like a similar incantation of it and
it's immensely helpful for just saying
oh this PR has grown the size of this by
X amount or this PR is purely to reduce
the file size of something and then we
can actually see it in the PR really
great for holding your team accountable
yes that's up next up we've got design I
thought it was important for us to also
talk about like the bridge improving
between designers and developers I use
sketch quite a lot whenever I'm sort of
building prototypes trying to sketch out
you eyes and something I came across was
a plug-in for sketch and image opt-in so
much optimist this free desktop app for
Mac that can you know optimize your
images have support from Moz JPEG modern
compression schemes what this this hook
does is whenever you're exporting images
from sketch to share with other people
or deploy it'll actually automatically
run it through image opt-in so you've
got like the reduced number of bytes
right off of that see you technically
can't really Expo an image without it
basically being as small as it can be
right off the bat right now I don't
believe that's the case they should fix
it this better be the way if it
simplifies it awesome yeah another thing
I really wanted to give a nod to was
some work by the Airbnb team John Gould
on a react sketch this is a really
interesting project where it's you know
it's tailor-made for design systems the
idea is that you're able to sort of take
your react components your act style
guides and convert it into a sketch file
with like layers and everything where
your designers can then go and take a
look at it and it's it's interesting
right because this is the first time
that this has been done sort of code to
sketch rather than yeah you always see
the other way where you see it like a
design of something and then it gets
converted to HTML or something else it's
nice to see it go the other way around
yeah super clever yep and react in this
case provides a nice wrapper for
building the trees
components next up we've got scaffolding
one of our favorite things this year was
NPM X this was really interesting so I
someone was talking about this a waffle
Jas me up and the idea behind this is
there's tons of examples of NPM install
yo and generator web app and then the
following step would be yo web app the
idea with NPM X is it you pass in the
command that you want to do and it
figures out work ok you've tried to run
yo but I need to go grab the euro
package and you tried to run web app and
I know I need to generate the web app
package so it'll do the NPM install
script for you and then immediately run
the bit afterwards and in the blog post
for NPM X and I haven't tried this but
apparently you can go MPX
and then like a gist URL and it would
just run the commands in there I mean
granted you have to trust the gist but
that's kind of a nice way of being like
hey if you want to set this thing up
here you go here's the command to do it
yeah so if you're ever in a situation
where you want to run the CLI tool but
you don't want install we just run it
once npm x is for you yes another thing
we've seen this year lots of CLI secrete
react app react to see a live view CLI
all of them have gained first-class
support for through scaffolding out a
progressive web app yes you can see you
create a new project and boom you're
good to go with a serviceworker and
everything lots of cool stuff to see
there and finally we've got command-line
tips you can't have a TTT summary of the
year without at least the command-line
being mentioned once so I don't I don't
use the command-line quite as often
because I'm now manager and I just send
emails instead you don't do code anymore
I know that's fine
but you do and so command like foo is a
site that you can check out that's got
like a stack rank list of all the
command line tips really neat for
remembering those things that you've
probably tweeted at some point I forgot
yeah it's super nice add them to your
dot files they're all handy cool so
that's that's it for our tips yeah
hopefully you can try some of them out
over your holiday period otherwise happy
holidays
