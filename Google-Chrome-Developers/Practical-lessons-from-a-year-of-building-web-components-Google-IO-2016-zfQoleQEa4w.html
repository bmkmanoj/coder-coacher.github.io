coming thank you for coming to this 9:00
a.m. session for the jet lag and
insomniacs and those of you often left
from the party last night so let's talk
about web components we had a whole
bunch of titles for this talk
it doesn't actually match what's in a
program my favorite was the me Annika
school for kids who went to web
component good and do other things good
too it was rejected and addy osmani
suggested Miao Miao pro-tips Miao Miao
which is pretty much what's going to
happen here so Miao Miao
hi everyone I'm Monica I'm not Waldorf
on Twitter and github in Internet places
and officially at Google I'm an
Imagineer and that's because I get very
excited about emoji and I sort of like
shout about it into the void that is
Twitter but what they actually pay me
for it is - OH
emoji so fun thing about the slide I had
to use Android emoji and not the Apple
ones it was mandated by legal and what I
do is web components and for the four
people in the audience I think as we did
a raise of hands we don't know what that
is what components are a standard we've
been working on so that you can write
reusable widgets for the web so you can
make your own fancy parts and give it to
people and everybody can use it I work
on polymer which is a library that helps
you write these web components and in
particular I write web components with
polymer we have elements like these ones
that are like material design for me
elements we also have lemons I don't
look like anything we have a declarative
Ajax element that you can put in your
page and get super easy xhr requests and
that's kind of fun so you might not
think of yourself as an element
developer you might think like you're a
web developer you make apps but if you
want to start playing with web
components I think thinking like an
element developer is really important so
you might only make to make elements for
your for your own application but you're
kind of making them for future you
because future you is going to have to
use these elements and if they're crappy
future use going to have a hard time so
I'm going to tell you basically all the
mistakes I've made in the last year of
making web components so that maybe you
won't have to do the same ones so
there's like four things that I thought
are kind of interesting about making web
components you got to make an API that
doesn't enrage your users and this is
actually kind of interesting you've got
to maintain this element once you start
giving it out
people you got to make sure that's fast
and isn't like slow like molasses and
destroys everybody's application and you
want to make sure that it's accessible
so these are the four things we're going
to talk about so let me tell you a story
in the 90s we had HTML one and it was
lovely and was basically like reading
the paper on the internet things that
you might see on a page were things like
links and headers and images if you were
lucky and that's all it happened you
opened a web page and you read it and I
was pretty much it and in 1995 things
got exciting we got HTML 2 and they
Channel - we got three awesome elements
we got input we got form and we got but
and we got select and I think we found
button well input type equals buttons
there so now this meant that like
websites could offer you interaction you
can type something in a text box and the
website would react to you in some way
and the reason why I think this is
important is that these are basically
like ogee web components there are
little reusable widgets that the
platform gives you and you can put in
your application that's exactly what a
web component is and since 95 in the 21
years that we've had this we've come up
with a couple of more web web components
or like whatever you want to call them
we have video and audio which are kind
of awesome
canvas is like an enormous framework in
and of itself dialog in details and
things like that I'm really implemented
in all the browsers and a lot of the
input types aren't implemented in all
the browsers so the reason why I'm
telling you is that even though we kind
of had web components for something like
21 years we're not very good at making
web components and I'm going to spend
the next like 10 minutes telling you how
input is really terrible because that's
one of my favorite things to do in life
on the other side of the world we have
UNIX and here's where like begins to be
a little bit of a flame war so we've had
your NIC since the 1970s and one of the
things that UNIX is really good at is
making reusable little programs that
everybody knows how to use these are the
ones that I just like used probably in
the last week these are the ones you've
probably used ever in your life maybe
not till knit and lynx unless you're
playing a joke on somebody but UNIX is
really good at this you use LS every day
like if you use a terminal you use LS
every day and the reason why UNIX is so
good at it is because UNIX has a
philosophy about how to write these
super tiny components commands programs
whatever you want to call them and
that's what we're going to talk about
for a little bit because if you're going
to go ahead
and right web components I want you to
think of what grep does and not what
input does grep is a great example of
our useable component input is
absolutely terrible first thing so yeah
UNIX has like 17 bullets in their
philosophy and some of them are super
meta like value developers times over
computers which is great and I don't
know what that means but one of the ones
that's the most popular one is that your
component should do one thing and this
is a hundred percent true of web
components if you build a component it
should be really tiny it should do the
thing that it says it does and it
shouldn't do anything else if you look
at the cat command cat takes a file from
your computer and spits it out to the
terminal it doesn't try to print it
that's what LPR is there for it doesn't
try to find a string in it that's what
grep is there for it doesn't try to sort
it alphabetically that's what sort is
there for cats takes a file and prints
it to the terminal input on the other
hand has something like 21 types I think
today last time I checked even when it
started in 1995 it had eight eight types
off the bat that's how he started the
races and that's really terrible because
they don't really have anything in
common these input types others in they
allow you to select a value you have
input type equals text ray just like
mash keyboards and they appear on-screen
you have the slider which like you drag
a ball on a vertical slider and that
magically picks a number you have a
color picker that gives you an RGB color
you have the map type which is basically
like an image map and where you click on
that image is the thing that gets saved
as a value so again all of these things
they have in common the fact that they
have a value they shouldn't be the same
element they don't even look the same
and then you start like painting
yourself into a corner once this is your
API that you started with so here I'm
creating input it's a by default of type
equals text so it's an HTML input and
because you can type in it and it has a
carrot you can get where that carrot is
and selection start is the property that
you do this and then I'm going to change
the value the type to input type equals
number I can still type I still have a
carrot but now if I actually try to
access that property I get an exception
it's not that it's like a bad value I
literally get an exception the browser
panics this makes no sense from an API
perspective both of these are an HTML
input element both of these have the
same prototype they have the same
property
and yet if you access it on some types
like most of the types to be honest
selection start just barfs on your
console and the reason why this is
happening is because input type equals
text and imple type equals number should
never have been the same element they
were the same 11 because in 1995 we
didn't have JavaScript we didn't have
polyfills we didn't know how to fall
back to a default behavior so we're just
like we're gonna put everything in one
element and it's going to have a default
value and it's going to be great but 21
years later we're still paying for these
mistakes that we had to do in 1995
because of what the platform was like so
this is why don't look at input for API
advice because input makes mistakes all
the time another one of the UNIX
philosophies is composition programs
play very nicely with pro with other
programs in UNIX this happens with pipes
the output of any program can become the
input of any program and everything
works magically and beautifully and the
way this works on the web is by sort of
nesting elements together so select is
composable like select an option or
composable that's how you can put
elements in a checkbox and you can put
in text and you can put in a button and
you can put in an input and an image and
can what do you think is going to happen
here does anybody know what actually
happens yeah this happens it's amazing
so the input gets rendered outside of
the select box we're not even trying
there's no image and with a button we're
just taking its text value this is not a
composable element this looks like it
could be composable and so I've had a
chance to get it really right and they
made a mess of it and the historical
reasons here are again because in like
1995 when it came out
are you four on Windows didn't know how
to draw select select combo boxes
otherwise but 21 years later again we
can do better and with polymer we did do
better we made our own select box we
called it paper because its material
design and in the drop-down you can put
on items so you can put in text you can
put in an input and you can put in a
button and it looks like exactly what
you would expect there is the text there
is the button there's the lemon I don't
know why you would put an input in a
pop-up menu but I mean you could nothing
to nope nobody's stopping you if you
want to do that and that's a composable
element so when you're making your
elements think about this are you
expecting to have children composed in
there and if you
you try not to make assumptions about
them try to expect sort of any types in
there because people are going to put
inputs in your drop-down menus and
you're going to have to deal with it and
this one leads me to extensibility which
is the code that you're writing today
should work in ten years from now
unless was written 40 years ago on a
platform that is nothing like the Mac
that I'm running it now and Allah still
works it probably had to be recompiled
but I don't think anybody changed the
source code dramatically 20 years ago we
wrote forum and forum is the opposite of
an extensible and plan for the future
element because forum only works with
the input element and when I say it only
works with the input I mean it is
literally baked in the parser when the
parser gets to the for form element it
only looks for input for elements that
have the tag input and skips everything
else and this blows for us as web
developers because what if I make a
super awesome input now that is like way
prettier than the crazy native endpoint
I can't put it in a form because the
form is going to ignore it altogether so
I have to like start hacking around it
and make hidden input so that the form
recognizes it so in contrast in polymer
we try to like not make assumptions
about what sort of things again our
element expects we have the swipeable
container where anything that you put in
it gets this like magical Android swipe
left or swipe right action and this
means that I can put in divs and I can
put in inputs and I can put in polymer
elements and I can even put in like web
components that people wrote without
polymer that a lemon doesn't care it
accepts everything and that's a really
good element because if it works today
it's going to work in the same in the
same way in like 10 years when the Dom
might change a little bit but the
platform stays but the elements stay
similar so the point here is like to not
make any assumptions when you're making
your relevance and it's very so the way
I interpret is that when you create your
element assume that it starts like sort
of naked without anything it doesn't
have any property set on it it doesn't
have any children it's just like born
into the world and then it starts
reacting to things when properties
change react to that don't assume that
the properties are already set if people
add content to it react to that assume
that when your element starts up it has
nothing and you have to deal with
everything that follows and that means
that pretty much in any way that
people are going to use your element
you're going to be fine because you
pretty much covered all your bases by
just reacting to changes and this also
sort of leads me to this conversation
about state because unlike UNIX and this
is where UNIX wins UNIX programs don't
really have any state they start up you
give them some input they do something
with the input and then they die and
everybody's happy but on the web the
input sort of lives there on the page
for as long as that page is open and
you're probably gonna type in it and it
has to somehow remember what you typed
in it and that's it isn't is internal
state which isn't necessarily bad but
what what you should do about it is that
make sure that if your element changes
the state internally you communicate
this to anybody who cares you fire an
event every time this internal state
changes and similarly you as a user
should be able to always change the
internal state of this element in the
same way that the element can do it and
guess what guess what input fails that
so input type equals number it's kind of
a good one a good element because in
theory it lets you like validate when
you type in it so it lets you type in
digits and a period for decimals and
like the negative sign in a for
exponents so it doesn't let me type in
Monaca emoji which is great I guess so
if I type in one two three four the
internal value of the input is one two
three four if I type in nothing the
value is nothing and if I type in junk
the value is nothing wait what yeah so
it turns out because this value is
actually invalid the input is going to
secretly reset the value to the empty
string but don't actually tell anyone
this is going to do it internally and
not fire an event about it and if you
start with nothing and you type in junk
you as a programmer cannot detect this
change like nobody has told you that
that anything has happened but you with
the eyeballs are looking at that input
and be like look there's junk in it you
got to do something about it but as a
program where you can because input is
like hiding it stayed away from you so
don't do that
don't be input which is pretty much the
like point of the stock never be input
because nobody really likes surprises
like surprises in an API are the worst
they're like finding that your cake is
made out of kayo and not cake and this
is San Francisco everything is made out
of kale this is the new tragedy in my
life
so remember how I said that the reason
why we painted ourselves into a corner
with input is because in 1995 we didn't
have polyfills we had to somehow have a
default type on all these stupid inputs
and the only way we could do it is just
jamming them into one object but now we
have polyfills so we need to deal with
polyfills and the really important thing
about polyfills is that if your element
expects a polyfill please for the love
of God do not include that polyfill with
the element and here's the story so we
have an element that uses the web
animation polyfill with the web
animation spec which works on some
browsers and not all of them so there's
polyfills for this and we were like
we're going to be so nice to our users
and include the polyfill with this
element and everything's going to be
grained you're going to have a great
time and then Chrome settings came
around and they're like we would really
like to use this element on Chrome
settings a page that runs on Chrome and
no other browsers chrome has the web
animation standard implemented but
because we jammed the polyfill in that
element chrome has to actually download
the polyfill for something they already
know how to do on every single page
that's really great so they don't really
want to use that element and they hate
us for it um so the moment you include
the polyphen in your element you take
that choice away from the application
developer maybe they want to use a
different polyfill maybe they don't even
care about supporting Internet Explorer
who cares don't Jam the polyfill in
there you're not actually helping anyone
document it but it's required but let
the user take care of that so what I
hope you got from this last ten minutes
is that input is terrible and you should
not look at it for any API advice and
that group is kind of really good
because UNIX is actually really good at
making this so if you want to read the
17 full at least 17 bullets of UNIX
philosophy I strongly recommended
they're kind of really interesting and
they're probably going to make you help
better make you make better APs help you
make better ApS got it in the end
awesome so we have an element we've
given it to people it has a beautiful
API nobody hates us for it and now we
actually have to maintain it somehow so
the thing about maintaining your
elements and why it's important is that
if you go on NPM and you download a
package that hasn't been updated in two
years this is going to give you like the
creepy GPS like if nobody cares about
this package and nobody is fixing it and
I'm probably going to be running with a
lot of bugs this is the same with web
components
if you
want people to use your elements you got
to keep your elements up-to-date because
that makes them cool and usable and one
way we and polymer do this is by making
sure that we follow semver
oh whoa whoa whoa whoa that was exciting
we got there Samburu I get excited with
silver all the time so silver stands for
semantic versioning and it basically
means that every of the every one of
these numbers in these versions actually
mean something they're not just random
so the last number on the right here I
have a tweet from Dave Mithen who makes
fun of semver because no matter how what
do you think you're shipping you're
actually going to break your users so
you know keep that in mind the last
number means that this patch has a patch
fix it has bug fixes it still
backwards-compatible everything is a-ok
the middle one means that you're
shipping some features but they still
backwards compatible so if you're using
this version yesterday and then you
update and you get the new version your
your app should still be fine you're
going to get new features you don't have
to use them but like everything that
used to work should still continue to
work it probably won't because you'll
write some bugs but that's a different
problem and the first one is a major
version this means you're actually
introducing breaking changes so if
somebody wants to pick up this new
version they actually have to do a
little bit of work for everything to
work in their application and there's
two things I want to tell you about
major version bums one of them numbers
don't have meanings please do not think
that increasing your major version is
actually like a marketing ploy or
anything like that don't get obsessed
about this all you're doing is
communicating that this version has
breaking changes you're going to have a
bit of a hard time and the second one is
just because you can communicate this
breaking changes doesn't mean you should
have like really aggressive breaking
changes breaking changes are really
terrible for your users they have to do
work they have to like read the new API
and figure out how you broke them and
figure out how to like make their stuff
work again
so I'm Palomar we try to be very
deliberate we haven't shipped a major
change yet because we want to make sure
that like the moment we ship it it's
like a write change and it's going to
not be actually very hard for users to
update to it so be very deliberate about
what you're shipping in a major change
don't just abuse it because you can't
communicate it that's what Ruby does um
so now that we have cember we can tell
the users that you know this user this
version is gonna break you or not but
the only way we're gonna figure out if
we're actually going to break users is
by testing and this should not be new to
anyone you're right software you tested
duh but testing look what is is kind of
interesting because what components are
new and I found that I had to test
things that I did not expect that I had
to test the first one is obviously the
public API if you pinky swear that a
function exists you should make sure the
function exists and does what it says it
should do duh umm and I'm trying to
click now we're having great times with
this remote I really like it
so the other thing is that you might
want to start introducing this idea of
like a private API
javascript doesn't care so don't worry
about that one but if you introduce a
convent couldn't convention like
underscore news private you get to be
responsible for less of that API like a
lot of your configuration methods or any
of like your internal functions you
don't have to make them public because
if you're making it public you're
responsible for them but if you make
them private then anybody who's using
them you can be like listen you're on
your own I told you not to use it if you
really want to use it can't promise it's
going to be there same polymer you use
underscores any functions or properties
that start with an underscore or two
underscores if it's a behavior I private
use them at your own cost
I might just delete them for shits and
giggles you should test your
accessibility so element should be
accessible and I'm going to like rail on
this one in about 20 minutes but you
should also test this you should unit
test it because you don't want to break
it we use the accessibility developer
tools it's on github under Google Chrome
that's what this cryptic diagram means
and they're basically an API that you
can run as a unit test and every time
you said something like roll on an
element it makes sure's it like runs 20
tests and make sure all the Aria labels
are set up correctly and tab indexes are
set up correctly and your contrast isn't
terrible so that's really good you can
automate them you should also test the
look and feel and this is where things
get interested because your vending
elements that look like something the
thing that they look like kind of
becomes part of your cart it becomes
part of your contract with the API it
with the element user so I discovered
this a super hard way where we had an
element it was a button and I thought
being extremely awesome and I changed
the box sizing from content box to
border box and I was like everybody's
going to love this change and I broke
like 15 people because it turns out if
you change it to border box and somebody
was sending a size on that element that
side is now completely messed up and
they're gonna have like adjust
everything and add 20 pixels to
everything and I ship that as a bug fix
and it was actually breaking change go
me and that's because I don't have any
tests for the UI so make sure you
actually test the UI because you're
promising your user that a thing looks
like the thing it should look like
here's a bunch of UI frameworks and
libraries that let you make UI tests I
don't care which one you use just use
one you don't even have to you
everybody's taking pictures of these
nice you don't even have to use this one
you can literally do like get bounding
client direct on your elements and make
sure that the right size and like the
font size is the same do whatever you
want as long as you test your and
if I don't remember I told you elements
are composable and they like should
accept children and they should like
working other things so if your element
should be composable and that's the
thing that you care about make sure that
you test it if you're writing something
that's like a form put all sorts of
things in that form and make sure it
doesn't crash if you think is like an
input put it inside a form and see that
works fine test your things cool we're
testing we have silver we're telling the
users we're updating our elements users
trust us they're delighted with our
elements are going to use them forever
we need to actually write documentation
about it um because if you don't WTF m
you can tell people to RTS em later so
cover your bases now if your element has
any edge cases document them I don't
care that your element is being weird if
it's in like RTL mode as long as you
tell me about it because otherwise I'm
gonna write this like super-lonely stock
over Stack Overflow post that nobody's
going to respond to I'm just gonna be
sitting there and be like it's been 10
hours why doesn't this element work just
document your is going to be great
we're maintaining irrelevant everything
is great let's talk about performance so
performance has been a big topic at i/o
performance we want fast steps fast apps
lead to user engagement lead to more
views leads to me getting promoted and
getting paid more everybody wants that
but when we talk about elements
performance is actually really important
because
if you it doesn't matter how fast I make
my application I can use rail and purple
at everything if I'm building it out of
really terrible and slow elements
there's nothing that I can do which
means that you as an element developer
have to make to be very careful about
what you put in an element because it's
going to screw somebody in a major way
later so if you think about your element
maybe it's like 1 milliseconds fast
let's see it's a checkbox and it takes 1
millisecond to paint because that's what
we really do one thing do it fast duh
so if you think about painting if it
takes one millisecond to paint your
element you might like high-five
yourself and be like one millisecond is
the fastest paint I've ever heard of in
my life I'm doing great but if I have
like a thousand pizza toppings on that
page and they're all checkboxes you've
now added a whole second to that page
and a whole second to a web page is
actually enormous we've been trying to
like save milliseconds out of pages and
you just made it so much slower so focus
on first paint and make sure that the
first time your element shows up on the
page is as fast as I can possibly be
Steve are well on the polymer team has
an amazing rule about this the best to
advise about how to make your element be
fast is do less and be lazy this applies
to like any that you want to be fast do
less be lazy by do less we literally
mean that don't do anything you don't
need before first paint don't like said
magical handlers don't set magical
Styles that are needed maybe later so we
had this code a lot in a lot of our
polymer elements were like when the
element was being attached so when was
actually inserted in the Dom we were
updating the pointer events to make sure
you couldn't click on disabled things
and we are you know adding click
handlers and this looks like very
reasonable code right it's very short it
probably doesn't take very long to run
but again if you do it a thousand times
that's a thousand event listeners you're
setting up before you're painting the
page that's enormous so what we do now
is we wrap it in this like after next
render we do everything that's needed
for paint this isn't needed for first
paint and everything that's needed like
literally the tick right effort painted
we do it after the next render and this
is really great because now my page
paints really fast my elements paint
really fast and they're interactable the
milli site like instantly right after so
everything is perfect and everything is
fast be lazy take sad one step one step
further don't do anything unless
somebody acts
chillie asks you for it don't just like
volunteer to do work that's bonkers you
would never do that in real life I have
nothing to do right now let me do some
work it's great you'll watch Netflix you
know you do
so in polymer in polymer we have a lot
of polymer elements they implement the
material design spec and the material
design spec has this thing where like
every time you click on something has
like a really satisfactory poll that is
a little jiggle and everything's really
nice and fun so the way we were coding
it up is that literally every element
had a ripple element inside of it check
boxes buttons inputs everything had a
ripple which sounds really great in
theory right like it should ripple we
should put a ripple element in there it
turns out that's crazy let's go back to
my pizza topping analogy I have a
thousand pizza toppings I'm probably
going to click on like four of them
because I've tried to put all the pizza
toppings on a pizza before and it is
terrible don't do it pineapple and
mushrooms don't go together they go
together with onions though so if you're
only going to like click on three things
you only need three ripples you're now
creating like 997 ripples you don't
actually need so we update our code and
we do something else that where no
element has a ripple when it starts up
but if you click on it the first thing
is going to do on that clicking will be
like do I have a ripple no well here's a
ripple make it jiggle so now in this
enormous application we're only creating
the ripples we actually need or being
incredibly lazy and this makes
everything super fast because I'm not
just creating Dom nodes that are sitting
on the page doing absolutely nothing not
even giving them access to Netflix do
less be lazy do less be lazy this is
your manager tattoo it somewhere and we
didn't just like come up with us one day
well Steve did he woke up he's listening
to like this weird podcast I think that
tells him that but like we actually
started writing tests for performance to
figure out how this was going and
there's many different ways in which you
can test performance and they're all
terrifying because I'm actually
terrified of everybody else's frameworks
so I have like two simple ones that I
use and they work really well the first
one is console dot time so cause the
whole time takes a label and basically
like between the first time you call
time and time end on that label it
calculates how much time does this cost
and you can also nest them so you can be
like well creation took this long but
setting attributes took this long and
the reason what causes all time is nice
is because you get dev tour you get a
timeline in the
of tools and you can see like what's
actually happening here this is
incredibly fast because I was just doing
random numbers in a loop you're never
going to get code that runs in ten
milliseconds like that but yeah so
that's constant load time it gives you a
time line if you're even lazier than
that and you don't want to don't care
about that aki-nee's performance now
which literally just tells you
milliseconds now milliseconds now so you
can do it before and you can do it after
a task and see how long that took and I
think that you do inside if you want to
test your first paint is that you want
to create your element you want to
attach it to the body and you want to do
a giant hack so let's talk about this
giant hack in the same way that we're
optimizing our elements the browser has
been optimizing itself because it
assumes there were terrible developers
which we are so just because you're
appending something to the body doesn't
actually mean chrome is going to paint
it Chrome's going to like wait to batch
them if that's the thing isn't visible
chrome doesn't even care if it doesn't
affect the layout it doesn't care and
you can't actually tell chrome to paint
things so the only way we can we can
time this correctly is by sort of
forcing chrome to relay out the entire
page which also forces it to paint
offset with is one of these attributes
that when you call it on a on an element
is a style attribute it like has to
recalculate the layout because it's in
reference to its parents so that's the
one that I use pretty much anything with
the word offset in it is going to cause
a relay out you can Google for all the
other ones if you don't like it but the
idea here is that if you want to make
sure your element has painted somehow
trigger our relay out on the page and
the follow up to that is don't do this
once do it like a thousand times do it
as many times as you have time for
because if you only do it once anything
could have happened in there somebody
could have sent you an animated gif to
your slack channel which slows down your
computer the garbage collector could
have run the garbage collector could
have not run if you do it a thousand
times you'll get more accurate numbers
you actually get a good answer about how
slow or how fast your element is at
painting and the reason why this is
awesome is that now you can automate it
you can put this in a unit test you can
put it on a test that you run on every
merge and then on every more you can be
like well this elementals like 10
milliseconds fast yesterday and itself
15 and then you can ask yourself whether
the feature you're adding or the bug fix
you're adding is actually worth this
performance constant you're taking so
let's talk about accessibility there's
this amazing quote about so anywho
but the conclusion here just to like
bring it home is test your elements for
performance make sure they are fast if
your elements are have their ups really
slow I hate you and you're going to slow
down the web please don't slow out the
web is really hard for all of us
accessibility so there's this amazing
quote by Cordelia Dylan which is that
accessibility is like a blueberry muffin
so the way you make a blueberry muffin
isn't by taking a plain muffin and a
fistful of blueberries and jamming them
in there and be like I made you a
blueberry muffin you made me garbage the
way you make a blueberry muffin is by
taking the eggs and the flour in the
sugar and the butter and beating them
together and adding the muffin the
blueberries to this raw dough and
putting them in the oven and waiting for
35 minutes and then you get delicious
blueberry muffins accessibility is hard
you have to do it the entire time from
the birth of your element to the end of
your element in the same way that you
make muffins you can't just make an
element and the last day before you ship
and be like I didn't make it
accessible let me jam some Eric are your
labels in there you're gonna make a
terrible job about it and the reason why
this is important is that if you don't
have accessible elements you're not
going to be able to make accessible apps
and if you don't want to make accessible
apps you're a terrible person you should
have meat making apps for anybody you
should be doing something else thanks
y'all
Rob Dodson gave a really good talk
yesterday at 9 a.m. on this stage about
how to make your elements accessible and
I strongly recommend going and watching
it at home it's an amazing talk and he
tells you like proper concrete things on
how to make it better I'm going to tell
you two things that I got wrong because
they were like kind of like really easy
things for me to get right and I didn't
focus dates are only a big one
focus dates tell you you know where the
focus is on the page it's a really ugly
outline that in the 2000s it was really
cool to set outline:none on focus
because nobody really liked it and
that's really terrible because if you're
not using the mouse and you're just
using the keyboard you're not going to
know where you're on the page but even
if you are a mouse user if it's just
like you remember the last time you had
to buy something on the internet and at
the end you get to the 15 field visa
credit form where you have to like fill
in on your information your shipping
address your mailing address your name
and your credit card number and you're
going to be tabbing to them I promise
you you don't actually click on every
single field I know you
and if nobody is telling you where the
focus is on that page you're going to
start typing your credit card number in
your like address field you're going to
get frustrated it's already frustrating
experience buying things on the Internet
don't make it worse don't make bad you
eyes for people I don't care whether you
use this outline or a different outline
or you're communicating focus in a
different way as long as you are
communicating focus in someone you can
make like a nice ripple around it just
make sure that if somebody is using the
keyboard they know where the focus is on
that page and the platform helps you
with this tap index equals zero whatever
you put it on that thing becomes
focusable and by default at least it
gets the really ugly outline it's ugly
but you're doing better than not doing
anything at all and the other thing is
that you have documented active element
which tells you where the focus is on
that page which means now you can unit
test this and automate this make a test
where you have 17 of your elements and
simulate tabbing through it and check
that the thing is that the thing that is
focused is the thing that you expect to
be focused and it's styled like you
expect it to be focused unit tests are
the best they make sure that your
element doesn't randomly break the
platform also gives you Aria Aria is
what a voiceover application is used to
read HTML there's a whole bunch of like
documentation Aria I'm not going to talk
about Aria I just want to mention that
some elements have like built in Aria
like nav and a have like extra Aria
built in themselves and that are you
labeled by is this really awesome
attribute that is basically like Aria
label on steroids
because if an element already has a
built in Aria label like input the
native input does it uses the Aria label
to read whatever you typed in it you
can't put an extra Aria label on it you
can only have one so if you want to make
the native input more accessible like
say with a label that describes what
it's for are you labeled wise therefore
that it always adds more information to
any element so this is really important
please make your elements accessible
because if we're going to make
accessible elements we're going to get
accessible apps and the same thing
happens for performance if you have fast
elements you're going to get a fast app
and if you have maintainable elements
you're going to get a maintainable app
and that's really our goal as element
developers we want to make the web
better we want to make amazing apps for
other people so that's it I hope you got
something out of the stock please go
home and make elements and if you do
tweet them at me so I can
what remained thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
