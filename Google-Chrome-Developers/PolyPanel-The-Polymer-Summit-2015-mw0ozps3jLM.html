sir first question hi so I love that all
the sessions today were about like from
very different perspectives so it was
like design accessibility performance
but for me but I work on a website and I
was one thing missing for me and I was
SEO so how like it seems like when you
use lots of custom so it's slightly
ready to the accessibility i guess like
you you can implement the semantics
using a lot of attributes but this still
like it does seem to have like all this
javascript dependencies so i guess is it
can you make it work with search engines
or would you basically need a completely
different tool or yes yes you can so
that's a question we get a lot and just
kind of right off the bat working with
polymer in terms of SEO is absolutely no
different than building apps with any
other javascript library or framework
you may use the problems and challenges
are exactly the same with SEO for
polymer as you would get for an angular
react app anything like that which also
means fortunately the same set of tools
that are available in terms of SEO also
work with polymer so if you're building
single page apps you're gonna you know
naturally we need to pre-render and pre
pre render on the server side your
application so that can be picked up by
search engines and so all the set of
kind of services that you might use to
pre-render your angular application
pre-render io is one of them there are a
number more they all work with polymer
as well so essentially same set of
problems with single page apps same set
of solutions and if you if you build
your site just like any other site in
terms of SEO you'll get the same results
so it's no different okay thanks thank
you for that question yes you sir even
you've introduced us today to poly get
and pulling into quite a nice set sets
of features but things that don't exist
in JavaScript but they do for example
exist in the dart language will we see
continued cooperation with dart I can
take that one as well yes so fortunately
yes so the polymer dart dart version of
polymer
library is still being actively worked
on so they are working really hard to
get a dart polymer for polymer 1
dot 0 out by the end of this quarter the
end of this month approximately is the
goal which is great it's a small team
it's a really small team just like the
polymer team working really hard and we
love that all the work that they do and
so they actually already have a branch
of polymer dart for polymer 1 point 0 up
so you can check it out and kind of poke
around and hopefully it'll be it's
they're still you know working on it
actively but hopefully very very soon
it'll be production ready so let me do a
quick Twitter question here because it's
in a similar vein a lot of folks are
wondering how does polymer and angular
how are they going to coexist this is
gonna be the Taylor the tailor show they
um okay
I get the fun questions so there's a
there's a lot of JavaScript frameworks
out there even though polymers not a
framework it's a library so and really
there will always be a lot of libraries
and frameworks out there so the fact
that we're both part of Google is just
sort of a side effect of the fact that
Google is a very big place working on a
lot of projects all at the same time so
we work really well together with with
angular especially with their upcoming
20 which supports web components we've
done a bunch of work to work on inner up
with it and a lot of projects inside of
Google are actually using angular and
polymer together so we think there's a
you know there's absolutely a niche for
every single library out there I think
you guys are probably authored some
yourselves and I think you know they
will continue to work together all right
you sir at microphone I don't know if I
missed this but well that question came
up with the the breaks how does how does
browser caching play with polymer
cashing in the current state of affairs
yeah are there collisions do things get
messy is there anything I have to look
out for thanks I guess I can speak to
that quickly no there really shouldn't
be any issue you know HTML imports which
is a you know primary platform tool that
problem or uses to grab dependencies you
know fundamentally your implemented in
the platform and support browser caching
just fine works really well with service
worker that was talked about a lot today
too so I mean really everything should
just work well and be fine there's
really no issues there okay thanks a lot
thank you all right another question
from Twitter someone asked building an
accessible website can sometimes be ugly
you've got things you know like focus
rings and stuff like that is there
anything that polymer can help with in
that department yeah that's a great
question actually and so if you're
actually using some of the paper
elements and we're even like the gold
input elements those are actually going
to come with a really nicely designed
focus state with them that's that's
definitely one way that you could go
with it another way that you can
consider is that if you're not if
they're not going to be using the paper
the gold and put LM LM excuse me
elements and if you're building your own
you're going to have some focus rings
and focused states that are available
that are going to be built in one thing
to consider there is that that sort of
look and feel that focus ring it might
not always go with your site or your app
and that's totally valid if you don't
feel that that's that's the right sort
of way to go the good thing to consider
here though is that you can work with
your designers to work in a focused
state as part of the design from the
very beginning so accessibility really
feels like a very just integrated part
of the entire flow as opposed to
something that's just kind of tacked on
top so from the super nerdy tech ii part
we try to make behaviors to actually
help with this so we've made the ink you
focus behavior I couldn't name it
anything better at the time but that
basically lets you if you have a ripple
when you're focused you display that
ripple because it's probably be slightly
nicer than then the blue outline so
check box does this radio button does
that paper buttons a little bit
different but that one also has a
behavior that you can override if you
don't like it for your particular button
and if you're using iron control state
which basically tells you what's going
on with your button you can always like
listen to what's happening on focus and
make your own style so at least like all
the hooks are there and then you can
style it however you want great another
question you sir down at Mike hi first
full thanks for this awesome event
that's seriously cool question on a
technical part say you have two
components one is built with web
components jazz 10 and others built at
one dot one how would you incorporate it
in one application without conflicts or
dependencies yeah so so there's a
there's a couple parts this question so
first yeah so in the current version of
custom elements and and web components
we don't really have true kind of
isolation between elements that you can
register so you know it's possible that
you know one component pulls in it
you have a paper button one point oh and
another one pulls in a dependency of a
paper version 1.1 for example and right
now elements are registered into a
global registry and we know that this is
really unsatisfying and this might we
typically get get questions like this so
this you know we recognize that this is
very unsatisfying and its really kind of
an artifact of the fact that specs are
really hard to get through especially
you know when we're trying to get cross
browser specs push through and this was
actually a you know a known you know
deficiency or conceit of the version one
of the custom element spec in order to
get consensus and do get it pushed
through so that's really like on the
version 2 of custom elements is route to
really tackle the the kind of the notion
of how can custom elements be registered
scoped into and kind of scoped
registered into scope registry so that
you can have kind of multiple versions
of the same component on the on the page
so i think that's that's one part of the
answer however you know the other way i
like to look at it is that you know if
you think of the npm model where you
know each each package can pull down its
own dependencies in its own versions and
then each of those can pull it down its
own versions and you may have seen like
crazy dependency trees where you have 97
versions of the same you know async
package or something and that that model
well it's nice from a you know you know
it's possible to put all these things
together point of view when you look at
on the client side it's really just kind
of incompatible so even if we built a
system that allowed you to have like 47
versions of paper button the first thing
you would want to do was go like get
that down to one version of paper button
and so you know when we think about
client-side tech it's just a little bit
different and so ultimately we're right
now we're kind of pushing the pain
forward to say resolve the dependencies
first because that's going to you know
it altima tlie end up in the smallest
payload for your app yeah so follow
sorry a follow-up question on that so
would you then advised not to use for
example third party dependencies because
you don't have control on it um it's
more just that you know right now for
when you're using bower bower will will
identify the conflicts and then you know
there's a there's a process of resolving
them so you know by leveraging the pet
the package jewel wall you know we have
a love-hate relationship with you know
the current state of package management
you know the good thing is that they
can't highlight where where you have
dependency conflicts and help you
resolve great let's take one from over
on this side yep hi I get another
question about the accessibility because
I know there are problems with
accessibility and the focus event around
the shadow Dom but does the shady Dom
helps somehow in it so um we would like
the shady Dom to be as close to the
shadow Dom as possible in a perfect
world everybody would have the shadow
DOM and we want to need to use the shady
Dom so if you're doing things where
you're taking advantage of the shady Dom
because you think that helps you fix
focus issues um that's kind of like a
bonus of the shitty down but it
shouldn't be there so she's probably
file a bug and we'll fix it so that it
doesn't work for you anyway but there
shouldn't really be discrepancies
between what how focus works on the
shady Dom and how focus works on the
shadow DOM and we event like we
occasionally in elements find bugs where
we've dug ourselves into a hole because
focus is hard and then we keep trying to
fix it so that shady Dom in shadow don't
focus do exactly the same thing I just
went sorry quickly wanted to add one
thing which is just that there's
actually a lot of complex pretty
technical behavior around focus if you
consider for example i know and i think
was in Monica's talk she showed the
input type date which has the pop up and
if you think about that focus date I
mean there's like if you think about the
notion that there's that elements focus
state ok so it's focused but then the
actual keyboard is going to go to the
specific like D or two or a month or
year field that's pretty tricky and this
is an area in particular in shadow Dom
where the spec is still sort of evolving
and the behavior is evolving it's an
active area of developing in chrome
we're actually we're sort of there's
sort of experimental implementation
going on which will help inform this
back and hopefully this will be
something that'll that'll evolve
relatively soon because again we want to
sort of get to the point where we can
very easily make
of that kind of complex behavior that
you can do in these in these uh you know
built-in elements I just want to point
out that this is kind of an interesting
aspect of polymer being part of the the
web platform team at Google is that when
the the guys are you know working on new
browser features like shadow DOM and
like you know these questions about
focus you know have a concrete you know
question like how should this work you
know they have a team that they can come
to is like sitting there right on the
bleeding edge of what all you guys are
doing out there on the web and we can
actually you know give them feedback and
really tighten the loop back with with
the browser vendors so I think this is a
it's really it's a really smart thing I
think that Google chose to do with with
kind of having a client-side framework
work so closely with the platform team
oh sorry focus is really hard like
literally the hardest okay thank you for
that question uh another one from
Twitter and this is actually something
someone asked me in person out on the
floor the other day too what's the best
way to share data across elements
number one think locally number two
composition number three it mean yeah
but so uh right guys got it listen
listen to the first tech talk yeah so I
mean that's basically the answer I mean
you know we like I went into
excruciating detail we've kind of
codified this notion of you know being
able to share data through a tree but
not in a super deterministic way it's
all shared from one mediator to another
to another and then those notifications
you know always flow through that tree
through those connections that you've
made in the bindings and so you know in
general you know app application data
that is truly shared that doesn't need
mediation that doesn't need someone to
kind of make a decision in between
before it's propagated it's very easy to
just use polymers two-way binding system
and I think you know you know the one
you know place that sometimes comes up
is yeah I started out binding this stuff
together and then I realized that you
know but I needed to put like an if
statement in there somewhere how do I do
that and that's just kind of you know a
sniff test that you know these things
aren't actually shared they should
probably have two names and then there's
some mediator that's you know making
some decision and passing the data along
so you know I think it's really key you
know hopefully you have a better
understanding of what the what the data
binding system and polymer is actually
doing and then you can make the decision
when you want to just fall back to you
know kind of using events and in
mediating the data manually vs vs kind
of using the built-in data binding okay
uh over there hi so we've done a lot of
work on our components to follow the
structured data model or schema.org
stuff so my first part of the question
is one will those components although we
tested them inside the tool will they
actually be picked up as rich snippets
and the second part was are you doing
any work with elements for those kind
things like schema tags and social tags
yes great question absolutely and a
hundred percent
it will work it will get picked up by
browser by search engines and shown as
rich snippets and we've actually done a
lot of experimentation with this at
Google the the search engine crawling
team there is a strict firewall between
them and any client teams so we have as
much information out there as all you
have in terms of actually how the
internals of the search engine work but
we actually have done a bunch of
experiments and there's some experiments
live on github that were posted about a
while back about a year ago now on the
chrome developers blog that goes into
exactly this and it's an example example
multiple examples of polymer elements
that get internal state and data and
then expose that explicitly through
attributes that can then be picked up
seen a schema.org attributes things like
that and get picked up throughout the
entire loop and then rendered is rich
snippets and things like that so
absolutely works and it's actually a
really cool model because we can expose
this data I think the example was you
want to have a location and you want to
expose that location data so that it's
picked up by the search engine and you
know you only have to have that data
once you know you don't have to now like
if you're if you were a hand hand coding
or hand coding this mark up with
schema.org you kind of have to repeat
yourself in where you put the location
latitude and longitude and thus kiva.org
and then in your data and however it
flows throughout your application but
fortunately with data binding and
reflecting two attributes you can just
have that data once in your application
and it can be both exposed through the
schema.org and it can be exposed however
your app needs to expose it so it's
absolutely use case that it works well
what about rival social networks it's
schema.org so you know the I however
whatever social networks support that
markup would would support this and
similarly open graph you can do a very
similar similar strategy with reflecting
it and it should work I can't speak
obviously to how other networks do
they're fetching in their parsing and
they're crawling but ultimately again
exact same things you'd run into with
any type of JavaScript rendered
application it should it should work and
you just got the try it out great thank
you so much oh yeah over here hi guys
zero a lot of buzz nowadays like web
components are cool but not cool enough
yet polymerase cool but not cool enough
yet and just to make it clear for your
opinion what is the weakest point of
polymer now and how can we as a
developer's help to improve that and
yeah well let me give you my take I
think that may be the weakest point is
from my perspective sort of as a car
engineer on the team is a very technical
point which is just that we are
embracing the platform we think is the
future but it's very hard for us because
while Chrome's implementation is great
and native and there it's really hard to
try to polyfill this behavior on other
browsers and the work that we have to do
and sort of honestly the you know the
fact that we have to spend a lot of time
doing that work is kind of the weakest
part from you know it slows down our
progress it makes it harder for us to
get stuff to you guys the fact that we
have to do that hard work so the good
news on that is you know you've heard
some stuff about how you know native
implementations are coming to other
browsers and the faster the better
because then we can all sort of read the
benefits of that and you know as the
platform grows we grow and everything's
better so I mean that the good news is
the weakest point is going to go away
but it's you know for a little bit more
time it's going to still be difficult
hopefully just for us and not for you
yeah I was just gonna add you know yes
and what can we do to help I mean it's
kind of call your senator it's it's a
you know make it you know make it known
to the other browser vendors you know
how much you know we really need these
these primitives especially things like
shadow Dom that are just you know you
know we tried they're virtually
impossible to polyfill because there's
such a core incredibly needed you know
you know piece of piece of functionality
in the platform so as soon as that you
know becomes native we're all we're all
going to benefit tremendously we can
stop worrying about you know spending
all this time doing that the poly
filling and stuff but like Steve said
like Taylor read off this morning
there's there's a lot of really good
moment momentum so we're very happy
about the future so kind of actually
following on that a little bit a while
back and this is what
our Twitter questions Mozilla wrote a
blog post saying that they weren't
planning to implement HTML imports
instead favoring es6 modules so what is
the team's thoughts on that sure I can
speak to a little bit so I think the
important thing about that is to sort of
note that they didn't say they're not
going to do it they said they're not
going to do it right now they don't
think it's a top priority compared with
this other thing that's got this other
specification and is sort of on track
with other es6 features so that's fine
and that's reasonable in chrome honestly
is also implementing modules they've
also implemented HTML imports and the
awesome thing about that is that
fundamentally sort of it was something
that a bunch of that chrome engineers
blink engineers got together and
realized that the fundamental sort of
design parameters of those two systems
were compatible and there should be a
way to sort of get the best of both
worlds and there are some people now
working on that and I mean I think as
that evolves we will hopefully see
relatively soon you know the glorious
future where we have modules implemented
natively and they interact correctly
with imports and it sort of everything
works nicely together this may take a
little bit more time you know but we're
going to get there because fundamentally
I think there are compatible systems
they both have serve an asynchronous
loading model they both have a lot of
commonality and sort of the way that
they want to do to placate resources so
yeah I mean I think fundamentally we're
going to get there it's going to take a
little bit and I think at that point I
hope that you know the browser vendors
will say oh okay there's a lot of power
to having this declarative HTML way of
loading resources along with this script
based way and they should be able to
coexist and interact all right yeah once
more over here I guess on a similar vein
to what you guys were talking about just
now how would you advise someone writing
a polymer app now to guard against the
possible flux and like API
implementations of the different vendors
to some of these standards so someone
writing a polymer app now what would
they have to do two years from now when
some of these standards might have
changed how could you mitigate some of
that how could you prepare for those
those kinds of sin
so yeah I can speak to and just quickly
is I mean this is kind of what I was
alluding to you when I said we have this
hard work to try to make that substrate
of polyfills relatively you know seeing
for cross wiser development so you know
as there as we get I mean so far we've
really only had to deal with a native
implementation in chrome and honestly
it's hard to polyfill so we sort of try
to find the sweet spot of the features
that we need to get where we can sort of
get cross browser performance as other
features come online and other browsers
we're going to have to sort of take hard
look at saying ok so now firefox
implemented this let's try to let that
part be native and let the polyfill fall
away here so we're going to need to
manage that so that you know people
using polymer are not going to have
problems over time you know we're
committed to doing that you know we've
have a lot of experience doing it at
this point so I mean I think what
basically the answer is is that as you
know as native implementations come
online polymers sort of i mean honestly
the web components polyfills which
really are not part of polymer but are
used by polymer are going to have to
sort of adapt and you know be able to
coexist with the native implementations
so what you're saying is that the
polyfills are going to drop back to the
native implementations or are there
polymer poly fill light guys going to
change so I mean I think the exact shape
of the solution will have to evolve as
you know if you know safari implements
something that's problematic versus
chrome I'll have to see at that time but
the notion is that once you get up to
the layer of polymer hopefully you've
got an API that's stable and not going
to you know not going to change out from
under you so we will do the work that we
need to do I mean I can't promise
anything good God knows what's going to
be actually implemented but we're
working really hard to make sure that
it's reasonable and follows this back
and so far all signs are good so I mean
I don't really anticipate anything you
know that's going to be fundamentally
like so hard to deal with their i think
you know i think you know pretty soon
let's hope that one of the browsers
implement its shadow DOM and other than
chrome and then you know you can use
polymers polyfill for that only
selectively and not on that browser at
that point so i think it's going to be
pretty clear and from an element's
perspective we test all of our things
both in the shady and shadow Dom so that
if at least a shadow Dom comes around
if you're just using or elements you
shouldn't really notice a change unless
you've been cheating and just using
explicitly shady Dom things so if
anything changes we'll like at least
make sure that the paper elements of the
iron elements are going to work fine
well and then you one of our engineers
Peter today gave a lightning talk I
think he said we got your back I think
that was the the phrase you know so you
know the polymer team here is committed
to kind of helping make any of these
transitions as other browser vendors
kind of bring their native
implementations online to help you adapt
and and you know we may have tools and
that sort of thing to help help convert
but we're yeah we got your back all
right another Twitter question what is
polymers accessibility roadmap does that
look like absolutely that's a great
question so accessibility is really just
very highly integrated into the polymer
library now and so we had a lot of work
leading up obviously to the one point o
launch I'm going through all of the
testing all of the identification of any
sort of user issues and then figuring
out the right ways to implement
solutions to these issues but we
obviously don't want to stop just at
Palmer one point o launch we want to
work and we are working together at a
very regular basis so every time that
new changes are actually implemented
across any of the elements and they're
going through substantial testing if any
of you were you know if you were
listening to the talk earlier and we've
got a significant way of testing across
a lot of different components which
we've outlined in the gold standard
accessibility checklist which is
available on github so would definitely
encourage that everybody takes a look at
that and so that will give you a sense
of kind of the different use cases that
we are testing for for each of the
individual elements so things like of
course keyboard focus focus States
keyboard interaction is that working
things i'm testing with screen readers
and making sure that everything is all
the declared semantics are working
properly labels are implemented the
right way so the discriminator can get
the most clear and intuitive spoken
feedback to the user and then looking at
things like contrasts and and color the
way the colors are rendering
magnification all of these are being
regularly tested across multiple browser
multiple sets of assistive technology
and screen readers and multiple
operating systems so this will continue
in addition to some automated testing so
for instance the accessibility developer
tools audit that's all being executed on
a regular basis and moving forward you
mean accessibility is definitely a
moving target this is a dynamic world
that we live in so I would say you know
we're basing all of this based off of
the use cases that we can think of now
for the users that are out there with
varying assistive technology needs but
who knows what sort of technology is
going to come out in the future I mean
that's an amazing thought that things
might come out in the future that can
totally revolutionize our world even
more so you know as that happens we'll
have to incorporate that into testing
and also we love any additional feedback
like if there are additional use cases
that some of you can think of right off
the bat of oh you know you should
consider this or that and let us know
for sure I mean we've got the the
polymer slap channel and you can find me
on Twitter anything that you need like
we want to be listening to you and
incorporating that feedback and working
that into our roadmap also I think my
personal next plan for accessibility is
RTL we've like sort of slacked off on
our tail really badly and the Chrome
settings page is coming after us so RTL
will get better and maybe look at
internationalization that's the thing
that's on the road Mac map and also
Laura mentioned the polymer slack
channel if you are not already on that
that is at Palmer dash when is it
polymer dash slack Heroku app com you
can go there too to hop in the channel
and discuss things all right let's take
another question from over there hi so I
really liked the the mediator pattern
and I was also wondering if you have any
experience with like taking a donor
application which is for example an
angular application wrapping it in your
own component and then reusing it in
your app is that something like you have
any experience with rebuilding google
apps or is it just well do a greenfield
and take it from there you mean
specifically just like literally putting
something that was already built in some
other technology in you know kind of
hiding that in a custom element and then
using that yeah
um yeah I mean we we actually I mean
it's kind of funny that there are a lot
of because that like declarative you
know interface is so powerful we do this
wrapping a lot I mean not specifically
with with you know a full angular
application for example but there's no
reason that that you can't write you
have lifecycle callbacks and you have a
dom node in which to render stuff and so
for example like people do stuff with d3
for example you know there's a lot of
examples you know you we've often taken
like jQuery widgets or something like
that something that's really useful then
you can just you know you pull in those
dependencies through its import and then
in the custom element you can just hide
all that you know have the jQuery widget
or whatever render itself into into the
the local dumb and you kind of you can
totally expose that out as an element so
yeah fully possible all right so we're
going to take these will be the last
three questions the speakers up here so
yeah well we'll start over there
actually you sir sorry to ask you
another one so Eric talked about when to
get better performance out the polyfill
you only loaded on browsers that need it
and as browser star adopting features
that gets more and more complicated I
was wondering if you thought about maybe
making that into a bower component that
was version based on different browsers
that we could pull in that's a good idea
and I think that I mean so far we
haven't really had this problem because
mostly it's been the native implantation
has been on Chrome I think this is
something that it's thing that will have
to evaluate as some of the features are
coming online and other browsers for
sure and yeah I think we'll try to make
sure that that continues to be
straightforward and as easy as possible
so yeah yeah we'll definitely evaluate
case of case I you know that reminded me
of a case we you know they're there are
like two or three small things that we
ship in the web components light
polyfill that are only there for IE it's
like you know for ie10 you need you know
they don't have I don't a week map in
mutation observer and a few things so we
we probably fill those and you know we
kind of had this question it's like wow
that's like for you know 4k maybe we
should make a different version of what
bonus light just for just for ie so like
for you know it's that you could do that
and that one it was like now you know
maybe for the complexity of having to
explain that all you guys like use this
one for IE and you know maybe the 4k is
ok but you know if that if that got to
you know do something significant we
would totally look at doing that all
right yes sir hello I have a question
about internationalization you have any
plans any tools elements to use for
internationalization yes absolutely so
there's an element for that so they're
actually I talked a little bit to this
at the beginning and this is kind of our
typical answer at least today for
foreigners last ization and similar
topics which is there are a whole bunch
of different strategies that you can use
for a nationalization so we've we've
already seen a lot of different apps you
have different techniques of approaching
internationalisation Eric bidelman
actually wrote a great example with the
Santa tracker that launched with polymer
which used you know one I think gives 18
message and it was a filter or a around
the binding system that looked up
translations to be able to do
internationalisation that's one approach
we've also written I 18 next element
which uses a slightly different approach
to mapping out translations and things
for your a solution this is absolutely
something that we want to tackle with
the carbon element set this new kind of
element set that we're just working on
to do app level structure so
internationalisation will be a big piece
of that of course it will not be
necessarily you know the only solution
all of these are good solutions and it
really depends on what you need for your
application but we do want to build a
kind of polymer riffic
internationalisation solution with with
that component set so coming relatively
soon as we build that that set out but
in the meantime there are these existing
solutions out there that have worked
successfully on various applications
thank you thank you that's question hey
guys yeah thanks thanks for all your
work by the way um yeah I mean like the
specs are awesome and like you guys got
to go through a lot of stuff I mean
also the other other browser vendors
it's really cool what you guys are
trying to do yeah I add a question
because I mean like as a morphic and
universal this is becoming like a trend
right now right and as well as like
native so react native and then you got
angular 2 you can render to native and
even the command line it's like it's
crazy stuff right is there actually I
mean maybe this is a stupid question
it's pretty early but is there is there
a future in other platforms for web
components it's a very good question so
we consider on the polymer team we are
native we're native on the web platform
and we're native to the web platform
whereas tight to that platform as you
can possibly get with web components and
that's the really the value that web
components gives us so one way to think
about it and the way kinda we like to
think about it is that that is our
native platform it's the web web is only
getting better it's getting better on
mobile devices all the time you get all
these benefits building on the web
platform that you don't get building
natively and so that is our focus is
building on the web platform making the
web platform the strongest platform it
can possibly be for building everything
from you know basic text rendering
applications to really full fledge
interactive applications and beyond so
that is our focus today and certainly
you know polymer 10 is only three months
old so there's a bright and broad future
ahead of it and we certainly would be
excited to see any experiments or things
that any of you would be interested in
building to experiment with this kind of
rendered in native it's it's an
interesting idea and what what polymer
is beyond being native the web platform
it's also this component model and the
component model in the mediator pattern
that Kevin talked about that's certainly
all applicable to other platforms so
from the kind of component ization
perspective and that philosophy of how
you build things that could apply
broadly across platforms and so you can
imagine you know our paper buttons it's
just markup it's just HTML if you're
building an Android app for building an
iOS app you're using XML to lay out your
application anyway you know you that
translates relatively should translate
relatively straightforward so
oh absolutely it should be possible it's
not our focus today but we're excited
for the future cool thanks thank you all
right I think that's actually the last
question uh please give it up for the
speakers
