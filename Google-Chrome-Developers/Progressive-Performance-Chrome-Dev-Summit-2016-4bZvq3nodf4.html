an engineer on the chrome team and to
set expectations this isn't the talk I
usually give so I hope you'll bear with
me through some difficult content these
days I usually put this slide up to
start a talk about progressive web apps
which Francis Berman and I named last
year
furgus why I've saw the culmination of
multiple years of my team's work I've
been working with Jake on serviceworkers
for like four years now and the team
that I work on has been designing and
building the core technology for
progressive web apps the stuff that
you've been hearing about for the last
couple of chrome dev summit and all day
today and probably all day tomorrow and
I apologize a little bit but not really
but as you can imagine sort of building
and maintaining all of that stuff and
working on the standards for it is a
full-time job
but I'm not gonna talk about progressive
web apps today at least not directly you
see for the past year I've also been
working with Tao and her team to partner
with folks who are about to launch their
progressive web apps to make sure that
they're really high quality and this
sort of incidental consulting work has
given me a broad view into the practices
of many of the teams that are building
for the mobile web today what I can say
with only a few exceptions exceptions
like booking comm and the great work
that the Flipkart team did is that most
of us don't really understand how hard
mobile actually is I haven't exactly
been making friends in the JavaScript
framework community by saying that sort
of thing out loud turns out but as the
polymer team will tell you this is
basically the PG version what I've been
saying to them for something like a year
and a half we had some really tense
meetings I kept saying things like it
needs to be more synchronous or look at
this Trace you really need to load a lot
less JavaScript in 12 K sounds good to
me actually um or you really need to
break up your script so you're not
executing this entire long block what
the heck is going on here and at some
point they said we get it we get it just
stop telling us what to do and start
telling us what goal to hit this was
kind of a breakthrough in the
conversation we've been sort of at
loggerheads for a while um and so I kind
of put my finger in the air and said it
would be really great if you could get
me some thing that's interesting
in about three seconds on a 3G
connection on first load and interactive
in about a second when I launch it from
the home screen so the polymers went off
and they went through the stages of
grief
we had some denial I'll admit there was
some denial anger yes bargaining
absolutely depression luckily they sit
far enough away from me that I couldn't
actually see them sobbing in their cubes
but it finally accepted the challenge
and they came back with a purple pattern
which Sam is gonna talk a lot more about
meanwhile the rest of the JavaScript
community kind of hasn't internalized
the same message to the same degree so
I'm here to let you down
not easily this may be a little bit hard
and I apologize in advance but we need
to get to the bottom of what mobile
actually means and when you see me
tweeting things like this this is
actually kind of desperate I have spent
years of my life working in tc39 to make
JavaScript a better language I have
spent countless hours persistently
advocating for extensibility to give you
more power when you're writing
JavaScript in the web platform
I've designed features like service
workers with Jake and a load of other
folks that are entirely predicated on
JavaScript in the first place back in
the day I used to work on a JavaScript
toolkit with Scott and Steve from the
polymer team it's not like I hate
JavaScript or I don't like it or I think
you shouldn't be using frameworks I
don't hate them it's just that we're
really in the midst of a crisis and
collectively we don't understand how bad
that crisis is if we did we would have
already modulated our behavior so what
I'm seeing when I do reviews is almost
universally bad news specifically in the
context of the rail performance model a
quick recap of rail basically R stands
for responding to input and under a
hundred milliseconds animating at 60
frames a second which means that because
the browser has to apply the things that
we hand it on every frame we probably
only have about eight milliseconds to
get to do our work when we think about
what VR it gets 60 frames is 60 frames a
second hard 120 when we're doing
background work we need to make sure
that we're breaking up that background
work into 50 millisecond chunks so that
we can respond
subsequent input and stay under that
hundred millisecond budget and we really
want to complete actions for the user in
under a second because over a second
research suggests that users lose focus
on the task they're trying to accomplish
if we can't actually complete it we
definitely need to acknowledge that
working under a second give users the
sense that we're doing something for
them so you've heard this number all day
today Darrin had it in a keynote but the
double-click folks went and did a bunch
of work to find out what are the bounce
rates for sites and does performance
matter and the answer of course is yes
53% of users bounce from mobile sites
that take more than three seconds to
load you leave real money on the table
when your site is slow yet most of the
apps that I've traced over the last year
has been performance travesties my
experience isn't an outlier the last
that same report noted that the average
mobile site takes 19 seconds to load 19
seconds collectively we're failing Sam's
got more data on this and I actually
don't have time to go into it cuz we're
gonna talk about some of the reasons why
but I think one of the key reasons that
we are not succeeding today to put it
kindly is a lack of understanding and
respect for how hard level is I have
faith that as a community if we
understood and respected the limits we'd
be doing much better nobody here wants
to make bad user experiences I think
part of this is because we're the only
platform in the world that tried to take
all of our desktop stuff with us you
don't take a Java jar that was a swing
application and run it on your Android
phone you don't take a Mac Universal
binary and run it on your iPhone right
you don't take a win32 app and run it on
your Windows Phone everybody else
switched their tools when their form
factor and their constraints changed we
didn't we didn't make that switch and
the proof is in the pudding it's in the
traces that I'm looking at every day but
that's not the only reason why are most
of the popular frameworks and the tools
that we're using the tool chains that we
all wind up setting ourselves up with
unacceptably slow by default why are our
tools producing such Bismil results it's
not like we're bad people who want bad
things for users I think in part it's
that you all aren't actually developing
on mobile phones Paul show you some
really great dev tools they're awesome
so but I want to understand who uses
chrome dev tools to sort of get that
responsive view and understand how
things will look on a phone okay uh now
keep your hand up if you're using web
page test for testing on real devices oh
I like you some of you are liars
um and keep your hands up if you use
Chrome : inspect over USB to do real
on-device debugging okay who's done it
more than once okay that's what I
thought um it turns out the dev tools
emulation is nothing like real devices
now we're throttling CPU throttling
they're all kind of a fudge they're
better than nothing please use them
please set them on by default please use
them all the time but they're not the
real thing
not even close let me give you a quick
example this is the i/o 2015 website
which was a polymer 0.5 progressive web
app it was super bleeding edge it had
push notifications which I think we had
launched in chrome like the week or two
before there were bugs it was amazing
on desktop it felt super fast on this
Wi-Fi connection we get Dom content
loaded and it a meaningful paint at
about 700 milliseconds onload isn't far
behind and that starts a nice sweet
swooping out animation which is smooth
most of the time overall we spend about
a half a second in script which is well
under our budget for actually getting a
good responsive experience and we get
interactive content in about four
seconds including that long animation
this is a really great experience on a
desktop class device which is to say my
macbook pro this is the same site
running on the same Wi-Fi network on a
nexus 5x Dom content loaded doesn't show
up until two seconds on load triggers at
the six second mark which is where that
animation starts part of that delay is
down to this huge honking script eval
that's locked up the main thread for
nearly two full seconds script execution
balloon
up to four seconds in total and for all
of that work we still don't even get
smooth animations look at all those long
frames content doesn't become
interactive until seven seconds this is
what TTI will tell you in a lighthouse
and this is not acceptable
ouch so what have we learned
traces from real mobile devices are a
harsh master and when I show folks their
apps on real devices most have the same
reaction and in fact I do this a lot
they're shocked at how slow the median
mobile mobile CPU actually is not the
iPhones in their pockets they don't
really understand the difference between
desktop and mobile disks during storage
and most of us are super ignorant about
how crazy mobile networks are in the
real world I think we theoretically know
at some level that they're bad doesn't
begin to cover it
they're so bad it's important to
understand the depth of the deficit
though so we can start to adapt I've
been letting out down a bunch of
Engineers for the last year hard soft
I've just sort of been like easing them
into this this sort of you know grief
curve and then hopefully we get out the
other side and it goes well but you have
to put in the work but unless we do that
work unless we change the way we're
working that web won't work for the next
billion users not practically speaking
so something I say in basically every
meeting is that the truth is in the
trace and by that I mean dev tools and
chrome tracing attached to real devices
nothing else cuts the mustard it doesn't
get you there so this is what's sitting
on my desk on a typical day and aside
from the pixel excel that's on the
right-hand side all those phones are
less than $300 new the folks at Congo
report that the most recent commonly
used phones in their market are in the
sub $100 range new I carry most these
phones around in this bag this bag is in
my bag my other bag it bag with me all
the time and these are some slow phones
and I carry them because I have zero
faith that any thing I trace in Chrome
on the desktop is gonna be like the real
world
unless I've put it on the phone
and emulated 3G and we'll talk about 3G
I don't trust that unless I've done it
on real hardware and you know what I
also don't trust is the marketing
numbers from phone vendors so here's
some of the headline specs for the
devices that are in my bag all these
devices have flash-based storage
naïvely there's no reason to think the
description run ten times slower on my
Nexus 5x than it did in my macbook pro
if especially if I looked at these
headline numbers 2.8 gigahertz versus
1.8 gigahertz that's not a 10x
difference naively there's no reason for
that right if we just looked at these
numbers we wouldn't really understand
what's going on it bears repeating if
you think the $700 iPhone in your pocket
is what people are going to be adopting
in the next couple of years at the
median you're delusional
the average selling selling price of
smartphones is going down not up because
the next set of people who are going to
buy phones are not replacing their
current phone they're buying a new phone
for the first time and all the rich
people already have smart phones the
next billion users aren't buying
high-end devices they're buying at the
margin and that margin is a cheap device
worldwide phones are getting slower so
is the average network connection your
test device these represent that reality
so that we don't wind up building what
Bruce Lawson has called the wealthy
Western web so this is motion Mark it's
a benchmark that I put together earlier
this year and it tests a bunch of
graphics performance but it's various
JavaScript bounds in many cases on
apples to apples hardware with Safari on
current and chrome one running on the
same version of OS 10 chrome ties or
beat Safari in most cases basically this
is not something that we're actually
slow at so here's the same benchmark on
the same version of Chrome on a nexus 5x
the desktop version is 25 times faster
first though that XS 5 X's I was able to
change just one thing and get the motion
mark benchmark running 15% faster 15%
for one change what the heck did I do is
it magic
we're all adults here so I think it's a
food to admit that magic isn't actually
a thing instead I use a little bit of
science and I added this makeshift ice
pack to the bottom of the phone I got
this idea from my colleague Victor who's
been looking into optimizing this
benchmark earlier in the year and was
seeing massive variance across runs what
the heck is going on here going back to
basics recall the computers are
basically just a bunch of wires those
wires have resistance and voltage and
power are running through them which
means they dissipate heat and we
dissipate some more heat every time a
transistor flips from the on state to an
off state or vice versa
that same process generates computation
but it also generates excess wattage in
the form of BTUs so a chip built on the
same process with roughly the same
architecture with the same number of
transistors that dissipates more power
and turns it into heat is the chip that
does more math and doing more math is
how you go faster when it comes to
computing power is literally power and
power equals heat so these are the guts
of a regular desktop-class machine the
chip in there is a slower version of the
one in my laptop the sqaure fans on the
top of that thing though the heatsink
and the job of the heatsink is to
evaporate or just re dissipate the heat
coming off of the chip now that heatsink
is seated on top of a metallic top of
the assembly for the chip with a little
layer of thermal paste between it so
there's no air gap that air gap would
like cause a thing that would explode
and break the chip because it gets so
hot there's a fan that's running you
over the entire box extracting all that
heat that's getting dissipated out and
the result is that a desktop class or
high-end laptop chip like this can
dissipate something like 60 watts under
load this is what 60 watts looks like I
don't know about you but I haven't
chosen to hold 60 watts in my hand is
spitting more than once and
the key this is the key reason that
mobile phones don't run as fast as
desktops or laptops even if they can
include as many transistors or scale up
to the same frequencies these chips in
these packages just can't dissipate 60
watts without burning your hand as
Taylor said earlier so let's look at
inside the guts of one of these phones
this is the remains of the Nexus 5x that
I used as my daily phone for a couple of
years it gave up the magical blue smoke
and stopped booting a couple of weeks
ago so now I get to dissect it and
unlike desktop-class machines with a GPU
and the memory might be on different
sections of the board or different
boards entirely the whole system on a
chip lives under the other side of this
and that's the thing there is the power
supply on the flip side of the same PCB
is the entire system on a chip it's got
an aluminum cover like this sort of a
heat spreader so when we flip it over
this is what you see there's no thermal
paste no fans I took the shield off but
that's all
in fact the CPU module isn't even
visible on this board because it's
sitting underneath that Samsung made Ram
chip think about that to get heat off of
this CPU it has to go through another
chip and then through the casing of that
chip then to air then to a thin aluminum
thing to maybe spread some of that and
then out what the screen the two layers
of polycarbonate plastic in the back two
layers separate layers I'm even
connected remember that polycarbonate
plastic dissipates heat a thousand times
less efficiently than aluminum if you
can't evacuate the heat then you can't
really generate a lot of it without the
core temperature rising to levels that
damage the circuitry and then the magic
blue escapes smoke escapes and you phone
start booting I wonder what I did to
mine so chip designers saw this coming
they've been putting dynamic voltage and
frequency scaling into chips for more
than a decade and we're recently they've
started enabling features that allow
os's to turn off cores entirely all this
reminds me of this paper that I read a
few years back from 2011 if you have
some spare time I recommend it well
perhaps not intended to be it reads like
a prophecy from half a decade ago about
the experience that we're all carrying
around in our phones where a huge
percentage of the silicon in our devices
isn't actually available to be used
thanks to the power and thermal
constraints
and the power thing is real there aren't
any heat sinks in your phone although
I'm pretty sure that you wouldn't want a
heat sink and a fan in your pocket um
but imagine if you could have one why
don't those exist why can't I get a
bulky phone the basic reason is that
this battery only contains 10 watt hours
of power think about that in terms of
the light bulb you only be able to keep
it lit for a couple of minutes if you
had to if you could drain the battery
that quickly which you don't because
doing that causes batteries to explode
so just don't try just FYI
not a fun experiment at home um this is
why mobile phones are slow we can't
dissipate power because we can't carry
power that battery has to deal with all
sorts of stuff it has to deal with the
CPU and the GPU and the Wi-Fi radio and
the Bluetooth radio and the NFC radio
and the cell radio and the screen and
the touch digitizer it has to power all
this stuff and keep you satisfied for a
day's worth of use on a single charge on
something they can't keep that light
bulb lit for more than a couple of
minutes so to keep from wasting power
there's a lot more complexity in modern
phones most of them today use what's
called a big little architecture and
that means that they try to move work
from high power course to low power
course very aggressively the systems
that move that work around are called
schedulers all Colonels have schedulers
and the antique assistants schedulers
are a bit all over the map the big thing
to understand about them though is that
your phone probably isn't using what's
called symmetric multiprocessing that is
to say not all of the cores are spun up
to the same voltage and frequency
running at the same rate all the time
there are different levels most of the
phones that you probably have have
something called a global task scheduler
which moves work around between those
things the systems in Linux that wind up
doing that management that work
management are notoriously hard to tune
and they use all sorts of heuristics to
do it some do something called touch
boosting and what that means is when you
put your finger down on the glass they
power up the big CPUs in anticipation of
you doing some work like animating
something or flinging it around some of
them have special heuristics for
launching application
so that when you want something from the
homescreen they power up the big core so
that thing launches very quickly now
that looks nothing like the web work
load the web work load today
looks like tapping on the URL and
waiting for the network and maybe those
scores got scaled down again and then
your content comes in and then we start
processing in basically the web is
fundamentally not aligned with the way
mobile phones have been optimized to
work because our workloads don't look
like their workloads last remember that
light bulb the light bulb is why you
shouldn't believe any of the numbers
that really you see in benchmarking
right the idea that your mobile phone
CPU is as fast as a desktop CPU may be
true in the limited case but not in the
common case you're gonna get scaled
you're gonna get throttled things are
gonna move to a low-power state as
aggressively as possible that's not how
the world works
we don't keep things spun out the way we
do on desktop so here's that chart again
but I added the details of the CPUs it
looks a lot different now doesn't it I
don't know gonna get into the details of
the huge differences that come from
caches and pipeline depths and in order
verses out of order dispatch and memory
bandwidth but all of it matters
that TLDR is that you actually get what
you pay for our mobile phone importantly
the macbook pro packs 100 watt hour
battery that's the faa maximum limit
that you're allowed to carry in a single
battery onto a plane design constraint
but as a result of having that much
power available and because the heatsink
and the fan of my macbook pro i can keep
those four cores spun up under load and
they can dissipate something between 40
and 60 watts all the phones in the chart
are big little devices and that means
that many of the cores are powered down
most the time that moto 4G at the bottom
has a cores but if you get more than
three of them working for you at any
point in time you are really lucky right
so mobile CPUs aren't exactly what you
thought they were I mean since when
would a hardware vendor ever use an
opaque number to mask a major difference
in performance right and okay maybe
memory pressure and smaller memory
footprints on mobile devices don't allow
us to on the browser side trade away
space for speed as aggressively as we do
on desktop and maybe the storage systems
roughly as fast though so maybe we could
get something back there I mean they're
just solid-state
devices on a Linux OS if you're running
Android right who has heard of the term
mlc flash okay I think it's like ten
people that's about what I expected
mlc flash is multi-level chips basically
there are chips on top of chips inside
the same chip package and that is how
you make storage cheaper and it's a
primary reason why my Nexus 5x gets 400
megabytes a second of read throughput
and my macbook pro gets 2 gigabytes as i
can have read through put in SSDs the
way you get better performance is
parallelism in order to read or write a
block you want to distribute reads and
writes for large reads and large writes
to as many different chips as possible
because the latency for getting data to
and from each of those chips is constant
so you have a controller in front it's
got some memory and then distributes
that work out to those chips now space
physical space is at a premium on mobile
devices but so is power and so vendors
have tried to consolidate those chips as
far as possible and that means that
they're using fewer and fewer usually
one chip for all that reading and
writing and that means low parallelism
which means low performance we don't get
that benefit that my macbook pro does of
having many chips in a row on a mobile
device and mostly flash is also just now
slower and file systems haven't really
caught up basically what you should
think about the median mobile phone
having is spinning disk from 2008 think
of it that way that's probably a pretty
good parallel okay that's kind of a
bummer right spinning metal and if
mobile disks make you sad the state of
mobile phone networks will make you wish
that mobile disks were the problem you
actually had if you had I recommend
checking out ilya grigorik high
performance browser networking it's free
you could read it online and it goes
over a huge amount of the total
end-to-end
network stack that gets bits from your
server to your phone highly recommended
if you spend some time with it you'll
get to where I got to which is the
mobile networks hate you cell networks
are basically kryptonite to the
protocols and assumptions that the web
was built on where TCP in the web was
built around the assumptions of
relatively stable underlying transport
condition cell networks gyrate wildly
and from millisecond to millisecond
where a TCP assumes relatively constant
packet loss and constant RTT times
cell networks deliver anything but
transitioning from one network type to
another or one subtype to another in
real-time and where the webs model of
hot linking sub-resources assumes
reliable networks for the duration of
the page well we kind of know how bad
that that breaks down in practice don't
we at least those of us who use public
transport or riding cars or you know
basically use phones so this paper is
actually a pretty good entry point and
especially its references into why these
networks hate you so much and they do
they hate you a lot when you dig in it
turns out that what's really killing you
is the variance and the volatility and
the underlying network substrate now
some of you might be thinking isn't LTE
gonna save us well yes and maybe here's
last year's performance for us LTE users
compared to the year before these
networks are actually getting slower
in fact the variance in mobile networks
is so massive that it feels like a farce
to call something 2g or LTE some of the
largest emerging markets have median RTT
times
north of 400 milliseconds when you open
dev tools and you do network throttling
and you put it in the regular 3G mode
it's that's the RTT to 100 milliseconds
which is par for the course in the US
but wildly wrong in other markets
especially when you think about how many
carriers wind up throttling things even
further down the same network type may
mean dozens of different things for your
users for the DCP geeks in the house
thinking about what that sort of are on
chip time does to the bandwidth delay
product can really bring you down
channel capacity be damned
that sort of latency eats your transfer
speed for breakfast but of course this
is mobile so it's worse than that as
Ilya said to me recently a 4G user isn't
even a 4G user most of the time cell
radios are magical things sure they try
to preserve power too though and they
seamlessly transition between their high
power suits in the low power states
across different radio types different
cell
locations they do a ton of work to make
sure that we never see what's happening
under the wall under the covers but that
creates variance when users try to
connect their phones might be in a low
connectivity or low-power state when
they weren't just a minute ago
in those cases the radio resource
control protocol that Ilias book goes
into some detail on determines how the
connection gets made for users and in
very low-power States on 3G connections
it can take seconds to just start the
radio handshake at the physical layer so
that you can start transmitting data if
you want to get bits on screen in three
seconds you're in a really tough spot
you can't do DNS TCP TLS or even start
sending those HTTP headers down the wire
until all of that is complete now
consider adding hundreds of kilobytes of
JavaScript to the mix that's not
theoretical the HTTP archive is showing
that the top 1,000 sites put almost a
megabyte of uncompressed script on their
pages today on those networks on these
CPUs this is a recipe for disaster
no wonder users have the pervasive
feeling that the mobile web is slow I
think it's only reasonable to be sad
about all this the tools and techniques
that we've brought over from the desktop
era really aren't serving us to make
great progressive web apps we need to do
things differently we need to load less
code we need to load it at the right
times and we need to let the browser do
work for us whenever possible use the
platform isn't a nice to have on mobile
it's the only way to go Sam's gonna go
into a lot more detail about the depth
of the crisis that we're in but make the
mistake if you're using one of today's
more popular JavaScript frameworks in
the most naive way you are failing by
default there is no sugarcoating this
except for the tiny club of fast enough
by default tools like the polymer app
tool box and pre-act with some good web
pack foo today's frameworks are mostly a
sign of ignorance or privilege or both
the good news is that we can fix the
ignorance so when we're our birth data
we can make better choices and avoid
those slow by default tools now I talk
to a lot of teams who've gotten a long
way into the PWA development story and
they've got very heavy client-side
JavaScript apps their apps feel like
Gmail basically they
loading bar or something like it well
all-time script starts to execute and
then they get a fast UI all the
subsequent interactions wind up being
fast because they've paid all that cost
upfront but many developers find that
this is kind of slow
it feels slow to use once everything is
loaded it's great but as we saw earlier
JavaScript execution on phones makes
this strategy kind of a loser javascript
execution is single-threaded sure we can
parse and compile a thread but we can't
use the preload scanner to grab some
resources if they're embedded in that
script
we can't speculative we build Dom or
parse CSS or apply it when you go with
one of these tools that doesn't use the
platform well you bet the farm on a
single core on a phone that might be
thermally throttled or in a low-power
State good luck so what we're seeing now
is something called server-side
rendering aka isomorphic rendering aka
Universal JavaScript I haven't looked in
a couple of months is there a new term
for this No okay so the idea is to run
JavaScript on the server the same as
JavaScript on the server that you run on
the client and then send down a a pre
computed snapshot of the HTML that you
were gonna send and then you load the
drug gancho in javascript bundle and
hope that it all works out on my macbook
pro or an iPhone with a fast connection
or my pixel something like that this
works out pretty well but for the vast
majority of users with less expensive
phones or less good connections you get
this crazy uncanny valley when the
JavaScript arrives the main thread locks
up all the same until it starts
executing and finishes the content might
be displayed but it isn't meaningfully
interactive now there's a debate that
starts some folks think that because
maybe you can start scrolling this stuff
because browsers are magic and they do
threaded scrolling and don't worry
scrolling actually is an interaction if
I can't put my finger down and tap on
your UI and have it start responding and
doing work for me under 100 milliseconds
it isn't loaded it's broken okay all
right what we really want is progressive
interactivity and this is what the
purple pattern that Sam will go into
delivers the insight here is that you
should only load the code that you need
right now if possible for the views that
you're actually sending to users and
combine the service workers and HTTP to
push it's possible to achieve this
without over bundling purple
on the polymer app toolbox represent
what's possible once we take that mobile
by default things seriously and it's
night and day from where most popular
tools are so this is the shop app that
you've seen before the polymer team
released it at i/o you can visit it
right now at shop that polymer - project
org um and here it is running on a
desktop browser we get the interactivity
very quickly on Wi-Fi and it only takes
a few hundred milliseconds of script
overall you know so what we've seen this
story before but what about mobile again
Nexus 5x same Wi-Fi connection despite
the slower CPU the app sends down an
appropriate amount of script so that we
get interactive performance at under two
seconds there's nearly a second and a
half of script execution overall but
thanks to the granular use of HTML
imports in HTTP to push in contrast a
major bundling most the components load
with tiny execution slices which means
that the content that's already on
screen stays interactive this is what
mobile first looks like and it's
radically different in a good way the
other thing that the purple pattern adds
is the serviceworker you might be
thinking that service workers are about
handling offline and while it does allow
you to do that that's not the primary
benefit for most end-users service
workers matter because they let you
deliver reliable performance because
they can handle the top level resource
and always return something from the
cash you can dramatically improve the
performance of your apps when you use
service workers this way that huge
variability in network conditions it
evaporates when you've done this so this
is a chart that Eric bittleman gathered
from this year's i/o site it's also a
progressive web app but with Fawna 1.0
but as you can see from the giant dark
green spike when the serviceworker is
active the distribution of load times
moves hard to the left and that's a good
thing this is very literally what faster
looks like I'm seeing a lot of teams try
to add service workers as some sort of
transparent pass-through thing using a
network first approach don't do that
please don't do that use the purple
pattern and make sure that your
top-level app shell
never depends on the network if you do
that you can compete with native apps on
the experience that you deliver if you
saw Darren's keynote this morning you
saw exactly that with the keynote tech
the CNET tech today PWA if you don't do
that though you will never match their
performance until recently it sort of
difficult to verify in an automated way
that your service workers installing and
the rest of your progressive about
properties are actually met correctly
you've heard a lot about lighthouse but
please put it in your seal I put it in
your continuous integration system and
let it tell you how you're doing so I
think it's safe to say that mobile is
much much harder than we've collectively
understood it to be to make good apps in
this environment we need to change our
outlook our tools and most of all our
priorities and the fastest way I know to
get in touch with that that ground truth
is to test unreal hardware so please if
you don't already have a circa 2014 ish
Android phone go ahead and buy something
like a moto G 4 if you can use one of
these and chrome inspect on dev tools
you'll find yourself in touch with how
it really feels to be at the median if
you can get something worse like this is
an Android one from last year you
probably can't buy one they get
something worse if you can um and if you
can't afford any of those please use
webpagetest.org
to select from the list of real mobile
devices that are sitting in Iraq at your
disposal to test your URLs and whatever
you do implement as much of the purple
pattern as you can Sam will fill you in
in the details so stay tuned for that
and lastly lighthouse and chrome
telemetry are potent weapons in your
ability to not regress on keeping sure
that you're doing the right thing I want
to apologize for being a bit of a downer
today usually I'm telling you about how
good pwace are and how great the
experience is that you can deliver and
that's all true and there is good news
and that it's that modern web technology
makes it possible to build truly amazing
experiences but it will require ditching
or radically reworking the way that
we're using these slow by default tools
Addie's got a whole talk tomorrow about
what kind of elbow grease you really do
have to put in if you've bought into one
of today's major frameworks but no I
think now that the challenge is much
larger than you probably thought it was
now that you know I'm actually very
confident that the folks in this room
and on the live stream are going to
internalize this and use it to make
really great
