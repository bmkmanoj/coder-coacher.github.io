chrome dev summit I am an engineer on
the chrome security team and my
colleagues and I on the security team
are on a mission to be honest with the
people using our software about their
connection security and we need the help
of you all the developers in this room
to do that the first way that I'm going
to ask you to help us out is to do a
little thought exercise where you put
yourself in the shoes of an average web
user so probably not a developer maybe
someone who is even new to computers or
new to the web and if you were this
average web user looking at this omnibox
which is what chrome shows when you
visit an insecure plain HTTP site in
chrome today if you were this average
web user what might this omnibox say to
you you can see it kind of has the
hostname of the site and it has this
sort of neutral informational icon right
so if you were seeing this what would
this mean about the site that you're
visiting as an average web user you
probably wouldn't realize that an
attacker is sitting between the web
browser between your computer and the
web server can read any data that's
passing back and forth between the two
of you so that could be sensitive
sensitive data like passwords credit
cards health content all of the stuff
you probably don't want an attacker
sitting between your computer in the web
server to read or as an average web user
looking at this omnibox you probably
wouldn't you realize that even though
the omnibox says example.com that's not
necessarily who you're actually talking
to over insecure HTTP you don't actually
have that guarantee at all you could be
talking to any attacker who's
impersonating example.com and that's
probably pretty unintuitive to average
web user who looks at the omnibox and
sees example.com
and finally this average web user
probably wouldn't realize that any
attacker is sitting between your
computer in the web server can modify or
tamper with content that's going back
and forth between them that tampering
could be to inject ads perhaps
overwriting your legitimate ads it could
be to insert some fake or malicious
content it could even be to trick the
user into downloading or installing
malware so if this was your site with
this attacker modifying or tampering
with your content this is obviously very
bad for your users right they're
probably getting a poor user experience
they might even be being tricked into
downloading malware and it's bad for
your site it's bad for your brand it's
bad for your revenue you're not
delivering the legitimate good user
experience that you want to deliver and
these risks are real they happen every
single day in coffee shop Wi-Fi Internet
service providers injecting ads software
like Firesheep that makes it really
really easy to to passively sniff on
unencrypted session cookies these things
happen they're real they're probably
affecting your users and the way to
protect your users from that is to use
HTTPS these risks are why we on the
Chrome security team are on this mission
to fix this UI which we don't think as
being particularly honest or forthcoming
about what it means to use insecure HTTP
what we plan to do in the future is not
this sort of neutral presentation but a
presentation that actually delivers a
warning to the user the risks that
they're taking by using insecure HTTP so
in this talk I'm going to tell you about
our mission to use this to get to a
place where we can use this warning UI
to be honest with our users about their
connection security and how and why you
as developers should help us with that
today I'm gonna be telling you about
some newly released metrics about the
honest state of HTTP usage in the world
today and those metrics will hopefully
help motivate why and how you as
developers should help us move the web
to a place where it's HTTPS by default
because it's good for you and your user
it's just good for your site and it's
also good for the web as a whole and
finally I'll be previewing some upcoming
chrome UI changes that illustrate our
strategy which is to gently prod
developers like you into adopting HTTPS
while simultaneously kind of using our
users into the idea that HTTP is
probably not what they want to be using
in the spirit of honesty I'm gonna start
by telling you about a section that we
added last week to the Google
transparency report the Google
transparency report if you haven't seen
it before is a collection of all sorts
of interesting and useful data about
Google and about the internet as a whole
and for most of this year we've had a
section on this transparency report
that's devoted to HTTPS very interesting
data but up until now it's mostly
focused on HTTPS usage at Google so on
Google services Google traffic and also
on some of the top sites tracking this
data has been pretty encouraging since
we launched the transparency report the
HTTPS version of the transparency report
in February we've seen 12 more of the
top sites adopt modern HTTPS but this is
not necessarily the full picture right
because what are the top sites what does
that actually mean for people who are
using Chrome every day that's why last
week we released a new section in the
transparency report that releases data
about HTTPS usage as Chrome users see it
one of the milestones that we passed
recently as you can see here is that on
desktop platforms chrome users now load
over 50 percent of their pages over
HTTPS
this is a big milestone and overall
we're pretty happy about the trend here
which is that HTTPS usage when when you
look at that as percent of pages that
chrome Chrome users load slowly but
steadily increasing that's what we want
to see I mean obviously we want to see
faster increase but slow but steady
we'll take it another way to look at it
is not the percent of pages that are
loaded over HTTPS but the percentage of
time spent and as you can see from this
graph this is an even more optimistic
way to look at it because Chrome users
spend on desktop platforms about 75% or
more of their time on HTTPS we don't
necessarily know why this is for sure
but one way you can think of it is that
users probably spend more time on sites
like Gmail or Facebook or your super
engaging progressive web apps than they
do when they're just googling around for
some information clicking a link
navigating away so we think that users
spend most of their browsing time on
sort of heavy-duty apps that for the
most part our top sites using HTTP I
also want to make a quick note about
Android usage which you might have
noticed in both of these graphs is this
Green Line it's kind of an outlier down
at the bottom again we don't know why
this is for sure but one one hypothesis
we have is that on Android this sort of
serious web browsing on Gmail Facebook
things like that that stuff that Android
users are doing in apps
so from Chrome's perspective they see
more of the non HTTPS traffic and less
of the traffic that tends to be HTTP
that Android users tend to do in apps so
again that's just a hypothesis but we
think it kind of makes sense and it
means that as the mobile web becomes
more and more engaging as you all build
building and gain traction on your
progressive web apps we would hope to
see this line kind of continuing to go
up and hopefully catch up with desktop
so this is great news developers like
you are adopting HTTPS you might be
wondering why what what is driving this
slow but steady increase in HTTPS usage
we can't tell you for sure but I want to
pull out a few few things that we hear
over and over again anecdotally from
developers who are transitioning their
sites to HTTPS first modern browsers
like Chrome and Firefox and others are
restricting usage of powerful features
over insecure HTTP some features have
already been deprecated are already not
available over insecure HTTP and some
some will be restricted in the in the
near future so these are things like
geolocation service workers push
notifications the payments and
credential management API is all sorts
of things that you've heard about today
that you need to build a progressive web
app are increasingly only available over
HTTPS so we're not doing this to be mean
we think it makes sense and that it's
the best thing to give our users more
control over their privacy and devices
and data and I think this is easiest
understood with an example like
geolocation because if a website wants
access to my location and if I grant
them access to my location then I'm
giving them information about
potentially where I live where I work
where I shop where I go to the doctor
what I do on my weekends all sorts of
things that it's pretty privacy
sensitive information for a website to
have and that may be fine I may be
perfectly happy sharing my location with
some website but I can't really make
that a meaningful decision unless I know
which website I'm talking to and that's
exactly the guarantee that HTTPS gives
you which is why we are increasingly
restricting access to these privacy
sensitive powerful features unless the
user actually knows which site they're
talking to
as I said Chrome is not the only browser
doing this and just one other example is
Firefox in this blog post they actually
announced that they are eventually
planning to require HTTPS for all new
features so this is something that
browsers are pretty much United around
the the hope that it makes sense that if
you're going to grant access to privacy
sensitive information or a powerful
feature the user should know which
website they're granting that access to
we think this is one of the drivers
behind HTTPS adoption because we hear it
from developers one example of this is
the BBC which cited these restrictions
on powerful features as one of the
reasons that they decided to move
bbc.co.uk/topgear another consideration
that we think is behind the slow but
steady increase in HTTPS usage is that
HTTPS performance is getting better and
better every day and it's no longer kind
of the bottleneck that it maybe once was
ten or fifteen years ago what you're
seeing here is a website built by by
built by one of my colleagues ilya
grigorik it's called is TLS fast yet
calm TLS being the the protocol
underlying HTTPS so the answer is yes
but that's not just what this website
tells you it tells you about all of the
performance improvements and
enhancements that are coming out every
day with HTTPS and it tells you how to
configure your server with them and
which servers support them so it's a
great source of information about HTTPS
performance I want to draw a particular
attention to HTTP 2 which is the next
version of HTTP and offers a whole suite
of web performance improvements but it
is critical in this talk because HTTP 2
is only available if you're also using
HTTPS so what we hear from developer
is that in the case that they do
encounter some performance hit when they
move to HTTPS it can often be offset
more than offset by the performance
advantages that they unlock using things
that are only available over HTTPS like
HTTP - so these are some of the things
these restrictions on powerful features
the improvements in HTTP performance
these are some of the examples of what
we think is driving this slow but steady
increase in HTTP adoption but while
things are moving in the right direction
we still have a gap to close and we need
your help doing that we need your help
by adopting HTTPS on your site so that
we can get as close as possible to HTTPS
Everywhere and we need that we need to
be as close as possible to HTTPS
Everywhere if we're going to get to the
place we want to be where we're honest
with our users about connection security
my point here is that if we were to
tomorrow turn on this warning state that
we want to have where we do this kind of
scary read dangerous warning indicator
on insecure HTTP if we were to just turn
that on tomorrow it would probably be a
little bit counterproductive users would
see it everywhere they'd see it all the
time they'd learn to ignore it they'd
have to ignore it to kind of use the web
and they've kind of get trained to
basically just not see it so that's not
what we want we want it to be the case
that insecure HTTP is a pretty rare
occurrence so rare that when the user
encounters it we can show them this
warning and they will pay attention they
won't be scared or confused or
habituated they will see it they'll pay
attention and they'll understand the
risks of the situation that they're in
where they don't have any guarantees
against attackers reading their content
or injecting malicious content or any of
those risks that I talked about at the
beginning of the talk so that's what
we're asking of you we're asking you to
adopt HTTPS on your site it helps you
and your users in your site and it also
helps us in our mission to make the
whole web more secure to make users more
educated and to make their activity on
the web less of a risk for them but we
know this is not always easy for
developers it can be overwhelming and
that's why we at chrome and at Google
and then other organizations are
mobilizing a lot of support and
investment around helping you transition
your site to HTTPS one of the
organizations that is becoming critical
in this in this movement is called let's
encrypt let's encrypt is a certificate
authority a certificate being a
cryptographic proof of identity that you
need in order to use HTTPS it's the
thing the cryptographic proof that
proves that you your site is who you say
it is if you say your example.com you
get a certificate proving that your
example.com and that's what gives your
users the guarantee that their browsers
are actually talking to the real
example.com historically getting
certificates has not always been easy
and it's not always been free but thanks
to the work of organizations like let's
encrypt it's now possible for you to get
a certificate very quickly with no money
and they also provide easy command-line
tools for automating the management and
renewal of your certificates so we think
this was a critical part of internet in
which infrastructure going forwards
chrome has made a large donation to
let's encrypt and users are funding it
as well because it's becoming such a
core reliable part a core part of their
their the process of running a web
application that they've come to come to
depend on and in case you don't believe
me that let's encrypt is here to stay I
think you can see it just in the numbers
this is a critical part of Internet
infrastructure that is really going to
change the way that people do HTTP it
already has
looking internally a little bit more at
croman at Google one of the ways that
HTTPS sometimes worries developers if ad
revenue and if you haven't heard about
this concern before it might seem a
little bit random what do ads have to do
with HTTPS the connection is that when
you move your site to HTTPS you have to
move all of your content all of your
third party party resources including
ads in order for your site to work
properly so developers are often worried
about having to move their site to HTTPS
needing to move all their ads to HTTPS
and therefore losing ad revenue from ads
that are only available over HTTP to
help alleviate this concern all google
source ads are already served over HTTPS
so when you move your site to HTTPS you
will not have a revenue hit from Google
source ads because you they are already
available over HTTPS and this is backed
up by developers in the wild the
Washington Post move to HTTPS recently
and saw no hidden revenue from their
from their Google sourced ads another
Google service that people sometimes
worry about when moving to HTTPS is
losing search ranking because any time
you make a large change to your site
like this you should make sure you
follow the proper steps to to make sure
you don't you minimize the disruption to
your organic search traffic these are
some of the questions that people have
how to move their site do they do it all
at once do they do a little bit at a
time
what kind of fluctuation should they
expect and more technical aspects of the
move like what do they do in the
robots.txt and their sitemaps and how do
they tell Google that they're moving to
HTTPS and all those sorts of things what
we're doing in this space is expanding
and improving upon documentation and we
we really like to hear from developers
about how how what their questions are
so that we can answer them publicly
these two FA cues I recommend people all
the time they're just lists of questions
that people have with very straight for
practical advice answering some of the
questions I had on the previous slides
and we also have a web fundamentals
guide that walks you through the process
of setting up and configuring HTTP
performance tuning things like that and
also has a section on how to how to
handle your transition from the
perspective of Google search ranking
Cena was able to move to HTTPS with as
you can see minimal disruption to their
to their search rankings so we are
hopeful that we have improved the
documentation to such an extent that if
you just do a little bit of research and
follow the steps and the documentation
that we provide this isn't a traumatic
thing for your search ranking it really
shouldn't be finely nearest and dearest
to my heart and I could spend a whole
whole talk talking about web platform
and browser tools that we're building
and sometimes standardizing and
evangelizing in other browsers to help
developers like you move to HTTPS these
are things that I work on pretty much
every day and I just want to give one
example which is the dev tools security
panel so if you if you open if you move
your site to HTTPS and you open it up in
dev tools and you go to the security
panel here here you'll see that it's
designed to basically help you figure
out if you've done it right if you have
any problems if you if you've made any
mistakes in your transition to HTTPS
it'll help you try to figure out what
they are and tell you how to fix them
these tools are ways that we at chrome
in at Google want to guide developers
into using HTTPS on their sites but
simultaneously we're planning to start
easing users into the idea that HTTP is
bad because we want to get to eventually
a place where enough developers are
using HTTPS that we can really warn
users when they're when they have a lack
of connection security on insecure HTTP
and we don't want to just jolt them into
that world right away we want to kind of
ease them into this into this
association between HTTP and bad
this is the new UI treatment that we'll
be using for some insecure HTTP sites in
chrome 56 which goes to stable in
January so you can see we're still doing
kind of a neutral informational icon but
we're adding the not secure text to
start to educate users about what it
means to be using insecure HTTP and
we'll be specifically launching this for
HTTP pages that have passwords or credit
card inputs on them so our goal here is
to use passwords and credit cards as a
signal that the user might be in a
particularly sensitive situation in
which they want to be particularly
careful with their data and in which
it's especially important to warn them
about the risks of insecure HTTP so this
feature is still in development so I
want to stress that it's subject to
change but you can go try it out in
Chrome Canary today and we would love
for you to do that both to report bugs
to see what it's like browsing the web
with this feature on I find it really
interesting to see what it's like a
glimpse of browsing the web in the
future and and also to try it out on
your site and see if your site will have
this UI applied to it if you're not
using HTTPS yet so to do this you just
go download and install Chrome Canary if
you haven't already go to Chrome colon
slash slash flags and find this mark and
on secure as flag and flip it to the
option that says something about
passwords and credit cards on on an HTTP
page so if you do this and then you go
browse around the web or browse around
your site you may see that we're doing
as I said we're detecting when a
password or a credit card field appears
on the page and using that to trigger
this not secure warning in the omnibox
so we really encourage you to try this
out try out your own site if you're not
using HTTPS and if you find that your
users will see this not secure warning
come January maybe you want to start
using HTTPS by then
our hope is that this does help
incentivize developers like you to move
to HTTPS and also starts to sort of
build the association in users minds
between entering sensitive data and the
lack of security of HTTP so fortunately
it's not just about negative indicators
we have sticks and we also have carrots
if you if you download Chrome 55 beta
we're already using this secure this
secure chip for sites that are using
HTTPS so it's not just that you'll get a
not secure warning if you have a
password or credit card on HTTP if you
adopt HTTPS you get this shiny green
badge next to your site telling users
that hey you you are using a secure
connection so we hope this provides some
incentive to adopt HTTPS in addition to
all the other benefits that you get like
the privacy and security benefits for
your users and the the ability to to use
powerful features like geolocation and
serviceworker is that you get with HTTPS
so that's the glimpse of the very near
future these secure warnings for secure
sites and starting to show not secure
warnings which is closer to honest truth
about HTTP for some sites in chrome 56
but this is where we're going we hope to
get here as soon as possible to a place
where the web is as close as possible to
HTTPS Everywhere so that we can be fully
honest and truthful with our users about
what insecure HTTP means one of the
things that we're considering doing in
the future is sort of gradually picking
more and more signals so in chrome 56
it'll be passwords and credit card
fields maybe in the future it might be
something like when the user is in
incognito mode or when the user is
downloading a file over HTTP things like
that more and more signals to kind of
drag gradually gradually make an
assumption that the user is in a
potentially sensitive situation
to warn them more and more aggressively
about the insecurity of HTTP until we
get to the world that we want to be in
so the theme of my talk today has been
honesty the new transparency report
metrics show an honest picture of the
world when it comes to HTTPS usage it
shows that we're moving in the right
direction we have a slow but steady
increase but we need your help
closing the gap by adopting HTTPS on
your site which we think is good for you
for your revenue your brand your user
experience it's good for your users
privacy and security and it's also good
for the web as a whole the whole
ecosystem by helping us get to a point
where we can be fully honest and
truthful with the people using Chrome
about their connection security thank
you and enjoy the rest of the summit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
