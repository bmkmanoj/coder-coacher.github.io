show so today I wanted to talk a little
bit about screen readers screen readers
are super important for many of our
users out there but I know a lot of
developers are not familiar with these
pieces of technology and that's kind of
a bummer because screen readers are
actually pretty easy to pick up and if
you're using a computer like a Mac
you've already got a screen reader
built-in for free so what I wanted to do
today was focus on the screen reader
that comes with the Macintosh computer
and then in next episode we'll look at
some free screen reader options for
Windows users so on the Mac the screen
reader that we've got built in is called
voiceover and if you follow me over here
to my laptop I'm gonna go to my system
preferences I'm gonna go to the
accessibility setting right here and
then there's a tab zoom in a little bit
so yes there's this little tab over here
for voiceover and click on that and
there's a few options that we have to
actually activate voiceover we could go
and just check this checkbox and our
laptop and start talking and we would be
like whoa I don't know what's going on
or we could go down here - voiceover
training now I highly recommend everyone
take maybe about 20 minutes to go
through this I'm gonna kind of give you
like an abbreviated version so I'll turn
the sound on my laptop let's see well
zoom back out a little bit we're gonna
open up Boise over training and this is
just gonna guide us through some of the
fundamentals of using the screen reader
okay so I'm just gonna I'm gonna talk
over this dude a little bit here you
know what I'm gonna mute you for a
second so when we open this up it's
gonna be really really big text and
that's because screen readers are often
used by folks who might not be
completely blind but they might have low
vision so we want to make sure the text
is large enough for them to read and
that's just going to present some
instructions it's about 22 little slides
that you can click through so it doesn't
take long at all and it's basically just
gonna walk you through some of the basic
control keys for voice-over
now I'm gonna give you the the cheat
sheet version when you turn voiceover on
your Mac really there's only a handful
of keys that most developers are going
to need to know the first thing is this
idea of the voiceover or the V
Oh modifier key which on Macintosh is
ctrl alt so not command all that ctrl
alt so all throughout the instructions
you'll see it referencing the things
where it says like press vo - right
arrow so that always means just press
ctrl alt right arrow to navigate the
page very easily you can use ctrl right
arrow that'll just kind of move you
around the screen if you want to move by
something like headings which I'll
demonstrate a bit later you can use ctrl
alt command H it'll just jump through
the major headings in your document and
you can also use ctrl alt spacebar to
click on things and really those three
keys are gonna get you pretty far if
you're just sort of testing and auditing
your website to make sure it you know
has some some decent functionality you
can just use that handful of commands to
get most of what you need so let me show
you example of actually using this we're
gonna go ahead to this little section
here which has a few controls down at
the bottom it's a little small I can't
really zoom in that easily on this but
uh but bear with me here
and what I'm gonna do is click this
start practice button and as soon as I
do that it's gonna it's going to turn
voiceover on my laptop so I'm gonna stop
talking and we'll just sort of like
follow what's going on on the screen so
volume on ok so it started saying a
bunch of things I'm actually going to
hit the ctrl key and anytime you hit the
ctrl key that basically tells voiceover
just stop talking sometimes what it
likes to do if it's sort of sitting
idling on the screen it'll just sort of
like start talking again and remind you
of where you are which can be kind of
annoying so right now what it's saying
is that we are focused on this one radio
button control and we're going to use
the vo keys ctrl alt and the right arrow
to move to the next control and we keep
hitting ctrl alt right arrow to move
down to this section of settings I'm
just going to hit ctrl to tell it to be
quiet
now if I want to click on this checkbox
I can use the vo and spacebar
check box and when you do that it's
basically like a simulated mouse click
so you know if you have a click handler
for instance it would get triggered by
that control space key you might have
noticed that my my screen reader was
reading a little fast if you want to
change the rate that voiceover speaks
that you can hit Control Alt command up
60% 65% or down 60% you can also hit
Control Alt left and right to sort of
move through various other options so
volume intonation you can change the
speaker right so you can have a Bruce or
Fred Kathy okay I usually stick with
Alex with Alex Alex he's my man so I
think we've covered it all the sort of
the fun of middles we just sort of
moving around why don't we try this on
an actual website now so I'm going to
hit ah here yeah good shortcut command
f5 to turn voiceover off command f5 is
also how you turn it on oh wait sorry I
gotta get out of this tutorial
command f5 there we go
turn it on and off command f5 is a very
very useful command it's also one of
those things which if you've ever hung
out at like the Apple Genius Bar people
accidentally hit that all the time and
bring their laptops to the Genius Bar to
be like I don't know what's happening
they could stop so command f5 in case
one of your relatives like sits on their
laptop or something and has a freak out
at Christmas command f5 ok so let's go
and actually look at an actual website
so I'm gonna go to Wikipedia Wikipedia
has really really nice accessibility
we're just gonna look up look up Google
itself the company ok and now there's a
lot of information on this page and one
way that you could imagine someone using
a screen reader is they just turn it on
and they just start moving laterally
through everything so let's try that and
see what that's like control there's a
lot of stop talking oftentimes when you
open a website you need to hit ctrl alt
shift
down that will tell voiceover I would
like to interact with this this page
right now otherwise it's gonna try and
move you through the rest of like the
Mac UI which you don't want you want to
actually interact with what's in Chrome
and then we're gonna hit ctrl alt right
arrow and the vo right arrow keys to
just move through all the content okay
so that that was like slow I have not
even gotten into the the main meat of
the article yet and I'm already kind of
tired of clicking on this thing and so
what we found was through a recent
survey conducted by Hayden works or
Hayden Pickering I think it's this last
name really cool developers does a lot
of cool accessibility work he sent out a
survey to ask screenreader users how do
you typically navigate the page and the
overwhelming response is most people
initially when they first land on a page
navigate by headings so remember to do
that we hit ctrl alt command H so let's
see if this makes our experience a bit
more efficient okay cool so I feel like
that was sort of a more productive way
to move through the document one thing
you might notice is sometimes as we're
moving through a web page voiceover will
not scroll the screen for us all the
time if we're just like jumping around
by heading and so if you just hit ctrl
alt right arrow it'll start to kind of
jump down to the to the text content
itself it actually you know if you're if
you're using a screen reader it kind of
doesn't matter if it's not scrolling but
if you are you know a sighted user and
you're trying to debug something
sometimes you have to fiddle with it a
little bit to make it actually scroll
and move how you want it to another
really interesting thing that we can do
here this is sort of like a like like
the uber shortcut is we can hit ctrl alt
U and that's going to open what's known
as the rotor and the rotor is a menu
just full of options relating to the
current thing that you're interacting
with so I'll hit ctrl alt U and I'll hit
the right arrow and we can just flip
through a bunch of different options for
the page all the tables all the
landmarks so html5 landmark elements
things like main article aside the
reason why those elements are important
is for things like this it actually
someone just jump directly to your
navigation all the links all the
headings etc so this is a really really
useful tool the the rotor just to you
know if you jump around kind of like a
power user now the last thing that I
want to show off related to the screen
reader is when the screen reader kind of
misbehaves a little bit let's say I'm
just writing some code maybe I'm running
some body copy and I've got the word
Udacity here so I'll bump this up a
little bit it's easier to read so I just
got a pee tag here with the word Udacity
in it okay let me preview this now in my
browser and let's see what the screen
reader actually announces so we got the
word Udacity there we will flip on
voiceover let's let's hear what it says
saying Udacity it said Buddha City or
you know some other weird amalgamation
of that word you'll often times see this
with a screen reader with sort of like
you know complex words it just tries its
best but it probably doesn't pronounce
it as you would like it to you it's
tempting to go in and try and crack the
screen reader or work around this
behavior so maybe I might go in and
replace the word you dude acity or
Udacity I might use something like an
aria-label aria-label basically tells
the screen reader what to say and I
might give it like some phonetic text
like Udacity so let's see let's see what
that pronounces okay so it was like a
bit closer but by the way did you notice
the on-screen text there inside the
write actually like printed the words
Udacity or whatever that that weird
phonetic spelling it's important to note
that if you're working around
screenreader pronunciation by adding
phonetics and things like that that
might seem cool for someone using a
screen reader but if you have a user
who's using a Braille reader now the
word Udacity for them is gonna be
Udacity or whatever it's gonna just be
some some gibberish
so in general when the screen reader is
acting up you don't want to try and work
around its behavior don't try and
corrected what we found from folks who
rely on screen readers is that
overwhelmingly they prefer that you just
like leave the quirks in place they are
used to the way that the tool works
already and so when you try and correct
it you can actually make the experience
worse for other users of different kinds
of assistive technology okay so we've
covered a lot today that about covers
the basics of getting rolling with
voiceover in the next episode I want to
talk about some free screen readers for
Windows and then I actually want to move
on to talking about mobile screen
readers because accessibility on mobile
is super super super important and it's
one of those areas that I definitely
feel like it's under explored but if you
have any questions on what we talked
about today please leave them for me
down below in the comments or as always
you can hit me up on a social network of
your choosing
that's it and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
