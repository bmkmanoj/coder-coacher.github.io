today about some experiences we've had
at slack with shipping a cross platform
whatever to see product and some of the
things we've learned so although it's
not the main subject of the talk I
wonder I thought would be interesting to
go through a brief architecture tour so
you can see we have two clients here
connecting to a media server and all of
our calls actually go through a media
server even one the one calls just to
stuff quickly through how a client makes
a call and the slack architecture first
talks to a region server to understand
where it is in which media server it's
going to connect to it then makes some
API calls to the slack REST API where
the call state is stored in the same
database that the rest of the slack
clients store stayed in that API call
returns certain IDs and which media
server to talk to in tokens and so on
and then the rest of the call stuff that
goes through the media server and so the
call is established the only other kind
of slack specific interesting thing to
note is that some of the clients state
is updated via the real-time messaging
API but today I mainly want to talk
about client-side development and our
approach to it so in terms of client
platforms on browser we support Chrome
desktop Mac Windows and Linux and a
mobile iOS and Android and so you've
seen a diagram similar to this before
but this is just like a super simple
breakdown of a Robert C client stack you
have a UI layer application logic and
signaling layer and then native over to
sea layer on the bottom so as part of
this I'm also assuming you've rolled
your own work but to see binaries and as
we've heard several times that's not
gonna be the right path for everyone but
that's the path that we've taken and
that's what I'm going to assume as we go
along here and the part I really want to
talk to you about is the middle layer
the application logic and signaling
layer and it's API with the the UI layer
I love it so first a bit of history
about slack audio calls we launched in
April of this year and one of the
platforms we launched on was a slack Mac
native app and this app is based on Mac
app which is basically a WebKit wrapper
so it's like a single site browser
container to run the slack web app and
the interesting bit here as far as
calling was concerned is that it's
although it is very browser like it
didn't have any weapon these-- in it so
we already knew haven't got launched in
this platform that we'd be building her
own where with you c c++ barberries so
that was a given the this is a diagram
of kind of the split between the browser
and the desktop native app applications
so the top layer is a shared JavaScript
UI code layer which calls down into
either JavaScript or C++ depending on
whether it's browser a desktop and
further down into WebRTC either the
browser-based one or the native one that
we've rolled ourselves so these two when
we were developing this product these
two were developed in tandem and that
works fine because it was the same team
developing everything so this pink band
I've put on here which will come back a
few times is to represent the
application logic and that's actually as
you can see here it's was spread between
the kind of wrapper layer and the UI
code layer and again that works fine
because it was the same team doing this
whole development so we didn't have a
very like precise interface between the
application logic in the UI code but
that was okay over to find the API
between the the web woodsy wrapper and
the UI code was pretty low-level
consists of a few weakly typed methods
passing JSON messages directly from our
media server so again not like not
really like clearly defined layers
things were kind of spread out and now
we're fun but trouble appeared as we
expand its mobile because it was not our
team any longer developing the UI code
so we had this application logic that
was spread out into the UI layer and
the mobile platform teams and of having
to re-implement a lot of that and do a
lot of parsing of raw JSON messages from
the media server that they might not
care about and so we ended up launching
on mobile in this state but it
definitely slowed progress and adding
features later would continue to be
costly so this is a different view based
on kind of like in the work of the slack
teams so the calls team is vending the
C++ library to the various platform
client teams and again this is showing
like this repeated application logic
being reimplemented on by the various
teams so we launched in the state but
afterwards decided to reimagine the
approach so what we took a step back and
said what is the ideal cross-platform
design is in this context we want
ideally to write once and run anywhere
this has a few benefits you can
consolidate your features and more
importantly probably here your bugs in
one place and it insulates platform
developers or client developers from
details they shouldn't have to care
about we're working in a very complex
domain and the Java and objective-c
developers probably don't want to have
to care about all the Webber DC stuff so
it's great if you can insulate them from
that the second thing is to provide a
natural API to the developers something
that they can interact with very easily
so ideally you would give them something
that's exposed in the language they're
working with so platform specific
language bindings
another thing we another goal we had was
to make it strongly typed so rather than
passing JSON messages around actually
have strong types that we could have
forced to let us move a certain class of
errors from runtime errors to compile
time errors and so this is just the same
diagram again moving all the application
logic to the wrapper layer that our team
is implementing and again the view where
we do all the stuff that we should be
doing so what do we decide to do we
continue to write the application logic
in C++ a few reasons for this
the native ever the C libs are in C++ so
and we're building those and so whatever
we do we're gonna have to be calling
down into that language so keeping it in
the same language makes some sense but
also if you're writing a modern C++ it's
actually a fairly painless experience
dare I say occasionally delightful if
you if all you remember of C++ is like
your grandfather's or grandmother's C++
then have another look at it it's it's
come a long way so that was
implementation and on top of that we had
or we do have an API written in draw
boxes genie this is a tool at Dropbox
open sourced in 2014 and it's built for
this exact task it uses a simple
interface definition language which is
language agnostic to generate bindings
for Java and objective-c and it handles
so it generates Javan Objective C and
C++ on the backend side and also handles
all the data marshalling between the
languages so it it's turned out to work
really well
some just before I dive into geni a bit
more some alternatives we considered we
looked at RPC frameworks one benefit or
the main benefit is that they offer the
same kind of cross-platform API
generation and data marshalling but
turns out not really to be a great fit
for the domain it's not designed they're
typically not designed for running in
process which makes sense given the
usual applications maybe G RPC it might
offer this eventually and I think the
javelin plantation has an improv server
right now but it's it's not quite there
yet and another problem is that they can
be really heavyweight thrift in
particular generates a lot of classes
and on Android that can you come up
problems they and even the Microsoft
project called 50 intended for Android
to reduce the number of classes that get
produced by thrifty
okay so jumping back into the genie I
just want to give a quick example of
what it looks like so here's a super
simple interface you can write with two
methods one of them static - to actually
create the interface beside the
interface keyword you can see a plus C
that means the
interface will be implemented in C++ and
callable from Java and objective-c and
so the the second two boxes you can see
the Java generated code and the
objective-c generated code so these are
just the interfaces what you don't see
here is a bunch of an intermediate code
that handles all the data marshalling
down to C++ and and vice versa and so
for anyone who's had to write Jay and I
by hand before you can imagine how nice
it is to have a tool that just does it
here's another example this is a
callback interface so you can see
there's a + om + J beside the interface
keyword and this means it'll be
implemented in Objective C and Java and
we can call it from C++ and this is the
C++ generated code that you get that's
callable from your back-end library so a
current count
Jeanne's generated more than 5,000 lines
of boilerplate code for us which is
awesome and even more important than
just like the raw number is that as we
make changes the interface we don't have
to sift through all the code and and you
know redo all the plumbing and
everything it's just like totally done
for us so so it's worked out really well
there's a few I'm gonna say caveats but
things we learned along the way sorry
there we go
what level of abstraction should you
choose for the API and this might be it
probably is obvious in retrospect but it
wasn't to us at the beginning but did
become very clear that we should base it
around UI events and actions so they'll
be layout differences of course in the
different platforms but the essential
call UI elements are retained across all
the platforms and so it becomes very
natural for the platform developers to
interact with the library this way you
know like a user makes an action clicks
a button or something and we call method
X on the library we have some callback
method and that results in the platform
code making some UI update so when you
start to think of it in this terms the
natural API emerges from what you're
trying to do this is just an example of
some more genie code I only put it here
to note that we kind of in the
documentation we have actually UI
suggestions along with the events so the
idea being that we like encourage
I mean beyond the design specs we
actually like when the implementation is
happening I encourage the developers to
to make the same kinds of UI updates on
the various platforms another lesson
learned throughout threading models
always assume that the UI thread is
hitting the library this might not
always be the case
at least but in our case it is and so
definitely make all methods heavy
methods asynchronous so you never
blocking the UI thread we ended up
deciding to make all methods async just
to make the threading model easier and
that's what you see an example of here
so every method call into the library
just post to a background thread another
threading model type tip is that the JVM
gets upset when it's accessed by non
Java creative threads so you need to
provide a mechanism for C++ to create
Java threads whenever those are going to
be calling back into Java and some good
resources around this stuff Genie has a
project called mx3 which is great for
showing best practices and they even
have good implementations of some useful
objects like a thread launcher that
handles the creating platform threads
that I just discussed and UI thread
event loops for posting back to the
platform UI threads another great
resource is the mobile C++ slack
community team it's a great place to log
on there some questions I'm on there
there's some Genie maintainer that are
on there so you can probably get your
questions answered if you go there I
wanted to show quick case study so this
plot is of call survey results for
Android clients so at the end of a
random sampling of calls we give a
survey and ask the user what they
thought about the call with a few
options I've eliminated everything
besides the top two answers so
disconnects are bad of course and okay
means like yeah the call was fine we
released this library in 2:19 the 2:19
version of the android client and you
can see that disconnects went down
considerably and at the same time the
okay
raining
quite a bit and so we weren't expecting
this we were like hey what happened and
I attributed it actually to we ended up
part of the application logic that was
implemented in the Android UI layer was
stuff early connections and it's tricky
stuff deciding when to do this properly
we have some like very precise rules
around it and so I think when we brought
that back into our C++ library and how
to implemented by people who like were
intimately familiar with the details of
it we basically do the better and this
is not to say like hey those guys are
horrible or whatever but just that when
you bring things into your problem
domain you have a better chance of doing
it right than having to like communicate
requirements of people who might not
understand them beforehand so that was a
very positive result of of launching
this so alternative architectures as
you've heard today there are a lot of
different ways you can approach this but
there are two that are kind of most
exciting in my mind one is the one I
described today the C++ in geni approach
and the other is hybrid apps using
javascript and and react native or
something like it and I think the choice
comes down to mainly what your existing
code base is like so like do you have
Javan Objective C mobile apps already
then probably what I'm describing now is
going to be a good choice but if you
have like a web root C web app today and
are considering expanding a mobile then
I think the JavaScript and react native
approach is really exciting okay but you
might accuse me of being a liar we'd
still have to write it twice because we
have this browser implementation and we
have to write the JavaScript too and
yeah that's true
that is true but we kind of have a plan
it's called in scripting and it's a C+
opposed to JavaScript transpiler we have
some patches on top of geni that will
produce and script and bindings for us
from the genie I do
and you know it's we have this kind of
hand wavy plan not actually developed
but if it works it really will be kind
of a write once run anywhere thing so we
haven't develop this yet but if we end
up doing it I'm sure we'll wear the blog
post or something so stay tuned thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
