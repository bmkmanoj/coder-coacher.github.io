friday i'll try and keep the pace up and
i'm here to talk about the future of
ortc with web RTC and I'd like to thank
Justin and Serge for fabulous segue that
they gave me to to this subject now if I
can get the click or go in here I'll be
golden I'm good here so just a little
bit about hook flash and who we are hook
flashes the founder chair and editor of
ortc were kind of the guilty party for
causing some of the confusion that has
existed around this but we thought it
was a critically important issue and
we're we've been focused on it for I
look probably the better part of the
last two years we're a distributed
virtual team of developers and engineers
with guys currently in US Canada and
Serbia our technology focus is very
predominantly on ortc and we also have
done extensive work on new web RTC
signaling security and identity protocol
with a technology we have called open
pier we work with large enterprise
customers technology service providers
and carriers on the new buzzword in
enterprises digital transformation with
real-time communications and before I
jumped into the remarks I needed to
speak to you know what in fact is ortc
and if you go to ortc org and as you
heard from google justin and serge
earlier ortc is essentially an evolution
of the web RTC api and the definition is
hear it from RTC dot org but the way I
wanted to share it with you was really
in a top 10 format of 10 of the top
benefits
that the developer community and
customers will potentially enjoy as we
we get the ortc lie library finished and
available to the world at large so
there's a lot of text on these slides
but I promise we'll get through it
quickly and and have Bernard our guest
from Microsoft join us on will make this
content available through cranky geek
and web RTC hacks and whoever else wants
hook flash and ortc or org so the number
I'll start at number 10 and countdown to
our number one so the the number ten
benefit is it enhances direct programmer
control over the media pipeline so it
gives the developers a greater degree of
control Justin did a great job of
speaking to access at the object level
and you'll see a lot of the benefits
kind of flow from that number nine
signaling flexibility so ortc does not
require offer answer exchange to be
repeated every time you change the media
it allows you to not not deal with a
round-trip exchange every time that a
transaction takes place and this is
valuable to an increasing number of
companies and developers who are
innovating away from sip for over the
top applications media forking is really
just a lousy ortc to use the same set of
ports and that'll that'll be a benefit
will see with ortc one of the number
seven one of the core attributes of
artistes of OTC and really the architect
fundamental to the architecture is it's
it can be asymmetric so WebRTC has
originally conceived was one mic and
camera to one mic and camera and as we
see the
evolution of the standard we're opening
up a symmetric applications so you can
imagine multi cameras multi Mike's multi
real-time media from one end without
having to have symmetric connections on
the other number six simulcasting and
scalable video coding native to the new
ortc application number five
capabilities exchange so this allows
remote side to essentially it's pulling
an interrogation so that I can get a
clearer vision and understanding of what
the other side of my peer to peer
connection is doing and you could
imagine the valuable applications that
will see with that kind of capabilities
exchange number 4s des srtp transport
and it that's really all around easier
integration of legacy devices number
three ipv6 and mobile networks and this
is already available in Chrome thanks
the kind of progress that Google shared
with us in the previous session and it
is also available to you in the ort c
library that is underway and and
partially available now and as we get to
the top the last couple of benefits and
the Google guys referred to them it's
obviously an incredibly mobile-centric
world and our ability to leverage
something as exciting and powerful as
web RTC for mobile is incredibly
important and the the founding vision
around the work on ortc has has been to
optimize it for mobile to the highest
degree pasa
also the ortc SDKs for iOS Android and
when Artie are optimized for things like
back rounding and all the challenges you
have in mobile network conditions and
finally what my co-founder partner Eric
lager way I think is most excited about
and is is the capabilities on mobile
network hand off in ortc and I've
highlighted the ortc live as a new
technology called continuous nomination
which allows for dot really dynamic
network management as as your roaming
between a variety of cellular
infrastructure and Wi-Fi as you can
certainly appreciate the complexities of
moving across networks on a mobile
device and maintaining live real-time
communications and there's some
incredibly exciting progress on Oh RTC
relative to those kind of issues it's
been great to hear the tone today and
and there was some wonderful progress at
the w3c meetings in Redmond this week
and the industry has come together to
try and collectively help address this
question to our the RV somehow competing
standards are they in conflict do I have
to choose and that web RTC ortc roadmap
is really getting increasingly clearer
hopefully you leave here today with that
clear understanding that that this is
evolution and integration I wanted to
quote Justin updated this for us today
we had a similar quote the better part
of a year ago I think so WebRTC 11 is
our proposal for how we can accomplish
the following two things new set of AP
is for
control based on ortc and integration
with the existing web RTC so that we
maintain backwards compatibility as an
evolution of the existing API we
consider web RTC at the time of the
quote it was 11 I understand now it's
envy which yeah kind of like envies good
so but the you know the point here we
see commitment and endorsement of this
roadmap by google in june of this year
the w3c invited hook flash co-founder
Eric lager way to co-chair the w3c
standards work and their public
announcement relative to Eric joining
the w3c bore working group was as the
new charter sets the path for
convergence started in the ortc
community group we expect Eric
essentially to deliver as much progress
on possible as possible on the path to
convergence so we see Google we see the
w3c working toward convergence of the
valuable pieces of both these standards
and and it's now I'm very pleased to
introduce our friend from Redmond
bernarda boba principal architect at
Microsoft skype to speak to Microsoft's
work around Oh RTC thanks Chad see if we
can get Bernard here oh do you want me
to turn the slides and I can serve so
I'll do a do the screen share yeah okay
hold on let's see uh hopefully I can
make it do that there we go cool all
right ah so I'd like to talk to you a
little bit about the edge platform and
the road back
for that hopefully you can see the slide
okay it's Chad I think we just found the
screen sharing but yeah okay we've got
to slide up where I understand you've
had a busy week out there Bernard yeah
so let me let me just talk a little bit
about the IE platform so the dev dot
modern done IE website lists all of the
features for the roadmap of edge and let
me just talk through the way you can
interpret this and also the way you can
be access to the features as they become
available so everything on that site
that uses the term supported means that
that feature has already shipped within
edge on Windows 10 some of them are also
supported down level on Internet
explorer but everything that says
supported is in fact supported an edge
so if you get a copy of Windows 10 and
edge you can use those features today
now we're a feature says it's in
development such as ortc what that means
is that feature will become available
initially through the windows insider
preview program and so if you're sign up
for that program and i'll give you a URL
for that you can get builds of wind 10
that contain all the features that are
listed in development that includes
currently ortc as well as vp9 which
justin talked about so one question I've
gotten is when will those individual
features become available and so the
answer is they become available when the
features are merged from the private
builds into the main wind 10 build and
then that build is an intern pushed out
through the windows insider preview
program ortc has been merged into the
main build so it shouldn't be too long
before you will see that in the windows
insider preview program I'm not exactly
sure when vp9 whether it has been merged
or will be urged
but at some point you will see that also
in the windows insider preview program
and then eventually in Windows 10 as
those features get released so let me
talk a little bit about what's in ord
see and what you should expect there so
back in October in 2014 we actually had
a blog entry and you can look that up
also on modern day II which talked about
the features that we had committed to
back then and we've gotten most of that
work done particularly on the audio side
so in that blog we talked about
supporting g.711 g7 22 and opus and so
we have all of those codecs checked in
in addition we talked about other basic
audio things that are in the WebRTC
audio requirements things like comfort
noise and DTMF and that is there as well
on the video side in that vlog we talked
about supporting h.264 and we still have
that is one thing that you will not see
in the preview program interoperable
h.264 because we still have more work to
do to get some of the basic video
elements of a platform in however we do
have a support for something we call
h.264 you see which is an implementation
of obviously 6190 which is h.264 word
scalable video coding and this is a
kodak that supports both spatial
scalability so it's our spatial
simulcast and temporal scalability
through h.264 SVC so that's kind of a
basic video codec that's in there at
that you will see in the preview program
and we will continue work on
interoperable h.264 so that we can
interoperate with Mozilla and chrome
going forward and that will require a
little bit of for work on the video
platform as well as on the video codec
transport itself so I know there's going
to be questions about BP nine so I just
wanted to clarify a few things there is
a blog that I'll give you a pointer to
that describes exactly what will you
will see in the windows insider preview
program as far as vp9 support that is
currently a decoder oriented towards
streaming media so it goes along with
the the dash support
and streaming support that you've seen
in Windows 10 already so that's what
we'll be there there is not currently a
support for vp9 encoder and the focus is
on streaming media so you will not see
vp9 supported within the preview program
in ortc but basically the decoder and
the streaming support is there you will
see it and beat for vp9 come out in the
windows insider preview program although
i'm not exactly sure what what bill that
will be in and whether it'll be in the
same build as the one in which you'll
see RTC so also a few other little
things i think as has already been
mentioned getusermedia did ship in
windows 10 rtm and that is already
supported in adaptive jjs so you should
be able to run all the examples on
github the WebRTC samples and they
should run an edge and if there any bugs
you can let me know or other folks and
we did have a skype blog a while back
about skype for web and that basically
currently depends on a plug-in but we'll
be moving towards plug-in free support
over time and so you keep your eyes
peeled it probably will be something
along those lines talking about support
for that as well I thought I would open
it up basically two questions now and
try to answer the things that are on
your mind yeah so um yeah so keep our
eyes peeled basically our plan is when
we release major new features it through
the windows insider fever program
there's typically a blog that goes along
with it kind of giving developers in
introduction to the feature what's there
what's not there etc and we already have
posted vlogs on media capture
functionality in May and then more
recently on vp9 with respect to the
support their kind of clarifying what
you'll see many what you should expect
as a developer and I would expect a blog
entry for ortc when when that is coming
out in a preview program as well we have
you back up on the big screen now
Bernard okay I think if you're ready it
will start to
we'll take some some questions from the
audience I'll probably go out and i will
ask trent to repeat for you if necessary
you an interpreter yeah happen about
thanks chat questions for Bernard or or
Fortran Justin Bernard do you have any
sense you mentioned that vp9 won't be
supported in WebRTC in this new preview
but is there any sort of sense of when
that would be supported yes I think I
heard the question about vp9 so um so
let me talk a little bit about the work
that needs to be done to support h.264
interoperable a shoe store because it's
a lot of the same work that would be
needed for any additional codec so
basically what we have today is what we
call the h.264 you see and that includes
support for a number of feedback
messages for example but not all the
ones which you would need for good in
our operability there's also would be
didn't work done in the video platform
for things like bandwidth estimation and
so forth and so basically we need to put
that foundation in place before we can
have interoperability really with any
codecs and so that the first evidence of
that work having been done with the
h.264 and once we've kind of got that
then we would be able to add more
potential video codecs on top of that
the other thing is because I mentioned
that we had a decoder and vp9 is
obviously you would would need to have
an encoder as well and then there are
issues of the hardware support and so
forth so that's kind of another element
is supporting hardware acceleration we
do have that for h.264 you see and so
I'm assuming that won't be a huge oak
work item for h.264 but but that would
be another thing we generally like to
have hardware acceleration when we
release codecs so that everything runs
smoothly but I I have no idea when all
of that work would get done we basically
have to make the platform functional
before any additional codex would come
in
that we don't have a we don't have a
plan for all of that work right now so
I'm not giving any dates even for h.264
I think other questions I wonder if you
could clarify just the overall time
frame for the edge browser with a
completely running web RTC already for
developers you know what kind of time
frame are we looking at well for that
for the windows insider preview as I've
said ortc has been integrated into the
main windows 10 built so it's kind of
more of an issue of a build packaging
and putting it up on the website and so
forth so I'm not going to have a betting
pool as to which day or week but I
there's no particular reason for the
delay which has anything to do with
anything going on in you know what you
see land so I it's not i would not
expect a long wait let me put it that
way other questions football i know you
have questions
so while we're waiting for a question
I'll give an answer that maybe is to a
question some people have been asked you
about but or maybe not so big people ask
is what our to see objects have we been
working on and the answer is the core
objects that are in 10 that you will be
seeing hopefully in a 10 spec the ice
transports the sender the receiver the
dtls transport are all supported we have
something called the ice gather which is
a little bit unique to or TC and that is
there as well so basically the core
objects of ortc which are in OTR to
seize back and read see 10 but Mike's
document focusing on thanks Bernard time
for a question okay um so actually this
is more of a general question for about
the Chrome Firefox and Internet Explorer
teams just browser and operability in
general and kind of a commitment to that
like another is like I'm going to be an
adapter j/s another it's been on
everyone's writing the same files to
make the you know their particular app
work across all the different browsers
but you know I guess now the internet
explorer is on board as well like what
is the commitment there to make it work
well between all the browsers yeah so I
heard the basic question which was about
adaptive jes support so as as Justin if
there is work going on and I think that
work is you could say it's largely
successful or get using PDF buddy
there's still work in progress for ortc
and I guess I don't want to predict the
full outcome of that I certainly hope it
all works there may be some folks here
and there but I think basically keep
your eyes peeled once the insider
preview is out and people have had a
chance to look at it work on a little
bit more will get a sense of how how
well we've got adapter jjs working on
top of our GC and if there are any
issues of bugs or not but I do think
that's an active area that a lot of
people are interested in and so we'll
have to see how well it works any
comments from Nils or Justin or anyone
that was a question for all the browser
vendors generally speaking while we are
trying to you know snap everything to
like the light of specifications adapter
is a very good way to make sure you
always get kind of the the spec behavior
even when the implementations are not
necessarily up to date so I for example
you can now use promises in WebRTC in
even though chrome as I'm an updated yet
if you use adapter because adapter gives
you that promise polyfill so I expected
after still be in sort of front and
center and something you should be using
in your apps to make sure you have like
you know equivalent support across
browsers and hopefully it'll work for
edge just as well yeah I guess I think
theoretically if we get like a 1 point 0
spec and everyone implements that one
speck and the spec is actually accurate
then we no longer need adapter jas but
that's probably like still some time out
I would guess and especially if we act
like orgy see to it that will add like
another very end to it so we'll probably
stuck with adapter chance for some time
but on the other hand if we if we don't
then that probably also would mean that
we don't have any new development going
on anymore so thanks think we're running
a town thank you so much for for joining
us Bernard one couple and Thank You
Trent thank you it's very lunch at ok
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
