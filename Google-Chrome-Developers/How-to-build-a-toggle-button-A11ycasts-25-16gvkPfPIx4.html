welcome back to the alley cash show
today by popular demand I'm going to
build an element end-to-end we're gonna
be building a toggle button based on
some work a developer named Raja did
recently on our how to components
project so we're gonna walk through the
implementation and then we'll use this
as an opportunity to talk a little bit
more about how to components a little
bit later but follow me over here to my
laptop you can see this is what we're
gonna build today it's a very very
simple control toggle button right you
can click on it and it has some like a
permanent pressed state and click on it
again unpress is pretty straightforward
right now anytime I'm building a custom
control the first thing I do is I
usually go over to the Aria authoring
practices site and I'll try and see if
there are some instructions for the
pattern that I'm trying to implement so
over here on the site if i zoom in a
little bit we can see that there is a
button section and it tells us that you
know a button is a widget that lets a
user trigger in action but it also says
in addition to the ordinary button
widget Aria also supports two other
types of buttons there's a toggle button
and there's a menu button a toggle
button is gonna be like a two state
button which will either be pressed or
not pressed and kind of like the
quintessential example they provide
there is like a mute button that you
might see on a video player the
important thing to note here is that
they mention in order to tell assistive
technology that a button is toggle
button we want to specify a value for
the aria-pressed attribute so right away
we know we're going to need an aria
pressed attribute if we look at the
instructions we can also see that
there's some keyboard support we need so
it being a button we need to support the
spacebar we need to support the Enter
key we can skip some of this other stuff
which talks about you know what if your
button opens a dialog and things like
that we're not gonna worry about that
too much today but we can go down to
this section on role states and
properties and see that okay since we're
building a button we need a roll of
button got it
we don't necessarily need to worry about
having a label on this button because
buttons as it explains here can get
their accessible name by the computed
text content that they have so you know
if we actually have some text inside of
our button types as I click me or mute
or whatever it'll just use that as the
label for the control otherwise if we
were building like a like a
that only had an icon on it we might
want to add an already illegal to that
but in our case we're gonna just make a
standard like actual button so we can
just consume that text it'll also tell
us that you know we need to support the
Aria disabled state so if the action or
the button itself is disabled we've got
to add already disabled and as that also
stated earlier we've got to make sure we
support are you oppressed okay so
there's a number of things this control
is going to need to implement even
though it's simple it'll actually take
us a fair bit of work I've actually
started to template this control out a
little bit already
so I'm gonna do this as a custom element
if you're unfamiliar with custom
elements I can leave some links down
below in the shona some more
documentation but basically a custom
element just lets you define your own
HTML tag so in this case we're gonna
create an element called how to toggle
button now we're here in my template
I've gone ahead and I've started to
stamp this template out a little bit so
I've got some some key code constants
that I've defined for the space bar in
the enter key I mean if we scroll down
here a little bit here I'll expand this
you can see a bit better the first thing
we're gonna do is we're going to create
a template for our elements
implementation and what we can do
instead of this template is we can
create some like very basic initial
styles for our element we can also add a
slot tag to this element and that's
actually how will consume the text
content from our element and display it
properly so inside of my template what
I'm doing here is a I've just called
document create element creating an
actual template tag I'm setting its
inner HTML to this little string here
and I've got a style tag and I've got a
slot tag now my style tag there's a few
styles that I want to set so this colon
host selector right here that allows us
to style the custom element itself
itself applying styles there my default
all custom elements are displayed inline
but since we're building an actual
button we probably want to be
display:inline-block we can do some
other things too you know we can give it
kind of like an initial border I'm gonna
say it's one pixel solid black or
something like that we don't want it to
be you know too stylized we can give it
some padding say we want it to be like
three pixels if we want someone to be
able to style this control later we
could use like CSS variables
aka custom properties so we could say
you know var dash dash toggle
order it'll either you know use a
variable if one was defined or it'll
just use this shorthand as a fallback
all right so we can do something like
that that's kind of cool and then
there's two states we want to support
for a button there is a pressed state so
this this style selector here signifies
if on the host we have a pressed
attribute then we should apply a style
and then this one right here says if on
the host we have a disabled attribute we
should apply a different style so all
I'm gonna do in this case it's just sort
of like change the background color on
our button so we can verify that it's
actually working you could do something
fancier with your control if you want
but we'll keep this one pretty simple so
when it's in the press state we'll just
to the background to light green and
when it's in the disabled state we'll
set the background to white
great now the next thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna have a little class here
that we define our button implementation
inside of and then finally we call
custom elements define we pass in our
tag name and then we pass in our toggle
button class okay cool so now we get it
to kind of the heart of the matter let's
start defining this class and and all
the things we're going to need to
support all those Aria semantics now
when I'm building a custom element
usually the first thing I do is I define
the attributes that that element will
support as we know from these selectors
that we put in our template earlier
we're going to need a pressed attribute
and a disabled attribute so to do that
we create a static getter observed
attributes is its name reserved
attributes and we want that to return an
array of attributes that this element
will watch for changes on so we'll say
we want to watch for the pressed
attribute and the disabled attribute so
now anytime those change we can actually
implement a callback called attribute
change callback and we'll get those
signals now next thing we want to do is
we want to define a constructor for our
element so anytime you're creating a
custom element the first thing you do in
your constructor is you call super that
sets up the prototype chain with HTML
element and this is a good place to go
ahead and create any sort of shadow Dom
for your element since we're going to be
taking in the text content from our
element and displaying it with that slot
tag we can use shadow Dom here to do
that so I'll say this dot attach
shado will set its mode equal to open
which means people can style it later on
and then we can just say this dot shadow
root dot pen child template content dot
clone node true so what that's gonna do
is that's gonna grab all template
content that we have up here and stamp
it out inside of our element the reason
we do it in this fashion when we create
the template element ahead of time is by
doing this on cloning it into our tag
and just instead of just setting inner
HTML we actually save a lot on HTML
parse cost so this is kind of like a
nice little custom element
trickery here all right so we've got our
constructor set up we've got our element
and it's registered so I think at this
point we could actually even go look at
it in the browser
and we should see yes we've got our
little border around this button that
we've been working on it doesn't really
do much right now like we can't click on
it or do anything like that but at least
we know that it's showing up the next
thing we want to do is say ok cool once
this thing is connected to the document
let's go ahead and sprout some of those
Aria attributes so we want to sprout a
roll a button and we also want to add a
tab index to this control so it's
interactive so we can do that inside of
our connected callback so connected
callback runs anytime your element gets
attached to the document and inside of
here what I often do is I say if we do
not already have a roll then we can self
apply one and the reason we do that is
because if the user of our element has
decided that they would like to override
the roll with something else maybe
something you know fancier we don't want
to you know surprise the developer and
override them so we always check to see
first if we do not have a roll so this
does not have attribute roll then we can
say this set attribute roll is button
we'll do the same thing for tabindex so
if we don't have tabindex and let's go
ahead and set that to have index 0 this
means it'll be reachable by the keyboard
and then finally because we're building
a toggle button we need to signal to
assistive technology that you know this
button supports those two states
so we need to go ahead and define an
initial re oppress state of false and
we'll do the same thing here we'll say
if we don't have the aria-pressed
attribute you don't have aria-pressed
let's go ahead and find that as
setattribute aria-pressed is false okay
so far so good if we go back and we look
at our element now and we open up our
dev tools and inspect it we should see
that it has here we will in this a
little bit so you can read it easier
whoa that's a little too much okay so we
can see that it has now strata to roll
it's spread at a tab index and a spread
at aria-pressed 'false next we want to
do is define these attributes and
properties for pressed and disabled now
the pattern that I often use is all
create getters and setters for the
underlying properties and I'll just have
those synchronized with the attributes
so setting the attributes that's the
property of setting the properties
that's the attribute right back and
forth so since these are boolean z' we
can go ahead and we can follow a pretty
simple approach here so we'll say set
pressed that will receive a value so
this is what this function runs when
someone sets the property itself and
what I usually do is I will define a
little constant and I'll say is pressed
equals boolean value whoops
spell that right liyan there we go value
so why do we do it this way well if you
look at the way that native controls
work like the the input type equals
checkbox when you set its checked
boolean property you can pass it all
sorts of different funky things you
could pass it like the number one in
quotation or you could pass it the word
false in quotation and since all of
those things are true the-- they will go
ahead and will mark the checkbox as
being checked so we're kind of doing the
same thing here we're saying anytime
someone passes something truthy to the
control will go ahead and indicate that
yes it has a value we're gonna say
that's a true boolean value so if is
pressed we will just set attribute
pressed to empty quotes so this is how
you actually signify that yes you have a
boolean attribute that's true
otherwise we'll just remove the pressed
attribute so remove attribute pressed so
all we're doing here is we're reflecting
the property to the attribute and when
we ask for the value from the property
so we get pressed we're just going to
return this stuff has attribute pressed
so now these two worlds are in sync and
for disabled I'm gonna basically do the
exact same things I'm just gonna paste
this in really quick so set disabled and
get disabled exact same approach we
check to see if the value is truthy if
it is we reflect the attribute otherwise
we remove the attribute all right so we
got properties they set attributes
that's cool right but we need these
missing Aria semantics and what I often
do is once these attribute values are
reflected to my control that's a good
time to handle any side effects over in
our attribute change callback so we'll
define the attribute change callback
attribute changed callback this is going
to get three arguments the name of the
attribute that changed the old value and
the new value and since these are both a
boolean properties and boolean
attributes we can kind of do a quick
little cheat here and so we can say has
value equals new Val does not equal
equal no and if has value or actually we
can if we can do this even faster we can
say this set attribute and we use a
little template literal string here so
we'll say Aria dash name has value boom
okay so now we're saying you know if
someone sets pressed it'll say Aria dash
pressed equals whatever that value is
some once its disabled will say Aria
dash disabled equals whatever that value
is now we should actually be able to go
test this so let's look at our element
again well select it in our dev tools
and we can see right now it has its
default role default tab index and
aria-pressed let's say pressed equals
true and now we can see aria-pressed
evils true
appeared and our pressed attribute just
appeared and our style is applied
similarly we could say disabled equals
true and we should sprout a disabled
attribute and re a disabled attribute
and our style is now gray okay cool so
we know that at least the the
programmatic and the attribute API to
this element works but we still need to
add like click and keyboard support so
the last thing we're gonna do is we're
going to define a function called toggle
pressed and inside of this function
we're just going to toggle the state of
our check or sorry are pressed property
so we'll say this dot crest equals the
opposite of whatever this not pressed
currently is you know if you want you
could also like dispatch an event here
to tell the outside world that hey like
your element has changed or something
like that
but to keep things quick I'm gonna just
skip ahead and I'm gonna say let's add
some event listeners so open our
connected callback this is a good time I
think to add event listener so I'll save
this dot add event listener click this
dot on click this add event listener key
now this on key down okay now our click
handler is really not gonna do anything
special here so when I click handler we
could we could have actually just called
toggle press directly if we want it to
I'll manually call it here perhaps you
might want to do some other side effects
when someone clicks on your control this
gives you the option if you want to
otherwise you can just go ahead and call
toggle pressed key down will be a little
bit fancier so we're gonna need the
event here and first we'll say if the
event alt key was held down let's just
go ahead and return the reason I do this
and this is a little hand wavy here but
as I understand some screen readers
allow the user to hold down the Alt key
it's kind of like a modifier key so they
might be able to hit like alt spacebar
alt enter or something like that I think
so I want to make sure if that is the
case that we're not you know
intercepting those those key presses
because they're not meant as space
partying or key presses their min is
like when a lot of fire key presses so
we'll just go ahead and return those
otherwise we're gonna switch on the
event key code and if the case was Kiko
dot enter or if it was keycode dot space
and we're going to prevent the default
action and we're just gonna call this
dot toggle pressed don't break and then
for anything else any sort of like
default action we are just going to go
ahead and return control back to the
program so now if we go and we check out
our control we can click on it you can
see that yes the the click handler is
working we see the aria-pressed state
toggling we can select with our keyboard
and press spacebar or enter we see that
working as well or we can select the
element and set stabled just a bold
equals true and let's select the actual
element when we do that there we go now
I can see the background color changes
to gray so that about covers that toggle
button implementation there are a few
little bits that I left out and if you
want you can go check out the how 2
components repo to pick up those
additional sort of like in the weeds
bits but I actually wanted to use this
also as an opportunity to talk about the
how 2 components project so I mentioned
it last time on the show and the idea
behind cap how 2 components is we want
to create kind of like a library of
example custom elements that developers
can look at understand how to write
these controls in an accessible fashion
and then take those implementations take
those ideas and kind of like map them
over to their own project so how to
components are not meant as like a a for
production UI set or anything like that
they're meant entirely as like literate
code examples and our goal is really to
take all the re authoring practices
guide and see if we can implement those
as custom elements so that all
developers can you know build cool web
components off of those so if you
yourself are interested maybe in
contributing to this project the the
toggle button that I built today was
actually created by a developer in the
community named Raja
if you want to do the same you want to
pitch in that would be awesome we would
love the help so go over to the how do
you components repo it's over on github
and you know open up a pull request if
you have the time that about covers it
for today so as always thank you so much
for watching leave me comments down
below if you have them and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
