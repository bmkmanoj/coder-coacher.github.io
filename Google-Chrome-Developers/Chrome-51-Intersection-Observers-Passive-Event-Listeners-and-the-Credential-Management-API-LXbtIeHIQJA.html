element enters or exits the viewport
with intersection observers you can make
the sign-in process
way easier with the new credential
management API and you can reduce jank
with passive event listeners I'm Pete
LePage let's dive in and see what's new
for developers in chrome 51 intersection
observers let you know when an observed
element enters or exits the browser's
viewport
no more jank conducing calls to get
bounding client rect or listening for
scroll events to use simply create a new
intersection observer provide a callback
and an options object then tell the
observer which elements to watch boom
when the element enters or exits the
viewport the callback is fired check the
description below for a link to a demo
browser support and more creating
remembering and typing passwords is a
pain in the neck especially on mobile
chrome 51 supports the credential
management API a new w3c spec that
allows your site to interact with the
browser's credential manager and
federated account services like Google
and Facebook improving the login
experience the API has three key methods
navigator dock credentials get to get
the users credentials and initiate a
sign-in flow store to save the users
credentials in the credential manager
and require user mediation to disable
automatic sign-in there's more info
about the credential management API
including a demo and links to the dogs
below did you know that simply adding an
empty touch event handler to a pavéd
can make scrolling Genki less than 20%
of touch event call prevent default
canceling the scroll but because the
browser doesn't know if it'll be called
or not
it has to wait for the JavaScript to
finish chrome 51 adds support for
passive event listeners allowing you to
declare that an event listener won't
prevent a scroll making it easier to
eliminate jank these are just a few of
the changes in chrome 51 for developers
check the description for more details
and we sort of like and subscribe so
that as soon as chrome 52 is released
you'll know what's new in Chrome
