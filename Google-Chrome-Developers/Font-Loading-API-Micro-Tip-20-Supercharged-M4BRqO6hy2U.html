phones actually to improve their visual
appearance when many phones are in use
they can easily add up to a couple of
hundred kilobytes yet the control over
font loading with CSS can feel a bit
rigid with a font loading API you can
take control over when and how phones
should be loaded instead of loading our
font with the declaration in CSS we can
now load it programmatically you can
create instances of the font face type
for each font that you want to use you
provide a name and a resource
description as it is common in CSS only
when you call load however will the
browser actually go ahead and fetch the
font file and parse it the promise
returned by load who will be resolved
when the loading and parsing off the
fund is done it is imported into the
system as a font but not it associated
with your document to do that you need
to call add on document dot fonts from
here on in your font will be available
under the name you provide it to the
constructor these are the most basic and
important bits of the font loading API
it seems fairly primitive but they can
be composed to develop complex loading
strategies to make your experience much
better
yayyyy fonts see you next time so you
know these two buttons to subscribe to
the channel and to watch our latest
video we did some market research and it
turns out the longer you leave them on
screen the more people click and that
means happy Surma you should click them
clickety click click
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
