Welcome to another edition to 
another...
(beep) Don't make me laugh!
Hey there, welcome to another e
dition of the Monica show. Sorry
...
If you have noticed and tried to
 use some of our custom element
s.
Take these inputs...
Do you have tape? Why don't you 
tape it to my back? I have a for
mat that is...
Look at that, it has an increme
ntal birthday. That's how you 
can... God damned.
In the comments below, you can 
find me on Twitter. Oh... (beep)
 Thanks for watching. I forgot e
verything. God! (beep) this is 
hard.
Monica:
 So, I thought this was going to
 be a disaster before that hap
pened. Great.
 Good morning. Welcome to the 2n
d day of the Polymer summit. I 
was supernervous. Oh my god. 
That is Matt to throw you off. 
It is going to be a disaster, 
please be nice to me. I have to 
remind you of things. All the v
ideo's are already on Youtube. 
If you missed anything you can 
watch them again. I want to re
mind you of the community guidel
ines. The code of conduct is pos
ted outside, on the website. If 
you have feedback, or anything 
wrong or well, you can give feed
back. Any of the speakers or 
staff. They are wearing black or
 white shirts. I'm running out 
of breath. The state of the i
nternet is Dion. Dion's fun fact
 is dubious. He was a national 
chess champion when he was 12. I
 made a mistake, it wasn't chess
 but scrib scrabble. I'm sure he
 doesn't remember his first 15 
years of life. Give it up for 
Dion, everybody.
(applause)
Dion: Hi, how is everyone doing?
 How was day 1? It was fun, 
right? (applause)
Great, thanks a lot. I want to 
say thanks to Matt to give the 
opportunity. Great to be back h
ome in London. They did a fantas
tic job for the, summit and the 
new release of Polymer 2. I 
kinda needed it yesterday and th
e party. 2016 has been an inte
resting year. Now and then I get
 a little bit frustrated. Again,
 I grew up here, I had frus
trations being here. Now I live 
in the US. And there is a few 
frustrations right now in the U
S. (applause) so, I kinda look 
at Canada, Australia. I really 
don't know. But then... I have 
to go to data. Take a breath. It
 is the best time in history to 
be a human. It is okay. The 
world is more peaceful. There is
 less poverty. I have to calm 
myself down. Sometimes I feel 
the same way with technology. 
Where I dive in there and feel a
 little bit frustrated. There is
 so much stuff going on. Things 
are evolving so quickly. I have 
to remember, I may not have to 
line every single tool that 
someone publishes. It may be ok
ay to focus on delivering some
thing for my users. And then, I 
have to remember again after ta
king a breath, things are ama
zing for the web right now. I u
sed to work for Walmart. Where I
 started a mobile group. Which 
also is in the UK. It is 5 years
 ago. Where I kicked out mobile 
from the ground up. The business
 wanted apps, apps, apps. It is 
5 years ago. A big  push. We got
 it in the app store. We built a
 brand new appstore that r work
ed well on mobile. Things se
ttled. Whenever something new 
happens, it is up in the riot. A
 couple of years in, I can see, 
okay, 80% is still coming throug
h the website. Maybe there is 
something to the web thing. We 
should focus a lot of attention 
over there. We are getting over 
there across the community. The 
macro pitch on what's going on. 
We can look at the data and see 
how things are balancing out. As
 well as being an important end 
of the tap experience, we need 
to become native on mobile. Th
at's what the progressive web is
 about. Delivering all of the 
capabilities. That has been exci
ting over the last year. But, I 
kan kinda feel like this. Like I
'm regenerating from desktop ap
ps web to mobile web. And I feel
 like, as a whole eco system, we
 are still going through this 
change. And we are not fully the
re yet. But it is important to 
know how far we have come. When 
mobile took off, it was the pin
ching zoom web. It was a genius 
strategy of Steve Jobs. It be
came the catalog. Everyone was 
working on Wap and weird things 
from Mobile. It wasn't the path 
to get access to all of the con
tent. We have been able to get 
from that and move away. We d
on't want it to be the back cata
log, but the forefront. We can d
eliver experiences, like the 
partners have been showing. This
 is really a sense where we have
 been able to get to over the 
last few years. But we have a ma
jor challenge. And we are an 
interesting crossroads. It is im
portant to notice there is a 
threat going on here. That's 
about building a mission for the
 users to deliver this fantastic
 experience. But, to do it on 
this platform, there is very 
different. On the web, you have 
the browser and the runtime. 
That's on the device. And you 
have to use that as much as pos
sible and use the platform and 
things we have been hearing. We 
also have this stuff on top of 
it. All the frameworks, the app 
code and all the data and things
 we need. How are we going too 
get that onto the device and in 
a way that mobile can actually 
run on that. Russell is going to
 tell about it. It is vital to 
realise the threat we are in. We
 need to deliver it in 3 seconds
 or we are dead. It is important
 for us the framework develop
ers, and the browsers, to keep e
volving this run time to work 
very well for mobile. How do we 
solve this? We have to do magic.
 Computer science tends to be il
lusion. As you are interacting 
on the desktop computer. Trying 
to do some work for you. We know
 it is going through a task in 
the background. At the last mi
nute, repaint the cursor. We 
need to work out a way to do 
that. Monica and Steve talked 
about it yesterday. It is impor
tant that we really push hard, u
sing all of the tricks and smo
kes and mirrors. Paul is going 
to talk later. He is the master 
magician.
You have to watch him do live co
ding and see the different 
tricks he is getting upto here. 
We need to do 2 things important
ly. Squash everything down. And 
get to a point where they are 
optimized. Same with the own 
code and data. But the flipside 
is, we need to take a slice of 
our information, of our UI, and 
to be able to deliver that 
slice. And be able to lazily 
load things later. It is impor
tant for us to do it. We need to
 do it in a way makes sense for 
us. Back at Wallmart we did a 
lot of rendering. But it became 
a spaghetti mess. If you would 
look in the code. If I'm on the 
server, doing this. It is pain
ful. We need to have the ability
 to do less work. And do work 
later for our devices. But we a
lso need to be able to do that 
as developers. And for that, we 
need to have all of the right 
tools to give us the abstrac
tions where we can fake this out
 and let the illusion happen.
So this is why we are excited at
 the summit. Polymer has got the
 right match here. It is a great
 tool to allow us to deliver th
is experience. And I'm super ex
cited for you to see what comes 
up in the day. And now I want to
 get off stage and allow you to 
see what's going on in the world
 of tooling. I think it is going
 to impress you and show you wha
t's going to be possible for 
meeting that challenge. Thanks 
so much.
(applause)
monica:
 I had the task to introduce 
Justin.
Next are Justin and Fred and 
Peter, to tell what's up with 
tools. We have to figure out 
which is which. One used to be a
 hippy rockstar in Celebrity Hot
tub. One of them gave themselves
 a concussion by misusing a 
bench. And one of them used to 
do a lot of pottery. He has been
 using Polymer all of his life. 
Give it up for them.
(applause)
Hello. Good morning everyone. 
Thanks Monica. For getting the 
day started and for being here.
I hope everyone is excited for 
day 2. I'm Justin. Fagnani. I'm 
excited to tell you what we have
 been up to. Yesterday you got 
to hear about the future of Poly
mer and web components. You 
heard about the new standards 
which are starting to ship na
tive in browsers. And Polymer 2.
0 and how it builds on the stand
ards and how it is smaller, ea
sier to use and more interoperab
ltble. We are also working on 
some major upgrades for the 
tools. So they work with the new
 standards, Polymer 2.0 and usef
ul for the web components eco 
system. In the next 45 minutes 
we are going to take a tour of 
our tools. Why we built tools. 
Updates of the core tools and 
the toolbox and how we deliver 
the tools to you so how you can 
use them. Let's start at looking
 why we built tools and why we 
have a tools team on the Polymer
 team. It hasn't always built a 
lot of tools. The core library 
team has reversed the tooling. 
When they, probably most love is
 the immediacy of working on it.
 So their tools consisted of an 
editor. And a browser. And t
hat's pretty much it. Components
 and apps and tests would load i
n the browser. By not addend too
 many layers of abstraction. 
There is not so much need for a 
complex tool chain. You almost 
always need some tools. We are u
sing the new features, many of 
the existing tools didn't quite 
work how we wanted. So first, we
 needed a dev server that could 
serve up components and the dep
endencies easily. And we needed 
a bundeler. And then we wanted a
 test runner that worked with 
the component first workflow and
 could load Html files. It went 
on and on. Until we ended up 
with this kitchen drawer full of
 tools. This is very very hard 
for our team to maintain. We en
ded up with many pages of tools 
in the documentation. And this 
is hard for the users. It is es
pecially hard for users who are 
new to the web components world.
 At the beginning of this year, 
we knew we needed a dedicated 
tools team. We needed to go back
 and reenvision this. That is ea
sy to approach and understand. 
That was a good time to stop and
 start an important question: 
Why? Why is the Polymer team 
building tools in the first p
lace? The tools we created did
n't come out of nowhere. We 
built them because they solved 
real problems. What kind of pro
blems? Web development in gene
ral has many many problems to 
address. And, as we all know, 
web development has many many 
many tools to address them. But 
with Polymer and web components,
 we have these new and unique 
problems to deal with the exis
ting tools don't address. For 
one, Html and Css are exten
sible. It used to be easy. A fix
ed set of tags. And text editors
 and linters could build on it. 
With custom elements it changes.
 Html is an open ended set of 
tags. How you know it is valid? 
Same with Css. It used to be 
global. Now w with Shadow Dom it
 has scopes and an open ended 
set of properties. It is harder 
to use now. There are also many 
different ways to write. You 
have seen a few. We have Polymer
 1.0. 2.0, the legacy. Vanilla 
custom elements. And we have the
 other libraries. Like Xtags. 
And I'm sure a lot more I'm not 
aware of.
And then with Html imports, it c
an import themselves. This a
bility for Html to have a depen
dency is new. Existing bundlers 
and linters don't know the struc
ture of Html. We can notice some
thing about all of these proble
ms. They are not Polymer speci
fic. They apply to web compo
nents in general. This brings us
 to a really important principle
 we have on the team. The poly
mer tools are not just tools for
 the Polymer core library. Our g
oal is to help all web compo
nents developers and users. I t
hink this is something really u
nique to the J web components ec
o system.. Because of the intero
perability of web components, 
the success of the users or lib
rary is a success for all. We 
build this eco system. So this 
is one major motivation for 
tools. To solve problems. At the
 same time we are in the midst 
of the change, other parts of 
development are evolving as ra
pidly as ever.
There are a choler slew of new 
technologies and expectationtion
 that are drastically changing 
the Webapps, especially mobile 
we can apps to officer offer a 
truly great mobile experience, 
apps now have to have what was 
urn till recently a fairly sop
histicated structure, supported 
by a sophisticated tool chain, 
on the Polymer Team, we've been 
trying to codify these into a 
best pattern that helps you 
craft an O mall loading 
experience. We came up with this
 acronym PRPL. That stands for 
push, render, precache and lazy 
load. PRPLel involves things 
like HTTP push to push  exactly 
the resources needed for a route
.  Service Worker and per route 
bundling when push isn't 
available. These techniques are 
critical for engagement and to 
compete with native apps. And 
tools can help make this 
manageable. The goal of defining
 a pattern like PRPL is to make 
it easily repeatable.  And re
repeatability is something tools
 is really, really good at. We 
want to take these cutting edge 
techniques and make them s
tandard practice, we want to 
make things like optimal loading
 the default when starting any 
new App. So that's why we're 
building tools, this is what get
s us to work in the morning. Let
's look at what we  actually 
build. Our tools are organized 
around a set of core single 
purpose libraries like the 
project initializer, test runner
 and the build system. These 
tools each address a problem 
along the life cycle of a proj
ect, from getting started to all
 the way to building through 
production. And we take these 
tools andante greet them all and
 deliver them to you in the 
Polymer CLI, and then, boyaring 
most of these tools is a common 
analysis engine that allows our 
tools to really understand your 
project. Now,  let's take a look
 at that engine that powers our 
tools. A few months ago we 
embarked on a project to build a
 new and flexible static analyze
r for the web, which I'm really 
happy to talk about for the 
first time, it's kaled the 
Polymer analyzer. The analyzer 
helps other tools understand 
applications and components in 
this new extensible words.  Many
 different types of files using 
new Elements and written in 
different libraries.  It's job 
is to dig into this complex 
graph of resources that make up
 an amountr App, find, extract 
important features like Element 
definitions and HTML and provide
  APIs for other tools to oper
ate on this structure. It does 
it all with Plug-Ins so the a
nalyzer can be extended without 
changing it's core 
implementation. The analyzer 
comes with several parser 
Plug-Ins so it understands HTML,
 JavaScript,CSS and general JSON
, in the future we can add 
support for additional languages
 the like TypeScript. It also 
understands many different ways 
of importing files into each 
other, like HTML import, inline 
and external scripts and soon 
JavaScript native imports.  And 
it has a large set of Plug-Ins 
for supporting Custom Elements 
poly and Vanilla Custom Elements
 when the analyzer processes a 
file, it processes it with one 
of the parser Plug-Ins, then it 
scans the documents looking for 
important features with it's set
 of scanner Plug-Ins, we have an
 HTML import scanner, and 
dom-module that can find the DOM
 mog you and parse the templates
, and Element scanner which can 
find a Polymer Element 
declaration and find important 
features of it, like it's 
properties. Next, the analyzer 
parses and scans any imported 
and in-line documents until it's
 analyzed everything in it's 
application, here we have an 
import importing another file 
and analyzer finds that. Finally
 the analyzer can resolve 
references between features and 
really understand that's going 
on. We know this tag is an 
instance of a definition in 
another file. The analyzer 
extracts a lot of information 
about Elements it understands  
it's basic API, attributes and I
 scripts, knows how to style an 
Element, knows about it's pr
otopipe chain, and super class 
and mixins, import and get it's 
documentation.  This information
 is available to all the other 
tools available on the analyzer 
.
As part of the analyzer work, 
we're also  adding a new feature
 to help our tools better u
nderstand App Shell style apps 
that use lazy importing, we call
 this declarative lazy imports. 
The analyzer and it's Plug-Ins 
work well because of it's 
declarative nature of Polymer, 
the more your application is 
declarative, the more question 
we can tell what it's doing w
ithout having to run it.  Lazy 
imports today use a lazy API 
that trips up static analysis F 
we take a look at a typical App 
style App, we have a Shell 
that's loaded before rendering. 
It then dynamically loads the 
code needed for a particular r
oute. To actually load a route 
you almost always see a snippet 
of code like this, this is a 
method that takes the page name 
and loads the associated HTML 
page with H import ref, or maybe
 the bundler might miss some 
files. Declarative lazy imports 
allow you to specify the imports
 you willowed right in your 
markup. Lazy imports are like 
link tags like HTML, they're 
link tags like HTML imports, 
they use different attributes 
and have a group name. When you 
load the import you do it by 
group, not IRL, we provide a URL
, tools like the bundler can 
change URL around without break
ing your  code. Being in mark up
 tools like analyzer can see the
 lazy import and know you're  
going to import this URL in the 
future. You can try out a 
preview of lazy imports today 
that works with Polymer 1.0, 
we'll be adding Polymer 2.0 
support soon and doing' new 
release. Before I finish with 
the analyzer, let's talk about 
Linting because it's sitan 
important consumer analysis 
information.  We're rewriting it
 will Polymer Linter on top of 
the analyzer, this will bring 
important improvements soon. The
 Lint command in the CRI checks 
declared properties use in the 
data binding or the Elements you
 use are actually defined and 
imported. But the current Linter
 has a hard coded set of riles 
that only works with Polymer 1.0
 Elements, like I talked about 
it doesn't work well with lazy 
imports. So because the new 
analyzer powers the Linter, it 
understands all the different 
types of Elements that the 
analyzer does. Not only that, 
but we're making the Linter 
itself existential so the new 
Linting rules can be added b
iousers, this is important for 
internal use at Google and 
enterprise that have stricter 
policies they want to enforce.  
We're also using rile sets the, 
Polymer 2.0 mode and hybrid mode
. Choosing the right tool set ma
kes sure you use only the right 
features in the specific Polymer
 that you're targeting. So the 
main insight of the analyzer is 
that web applications are not 
just HTML and not just 
JavaScript, they're built for 
many types of files and many 
ways of importing them. We might
 have HTML, JavaScript, CSS, 
images and more, and so we can't
 rely only on JavaScript tooling
 or only on HTML tooling, we 
need something that brings them 
all together, which is exactly 
what the analyzer does. And we 
can do some pretty awesome thing
s with the results. The new 
analyzer is key to our goal of  
supporting many different tools 
and many different Web 
Components libraries. If you use
 a right Web Components library 
we encourage you to get in touch
 with us so we can help you 
write Plug-Ins nor the  
analyzer, if you write tools or 
interested in using the analyzer
, please get in touch with us so
 we can get help out as well. 
The APIs are not completely 
finished, we want to launch with
 support for as many libraries 
adds we can. let's next talk 
about Mace package management. Y
ay! As you all know we use Boyer
 to distribute all of our 
packages, and Bower works really
 well for us, achieving thually,
 but the ecosystem has been co
alessing behind MPM, many have a
sked for MPM support so you can 
use a single packet manager. 
There's an infamous issue on 
github, issue 323, publish sub 
projects on  NPM and add them to
 package.json. This issue was 
opened almost exactly 3 years 
ago today and it has 202 lively 
comments on it. Now  NPM support
 turns out it's much harder than
 it seems at first. And while we
 haven't solved this issue yet, 
I don't want to get your hopes 
up, we're not going to announce 
 NPM support right now (ooooo) 
sorry. We did come up with a 
plan, at least, and I want to go
 over that plan, and I want to 
talk about some really awesome 
progress that's been made recent
ly. So the plan looked like this
.  The first thing we want to do
 is publish raw packages to NPM,
 not make any changes to them, 
we generated package.json file 
from  Bowir.json, if you figure 
out how to use them, let us know
 (Laughing) we knew there would 
be some problems especially 
because  NPM installs things 
possibly in a nested struck 
choir, and that's difficult for 
us.  So the next step was to 
find or build a plat package 
installer. Something that might 
take an NPM and platen out all t
he packages. Step three we 
needed to build a Bower plus NPM
 release tool, something that 
smooths out the differences 
between packages and tries to 
install and test our Preparing a
 democrat plait for a annals 
from both Bowre and NPM to make 
sure we push working packages to
 both Repositories. Finally, 
when we have all that, and we 
know that you can trust this 
when you install something from 
NPM or Bower and it will work we
 will publish it all to  NPM. 
Step one we did a while back, we
 published things as is to NPM, 
like we suspected people weren't
 able to get them working that 
easily. So, we started working 
on the design for a plat package
 installer, along with 
everything else we were up to at
 the time. When Facebook got in 
touch with us and gave us some 
really, really awesome  news, 
and that awesome news was Yarn, 
which you might have heard about
. They were  working on new 
package manager that uses the NP
M registry and they asked us 
what we would need to use it. 
And so we started working with 
them and gave them requirements,
 filing issues, we were a little
 busy to submit  code, they were
 very happy to add the features 
that we needed, we got Yarn to 
do 2 one thing we really, really
 needed. Which is flat 
installation with proper version
 conflict resolution. This is 
huge for us.  And not only that,
 not only can a user say that 
they need to instale things flat
, but a package can say that it 
requires a plat installlation, 
this is what all packages will 
need to do, it won't work if 
they're nested. This finally 
makes Yarn a viable replacement 
for Bower and really unlocks the
 NPM plan. Step two was by far 
the most difficult thing and the
 Yarn team basically did it for 
us. Now, we can move on, this is
 where we're at now, we can bui
ld the release tool which is 
going to change some small 
differences between Bower and NP
M, then we're going to publish 
everything to NPM, and you'll 
have to use Yarn to install them
.  Yarn is a really big deal, 
for us, NPM, for the entire 
Front-End development community.
  We're super excited, I think 
some of the  Yarn team is here 
today. We're very excited to 
continue working with them and 
make sure it works great for 
Polymer. This is our plan for N
PM, stay tuned, we'll have news 
on this very soon. (Applause)
Next, let's talk about bundling 
and code splitting. Today, we 
are announcing a new version of 
the. The Polymer Bundler. It is 
extremely important to reduce 
loadtimes. A lot of files would 
cripple your performance. But it
 can be important to squeeze

ting, which is creating more t
han 1 bundle is important to  
make sure bundling doesn't work 
against you. You include too 
much in your bundle. But shar
ding can be complicated. Differe
nt options are available for dif
ferent environments. It makes it
 easy to do bundling with a shar
ding. Vultacanize doesn't
 do sharding. And this was slo
wer than it needs to be and it 
wasn't flexble. Now we are ta
king that bundling logic. And we
 are combining them into the 
Polymer bundling. Along the line
 we are teaching the bundlers 
new tricks. It can produce 
better shards in many scenario
's. To understand how it works, 
let's imagine a app style. The 
shell always loads first. Based 
on the Url it loads the entry 
point. And these entry points 
have dependencies. Some share b
etween entry points. Usually 
there is a dependency that are 
shared between everything. The 
trick in a Prpl app is need lo
ading what is needed. And it is 
as fast as possible. The chal
lenge with bunling is not to 
bundle more than is needed.So 
what we've done with the new 
bundler is make it strategy for 
bundling and splitting your App 
plugble, we made the detail 
strategy configurable with a 
single parameter that controls 
the number of shards that you 
get. The way that we calculate 
bundles is to build up this 
table that maps files to the 
unique set of entry points that 
use them. This is already www
.way that you could bundle -- 
one way you could bundle your A
pp where each row is a bundle. 
This is far too many small 
bundles to be useful. You might 
end up with a bundle for every 
possible entry point. This is 
where strategy comes in, a 
bundling strategy takes fine 
grain bundle plan and modifies 
it. One strategy could simply to
 personal everything together in
 one huge bundle and that's what
 vol cab nice does. The CLI uses
 anything using more than one 
entry point into one shared b
undle and bundle everything else
 with one entry point that uses 
it. This is what it looks like 
in in CLI. You end epiwith one 
shared bundle for the Shell, the
 common dependencies and then 
you end up with a bundle per 
route. This is usually a pretty 
good approach, but in a really 
big App it can result in a 
really big shared bundle.  Which
 basically defeats the purpose 
of  sharding. We made the 
strategy configureable by 
setting a threshold. Only if it
's used by more entry points of 
a threshold is it put into a 
shared bundle. Otherwise it's 
pit into a bundle for it's 
unique entry points.  We think 
this lets you easily go in one 
bungedel to one shared bundle to
 many bundle depending on the 
needs of your application.  If 
you have more custom needs you 
can write your own bundling 
strategy. So we're going to be 
rolling out the new bundler very
 soon in the Polymer CLI, we'll 
keep you posted through the 
usual channels:  Okay, speaking 
of the CLI, it's imnext on our 
tour.  --  it's imnext on our 
tour. The CLI is augite way to 
our tool suite, first and main 
tool that most Polymer 
programmers are going to direct
ly experience. We announced it 
as part of the Polymer App 
toolbox. Our main goal was to 
help you build progressive 
Webapps and PRPL apps and we 
wanted to offer a turnkey out of
 the box experience that 
produced extremely fast loading 
and  rendering apps that took 
advantage of client side route
ing, lazy loadingsh push,  
pre-caching and worked off line.
 And CLI helps you do that by 
default. We also wanted to use 
the CLI to solve problems with 
our existing tools, discover
ability and ease of use. Because
 we had built up a set of many, 
many separate tools over time, 
it was difficult for our users 
to find everything they needed. 
And it was often hard to use 
these separate tools together. 
So the CLI solves this by 
including everything in one 
install and by integrating the 
tools ensuring they all work 
together. So to talk about that,
 let me bring up my teammate Fre
d Shot, he's going to talk about
 the CLI.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Fred:  Hey, everyone. All 
right, I'm  going to start by 
stealing a line from  Peter's 
talk yesterday. Is everyone 
feeling excited?  Let's try that
 again?  Is everyone feeling 
excited! (Yeah) is anyone feel
ing overwhelmed (Yeah) is anyone
 feeling a little dread. Well 
the CLI will help make that all 
better, the CLI is our gateway 
to the tool suite. It makes us
ing all these tools and develop
ing with web components past fas
ter and easier I'll give a 
overview of the five commands 
and deep dive into one of those 
to see how CLI fits with our 
greating ecosystem tooling. 
Okay, so five commands. The 
first one is a Inity it brings c
ustom templates right into your 
projects to help you get started
, let's say you have a great 
idea for a new Element, this 
thing is going to be huge, it's 
going to get  thousands of stars
 on github, Rob's going to 
invite you to do a Polycast, 
this is  awesome. Well you can 
get stuck creating your 
environment, setting I want Bowe
r, NPM your tests or you can run
 Init and it brings a custom 
starter Element right into your 
directly, all automatically. We 
also have a starter application 
template, same thing, really 
bare bones to help you get 
started, or if you like 
something a little more feature 
complete we have Polymer starter
 kit a progressive Webapp 
configureed to ice App drawer 
and a lot of other goodies. 
These are all really cool 
templates that hem you get 
started quick. It comes with 
four bundle CLI in total, my 
absolute favorite part of the 
command is you're not just 
limited to the four. You can 
actually create your own 
templates, publish them to NPM 
and share them with the com
munity. And so we're already 
seeing a ton of community 
templates pope up for working 
with internationalization, ES6, 
Google App  engine, all these 
are custom templates built by 
the community and usable by any
one. So we've only really been 
talking about this for a few 
months now, already we're seeing
 templates pop up. Thanks to you
 guys who have createed them.  I
 can't wait to see what we do in
 the next months, years to come.
 So, that's Init. Serve, the 
serve command will create and 
start a dev server for you 
automatically so you can see 
your code in the browser while 
you work on it. No configuration
 necessary, it's built for web 
components and does a lot of 
good stuff to help you develop 
quickly. Lint. Leapt Lints your 
project helps you catcher 
reports fast.  Test help you 
test your code by setting up a 
dev server to test your browser 
right from the command line. And
 build, helps you build a Webapp
 for production. And these five 
commands together represents 
abentire developer work Init get
s started, serve Lint and test 
build code quickly and build get
s your application out to 
production users.  The analogy I
 like to use for the CLI, it's 
like your Swiss army knife for 
Web Components, simple, easy to 
use, and it's alls available to 
you in your project -- and it's 
always available to you in your 
 project. So each of the 
commands is worthy of it's own 
talk, I'm going to focus on 
build so you can see how CLI 
relates to test of the ecosystem
. Let's talk about it. Build 
takes your project and processes
 it to make a optimized web-r
eady version of your site.  
Ready to deploy. So, what do I 
mean?  Well, this is making your
 web site. It starts with your 
project and the first thing it 
does is passes through the new 
analyzer that Justin mentioned 
earlier. This lets us do a ton 
of cool stuff in the build 
process. For example it can 
analyze exactly what files and 
dependencies you're using and 
filter out all the other ones 
you're not. So this results in 
builds that are about 96-95 we 
saw, percent smaller than your 
actual development directory. By
 filtering out all the 
unnecessary stuff in your 
components and dependencies, 
directory. It does a ton of 
other cool stuff in the build 
pipeline, which you'll see in a 
second. The next thing we do is 
optimizer code, so we minify 
your code, we can render JavaSc
ript through  Babel, we optimize
 it for production ice in older 
browsers. Next we bundle your 
code, and so we combine files 
together based on the analysis 
we did earlier, we combine them 
where we can to reduce the 
number of request requests that 
your users need to make. And 
then we generate a Service 
Worker for you.  Again, because 
of the abnaturalizer, we know 
exactly what files you need to 
pre- cache on the browser to get
 an off like experience for your
 users. And that's it. So with 
the  CLI you get this full build
 pipeline from start to finish 
already configured and ready to 
use. And so we launched this and
 it was great. People are using 
it, using it on their project, 
but we started to get a lot of 
feature requests, and it turns 
out people like to customize 
their build process. Who knew?  
So we could of kept going and 
add any features, new options 
and new options for new features
. But, we had to take a step 
back and remember that with were
 working on something that was 
simple and easy to use, and we 
were doing that, but we were 
kind of leaving our advance use 
cases, more complex apps out in 
the rain. And if we kept that in
 feature -- adding feature after
 feature to help them as well we
 wouldn't have a simple Swiss 
army knife, we'd have something 
like this. This is probably the 
best representation of software 
that's hard to work with I've 
ever seen. That was until I real
ized that's a secret compartment
 in the handle filled with more 
tools (Laughing) and now that is
 the most just amazing photo I'v
e ever seen. And so I think 
we've all worked with something 
like, this right?  Semisoft ware
 trying to do way too Mitch and 
just  ends up hit yowling. Some 
software that trying to do way 
too much and ends up  hurting 
you. The CLI was never Mental 
Health
 meant to do -- never meant to 
do everything. We knew the build
 logic shouldn't live in the CLI
, it should live in it's own 
library that anyone could use. 
If you wanted to create your own
 pipeline you could do it, and 
we could give you the tools to 
help.  I want to show you a 
quick exam 38 of what this looks
 like, we only -- example of 
what this looks like. We need 
two things, Polymer Project and 
the second is Service Worker. 
Now let's recreate this entire 
build pipeline using some 
JavaScript. The first thing we 
need is your application, your 
code, and we're going to get 
that from two different streams 
from the project, sources and 
dependencies. We split it so you
 could handle it differently if 
you like, minify your 
dependencies, totally up to you,
 flexibility and power is the 
name of the game here. So we're 
going to combine them into one 
merge stream and then analyze t
hem. And that's going to power 
the rest of the build stream. 
We're going to optimize them and
 run it through some 
minification here of different 
tools for different code.  One 
thing really cool, split HTML 
and rejoin HTML, pull out in-
line code into the build files 
in the pipeline. That lets these
 tools see them and minify them 
before combining them back into 
in-line JavaScript CSS once 
again. Next rerun it through the
 bundler, which helps bundle 
them, which Justin talked about 
earlier. And finally, we write 
your build to disk and then 
create a Service Worker. The 
order on those is flipped, but 
the result is the same. You now 
have a complete build, a 
complete build pipeline, written
 in only a few lines of JavaScri
pt.  And now you can do anything
. So now, with JavaScript you 
can hook into one of these place
s to run something else. You can
 remove things, you can add new 
code, add new  minifiers, you 
have complete control over what 
you want to do here. And so 
that's really what we're talking
 about when we talk about the CL
I and the rest of these powerful
 tools. We want to give you one 
way to bring them all together 
easy to use, doesn't take a lot 
of work to get working. We also 
want to give everyone the tools 
20 go out and explore and create
 their own different 
implementations as they need 
them. So this provides a really 
nice off ramp from beginner to 
intermediate usage into the more
 complex usage as your project 
grows and matures. So that's 
gist a quick, quick overview, 
both of that he would says are 
available on NPM, the CLI helps 
you work with Web Components 
really easily. Polymer build 
helps you build if you'd like to
 do something with a bit more 
control. We're excited to keep 
developing these. Now I'm  going
 to hand back to Justin to talk 
a bit more thank you. 
(Applause).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Justin:  All right.  I hope 
most of you are able to use the 
CLI, very convenient tool, give 
us some feedback. We're going to
 try to do a final release at 
some point coming up here in the
 future. The CLI is just one way
 that we expose our core tools 
to users. But your terminal 
isn't the only place where you 
work. You certainly spend much 
more time in your text editor 
than you do at the terminal, 
unless you're one of VI or EMAX 
users. And so, there's some 
really important problems to 
solve while you're editing code.
 First, running crash is a real
ly bad way to finder reports. It
's much better to see the errors
 as you make them, if you can. 
Next APIs and documentation are 
hard to remember, and jumping 
between your editor and 
documentation just slows you  
down. And also, large codebases 
are hard to navigate. Text 
search isn't really advance 
enough for programming, and you 
want something better than that.
 So luckily these are all 
solvable problems, and they're 
solved in a lot of other progr
amming environments, and the 
declarative nature of HTML and 
Web Components give us the 
opportunity to deliver a world 
class editing experience for 
Webapps. It only makes sense to 
bring our tools right to where 
you work, in your editor.  I 
forgot to advance my slides. H
ere's some bulling et points ( 
(Laughing) so I'm happy to a
nnounce today that we're 
releasing a set of text editors 
for Polymer
 (Applause) and I'm not going to
 tell you about it. I'm going to
 bring on our other teammate, 
Peter to talk more about it.  
Welcome Peter. (Applause).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Peter:  Thanks a lot Justin, 
I'm really excited to be up here
 to unveil the work we've been 
doing on editor Plug-Ins, pr
oviding a fantastic developer 
experience has alls been part of
 the plan of the Polymer Team, 
only recently that our tooling 
infrastructure has caught up to 
our  ambitions. So I'll start by
 talking about Linting. We 
released last year PolyLint. Our
 first pass at Linting. It's 
very powerful.  Gives you a lot 
of great warnings and great 
investigation about problems 
that come up as you're writing 
Web Components (Great i
nformation about problems) but 
we learned something else from 
using it and getting feedback 
from people, it is too slow.  I 
mean for linting to be a really 
productive part of your develop
er experience, it has to be 
instantaneous. Anything less and
 you start to lose faith in it. 
You start to lose trust in it. 
You start to fall out of your 
flow and start questioning, what
 is the Linter doing?  Is it 
helping me here?  And worst of 
all it can sometimes start to 
make your text editor start to 
stutter, all that's totally 
unacceptable. So we built Lint 
with a new analyzer to have 
incredibly fast incremental 
updates of analysis of your code
, which lets us do much faster 
Linting.  The analyzer also 
gives you very precise 
information about what's going 
on in your source code so we can
 give you very precise underlin
es of problems. So let's take a 
quick look. So here is a text 
editor, it's called visual 
studio code, open source 
released by Microsoft. It's very
 fast, smooth, and existential. 
And here, it's running our new 
editor plug-in, we've got a red 
Squiggle under the HTML import, 
this this is a HTML file, it's 
under lining right where the 
problem is. We get an error 
message. Also notice how fast it
 is. As I'm typing each single 
character the moment it's 
correct the Squg Texasle goes 
away. It also understand 
JavaScript. So the moment 
there's a syntax error, let is 
fine, Foo is fine equals syntax 
error, string, everything's 
fine. Okay. So that's Linting. 
Linting is nice. Linting is good
. What else can we do?  What 
about intelligent, contextual, 
as you type, auto completion. So
 here we auto completed the 
paper-spinner Element, control 
space, I get all of the Docs 
extracted right out of the 
source codes. Scroll through  
them. You can push enter, auto 
complete that Element. Paper 
spinner is a really awesome 
Element, but it has a really 
simple API,  let's look at 
another Element that looks 
simple but has a surprising and 
under appreciated and rich API, 
paper button.  Okay, laytimes 
take a moment, go through what 
happened there, with everything 
single edit to this file, every 
single key press, we are 
reanalyzing this file. And the 
editor plug-in notices there was
 a new import  added, so it 
tracks down that file, parses it
, analyzes it, scans it, extract
s the met that data for those 
Elements -- Meta data for those 
Elements, including documentat
ion from JavaScript and HTML com
ments and puts it into a cache 
and the cache   is available as 
you're typing to power the auto 
completion, so when I added 
paper button import, I get paper
 button and paper button ripple 
and auto completion I'll select 
paper button, I'll move my cu
rsor over here, I push control 
space, and I get auto completion
 of the properties and attribute
s on that Element. (Applause)
 and we're able to extract a ton
 of structuring investigation 
about these attributes.  I know 
the types, I know the Docs for 
each of these had tributes, I 
also know where they were 
defined and if they were defined
 in another file or as part of 
another behavior, I can see that
 too. For example toggles  comes
 in adds part of Polymer.Iron
-button state. Mow many people 
any that you could use paper 
button as a toggle Element for a
 check box or radio button?  I 
had no idea.  Yeah, I see about 
ten hands, maybe. Um, it's a 
really powerful Element, I think
 it's really under appreciated 
because it's hard to track down 
all the documentation, takes you
 out of the flow to do it. What 
I wanted to do here is have a 
simple paper button with a 
little shadow, select raised 
I'll start typing because I want
 to customize it a little more, 
it narrows down the auto 
completion, as you'd expect I'll
 select elevation, but I didn't 
read the Dacs, I can mouse over 
and get a pop up for the 
documentation for the attribute.
 Okay, it's a number, and the 
number is zero to five, bigger 
is a deeper shadow. That's nice 
I'll select one, I might tweak 
it later. But what if I wanted 
to go a step further?  Maybe I 
wanted to understand how that 
shadow affect was implemented. 
How that raised Material Design 
comes in.  I can move my cursor 
over the raised attribute, and 
push a single button, F12 and 
jump straight to the definition 
of that attribute. (Applause)
 notice this isn't a totally 
different file, this is paper.
HTML. Not only that it's not 
part of my project. This is my 
components directory. That's not
 a problem for the analyzer, and
 not a problem for the editor 
service. But I didn't see e
levation there.  let's jump to 
that definition. Oh, right this 
is in a totally different file, 
this is in a behavior, right, so
 I'm now in paper button 
behavior.HTML. Okay, that's 
actually in a totally other 
package, paper behavior, paper 
button behavior.HTML. So that 
was coming in from a behavior, 
mixed into the paper button 
Element, and then made available
 right there in your editor. So,
 you might notice that I've been
 saying Custom Elements, Web 
Components, not just Polymer 
Elements here. We mean that. As 
Justin was saying earlier, we 
built the analyzer as a plugble,
 existential system for where 
you co -- it can notice multiple
 different ways of writing 
Custom Elements and declaring 
them. So let's take another look
 at another example. So this is 
a 100 percent Vanilla Custom 
Element declaration. The beauty 
of this, you can copy and paste 
this code directly into Chrome 
Canary or Safari technical 
preview, works with zero 
dependencies, this is not a 
Polymer Element, only of the Web
 Platform.  I can jump into 
index HTML and import vanilla 
and immediately I get auto 
completion for this vanilla 
Custom Element
.  (Applause) we've extracted 
the documentation and I can auto
 complete it. Go over to its 
attributes, get auto completion 
of it's attribution with 
documentation and type, if it's 
annotated.  I can mouse over for
 the pop-up, and select it and 
jump to  definition. That's 
right. Every single feature that
 I demonstrated today for 
Polymer Elements works exactly 
as well for vanilla Custom 
Elements. Blaze places Custom 
Element (Applause) and we do not
 want to stop there. If you're 
in the audience and you use 
another Custom Element Framework
 or the author of one, I know 
there's some in the audience, we
 want to work with you, join us 
on github or Slack channel, I'll
 be opening up the editor channe
l just after this talk. So, we 
have -- had one more dilemma 
when we were  implementing this.
 As I started to think about 
editors I went around to 2 
Polymer Team. There's about toe 
people on the team.  I started 
to ask them what editors they  
used.  I discovered a shocking 
fact. There are maybe 20 people 
on the team and there are six 
editors in active daily use. It
's kind of crazy, right?  But it
's also really good, that means 
the editor ecosystem is really 
competitive, and there's lots of
 great editors out there with 
lots of  features that are vying
 for your user experience. But 
what do we do as plug-in author?
  Well, we're taking inspiration
 from a number of other projects
 including rust go and 
TypeScript in implementing a 
stand alone editor service. This
 is a simple NodeJS binary. It's
 a complex NodeJS binary that 
exposes a very simple JSON API, 
and this  JSON is expressed in 
terms that every tickseeds to 
understands, file name, line 
numbers column numbers, so your 
editor can say, hey, my user is 
on line fifteen of index.HTML 
third column and they just push 
my jump to definition button, 
what do I do?  They don't know 
-- the text editor doesn't know 
HTML, doesn't know about 
JavaScript, doesn't know about 
any of the stuff, just says what
 do I do?  Where is the 
definition, and the Ed store 
says, vanilla.JS line 13 exactly
 the information your text 
editor needs to pop up a any tab
 and put your cursor exactly 
where the definition is. So 
we've proven this out, we've 
implemented plug-ins for visual 
studio code, sublime text
 and of choirs Ato
 mAll (Applause)  3 of these 
plug ins support, as you type 
linting, auto completion of cus
tom element tags and attributes.
 We are just getting started. We
 have an alpha release today. It
 is out now. The Polymer editor 
service is here. Contains full 
documentation about the protocol
 and how to add it. We have 1 
step install today. Ipm install 
polymer-ide for Atom. And in the
 VsCode actions pop up. To recap
, the editor plug ins make it 
way super easy to edit and main
tain your custom elements appli
cations. As you type Linting. As
 you type documentation auto com
plementation. And jump to defini
tion. With that, I'll hand it 
back to Justin. Thank you very 
much. (applause)
Justin: Yeah! That was really 
really awesome. I'm super excit
ed for all of you to use the ser
vice on the plug ins. W
e hav
e be
en testing it on the team. It is
 the improvement that makes you 
not just more productive, but 
happier. It removes a lot of 
frustration.  I want feedback as
 soon as I can get it. This is 
what it does. We are really exci
ted about it. Hope you are too. 
And that concludes our tour of 
tools. We have a lot of changes 
coming up we hope make you hap
pier users. And with projects 
like the analyzer and Linter, we
 hope to serve the entire eco 
system. It is important to us. 
Interoperability is a huge 
strength of web components. And 
we hope to push it forward. You 
might be wondering when you can 
use it. As you caw saw, some of 
it is available today. The Cli 
is in beta now. The new Linter 
and Bundler will be in preview 
soon through the Cli. And we w
ill be working on Npm and Yarn 
support soon. That does it for u
s. Thank you so much for joining
 us. Have a great day. (applause
)
Monica: Thank you so much to the
 tools team. Which it would be s
o much harder without. We have a
 break now. A code lab. The 
tools will be You can talk to

 Next we have Chris and John 
from Concast. They are a big in
ternet provider in America. They
 have been using Polymer since 0
.3. And on the first night they 
ate Beef Wellington. They drew 
the Polymer logo on the ce
iling. Give it up for Chris and 
John.
(applause)
All right. Good morning, London!
 Hello.
I told the people in the front, 
goodmorning London! Thank you. I
'm Chris.
- I'm John.
- We have to share the Beef Wel
lington story. When I travel I 
don't set goals what to eat or 
see. I leave it upto my wife. 
Due to some poor planning, she 
is 8,5 months pregnant. And we 
are here. It is apparently hard 
to travel when you are pregnant.
 She is watching at home. Hi 
love. We set this goal. We watch
 Masterchef of Gordon Ramsay. E
very year he makes the contest
ants make a Beef Wellington. 
This is a Beef Wellington. It is
 like a Polymer App. It has the 
App shell. Inside you put the 
meat. It is deliciucious. I as
ked my wife where to get it. She
 told Grenadeer Pub. We go to 
Grenadeer, and we are sitting 
there, look at the ceiling and 
like, look at all this American 
currency. Wait a minute, we are 
Americans! I have a dollar bill.
 John is a graphics designer. 
The bartender gives us a marker.
, hands it to John. I'm wearing 
my Liberty T-shirt. We are from 
Philadelphia. We put the Liberty
 Bell on there. That represents 
the exit from the UK for Aneri
ca. We decided to put that on 
there. We put the Polymer sym
bol. And so we got up on a bar
stool. Put it to the ceiling. If
 you go to the pub, on the left
handside you can look up. You c
an get a Beef Wellington or Bloo
dy Mary. They are famous for 
both of  them.
- We talk about Comcast. It is 
the largest cable tv and service
 provider in the US. We have 
over 30 million customers and we
 own NBC Universal. The family 
of tv-shows, movies and themep
arks. My cousin works at Harry 
Potter park.
We use Polymer and we have 500 
components that we created.
So, we get to work on a variety 
of different web technologies. 
This is the My Xfinity website. 
A lot of the customers start the
 days to get the news, weather, 
email. This was built with Ruby 
on rails.
This is the My
 account website. If they have 
issues they can troubleshoot. M
anage accounts. This is built 
with Angular. So, we have the X
finity home site. We started 
with 0.3. It has half a million 
customers. To change locks, or 
turn off lights, change the ther
mostate. We have the X-one plat
form. It is premier tv-experienc
es. The guide is awesome. And we
 make this guide available on 
all platforms. If you use the 
Web One that is also written in 
Polymer. It serves over a mil
lion customers per day. The f
irst question is: Why Polymer? 
Why did we choose Polymer? The 
story starts 2,5 years ago when 
our product team asked us to 
build the Xfinity Home. It did
n't look when we started like 
this. We had this new project. 
We got to choose the framework. 
As a lead, it was my job to 
start researching what was avail
able. There are hundreds of 
frameworks available. I narrowed
 it to Angular and React. I have
 been a web developer for 15 
years. I didn't feel comfortable
 with these frameworks. I'm talk
ing to Phil at work. To give you
 background on Phil. He is the 
guy who lives on the cutting 
edge. He reads all the latest 
news blogs and watches the 
Chrome developer tools. He is 
like, Service workers, this is 2
,5 years ago. As soon as it was 
available. We should be using it
 in production. Phil, calm down.
 We have to wait until the custo
mers have this. I'm talking to 
him. He is like, we should use 
Polymer. This is my son Theo. I 
taught him to say: Progressive 
Web Apps. It is so cute. He says
: Progressive Web Apps! And he 
understands the sounds. He can r
epeat it back. He has no idea 
what it means. That's how I felt
 when Phil said: We should use 
Polymer. Unlike my son I could 
Google it. What is Polymer? And 
so, I started looking through 
the documentation on Polymer and
 checking it out. I got the team
 together. It was time to make a
 decision. Of course, we asked 
the whiteboard what we should 
do. The pro's, and con's for 
whether we should use Polymer. 
One of the big things was that 
it was backed by Google. I'm 
overwhelmed, impressed by the 
Google, Polymer team and how 
great their engineers are bu
ilding stuff. The other thing 
that is good is future oriented.
 It is going to be built in the 
browsers. We get great speed 
from that. The documentation is 
amazing. Their technical writers
 are great and don't get enough 
applause. We should applause for
 them. (applause) Thank you, 
writers. That's the best app
lause of the day. And developers
 like doing something new. Some 
of the con's at the time was, 
this wasn't even beta. We were l
ooking at 0.3. It wasn't even al
pha. This was experimental. I 
didn't get the memo for that. 
And at the time, Polymer 05 and 
below used Shadow Dom. We were 
trying to click on a button that
 was in the Shadow Dom. I can't 
find this button. There is no 
testing, no tooling, web compon
ent tester wasn't out there. 
There was limited browser sup
port. We had to use web sockets.
 So, we were okay with that. We 
decided to go ahead with Poly
mer. When we first started, I 
was really nervous. We were buil
ding a production ready app for 
half a million customers. And 
when I started I was really n
ervous. I was just like, I was 
on the con side too by the way. 
I was like, we need to abandon 
ship. As we were developing and 
we were discovering, getting ov
er the hurdles, I really enjoyed
 Polymer and Web Components. To 
the point where I'm excited 
going around talking about Web 
Components and talk telling all 
the other developers: You should
 be using web components, they 
are great. And where the project
 is going with Polymer 2.0. Ulti
mately we did finish the site. 
There is another page with devic
es. Each is a component. The th
ermostate, light. It is great w
hen the team comes in. Can we 
put the light on the overview 
page? Yes sure. We started with 
Polymer 0.3. We released with 5.
6. And as we were releasing Poly
mer said, we have a 0.8 version.
 Here is the 1.0. Now you have 
to upgrade. Great. I'm telling 
Phil, this should take a couple 
of weeks. He said: No, it is 
going to be hard. We spent 3 
months upgrading. I'm excited 
about Polymer 2.0. I'm excited 
about hybrid mode and a better 
experience upgrading.
- Let's talk about sharing. And 
there are Lego's on this one. 
Keep This is a picture of my 
kids sharing Lego's. As I have 
learned, sharing doesn't come in
stinctively. You don't want to 
share your toys. There is screa
ming and crying involved. And 
share components with Polymer. 
You can get through without 
screaming or crying. To get 
people excited about Polymer Com
cast. Before it was a term in 
the vocabulary, we were looking 
at how we can make a consistent 
user experience. We are building
 for tv's, tablets, laptops, wat
ches now.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So our UX team put together 
this presentation on what they 
call module lar design system. A
 single component could appear 
different based on the context. 
This is the Xfinity Homes arm di
sarm, the usual context on the 
right happened side. On the left
 you can see how it would behave
 and appear in a different co
ntext. We're to longer designing
 and developing web sites, we're
 building components that can 
expose functionality on any web 
site. Camera, recorded TV show, 
pay your bill, really anything. 
When the X fin FYty home team 
started talking about Polymer, 
this got everyone excited, UX, 
product, business, I heard 
executives that weren't 
technical saying the word 
Polymer at meetings, I said what
 is going on here?  This is 
really  catching on. A year ago 
the day came when my boss came 
to me, so, John, the Xfinity 
Home team has been building with
 Polymer a lot, sharing 
components, time to prove this 
is a possibility. So what I want
 you to do is take that Xfinity 
Home individual it and put it on
 my XFINITY web site in two week
s.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Whoa, Whoa.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I said, okay, that sounds 
cool, never used Polymer before,
 but I'm excited for the 
opportunity.  I said okay, 
located the documentation, the 
documentation went well, I went 
to the Xfinity Home codebase, 
there's a bunch of components 
here, I figured out what is the 
armed disarm widget, how can I 
take this component and put it 
on the my XFINITY web site.  I 
talked to the  developers, and 
the immediate response was slow 
down, buddy, you can't take a 
component and drop it on another
 web site. But I'm like, that's 
what we sold this on, that's how
 we got the company to use it. 
As Chris said they started to 
build with 0.3, they upgrade to 
0.5, upgrade to 1.0, they were 
learning Polymer and the Polymer
 Team was learning Polymer. They
 didn't have time to do a sha
reable component, they were 
learning how to ship the web 
site. That didn't change my teem
 mow date, I still had two weeks
.  -- demo date I still had two 
weeks. We looked at it on the 
right-hand side to put the 
widget, so we put it right there
. So in two weeks I was at the 
demo and I successfully armed my
 security system at my house 
from the my XFINITY web site 
this is a defining moment for 
Polymer at Comcast, it proved we
 can create shareable, reusable 
components and use this across 
the board at the  company. This 
opened at the door for more 
projects to be used with Polymer
. Right now Chris and I have 
been working on a number of 
projects over the past year. We 
knew when we started the started
 the project we wanted shareable
, reusable components, a key 
aspect of what we wanted to 
build. We set out to build 
components to be shared across 
web sites.  We've been doing 
this for a number of months this
 year, actively sharing 
components, we can see what it's
 like to do this, and we eve 
come up with a set of best 
practices for shareable, 
reusable components. The first 
one is to use CORS, if you're 
not familiar is cross-origin 
resource sharing. This  allows 
you to go ahead if you're on one
 domain to make an API call with
 ajax or fetch to get data. This
 allows you to get around the 
same origin policy bypassing  
headers saying, I'd like to make
 a request here, and if you're 
on the white list you get the 
data right there. This is a key 
piece we had to do for the 
Xfinity Home disarm widget. That
 was built for Xfinity Home. 
When I dropped it on the web 
site, expected a relative path 
to the API, which didn't exist, 
I hard coded to go to the X 
finty web site T browser said no
, not  happening, we haded the C
ORS header there to pass the AP 
I to get to another web site.  
The other thing is to separate 
the data from the UI. And what I
 mean by this is a single compon
ent should not be in charge of  
fetching, processing, and render
ing data.  The UI component 
should take in the data it 
expects as attributes and pr
operties and render it, any 
properties should happen outside
 of it. We tried to create data 
components strictly dealt with 
fetching and processing, it had 
some issues, Chris will touch on
 that in a little bit. We tried
 redux in early indication seems
 to work  well. The key thing is
 to separate your data from the 
UI there. We also care a lot 
about testing, so you may be 
wondering if we we practice test
 driven development, TDD, we 
don't enforce that, we do 
enforce code coverage. We use 
the Istanbul plug-in for tester,
 that's pretty much the standard
 for JavaScript. And one of our 
Polymer projects has nearly one 
hundred percent test  coverage. 
In each one of those repeople 
standings we require one hundred
 percent test coverage across 
the board. And if you don't have
 a hundred percent test coverage
 and try to submit a pole 
request it will fail the CI for 
continuous integration. So we 
enforce this and this helps make
  developers feel more confident
 about using the shared 
components, they know they've 
been fully tested. We don't 
enforce TDD by we do enforce DDD
. And you're probably wondering 
what I'm talking about when I 
say that, Ben touched on this a 
bit yesterday, and that is demo 
driven development. And this is 
one thing that I love about what
 the Polymer Team has done. 
They've created these amazing 
library of open source 
components and in addition to 
great documentation they have 
these rich demo pages that show 
you exactly the code you need to
 use and how  it's going to look
 when you use that code.  We do 
the exact same thing, here is 
for example again, the Xfinity 
Home arm disarm widget the two 
different ways it can appear and
 the code required to do it.Ory 
teams have agreed this has help
ed them focus better on making 
shareable reasonable components,
 when you're constantly looking 
at the demo page it's clear what
 your goal are and what you need
 to be building. This has other 
advantages as well. For one it 
forces you to think in Shadow 
DOM even if you're using Shady 
DOM. What I mean by that is we 
had developers get started with 
Polymer, since we're using Shady
 DOM by default, they'll have an
 Element contained within a 
couple other Elements then 
they'll set styles in the outer 
Element that im  imimpacts the 
inner Element. That's 
technically possible because 
we're just Polyfilling Shadow 
DOM. If we turned on Shadow DOM 
that would break. When you're 
building different aexperiences 
on the demo page and looking 
another it, it forces you to 
think if it needs to look a 
different way I'm going go ahead
 and put it on the demo page. 
We're using on multiple web site
, if we make an itch date to the
 shared component component, we 
test that update on every 
individual web site. If you have
 every use case on the demo page
, it's much easier to go ahead, 
look at the demo page, if it 
works there it's going to work 
well on the web site. If there's
 a new case you node to add, add
 it to the demo page and you're 
geed to go. Remember DDD is the 
key to creating shareable, 
reusable components:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I couldn't let John be the 
only one with an achieving crow 
them, so I came up with  SPC, 
second party come boy innocents 
or it could mean shared Polymer 
components, it doesn't matter, 
acronyms are everywhere, this is
 not important. What I mean is 
that we have this thing called 
the universal  header, it appear
s on top of every one of our 
sites. It also comes with a 
universal footer. And the 
product team wants to be able to
 have this header and footer be 
shared across all the sites and 
easily updatable so they can 
change a link and all the sites 
get it instantly. This has been 
around for probably 7 years now.
 When it originally started it 
was a script tag you put on the 
page which would then load two I
 frames, an I frame for the 
header, an I frame for the f
ooter. Yes, it was an I frame (
Laughing) it was pretty disgust
ing. Then we started using Ruby 
on Rails a little bit, started 
doing it server side, so you 
could get a server side call and
 get a page and serve it before 
the user, you know, needed it. 
And then, you know, we started 
doing the single page apps, we 
don't want a server anymore. We 
came up with a new way of doing 
that, what we're doing is we 
said why don't we make this 
thing a web component?  We're 
like, yeah, web component sounds
 good. So what we did is we got 
the Polarais team to create the 
universal header as a web 
component. What you can do is 
you can actual actually import a
 web component from another 
domain. From another team, so we
 have another team building this
 navigation for us and we import
 it intoory project and now we h
ave an XC header and XC footer 
tag that we can use like normal 
DOM Elements. We got rid of the 
I frame, doing an I frame is 
really hard to do a responsive 
site to change the size of the I
 frame good luck trying that.  N
ow with this we can talk to the 
header, we can pass it 
information, we can change the 
styling, we can change the Z 
index a lot easier if we have 
pop-ups, all around much better.
 Also, when we first started 
with Polymer, we really drank 
the cool aid and thought 
everything should be a component
. We were so excited, we got to 
make it all a component! And so 
what happens is, with a typical 
Polymer site, for instance 
Xfinity Home, the code looks 
like this, where you load the 
Polyfill, you load Polymer, you 
load your vulcanized assets, by 
the way Vulcan nightion wasn't 
out when we started.  Came later
. Yes, it's Chris mass out here 
when it came out. But you then 
put in one poll component on the
 page which is your CH App. 
Inside of xh-app is all these 
additional component, you have 
authentication, API calls that 
are  happening, you have log in 
page, your overview page. And 
the problem with this is that 
per or Nans matters. We node to 
get -- performance matter, we 
need to get something in front 
of the user as quick as possible
.  With the X finty homesite we 
have to make an API kale, which 
goes all the way into the user's
 home, makes calls for all of 
their device in the home and 
then returns the status beaucoup
. That can take over two seconds
. We have to remember that the 
color lore PRPL also matters, so
 you can cross it off your bin 
go card. So really the critical 
path for us is getting the API 
calls happening as quickly as 
possible. If you look at the 
developer tools, when you have 
xh-app loading the browser has 
to get the definition for that, 
stamp it into the DOM, then it's
 like look at all these other 
modules, I have to get their 
definitions  the, stamp them 
into the DOM, do all this other 
work, now I'll start making the 
API calls. So we were making API
 calls almost a second in to the
 site loading for the user.  T
his was a big problem. So, as 
web  developers, again, I've 
been developing for the web for 
five teen years now, we have to 
get back to our roots. And we 
need to remember that Web 
Components are just another tool
 in our toolbox. And really  
like, this doesn't do us justice
 anymore, we have so many tools 
we need a big red truck to carry
 around all our tools. Another B
ingo card, use the platform. 
This is the Polymer motto, right
?  Like the platform hasn't 
changed. The browser is still 
the same browser that we've been
 using for fifteen years, yes, 
it's gotten better, faster 
progressively enhanced, but 
still relatively the same. And 
so we node to remember when we 
want something to happen sooner 
in the browser, all we have to 
do is put that piece at the top.
 And so what we did is we pilled
 out our authentication checking
 and our API calls and we 
stopped making them Polymer 
components. We just kept them as
 pure JavaScript. And we're 
checking whether the user is 
athenty Kateed before we load up
 the App. And we (Authenticated 
before we load up the App. And 
then while the calls are being 
made, we load the Polyfills, we 
load the  App, and we get 
started. So the user gets a much
 better experience. And we've 
also  checked out this App Shell
 Architecture:   It's always 
great we build all these apps 
and the Polymer T:EAM is here's 
the recommendation after we 
build the apps. For those this 
don't know, this is about 
splitting out your assets and 
giving a small package to the 
browser. A lot faster to process
 things that are small. But it 
takes advantage of this notion 
of unresolved Elements. What 
that means is when the browser 
sees a web component, anything 
with a hyphen in it, it goes 
greet, you're a web component, 
wait a minute, I don't have your
 definition yet. I'm just going 
to keep track of you, you're in 
Limbo, as soon as you get your 
definition I promise to come 
back and upgrade you. We can 
take advantage of this just like
 the App Shell Architecture is 
doing. So here for instance is 
how we normally create a 
definition for xh-app. And by 
using IMD, yet another acronym, 
import module definition. This 
is based on the AMD 
specification, it allows you to 
find modules. This was written 
by the Polymer Team to do de
finition with HTML um ports.  
We're defining xh-app as a 
module module we're able to push
 it down to the browser but not 
load the definition yet. And by 
doing that, we can then have 
additional JavaScript, like this
 loader mog you, which can do 
checking of, hey, is the user 
authenticated. If they're not 
authenticated I'm not going to 
spend the five hundred 
milliseconds to substantiate 
whichH App, I'll just second 
them to the log in page. That's 
much faster than all this 
JavaScript processing. So, 
performance.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So been talking a lot about 
how to build these Polymer 
components well and  
effectively. Let's talk about 
building the team of engineers 
that are going to build the P
olymer components and apps for 
you. The people we've built on 
to work on the Polymer projects 
allot Comcast externally or 
internal, about 20 percent had 
experience with Polymer before 
working on the application. That
 hasn't been an issue.  I feel 
that's due again to Polymer's  
missioning which is toous the 
platform. So if you have edge 
mothers that have a solid 
understanding of him hymn, CSS 
and JavaScript, -- I 
understanding of him him,   CSS 
and JavaScript that's all you 
need. The documentation for 
Polymer is great. Take a look at
 the Elements they created, the 
demo pages you can get a quick 
understanding of how Polymer 
works. Chris and I also have run
 hands on training sessions, m
ultiple times, and what we do is
 give a bunch of exercises, 
we'll factor in, bring in some 
of the videos prediction system 
the Polymer Summit. I'm excited 
to see the library has doubled 
inside, and use Polycast to bri
ng in those videos adds well. 
That gives the team a nice quick
 introduction how to use Polymer
. From leading the training 
sessions and reviewing developer
s code, we realize the hardest 
thing for developers to wrap 
their head around initially is 
the core parts of Web Components
, that's encapsulation, 
composition and separation of 
concerns.  Polymer was designed 
with these principles in mind, 
and you should be building your 
come boy innocents with these 
principles as well. On voice 
redials when it's not being 
respected looks like this. You 
see this from a number of 
developers when they first get 
started. They may come from 
large scale applications and us
ed to put in a lot of code. They
 put a component and put a ton 
of code in the file, this has 
over two towlines of code.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is real code too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We saw this, oh, no, what 
have we done, Polymer was to 
make thingless smaller and 
easier and we have developers 
writing code that looks like 
this. We needed to refocus the 
mind set of our developers. In 
our code reviews we're driving 
home a component should do one 
thing, and one thing well. If it
 starts to get too large, break 
it up into smaller components. 
Again, focus on those demo pages
, no one's going to want to 
maintain this massive page with 
all the perm yenations of a 
component. Once a team can 
internal aids those they become 
a will oiled machine and you 
become a Polymer champion for 
your organization.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So just to wrap it up, we 
really love Polymer. Polymer has
 been spreading like wild fire 
at Comcast because it's really 
simple to use. It's much easier 
to learn than some of the other 
Frameworks out there.  The 
ability to reuse components too,
 taking the Xfinity Home arm 
disarm module and dropping on 
another
 -- Italys products mind, once 
Web Components are native and 
running on the metal of any 
browser, it's so much faster 
than any Framework can do. So, 
again, that's why we really love
 Polymer, I'm Chris and I'm John
, we're from Comcast. (Applauds)
Monica: Yeah!
 It is so exciting when you see 
real companies use what you 
make. And real people look at 
them. Thanks for the talk. Next 
we have the Vadim team. They 
open source a lot of elements 
that they build with Polymer 
which I find exciting. Less ele
ments my team has to write. Fun 
facks facts about them. Marcus 
is one of my people, we hate cor
riander. 10% it tastes like
 soap. We want to start a movem
ent. 
Because
 it
 is discusting. Jouni is impres
sively Finnish. He does Finnish 
folk dancing and icehockey. As a
 Canadian I'm proud other people
 are doing icehockey. Please wel
come the Vadim team.
(applause)
Hey everyone.
- Hi.
- So, hi, my name is Marcus Hell
berg. I work as a developer. I 
have been doing front end to en
terprise systems.
- My name is Jouni. I'm a pro
duct designer and I have been 
working on the web over 10 years
 now. Also at Vadim for 10 
years. Today we are here to tell
 you why we think, like Comcast 
showed us, why Web Components 
and the platform makes so much 
sense in engine context.
To give you context. Our com
tany, Vaadin has a 16 years his
tory of helping companies build 
web applications with the frame
work. That comes with a big li
brary of components. We have 
been building web components for
 16 years. So, you can imagine 
we are excited when Web compone
nts standards came out. What it 
allowed us to do is take what we
 have learned over the past 15 
years and translate it into a  
new set of components we can run
 on the browser. We can have an 
audience of people who can use 
it aw and all the frameworks u
sers, get access to a wider li
brary of components. In the talk
 today, we want to make the case
 for why we believe the web plat
form with all the new features, 
coming out, makes sense for busi
ness applications. We also want 
to highlight the things that we 
at Vaadin do to help this make 
reality. How we build internally
 components. Compatibility with 
other web components. And how we
 make it customizable, so they c
an fit into your company's look 
and feel. We want to focus on 
business applications. I, know a
 lot of the material on web comp
onents tend to focus on web site
s and web shops. We want to make
 sure people who develop busi
ness applications understand it.
 It makes a lot of sense. What I
 mean by business application. 
The types of applications that 
help run a business. In a criti
cal part. They are more often in
ternal applications. Even if you
 start building one today with 
the latest and greatest technol
ogies. In 5 years it will still 
be in production. And I think, 
business apps get a bad  rep. 
These are the applications that 
a lot of the users spend their 
entire working day working on. 
So, it is really important to be
 able to deliver a good user e
xperience to these people. And 
that's where we at Vaadin made 
our motto to fight for simplicit
y. We want to make it as simple 
as possible for developers to 
build great en end user experien
ces. To give the developers the 
tools and components they need 
to build these great experienc
es. So, if you are checking the 
bingo card. You can do it now. 
Let's take a look at the reasons
 why we think that businesses 
should use the platform. First 
off. When we talk about business
 applcations, the internal ones,
 they are built with a tight bud
get. They don't bring in revenu 
to the company. We can save time
 and effort by focusing all of 
the work on building 1 great a
pplication, instead of spreading
 effort in building 2-3 on diffe
rent platforms. That means there
 is less for us to build and 
maintain. It means that we don't
 need separate teams in the com
pany that have the skills needed
 to build the s different apps. 
It takes care of the distribu
tion problem. We don't need to 
go around updating people's 
computers and devices. They can 
use the latest version. And the 
ability to stay updated is stron
g for the web platform. If we t
hink about the business appli
cations that have a long lifes
pan, it means somewhere down the
 road you have a need to update 
it, address things that you 
couldn't think of in the be
ginning. At the same time the ap
plication is in a critical posi
tion in the business. You can't 
toss it in the garbage. We have 
the possibility, like mentioned 
yesterday, to incrementally upg
rade in place. We could take the
 application, add a service work
er to it in poor network conditi
ons. We can find the problem are
as in the application and re
place it with web components. 
Start bringing the component 
base thinking without needing to
 rearchitect the surrounding ap
plication. Later on if we do a 
rewrite of the application, we 
can bring the components t along
 with us. This reusability web 
components allows us to do, not 
only across projects with the sa
me framework, but across proje
cts that use different platforms
 or frameworks, is really some
thing I think is unique to the 
web. In a business context where
 you have apps that were written
 years apart with different 
technologies it is a big thing. 
To get user experience to the d
ifferent applications. We are 
not there yet. We need to get 
that level of reusability. One 
is, how we make web components 
work great together with the 
frameworks. And how we make web
components so easily, to drop 
them in and make them look for 
that project. Before that, I 
want to bring Jouni here.
- Yes, what do we mean by when 
we say business great components
 or enterprise com great compo
nents. For people in suits or 
gold plated buttons? Well, of c
ourse not. For elements of V
aadin it is components when you 
build the complex business appli
cations. These components might 
be more complex feature rich 
ones or more s simple use case 
components. Now, all of the ele
ments are open source on Github.
 We test them with the latest 
Polymer perves versions and pro
vide support for functionality 
and compatibility. We build the 
elements as seamless extention 
to the Polymer catalog. Combi
ning the elements sets you have 
most of the components when buil
ding a complex application. Like
 the one you see now. We see the
 datagrid and upload elements, 
together with paper elements 
there. But, apart from the vi
sual feature that the e end u
sers see. What else is required 
from a high quality component? 
To put it briefly, it is a lot 
of work. So first off you need 
to consider both end users and 
developers alike. Starting from 
end users, there are multiple as
pects you need to take into 
consideration.
First usability. Can the ice 
other accomplish a certain use 
case with your component and 
hopefully with ease (User) this 
Accessibility, can the user 
perform that use case regardless
 of their own abilities?  
Performance. Does your component
 load, initialize and respond to
 user interact quickly?  
Responsive design, again, can 
the user accomplish those use 
cases regardless of their device
, screen size or input methods? 
 And last, robust or complex 
interaction design. Does your 
component handle the user input 
and interactions as intended in 
all of its different States?  
This is especially true for more
 complex business-oriented 
components with a large number 
of different features that need 
to work nicely in concert no 
matter what the combination of 
those features might be. Like Ta
ylor also mentioned in yesterday
's  keynote, doing all of this 
work on the web is very hard, so
 it requires a lot of specific 
technical knowledge and attentio
n to detail to get things right.
 And I also want to thank the po
ly miles an hour team for 
providing us tools that make 
this a lot easier (Polymer Team 
for making this easier) there's 
developers that you node to 
treat with equal respect for a c
omponent to be consideredded 
high quality. And again, for 
developers, there's usability, 
again from this time the point 
of view from the API. Is the API
 of your component intuitive and
 flexible. Can the developer 
make the component do what they 
need to make it do in their App?
  There's compatibility. Does 
your component -- is it usable 
together with various text Sacs 
or layout environments where the
 developer might want to use it?
  And last, but not least, like 
Comcast mentioned many times, 
great documentation is really 
necessary in order for developer
s to learn how to use your 
components  efficiently. Now 
this seems quite a lot, already,
 even though it's not an exhaust
ive list of what you need to 
consider. So how do we actually 
succeed in building these high q
uality components?  How do we 
maintain the complexity?  I'll 
give you a brief look at how we 
do this at Vaadin internally, 
yeah, we basically do the 
regular agile process with this,
 so regular design development 
and testing cycles, even though 
it's not a formal process that 
we follow there, it is on a high
 level how we do things and it a
pplies to like the whole 
components as well as the 
individual features of those 
components as we work on them 
piece by  piece. So we start w
ith design. And that begins by 
identifying the use cases that 
we try to cover with the 
component or with the feature. 
And those use cases usually come
 from existing projects, 
customers or users directly. And
 as examples when building a 
data query you might have use 
cases like select the date here 
today or select your birthday. 
And for us it's not very 
difficult to come up with these 
use cases as we're rebuilding 
some well established UI  
patterns, but it still a good id
ea to check that those patterns 
are still valid today and 
accommodate any new requirements
 such as small view port sizes 
or touch input. And  it's also a
 clear place to apply our motto 
and fight for simplicity. Now, 
researching existing solutions 
and reusing the parts that still
 hold up is a natural next step.
  But we're still not afraid to 
pursue and experiment with 
alternative or unconventional 
designs like withory date picker
 here. So we could -- with our 
date picker here. We could of 
gone with a more traditional 
design, but we wanted to see an 
alternative design with an 
infinite scroll calendar list 
would perform better. Once you 
have some designs, you usually 
want to validate your assumption
s, somehow. So you might not be 
sure of your alternatives, which
 one is the best or you might 
have some technical uncertainti
es that you want to validate or 
clear out somehow. And for that,
 you build something you test. 
So prototyping is the next step.
 And the type of prototype you 
build or use depends on the 
level of complexity of the use 
case, how confident you are in 
the design or what type of fe
edback you're looking for to get
 with the pro people standing 
type. So, for example, if (Pro 
people standing type) if you 
want to know if a design is 
technically feasible, you want 
to call that in the browser to 
get a real concrete feel of that
, or if you just unsure if 
something is visually prominent 
enough for end users, you might 
go with a static or animated 
mock up instead. Now, again, as 
examples for our date picker, 
one early prototype we did was 
this iOS or a version that make 
the iOS calendar App with zoom 
like interaction. We wanted to 
see if that's feasible to do in 
a browser. So we ended up coding
 that and seeing that work in 
different devices. Another one, 
later on was that we wanted to 
get a more tangible feel of the 
dual scrolling list that we had 
as an alternative design. So 
before investing time in 
prototyping that code, we did a 
clickble clickble prototype and 
did some early user feedback and
 testing to get more confidence 
before actually doing something 
in code. And, yes, like I 
mentioned, testing that's the 
primary purpose for your pro 
people standing
 your prototypes, and it works 
greet for end user testing. For 
developer and API testing, we 
usually do something different, 
so we have an API design 
available. We have some use case
 that we try to cover with that 
API. And then we draft some code
 examples based on those, so we 
use the API already, even though
 it's not implemented yet. We 
show that code example to 
different developers and get 
feedback on that early on. And 
before we ship a larger set of 
stable features like 1.0, we do 
these more formal usability test
s both for end users and develop
ers. We bring in more users and 
give them tasks that we want 
them to accomplish with our 
component, we observe and take 
notes during the session and so 
forth. And, of course, we do the
 more traditional compatibility 
testing on top of this, to make 
sure our components work with as
 many Framework, browser and 
platform combinations as 
possible. And, based on the 
learnings sometimes we end up 
changing the designs, so with 
this iOS-like zooming design we 
noticed that the performance  
wasn't that great on some device
s, so we  ended up designing 
something else. And with our -- 
we learned also with the image 
base clickble prototype users 
didn't have any more trouble 
selecting dates using the i
nfinite scrolling list. Many 
actually preferred it, so we 
went ahead with that design. We 
also noticed that we can 
actually combine the separate 
calendar and year and month 
scrolling list into a single 
view with this dual scrolling 
interaction that you see here, 
and that's what we ended up 
shipping.  And -- yeah, that's 
actually one of the last 
important steps in the cycle. 
Once you have confidence many 
your design and your imple
mentations you actually want to 
ship some features and other 
fixes after you have the 
confidence. And that's one 
really important aspect of 
business-grade components, that 
they have a road map how those 
are going to be, how the 
components are going to evolve 
and how they're going to be 
maintained. So we use Semantic 
versioning for our components, 
and what's the same for all of 
those versions, basically, is 
that we're constantly looking 
for feedback.  Please try out 
the versions early and provide 
feedback as much as possible, 
because that plays a big part on
 our maintenance and support 
efforts. So we try to respond to
 pull requests and issues as 
quickly as possible. We also 
have an active chat platform 
where you can ask questions from
 the team directly. So, don't 
hesitate in contacting us. And 
in addition to these we also off
er commercial support in case 
you need that. Now speaking of 
support, one question that we g
et a lot is how about Angular 2 
so I'll let Marcus tell you more
 about that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, as you probably know, Web
 Components are used with WebEx 
tenders they work great with a 
lot of The Framework and tools 
out there. Namely those that 
work directly with the DOM, 
directly with the web standards.
  Now there are some other 
Frameworks that abstract a 
little bit awhy from the DOM and
 bring -- bit a way there be the
 DOM and do things like data 
binding, in some Frameworks like
 in Angular 2, Web Components 
don't work as great as we would 
hope them to. So in order to 
help fix this issue, we have cre
ated universal Angular 2-polymer
 adapter.  This handles things 
like custom CSS and Shady DOM 
operations that ties in with the
 data binding system and makes 
shire the components work in 
forms and with the validation 
that Angular 2 has. You can 
install this on NPM. And once 
you've  installed it, you just 
import it in your module as 
Polymer Element. With the poly 
per Element imported, you will 
declare it for every Polymer 
component that you want to use 
use. In this case we're using 
both the Van combo box and paper
 input. No special support need
ed to build in the Polymer 
component itself, the wrapper 
will take care of all of that. 
So with those declarations in 
place, we're able to use these 
Polymer components just the same
 way as we would any Angular two
 component. So here we can see 
we bound the value of the combo 
box to the input and we're able 
20 do two-way data  binding 
between them. Next up we're 
going to talk about something I 
think is really exciting, 
something we've been working on 
for a while. Something I know a 
lot of people in the community 
have been asking us about. What 
if we can't do Material Design. 
 What if we want to have Web 
Components that look like our 
company, so Jouni?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, so how do you customize
 the look and feel like Mrcus 
said earlier, it's one of the 
aspects of reusability and 
compatibility that you want to 
affect how things like from proj
ect to project. And one thing we
 get asked a lot is that, yeah, 
Web Components look like a cool 
technology, our company design 
guidelines don't really allow 
Material Design, so how can we 
change the look and feel?  And 
we're running a survey current
ly, I pulled some direct quotes 
from there and highlight tissue.
 So there's one person saying 
that well, &quot;it doesn't provide &quot;
lookless&quot; Elements, you're 
pretty much tuck with Material 
Design&quot;.
Another one saying better 
decoupling of look and feel from
 code, paper essentially buys 
you into Material Design. So it
's a real issue for web 
component users or Polymer users
. So while Paper Elements are 
asome features, it's great, gist
 changing fonts and colors is 
not always enough, and you might
 get this face when you're 
trying to do something. But you 
might also be thinking that 
aren't there multiple existing C
SS Frameworks for web 
applications out there, like 
bootstrap, foundation, what have
 you.  Why can't we use those?  
Well, one big thing is those 
existing Frameworks rely on sp
ecific DOM structure and 
specifics CSS classes to apply 
those styles, adds you  know, 
that doesn't really play well 
with Shadow DOM, because you 
have to have complete control of
 the internals of your co
mponents in your whole lab. That
 kind of defeats the purpose of 
the reusable components, right. 
So you should be using custom 
properties and mixes instead. 
Another thing that existing 
Frameworks commonly do is that 
they require a build step when 
you want to customize something 
in the theme. So while that 
might be an okay thing to do on 
a high level when you're theming
 or customizing your complete 
App or multiple components at 
the same time, might be fine.  
But for individual components 
like, they should not rely on 
any build step to provide their 
theming capabilities, that also 
again doesn't make them really 
portable or row usable in 
multiple places. Or reusable in 
multiple places. So we want to 
get rid of this build step as 
well. We kind of already can, 
standard CSS already has most 
things that we need for theming.
 So a quick checklist of things 
that pre-processes  offer, so 
variables, check, we have custom
 properties now, shipping in 
multiple  browsers natively, 
mixins, that's in the spec 
coming up, I don't think it's 
natively shipping, the shady 
Polyfill or shim does that for 
us. Basic math is something -- 
sometimes need when doing 
customizable  themes. Well, 
that's really well supported alr
eady with the Calc function in 
CSS so we have that covered. 
These three things are just the 
bear essentials basically that 
we need. And it could also be 
almost all that we need. Now 
there might be some limitations 
with the shady CSS shim, but 
once native support gets better,
 we actually get more benefits 
like native inheritance and 
cascade of CSS. And one extra 
thing that I'm really looking 
for in the future is color 
computation, which is already in
 the CSS specs, but also not 
shipping anywhere yet.  And we 
don't have a good shim for that 
either. But once that comes out,
 it finally closes the gap 
between CSS preprocessors and 
standard CSS, so we get color 
lore computation in the browser.
 And -- color computation in the
 browser. And all of this run ti
me for more possibilities for 
theming, so you can adjust the 
theme run time. Now, the future 
for theming looks bright, I w
ould say, and we've been researc
hing and prototyping for a while
 with our component, and we want
 to bring you or offer you the 
possibility to really get a nice
 starting point quickly which 
you can then start customizing 
further to get the App -- or get
 the look for your App that you 
really need.  So these are just 
mock ups at this point.  And 
early prototype code, but it 
could give you a feel for what 
we're after here. So similar to 
Paper Elements you should be 
able to customize the high level
 theme using custom prompts, 
like the main color lores in 
your theme, the overall sizing 
and spacing of your components 
and fonts and that kind of stuff
. Now, in addition to these, you
 should be able to quite easily 
adjust other visual aspects as 
well, like rounded  corners, 
border styles, gradients, 
Shadows and stuff like that. And
 this level of customization is 
a key feature for Web Components
 to make sense in a business 
concept when you can have these 
reusable components from project
 to project and still make them 
look consistent within an App. 
And looking from an implement
ation point of  view, each 
component should expose similar
ly named mixins for different 
parts in  internals like 
sib-parts and for different 
States of those sub-parts. And, 
at that point, the component 
should basically look like look
less as one person said in the 
survey. So they shouldn't provid
e that much theming capabilities
 per se, if you compare to a 
native input. They should be 
quite minimum styling there. And
 then we can start building on 
top of that like a theming  
layer, and define our, for 
instance here, like the global 
stance for our input Element 
Elements wherefore they may be. 
We want our inputs to look like 
this. And then we can apply 
those styles at the same time to
 any of our components that 
actual hi use input Element 
other text input somewhere. And,
 the idea is that then we have 
these multiple styling points, d
ifferent type of themes for you 
to begin with and might offer 
different kind of features 
themselves. And then you can 
take one of those as a starting 
point and then start fine tuning
 and customizing and tweaking 
from there on using the mixins 
and custom properties that theme
 offers to really adjust that 
border on that one button right 
there. So, we have all of the 
Elements that you've seen in 
this presentation available 
already. So go check out the web
 site for many information on 
those. And we're really excited 
to get you this theming stuff, 
hopefully, already this year, 
some early stuff, so stay tuned 
for that, and briefly back to Ma
r Californiacus still.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. So I hope you see 
that we're very excited about 
all these new advances on the 
Web Platform, and we really look
 forward to seeing how we can 
use them to really make our 
developers live's easier. Make 
it easier for them to provide 
great end user experiences. So 
we have most of the Vaadin 
Elements team here today, and 
we'd really love to talk to you.
 If you see anyone with a 
reindeer shirt on, come and say 
hi, we would love to talk. A 
final thing I want to mention is
 that we're running a survey 
currently on trying to figure 
out how people are using Web 
Components and progressive 
Webapp technologies in the real 
world. If you have ten minutes 
to spare on your way home today 
and really want to help us 
affect the future of these 
technologies, please go to the 
link and fill in the survey. 
Thank you. Thank
Monica: Thanks so much. Awesome.
 I was feeling really late walk
ing on the stage. Our next 
speaker is Robin. It is going to
 be really good. The only thing 
standing in the way of me and 
lunch. He speaks as quickly as 
me. He will finish early. Food 
for everyone! Give it up for ev
eryone.
Robin:
 Hi everyone. Thanks for the in
troduction, Monica. Everyone 
knows, I blitch through this in 
15 minutes. 91 slides. They 
said, cool it down. I'm Robin 
Glen. You can find me on Twitter
. I'm going to talk about compo
nents to applications. With 
being where we are. If I say, I
'm from the big L.. You know w
hat I mean? That's Llandeilo. 
Bit I work here in London, or, 
the little L as we call it 
there. I work for a company Yoox
 Net a porter group. We are o
nline retailer. Multiple websi
tes on e-commerce. This time l
ast year I was, is that where 
you were, in Polymer summit. Not
 here, but in Amsterdam. We were
 showing off our first Polymer 
release, the product detail 
page. I wanted to show you to 
link you to talk. There is a pre
vious talk, me and a developer, 
did about production. If you are
 interested, you can read about 
it. I want to talk about why Web
 Components, but take a diffe
rence stance. Not as a develope
r. But talk at it from designer 
perspective. So, previously, our
 design team would submit this 
for a sign off. Design a page. 
Pass it to the company for sign 
off. They found the comments 
could be subjective. We like 
this here, maybe we change this 
H1. What you get is bottlenecks 
and designing inconsistencies. 
Move towards a design pattern, A
tomic design. We build in small 
atoms, that become a molecule an
d become an organism. They want
ed this pattern, to eliminate 
the bottlenecks and get consis
tency. They wanted something 
like this instead. Collection of
 components. And when they wa
nted to build something, they'd 
structure a few of these toge
ther. So this led us to come 
with this new concept. Atomic 
components. With a new design 
pattern for the backend. I want 
to go over the principles of ato
mic components. First is standar
dising the rhetoric. What I mean
 is the front-end team, the UX, 
the design, all the way to the A
PI teams talking about the same 
thing in the same way. It helps 
us to get better understanding 
of eachother's problems, promote
 collaboration oi instead of 
thinking in technology problems,
 we think customer focus prob
lems. Next is granular thinking.
 Breaking down. A talk that Ap
ple says, using the simple 
stick. Breaking down to smallest
 pieces. Using those principles.
 I'm going to talk you to a com
ponent. We use these principles 
to build it up together. The 
first part is the nucleus. As a 
designer and developer you are u
sed to this point. Where you bre
ak things down what is on the 
page. The product image. I have 
a badge, which identifies the 
product. Product description. 
And price. Those are just the 
primitives of this component 
that we need to build it. Next 
thing is more stuff. Let's look 
at states. This component will 
have some states. First is the 
skeleton state. The pre-loaded 
state before the product date 
has come  back. This is how it 
will look. And then you have a 
loaded state. The next state on 
top. So next thing is interac
tions. Now we started to build 
interactions in the component. 
The most basic one is the link. 
Generates a URL for where the 
product will take you. Next is 
some kind of interaction of 
hover or tab tap. To show 2 ima
ges.
We are going to build on again 
and add behaviors and rules. We 
have behavior for if the image 
has been broken. We don't want t
he standard broken image. We 
style it up a bit. We use respon
sive images using image source
set. And we use schema tags. I'
ll go into it in more detail. 
Add another one. Testing is im
portant for the component to be 
tested. We can abstract some of 
the complexity away. We do diff
erent tests. Unit tests. To make
 sure the product is working how
 we expect it to. So does the 
product behave when we run it on
 Source labs for multiple brow
ser operations. We also do SEO 
tests. Sorry. Can I have a glass
 of water? SEO tests are to make
 sure that the product looks exa
ctly how we think it does. For 
rich media snippets. Finally, 
visual testing. What we do is 
with the level of tollerance we 
test across different browsers, 
to make sure the product looks 
the same on different browsers. 
Sorry about this. Okay, that's 
how testing is done. Next is doc
umentation. It is important for 
the consumers and other clients 
to adopt this component. So, it 
is self documenting, using the 
Polymer standards. It also got a
 demo. How to use this component
? Versioning. Different consumer
s can change the component, but 
subscribe the changes when they 
want. Sorry, next is monitoring.
 Does this component need some 
way it is registering in the 
wild? And then all of those to
gether make an atom. You can see
 the union onion skin effect. 
You abstract complexity away. 
So, using these principles, 
let's build something. I am now
here near brave enough to do it 
in front of you. Here is one I 
built earlier. This is available
 in Open. If you want to check 
this out and apply the work I ha
ve done, feel free. The repo is 
there. 
My
Github is the RG. We are going 
to  beeld
 build a component. We removed a
 few points. It will be code h
eavy. This is how you use the co
mponent. An aptribute. That's 
the data content it needs. Every
thing it needs is inside there. 
I don't expect you to understand
 it all. This is how you do it 
with the backend team. There is 
a lot of product.Image. Attribu
tes that are passed through from
 the attribute we have seen. I 
want to focus on one specifical
ly, which is price. You can see 
we have a path price through. It
 is a property. It is a computed
 property. It is going to get g
enerated before the component 
gets rendered. You can see a met
hod there. You can pass it. Have
 a look how it works.
So, hear's a simple method, it's
 private,  it's documented at 
the top, this is how you, if you
 want to Mike Zelley of-document
 code, write like this, you get 
it all for free.  What does it 
do, it's basically returning the
 price, using a local string de
pending on the country whether 
you put the comma or full stop. 
That's all that method is doing.
  Let's look at how we might 
test this. We do two different 
types of testing, the first 
we'll call a unit test. So we 
ice web component tester, as you
 probably heard people talk 
about today, and we also use fix
 youred to stamp that in the DOM
 to make sure it's clean every 
time we run a test. What we're 
testing here is we're calling 
the private method, stubbing 
some data in there and making 
sure it works as expected .
This the a unit test. The next 
type of test is a component test
 this is to see does it work 
inside the component. Is the 
component doing what it's expect
ed to look like. You can see 
we're doing a simple assertion 
using fixture, checking the text
 content inside the selector 
making sure it's the right value
. We're using the element, 
dollar, dollar notation, the 
reason we do that, if you just 
do a query selector directly, 
when you use the test in the 
Shadow DOM, it can't pass the 
boppedry and it fails,. The next
 is are structured data. So, 
structured data is a way of 
identifying what a product is, 
what it looks like so Google can
 come along and see what it is. 
There's a link to a product Sc
hema, how you mark up a product.
 And basically the two minimum 
things you need to do is say, 
hey, this is a product, and this
 is the name. And then you can 
pass this to Google structure 
data testing tool and validate 
it for you like it's done here, 
ask that correct. So what we 
need to do first is put on the 
host attribute that it's a 
product, this is all it's doing 
the host another tribute inside 
your Polymer con instructor will
 allow you to do this. The next 
is we're going to mark the name 
as the name with this item prop,
 we're saying that property name
 is the name of the product.  
So, we want to be able to do 
this at CI level, we want to run
 these test automation, we don't
 want to copy and paste into 
Google structure data tool. We 
created this so that it can do 
it for you. It's on the github, 
you can do it.  I I'll explain 
quickly how it works. So this 
bit of code, when you're setting
 up your test, you grab the 
entire outer HTML and pass it 
into this method that's b
asically going to proxy call off
 to API, return back to Jason to
 get assertions on, get all of 
your HTML and pass straight into
 this module. Then you can run 
some assertions, these aSerbs 
are saying are there any errors?
  Is it a product?  Is the 
product name correct?
  Now we have automation testing
 of rich snippets, which is 
awesome. So, we build a little 
component.  We want to get to 
applications now. So this is a 
simple listing application, 
again, built, it's on github, it
's available to check out, it 
has full automation tests and 
you can play around with it. It
's pretty ugly, sorry, I just 
wanted to show you some simple 
features you can do. So this is 
the template, you can see it has
n't few sub components so we're 
using iron-ajax as a wrap around
 of HR request, product header, 
that's just the name of the list
, we have pagination which is 
the controls, and we've got a 
list of products, you can see 
how we've broken apart the sub 
components and each scab 
components has their own level 
of test, so you can test in 
isolation, so you don't have to 
test everything together, just 
how you expect it to work. So we
 have auto in iron-ajax. What 
this will do is automatically 
make the XHR request for you, if
 you make a change to the API 
kale, it will again make the 
change to the call. You have URL
, again, this will be important 
when I build up this structure. 
Again, a computed style, and 
we're going to pass in product 
per page and page number, the 
page number here is the key part
 that we're interested in. So 
just picture this, I'll build it
 all back up, just so you know, 
page number here is going to 
pagination, and it's got two 
curly brackets, it has two-way 
data binding, important when we 
build up this application.  So 
let's look at some of the 
components, the header one, all 
it's doing is generating the 
title, won't go into that. The 
one below is pagination, I tried
 to highlight for you there. Let
's look at that component. 
What's it got, it's got some 
buttons, previous, next, 
description, to tell you what 
page you're on, and then on the 
buttons we have sole on click 
events, let's look into those.  
So, we're going to call 
pagination next. So when we 
click it, we're going to set 
page number and we're going to 
increment it by one, when we 
click that, update the bank 
number by one, and that's it. So
 what does that do?  Page number
 has this notify property on.  I
 know there was a data flow talk
 yesterday, so people might be 
aware of this now. This notify 
is going to say, hey, I've 
changed, alert my parent that  
something's happened. So now let
's look at the
 list. The list here is a c
ollection of products, but it's 
in a DOM repeat. So what we're 
going to do
 is get afternoon array of 
products back and we're go going
 to iterate through each one and
 pass through our product 
component. We have that big  
stringfied JSON earlier, we're 
going to pass this reference 
directly into there. And this is
 called the mediator pattern. 
I'm going to try and talk it 
through, hard to understand, so 
I'll try and build it back up.  
Pagination, you hit next. It 
increments that page number. 
That's alerting the application 
above. The application is 
wrapping around the two sub 
components, pagination tells the
 application, the page number 
has changed.  The page number 
computed URL, then, 
automatically updates the API 
core, and iron-ajax on auto goes
 and makes the call, so it's 
gone and made the call, got some
 more data. Passed it down to 
the  application, and the applic
ation passed down to the 
children. So you can see the 
list would update. Okay. So now 
we need some more real world 
stuff. We've added some 
pagination, but our customers 
want to know orory clients want 
to know, is anyone using 
babbling nation, let's add track
ing, we can do that with behavi
ors. So what we're
 going to do is fire this vent 
is pagination and pass the page 
number. Then in our pagination 
component we're going to inherit
 this behavior, inherit this 
behavior called tracking 
behavior. Let me show you, it's 
another HTML import and you def
ine it like this, okay, let's 
create a new behavior, add this 
property. Inside we'll have a 
listener.  And the listener is 
going to listen for panel nation
, when it gets it, it's going to
 fire a track event page in 
addition. And here this is just 
a simple example of how you 
could use request call back to 
do some beacon pagination. Paul 
Louis has a great article on 
this, it's linked in the github.
  Call back now to track that 
Analytics. So using these, 
principles, that's all we had, 
these kind of patterns is how we
 created our new listening appli
cation, which is here. So this 
is currently been rolled out to 
a couple of -- a few high end 
customers who try out a specific
 products for us first.  But if 
anyone wants to see it, K and ta
lk to me after this, and I can 
show you it  working. I want to 
talk about some specific parts 
of this, we can -- and look at 
how some of them work and what 
we build on top of it. So this 
is, this is a sample of the 
application, and I know there's 
a lot of stuff, so don't worry 
about reading what's there. It's
 multiple components all broken 
down on top of this one. So we 
have stuff for errors, we have 
stuff for certain customers and 
personalization. We have  things
 for loading states, we have a 
Reuter, header, all of these sub
 components build up this 
application, and each one is 
tested in isolation so you don't
 have to worry about the 
complexity, it's all abstracted 
away from you. So I want to talk
 about some of the more exciting
 bits this this application that
 I think are quite exciting. So 
the first thing is performance. 
So we tried to adhere to the 
rail guidelines, I'm going to 
leave it run, it's hard to talk 
when it's happening and show you
 then I'll explain the theory. 
It's a short GIF. So this is 
Skeleton CSS, this is the load
ing approach that we took. So 
when there's no product data, we
 want to show something, so we 
get something on the screen as 
quick as we can, we don't know 
what it's going to be, we just 
scaup fold out the page. In test
ing we put this versus a spinner
 with artificial latency and 
showed with the customers, 
people thought the one with the 
spinner they throughout it was 
slower even though it's the same
 latency. So just get something 
on the screen as quick as we can
. So the next one is pagination,
 I'll leave you watch and then 
try to explain what happens. 
Okay, so what we do is when 
we're going toward we node to 
get product data and load 
images.  And we put a spinner 
only when it takes more than 400
 milliseconds based on RAIL 
guidelines, spinner is only 
there and it cares about the 
images that are in the  user's 
view port. They don't care if 
the bottom image hasn't loaded, 
they only care what they're 
looking at. The spinner is based
 on the promise of the image loa
d in their view portment when 
they go back it's instantaneous
ly moving back, we don't show 
the spinner or any transition, 
just keep it going this is to 
adhere to the guide lines of 
RAIL. Next I want to talk about 
telemetry or sit working -- if 
so, how well is it  working -- 
is it working, if so, how well 
is it working?  If you ever look
 into the web component Polyfill
 you see it fires an event web 
component ready when it's boot 
strapped itself. You can latch 
on to that, we do something 
clever with it where we add an 
event listener for web component
 ready, when web component ready
 happens, we run this try catch.
 We look for the component on 
the listening page we look for 
the.is method, and the dot is 
method if the structure is 
upgraded and it's available, 
however if it's not available it
 fails and throws this  error. 
Has that component been upgraded
 to a Polymer component. If it 
hasn't let's catch the error and
 we get data back. Is Polymer 
defined?  Has the HTML import 
for that component been success
fully imported?  This allows us 
to understand what's happening 
in the wild. Is it working?  If 
it's not  working how do we 
debug it?  When you loose a lot 
of stuff to clients you node to 
compensate for that somehow, 
this is one of the ways we do it
. Also we do some availability 
API availability and performance
 checks, this is like, okay, did
 the API fail when we try to get
 products, you can see like 
there's some error rites there. 
If it did fail, what's the 
status code, what is the reason 
that API failed, and then we 
have some API latency. How long 
did it take to make the API call
 and come back. These are great 
as developers, we can debug, 
look, and delve deeper into 
what's  going on in the 
application. They're not great 
for business customers our 
product  owners, how well is 
this performing for our customer
s, so we also have some other 
metric. This is customer perf
ormance  metrics, more tailored 
about how it's  working for our 
customers. So the first one is 
time to remove Skeleton. So when
 you saw the Skeleton state and 
when the products come in, 
that's how loaning it's taken. 
But not since you landed on the 
page, since the first network 
request came to the site, render
ed, painted and then remove that
 Skeleton, how long has that 
taken. We can tell our product 
inners, okay, we can say  it's 
within like under 3 seconds, 3  
seconds-ish that they will see 
products from first landing on 
that page. And then there's time
 to load paginated products. 
This is when you go, right, I've
 cliqued next,  waiting for the 
spinner and that's removed.  We 
can have metrics on that as to 
how long it takes them. So, the 
summary.  I went a little bit 
fast, I'm sorry, I hope that 
made sense, there was aInvest 
lot in time into reusable acces
sible and tested granular compo
nents. Promote code reuse. The 
developers will find the code 
and not reinvent the wheel. It 
helps for design and consistency
. The site behaves each time the
 same. Abstract complexity. 
Because you have put all of the 
testing and effort in the small 
components, the applications 
don't need to have as much cover
age. Plug and play components 
straight your applications. You 
can spend more time on the custo
mer experience and do the fun 
stuff. You don't want to rein
vent the wheel. No one wants to 
write fetch multiple times. You 
can use the component. I thought
 of a nice way to summarize, 
because we are in London. If you
 look after the pennies the 
pounds will look after themse
lves. Thanks for listening.
(applause)
monica: That was a perfectly 
reasonable speaking speech. It 
is time for lunch! Yeah! Food! 
Be back here at 2. The speakers 
will be in the Polymer lounge. 
We give them a chance to eat. I 
still have stickers. See you at 
2!

Monica: I did it! I timed it ri
ght. Welcome back from Lunch 
lunch. How was lunch?
You are awake? My goodness. W
elcome back. Next we have
 Jesiah and Josh. And Josh 
coasts coffee. They
 give you the news. Put your ha
nds together
.
- All right. First thing you'll 
notice. Why did they send the op
psiteposite height people over
 here. It is for the cameramen. 
We are going to stand next to 
eachother. I don't call it short
 but vertically challenged. 
There are a lot of benefits. I 
can fit in the trouser press at 
the hotel. Americans don't know 
what a prou trouser press is. It
 is wonderful. 
I hate ironing. I'm Jesiah McCan
n. Manage the core web develop
ment team at USA Today network.
- I'm a principle developer on 
the core web team.
- We are happy to be in London. 
We want to tell you a story. 
Being in the news, we are about 
story telling. We are going to 
tell you all our Polymer story. 
It is going to be exciting. B
efore we start, I wanted to give
 another round of applause for 
the speakers so far. It has been
 amazing and great. Everyone 
just... (applause)
Absolutely amazing. It is one of
 the most practical conferences.
 We have learned so much. We 
will take things back to the Sta
tes and hope you will too. If 
you can't tell we are Americans,
 that's gives it away. USA TODAY
 is the flagship
 of Gannett. There was a quick 
last slide on it. Use the plat
form! Great. Yes, yes. (appl
ause)
We definitely use that platform.
 You will see. National coverage
, we also have over 100 local 
newspaper brands. sharing the 
same wame framework. Engage the 
country. To national and to lo
cal. Which is interesting. We s
cale, is a big thing. We have 11
0 million users engaging in the 
digital platform every month. We
 have over 500 digital products 
at Gannett. Our products reach 
43% of the internet population. 
It is amazing. It is also really
 hard, because scale and stuff. 
1.1 billion page views on arti
cles, newsarticles per month. 
Just a little graph showing you,
 we are also
 in the UK as well. Of News 
Press. We own a lot of busine
sses across the world. Josh will
 talk about the current platform
 and on components.
- Currently, we have our own CMS
 system. We have an API layer. 
And all of that consume that. Na
tive and watches and tv's. And 
also the web products. So, we do
 adaptive delivery between 2 
code bases. Web and desktop code
base. We have a light one for mo
bile and big for desktop. We 
have some modularity built in. 
It is limited to per experience.
 Articles have a module system. 
The front pages have a modular 
system. And the modular system i
s different between mobile and 
desktop. It is what we want to 
move to, better modules. Both of
 the web front ends are built on
 Python, Django. It was modern b
ack in 2012. But...
- The 
very first time.
- This is 2016. And this is a 
very tightly coupled client-se
rver SPA. It is not a great expe
rience anymore. A sample of the 
mobile experience. Beginning of 
this year we started moving to 
how we can make this better for 
development and better for the u
sers. So, it is looking at impl
ementing a new framework. And 
started planning in spring. Star
ted rebuilding a little bit in 
May and June. The big reasons we
 wanted to rebuild, get these 
new progressive web type featu
res and out for the users, for 
better user experience. And for 
developers. We want to play with
 new things. They benefit the j 
business and the users. We want 
ability to support multiple si
ples sites. We have a lot of 
local properties. For tiny co
mmunities, to bigger ones that 
support big cities. A couple of 
big papers in Detroit, Arizona. 
A big  difference between the 
small and big sites. And the na
tional paper, USA TODAY. It 
makes it hard to build something
 custom per site. They get a 
little bit. We need to support 
dev teams. They have their own 
developers and build great thi
ngs for local markets. They have
 to build into the codebase that
 is shared between everybody. If
 it gets built for Detroit, it 
is in Arizona and USA TODAY and 
other places. We wanted a faster
 development process. It has 
been growing since 2012.
- Or the 1800's.
- You know, it gets big and beco
mes clumsy to develop on it. 
Hard to test it and deploy it. 
The bundle keeps getting bigger.
 That's what we move to. In June
 the backend of the new frame
work, which is really cool. And 
then we started building our 
first project on it.
- So, we jumped head long into 
Polymer. And, the first experi
ence that we built out with Poly
mer ever, we said, maybe we'll 
do something in small, not that 
big of a deal... No, we are g
oing to build the whole Olympic 
experience with Polymer! We 
could have jumped in. And said, 
this is going to be the proof of
 concept. And, this is a kind of
 summary of the project. I have 
some shots of it as well. We 
needed the display, different 
data, from the 2016 Rio Olymp
ics. All the data that is coming
 in about the schedule, the res
ults, country specific things. 
Medal counts. Awards were coming
 in. Deep dive into athlete 
biography. We were writing a lot
 about the interesting things. A
 lot of stories, generating a 
lot of content. Photo's and vi
deo's. That was recirculating 
through the data driven expe
rience. This is something that 
needs to be available on the do
main names of all of our differ
ent properties. Not just usato
day.Com. But the chronicle.Com. 
The framework needs to know the 
context of the site. One of the 
things we don't do now, we don't
 have a responsive site, usato
day or the rest of the sites. We
 are doing adaptive delivery 
with device detection. This is 
the first real big responsive 
experience with the focus on 
doing mobile best, mobile first.
 We'll show you. This is the sc
hedule page. The thing about da
ta, about the olympics is there 
is a lot of it. A lot of data 
coming in a lot of different 
ways. A lot of results that are 
not necessarily you know exactly
 what the results and data types
 coming back. It is very diffe
rent, especially for the diffe
rent sports. America had a lot o
f medals on that one. And, then 
our athlete bio's. This is a 
small snapshot of all the datap
oints and filtering through. 
Knowing more about a country and
 athlete. Then, I mentioned mob
ile. Mobile performance is key 
for us. You can see sort of that
 complex data here being rende
red nicely in the mobile expe
rience. Little bit more about 
the project. Here s the fun part
. You can't move the opening 
ceremonies. We had 30 days to 
build the site and the expe
rience. We tested that. Let's 
add more man power to a late 
software project. It will make i
t fine. And so we tested that in
 this limited real world examp
le. Yes, newly highly develop
ers. You can see where this is g
oing. I can tell, it is the hurd
le jump. It is a good story. It 
has a good ending. Strong exis
ting webtech skills though, ba
sed on the new team. An amazing 
team. It is full of people right
 out of college, actually. But 
they had really strong web 
skills. The overall experience 
though, there was a lot of jun
iors. And varied between juniors
 to principlespal. And brandnew 
polymer framework. This is
 going to be fun. We had a lot o
f coffee, in order to fuel. We 
would be roasting our own cof
fee. How many of you turned cof
fee into code? How many tea into
 code? We'll talk later! Part of
 this was changing the way, not 
only our development team was 
thinking about coding. Thinking 
about changing from this page dr
iven way of developing to web c
omponents. Educating the rest os
e the com of the company, the de
partment, in thinking of web com
ponents.  Starting from moving e
veryone. Here is a page. Think 
about modules, componitizing to 
making atomic elements.
For our design, it was encourag
ing standardisation. We had at 
first when we talked about modu
les, we had a lot of modules 
that did the same thing but had 
slight variations. Let's make 
this work everywhere.So let's 
create better standards and here
's what a page looks here and 
here's what a page looks there. 
If for UX and I A content based 
on data source. Because there 
was so much data and all those 
different components were re
trieving their data from 
different sources and doing d
ifferent business logic for that
 data, it was really, rately 
important, that at least for us 
in our small time frame, that we
 group things by similar data 
sources. Otherwise the congress 
text wouldn't flow right. And it
 meat it a little bit harder to 
develop (Context wouldn't flow 
right) ourel product manager's 
to even our  QA, it was testing 
and planning these features, 
these individual modules instead
 of full page testing, full page
 QA and just even writing ticket
s about the stories, about 
planning, it was all modular 
based, component based and not 
here's this page and here's that
 page. And then this conference 
is talking to a lot of developer
s about thinking in Web 
Components, for our web develop
ment team a big way we delivered
 in thirty days, the division of
 labor was really important, we 
could have some people working 
on this component, some people 
work working on that component, 
and that was able to play to 
developer's individual strengths
, meaning someone who's very, 
very Front-End focused could do 
a lot of the styling, and could 
help, you know, others that 
weren't with the styling, then 
we had some more data driven 
individuals two were connecting 
all the, you know, complex piece
s of data from different places 
all together. So that division 
of labor played a key role. How 
that looked too was there was 
some interns that we had for the
 summer, and we were able to 
throw them on just modules where
 they didn't immediate to really
 know about the Olympics and 
what was happening or all the 
complex data that was going on. 
They could focus on this little 
one thing, here's a story, 
research that you're building, I
 can focus on that, and I don't 
need all the noise going on 
around me, pause there was a lot
 of noise. That focus helped us 
meet the deadline with that 
division of labor, which was 
just asome, we before able to do
 that, not, beyond the way that 
we were doing before in a 
platform that we were doing 
before, but faking advantage of 
think but taking advantage of 
Web Components
. Josh is going to talk about 
all the hurdles,.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Like any big project, we 
faced a lot of hurdles. Our 
approach was to be as agile and 
flexible as possible with 
features and how we were 
approaching the project 
otherwise we wouldn't meet the 
deadline. So the first hurdle we
 really faced was the schedule. 
As we've said, 30 days to build 
it. So the first thing we had to
 rethink was how we were going 
to do a TypeScript integration. 
 We started planning out our 
Front-End framework, oh, we 
rally like TypeScript, we really
 want to use this with Polymer. 
So we had these great ideas for 
how we were going to try and do 
it but getting that integrated 
before we started doing all the 
development wasn't going to get 
that developer experience where 
we wanted it. We ended  going 
with a hybrid approach with some
 of our developers were just 
building plain  Vanilla Polymer 
Elements, some were doing with 
TypeScript with a code behind 
approach.  We did one file for 
the JavaScript, one file for the
 Polymer Element, and then just 
use a script tag to link over to
 the JS version of the TypeScrip
t file, that way we're able to 
do coding in TypeScript and get 
the benefits there, but the down
 side was you're now coding in 
two different files, you're  
jumping back and forth in your 
editors, it really wasn't a 
great experience. It also caused
 other problems I'll touch on 
later.  We also eliminated how 
much packaging and fall backs we
 were doing. So it would be 
great to be able to say we did 
all this great support for 
legacy browsers, and all these 
great different approaches to 
http2, and what not. Yeah, we 
didn't get to that, refocused on
 modern browsers, focused on 
supporting the browser that we 
knew the majority of our users 
were on and just focused on 
building the best experience 
that we could for our widest 
audience. We also kind of 
delayed this SystemJS and JSPM 
integration that we had planned.
 This was another feature like 
the TypeScript we had great 
plans for our framework, oh we 
can do all this great stuff to 
support third party JS libraries
 that maybe somebody's going to 
want to use. We realized we d
on't need third party JS for 
anything we're building in the 
Olympics, so we don't need to 
build this  now. Something we 
put in there now in our 
framework that we're kind of 
working on, we'll touch on that 
a bit. But we found that we 
really didn't need any other 
libraries, we were able to just 
ice Polymer for this.  So our 
next hurdle was performance (We 
were very new at building 
Polymer, so we made some of the 
same mistakes that we heard from
 other companies that they made 
when they first started. The 
first was too many components. 
We jumped in head first and said
 we wanted to build everything 
as ammonal yule.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So many components, 
components for everybody (
Laughing).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And that ended up with a 
really slow page because we had 
thousands of components on the 
page. Kind of hand in hand with 
that is our components were too 
complex. So we just made these 
gigantic components and you saw 
from the little video, there was
 a lot of data on that page and 
there was a lot of variations on
 it, so there were a lot of DOM 
if statements controlling 
whether it was showing anarch up
 or if it was a -- showing a 
match up or something like 
boxing or a hundred meter dash 
where you have ten people 
competing at the same time. 
You're going to have little 
differences in how you're 
displaying that data. Those 
complex things ended slowing us 
down. We had to go back and 
watch Polymer videos from last 
year's  Summit, figuring out way
s to improve things, figuring 
ways to improve speed of 
components by over ten times. We
 were able to get  things really
 good and get performance to a 
place we're really happy with. 
When we first built some of the 
very first components we were a 
little nervous because of how 
slow it was that was because we 
hadn't thought about performance
 at all. It's just kind of 
saying that when you're building
 stuff, you do have to think 
about it a little bit. You can't
 go out and build everything as 
components and build them crazy 
complex and expect it to be 
super fast. But if you do it 
right, they are super fast, and 
they are awesome. The last thing
 was flash of un-styled content.
 Which was as things were load
ing in, we initially weren't 
doing much to do anything about 
it.  And so the page looked 
really Funky. So we put some 
basic styles in that focused on 
like the navigation, the page 
structure. And that helped get 
the page to look a lot better as
 the content was coming in. The 
last hurdle we faced was testing
, partly because of the schedule
 we didn't really get tov a test
ing framework in place. And we 
kind of pushed off a lot of the 
testing towards the last minute.
 Which meant we ran into some CS
S things that we should of 
caught sooner, plainly around 
Flexbox, it was the first time 
using Flexbox drastically across
 all the stuff we before doing, 
we found little variations 
between different browser 
manufacturers in how they  
implemented features of Flexbox.
 We had some weird pages at 
first, it took going back 
through CSS and making it 
standardized across browsers. 
Also with JavaScript cam pat
tability. This is where the 
TypeScript I want grace hurt us 
a little bit. We started using 
ES6 features that aren't 
cross-browser everywhere because
 we were using them in the 
TypeScript code, then switch 
back over to plain vanilla 
Polymer Element, you start using
 arrow functions because you're 
so used to doing it. But then 
some other browser would say, 
hey, I don't know what &quot;let&quot;  
means now you have a JavaScript 
error, and your component 
doesn't work. So that's  where, 
like switching back and forth 
between TypeScript and vanilla 
JavaScript really  wasn't a good
 idea. The final thing was H  
TTP 2 delivery. Also the first 
time we had done anything with 
http2 and having the whole site 
on SSL. We ran into issues where
 we okay, hey, we heard all the 
talks about how great http2 S. 
let's just push all our resource
s and things will be awesome and
 fast. Not always the case, 
there are times when you tonight
 want to push resources, 
sometimes it's better to preload
 them. We hadn't thought all 
those things through, when we 
first launched there were stuff 
that could have been faster if 
we weren't pushing it. We found 
those things out post launch, we
 were able to fix it now, that w
as something where more testing 
and thinking about A/B testing f
or performance is this feature 
really going to make us faster 
or is it going to slow us down 
even though we heard it's the 
great thing to do. So now  Josia
 is going to tell us how things 
turned out.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One of the other interesting 
things with on boarding, 
basically a new team for that 
matter into a any framework was 
the strategy for us and building
 up a platform on Web Components
 was not to use a monolithic 
JavaScript framework. Keeping 
keeping anything that was 
framework light and slim and 
playing up to components. You'll
 notice in the video and another
 win I'll show in a second, it's
 not really SPA driven, it's  
notingually using kind of the 
App shell stuff, which is 
interesting, it's still multi- 
page kind of loading, which I'll
 talk about a little bit more in
 a second.  Thankfully deploying
 utter Tivoli saved us.   -- 
Itteratively saved us, we moved 
along from loaning deployments 
where it took an hour, two hours
 and moved more towards and 
integration approach to these 
Web Components and pages that 
had Web Components on them.  
We're also able to launch with a
 subset of features because they
 weren't a awarding any metals 
right away on the open ceremony,
 we started with the schedule 
because the schedule was really,
 really important. So we're able
 to do subset, iterative in 
order to meet our dead line. So 
we're adding additional modules 
as the games were going on and 
as, the games began, so you can 
see that over here in this 
quadrant up in my -- in this 
upper right hand corner this we 
went from sort of this 
recirculation experience to add
ing our metal module there so we
 could get you to more data 
driven page. And Olympics data 
is just part of the  difficulty,
 it was so tricky and very 
inflexible. Boxing and some of 
the fighting sports they award 
two bronze metals. Wait, wait, 
what?  What?  I thought 
everything was gold, silver, 
bronze, two bronze metals in 
swimming apparently you can have
 three silver metals because 
that makes sense to a data 
scientist. It's like Ah! There 
were  lots of challenges with 
the data, we were able to 
overcomb them because of doing  
things interactively. The team 
was working something that was, 
in general, easy to own board, 
and was not difficult to work 
with.  So ... back to 
performance baud it was a hurdle
 .
How did we do?  Did we win the 
gold, did we win the silver, did
 we win two-prong metals?  I 
don't know. Actually I do. How 
did Polymer perform against our 
existing baseline infrastructure
 of USA.com and what we've built
 and what we've been using for 
many years now. And so, the 
average page load roughly was 
equivalent to our current 
platform. You can go on USA 
TODAY and check out what that 
kind of speed is. But keep in 
mind, this is without any time 
devoted to performance tuning at
 all because there was no time 
to do per foyer mans tuning. We 
were im -- we were 30 days and 
that was it. So that we just by 
using Polymer and building this 
experience out we were able to 
get roughly where we are with 
our current platform. So our 
audience reach. This is really, 
really cool. This and the rest 
of our Olympics reporting that 
we did actually raced USA 
network, the entire network up t
o number 2 for Com scores news 
and information category across 
the nation. And question just 
had amazing numbers coming in 
116 percent increase from our 
2012 Summer Games and our data 
driven experience was a core 
part of that, as long as all the
 interesting stories and report
ing that went on during the real
 Olympics. So, I don't want to 
spend too much time on this 
because it's the E word, electi
ons. But they're coming whether 
we like it or not it's  
happening. (Laughs) but guess 
what we did?  We did it again in
 another 30 days. This was 
pretty insane, let's do it again
. And we did it again. But 
what's different this time based
 on what we learned before, we 
had more thought into module 
composition, how we were making 
modules, not pitting DOM ifs 
everywhere, using them properly.
 Optimizing, this is our chance 
to optimize our  loading,ory 
caching the preload and pushnd 
http2 thing we were talking 
about earlier.  And then from a 
mobile performance standpoint it
 was part of our platform is, 
you know, maybe you don't need 
every single module loaded on 
your mobile experience.  Maybe 
that's kind of a sub tracktive 
experience and you have a 
lighter page load therement so 
that experience, which ask kind 
of a sneak previe looks 
something like this.  We have a 
-- previe looks something like 
this. We have a nice map loaded 
in (Preview) we have cat that 
from key races that are  going 
to be battleground states this 
year.  Let's check on -- let's 
Google California.  Let's see 
specific state outlooks, race 
ratings, poll averages, and, I 
guess we can, I mean we could 
change, you know, the data --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, they're just Elements, 
you can go in there and tweak 
it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We can make anyone win that 
we want?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's not going to really 
change it. But you can make it 
whatever you want.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's the great thing about 
Web Components, change it, all 
of a sudden I'm winning, which 
might be better than the other 
options. That's all the time we 
have for you today. That was our
 thirty day, and really another 
thirty day march with the power 
of web come boy innocents onory 
side being able to do the 
impossible with a brand new team
 who had never worked with Web 
Components before. Which says a 
lot about both the enterprise 
readiness of Polymer and about 
that on-boarding developer 
experience.  Thank you so much. 
(Applause)
Monica: I think I use the olymp
ics graph every day if Canada 
was winning goals. They weren't.
 Canada had the most bronzes. We
 tried, but we let everyone win,
 because we were so polite. I 
had 2 announcements. First is, 
we are going to have a panel at 
the end of the day. We'd like 
questions from the audience. If 
you have questions, tweet them 
as #askpolymersummit. If you 
want to fill in the Web compo
nents survey. We would appreci
ate. The
 Websurvey..
1
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Than1 yo2016. audience
Websurvey2016. Next is Ivy. He 
is born on a leap day. He is 4 
times younger than everyone in 
the
 audience. Eiji.
- I'm working at Google, as Moni
ca said, I was born on leap day.
 Asian people look younger than 
other people. But I'm actually 
younger. I'm going to talk about
 sign in and payments without 
forms. So, last month, I was 
going to purchase a tv rack. I 
knew what I wanted. I searched f
or the web for that product. And
 found the most reasonable deal 
at a website. I decided to pur
chase that using my mobile. Acco
rding to research 66% of the pur
chases are done through mobile 
web, rather than native web. I 
went to continue to checkout 
form and tried to fill out the f
orm. But in the end, I gave it 
up. The reason is that, you 
know, the in experience to fill 
out forms is so painful.. Typing
 credit card information, passw
ord. On ty tiny software key
board. It is frustrating expe
rience. The same research tells 
that the convergence rate on mo
bile web is 66% fewer compared t
o that on the desktop. Even for 
returning users, remembering and
 typing their password is a 
pain. Another study shows that 9
2% of users who visited your web
site leaves without recovering 
their account when they forget 
their password. Causing a lot of
 friction. We need to fix that. 
In order to overcome this situat
ion, with a platform, we have 
come up with 2 new API'S. Pay
ment request API and credential 
management API. I'm going to 
show you a demo webshop we int
roduced. How we integrated the A
PI's play nice together.
So, this is the Polymer shop web
site. It looks nice, right? Ima
gine that I'm looking for a s
weater or clothes for upcoming w
inter. Let's explore the webs
ite. By the way, this looks all 
good, right? You want it. But, 
these are not actual shop. 
Please don't send us an email 
when you can get the goods deli
vered. We actually had that. Any
way, let's continue. This one,

this. The price looks good. 38, 
85. Buy now. Now you see a dia
log pops up from the bottom. And
 this is actually done by API. 
Payment register API. At the top
, the summary, shows the price 
of the goods. 38.85 that's corr
ect. Let's continue. Next one, 
is shipping address. What is sur
prising is that my address info
rmation, of course, these are 
fake, but  show up. What is nice
 about this is, that I am not si
gned in or up to this website 
yet. This information is already
 available. Why? I have entered 
this information in the past. 
The browser remembers my address
 information. I can use it. So, 
let's select one. And, the next 
ons if one is shipping option. 
Standard shipping or express 
shipping. I'm not in a hurry. I 
can select standard shipping. No
tice that by selecting one, the 
other summary has added a new 
price. Standard shipping. The 
total cost has been changed. And
 now, I go to the payment. And, 
like my address information, my 
creditcard information is filled
 in. It is quite nice, right? 
And lastly, contact information.
 My email address is there. 
Looks good. Okay, everything loo
ks good. I can just proceed to 
payment. Pay. Then, I get my cvc
 and confirm. And done. So, i
magine that I wasn't explaining 
all this. It is only a few taps.
 Without  typing a single 
letter, using a software key
board. An amazing experience. 
And now we are at the confir
mation page. It is good after ma
king the purchase. Users can use
 a guest check out. Which is 
much lower for users. And motiva
ted to create an account. You ma
y provide some reason. You can 
provide 10% discount for the ne
xt purchase. Or maybe you can 
provide a feature. Why not? Let
's sign up. So, email address is
 as you see already filled out. 
It is nice. Because it was provi
ded by the API. It is already 
filled. All I have to do is type
 my new password here. And sign 
up. And done. And now, if yo
u look at the bottom of the 
page. It is asking me if I want 
to store my credential informati
on. Nice. This will make my next
 visit to this website much much
 easier. The browser assists me 
to sign in. Here is a new thing.
 By using the API, the things 
got much easier. Letting me sign
 in by a single tap. I'm going 
to swap and buy store new one.
So, what is going to happen is 
that the credential information 
I have
 had in the other device is syn
chronized across my Google 
account. It should be now in my 
other device and hopefully it 
will work. Let's see. To be hon
est, this sometimes fails. 
Fingers crossed. Okay, ready? 
Look at the bottom of the page.
 Boom! I'm signed in. (applause)
so, imagine that, you know, you 
have to sign in by tapping some
thing at least. But with this, 
you have no action required to 
sign in. Continue your shopping 
experience. This is really nice.
 Okay, can you come back to the 
page? Slides. So,
 this beautiful integration was 
possible because of the payment 
request Api. I'm going to intro
duce each of the Api's. Payment 
request Api. It provides a stand
ard compliant online payment 
flow. Usually making payment you
 fill in a long form and submit 
that. But with payment request 
Api you can instead of filling 
out the form, a few taps to subm
it the same information. If 
there are no address or creditc
ard information available, users
 can add them on the fly. The 
address information can be sto
red and synchronised across devi
ces and available from every
where for future experience of 
shopping. The best is, once the 
information is stored to the 
browser, we basically have all 
the data required to get through
 the payment flow.And without 
creating an account. Even for 
the users who have never visited
 your web site before can make a
 purchase. And it's easy. 
Payment request API also applies
 third party payment methods to 
be part of the ecosystem. Anyone
 would be able to provide an App
 or Webapp to -- for merchants 
to process payment in the future
. One such effort is Android 
payment for payment register API
, which is currently in Beta and
 you can try it out. To learn mo
re about payment request API, we
 provide integration guide and 
demo site and so on, you can 
follow
 the lick G.c pavement payment: 
 Payment API we created a c
omponent, shop payment request. 
Nice thing about making it a web
 component is that the sum of 
the defined parameters can be 
set as Element attributes. 
Declaratively like currency supp
orted methods and requests pay 
or e-mail and so on. It's 
declarative. Requesttion payment
 can be done through a function 
kale because it returns a 
promise you can just continue 
with sending the result to 
payment processors. B when the 
promise resolves. Now about the 
credential management API, it 
provides a program maltic 
interface to the browser's 
password so you can store the 
user credential information on 
behalf of the  user. As you have
 seen as the Polymer shop demo 
you can enabling auto sign in by
  obtaining credential informat
ion and send it over to the 
server on behalf of the user 
which is authentication. Signing
 in using a third party identity
 such as Google is quite popular
, it allows users to sign in by 
one tap. It's also good for your
 security. But the problem is 
that that kind of information is
 not stored to the browser. So 
you forget which identity 
provider youoused to sign into 
this web site, right. But by 
using credential management AP I
, it can even remember that 
information. So by storing the 
choice of your log in account, 
you can invoke identity location
 logic to let the user sign in. 
Even if you chose not to use 
eight sign in you can use the 
sign in form by choosing a user 
without typing a  password. This
 feature is useful for those 
that have multiple accounts. So 
it's handy.  And droid apps have
 a similar feature kaled smart 
lock for passwords. By 
associating your Android App on 
your web site you can share the 
same credential information bet
ween them. So, if a user stores 
the credential information to 
Android App by signing up, can 
-- the user can come back to the
 same web site associated web 
site to get aught signed in. 
Which is awesome.  --  Auth -- 
to learn more about credential 
management API, we also provide 
integration guide and so on, you
 can follow the link on the 
screen. And integrating this sh
op credential management API and
 entire authentication mechanism
 was we created by shop account 
component. We put various feat
ures into this. For example, 
form UI, actually included UI 
and loading UI, notification UI 
as well as authentication logic 
log in logic and credential 
management API and also managing
 profile data. So it's very 
complex. The point is that a lot
 of different parts of the App 
required to access those kind of
 information or logic, so what 
we've done is decided to 
splitted that into two parts. 
One is shop account, the same 
name with all the UI related  
things, and the new one is  
shop-account-data, which handles
 the athen thinkcation logic 
related things as well as 
managing profile data. By adding
 Iron meta behavior to the shop 
account data, we made it 
available throughout the App. A
lso, by returning a promise, 
things got much simpler by 
chaining functions to reflect 
results to the UI depending on 
the context. So to  recap, 
Polymer shop, I started with 
Polymer shop demo andante grated
 two APIs, which is payment 
request API, and credential 
management API. And how we 
integrated into Polymer shop. 
And lastly, I forgot to mention 
what about the TV rack I was 
going to purchase, and what I've
 done was after abandoning my 
purchase on the check out  form,
 I just went form and opened up 
my laptop and continued my 
purchase. And it's happily 
sitting in my living room. So 
I'm very happy. Yeah. I'm hoping
, I'm really hoping that the day
 will come soon where I could 
finish the entire shopping 
experience using mobile web. 
Thank you. (Applause)
.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Monica Dinculescu:  Thank you
, Eiji. As someone who has a 
tormented relationship with 
input Elements and forms.  I eke
 excited there is something 
better than that, up next we 
have a Paul and Surma, I was  
going to make a funny but the
re's nothing inheritly funny 
about a bald guy and a German, 
Paul plays the saxophone, Surma 
 means manslaughter in Finnish. 
They're going to be live coding 
for you here, so put your hands 
together for the Paul and Surma 
show.  (Applause).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello Oooo, am I on. Yes, I'm
 lowed,.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Am I?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, I am.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How you doing?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not bad, in the back how you 
doing?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Whooo.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In the front?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah! Left yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I love the idea that you can 
figure out where broadly speaki
ng people are from by the way 
they cheer.  I came out of tower
 hill station this morning and 
yesterday, and it reminded me 
last
 time itches at toyer hill was 
to go to the tower of London 
with Paul Irish -- who --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Who by the way is not Irish 
--
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Shocking.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We were there and the 
gentleman went are you ready for
 the tour. And even went W we 
weww in that British style apart
 from Paul who went Yhooo, I 
loved it because the Yoma invest
 said, there's an American in 
the crowd. Which I said, I think
 it's fine, he paid. So Surma 
and I we run a show called super
 charged call super charged 
charged.com/developers. What we 
normally do is we formally spend
 some time live coding on a live
 stream some URR Elements we 
thought -- some UR Elements we 
thought we'd do it live, live, 
that idea of doing live coding.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you ever watched the show 
before we have the YouTube live 
chat and I read it and I 
distract him when the questions 
come up.  Today we're going to 
use the Polymer Slack channel, 
the people in the room, the 
people watching the stream at 
home or at work, wherefore. Come
 in to the super charge channel 
and ask your question throughout
 the live stream. I'm going to 
watch the chat and reading it 
providing I can keep up. And I'm
 going to try to wave in all the
 questions that you have, and 
we'll try to answer them, if we 
know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So the idea is I'm Good even
ing to build a UI Element, 
normally it's quite practical, 
but not today it's going to be 
overblown and ridiculous.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We call it showbiz.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We do. You can see what's on 
my screen, I mine as well get 
started with code.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Because we get the question 
all the time, this is VS code.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. HTML.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Snippets are you friend.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm a bad typier.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anyone want to do how many 
typos he does, I would be 
curious to see that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Don't do that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rel equals import, async -- 
I'm not going to do Polymer, I'm
 going to use the  platform. I'm
 going   straight --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I never head that before 
today. Use the platform.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; #banking.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Href equals (#branding.  ).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Imagine a disk, it has a 
value on the front, one two 
three four, whatever, you click 
it, flips over in 3D, why not, 
on the back you can chose win 
two three four, and it flips ba
ck over and shows you the 
current value.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's like a tab but in 3D.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm going to call it flip 
switch.HTML.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Before on the show we used 
Custom Element Element, but only
 V 0.  I didn't watch any of the
 talks, I didn't know how V1 
works.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't know how anything 
works.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'll beg Kateed by this, I'll
 ask questions you know the 
answers to.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, flip switch.JS.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh rings' everybody doing in 
the chat.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Suddenly we have a synergy of
 people, which is great.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome. So what I've got is 
I've got, let me see, let me see
 if I can explain what I'm 
actually doing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My first question would be 
you're in a separate file 
already, no Doc type.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, it's an HTML import, 
which I called async, because 
I'm being good about that, I 
have my Custom Element. My 
theory is I'll use all the web 
component programtives that make
 sense here. I'm going I have a 
template stamped into the Shadow
 DOM of the thing I'm making. F
lip switch.js, and friends don't
 let friends write out Custom 
Elements by hand, they have 
snippets. Oh, yeah.  (Laughing) 
because if I was left alone to 
write things like the con 
instructor, I would forget to 
call super and that would break 
everything, I don't know why it 
breaks everything, if you don't,
 the browsers ghoulaaarrr, if it
's super, it's fine, it's an 
HTML Element.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is all new. Previously 
the con instructor would shot be
 called you would have to 
creative call back. The one we 
actually moved to the contact.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I like how you bumped it to V
 2.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Whoa, don't do that! By
 the way this is is -- see, 
class, it doesn't like that,  
noooooo ... so let's make it 
okay with it, yes, Lint -- ES6. 
Now it's fine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I didn't know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It didn't know. That's fine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, let's make sure it's 
actually  working, console.log. 
Flip switch! . Oooooh there's my
 server. Yes, there's a start.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What did we just to?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It figured out that -- see 
now every time I switch, -- 
there we go. It figured out I 
have a flip switch in my payment
 and called the con instructor 
and now it's spat out flip 
switch. We're going to faster 
than this if we want to make 
progress. So let me make shire 
this is actually going to work, 
let's do some styles this here. 
And I'm going to tell the host 
that I want to be background, 
readies play, block. Width, 2   
0E PX, height, -- 200 PX, don't 
mock my typing because it's 
awfulment 200 percent, 200 PX.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Units are hard.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know. Now here's the thing,
 we're going to try to snap it 
into the Shadow DOM. It's in the
 import, I have to know what 
import it is. That's the main 
document, current  script, yeah.
 It'll be current script. Who's 
running?  Which is this. Who's 
the owner of that Doc, I own the
 document for that. Yeah, it's 
this one. Now I can say --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wait only Doc and can be diff
erent.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The document is document and 
the other document is the owner 
of the current script.  So I can
 now say Doc.query selector, 
like  so, and I can ask for my F
S temple which is going to need 
a hash on the front because  
it's an ID, and then I can do --
 oh, yeah, this.attach shadow 
... sounds so good every time I 
say it. Mode, open, I'm going to
 let it be open. That's what it 
means, basically are you allowed
 to access the shadow root from 
outside or not. I'm wrong, 
somebody's going to Katie 
Corrigan recollect, probably on 
the chat.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm watching it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It means that you can't -- 
only the people that have the 
reference can return by this can
 use the shadow root if it's not
 open.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sounds about right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Would make sense.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm going to append child. 
I'm going to say TMPL. -- you 
have do that on the template,
.clone node deep is try, did I 
say this?  VS code was like deep
 ...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, do this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, I have a red block. Got 
to get more showbiz than this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And we're done.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we're done, see you 
later. In the main page, let's 
do some myth busting. Style --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Typo.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Shut up.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right, HTML body Ooop 
width one hundred percent, I'm 
going to headache this thing 
take up a hundred percent why 
not.  Width hundred percent, 
margin zero, padding zero. And 
here's the thing, when somebody 
tells you that you can't 
vertically align in CSS, they're
 lying to you, because with two 
lines, display flex, align-items
:  Center;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Even I nigh that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There we go, vertically align
ed. And  also, justify-... see, 
told you. And now  it's actually
 in the middle. So good, Flexbox
, so good.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I remember when you had to do
 zero by zero picture object 
relative fifty percent.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Shout out to spacer GIFs.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Those were good times (
Laughing).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Glad we had this chat. Feel
ing quite emotional. Now I will 
start adding some stuff. Now if 
it's going to do that thing be 
it's going to flip forward, 
something with a front and back,
 I'll make a container for those
, I have a feeling I'm going to 
need one, yes, I'm going to need
 one, I'm going to put things 
like perspective on, so &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; 
crag equals front, just what it 
says on  the -- we'll need one 
for the back as well.  Back, 
back. Back. How's the chat doing
.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm assuming this is the 
front side and backside of the 
thing that we mentioned.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's the one, that's the 
one.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We've done something similar 
before with a 3D card flip where
 we, I guess talk more about the
 shadow than the actual card 
flip in the end because we had t
o do it  efficiently to get the 
6 0E FPS U. but we had like a 
front and a back, and basically 
one thing was becoming visible 
and the other one becoming 
invisible when things are 
flipping over. Watch that 
episode, they're all YouTube, on
 demand, maybe good to fall a
sleep with or something.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, to the sound of our 
voices.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Probably not.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. So I positioned 
absolutely width, hundred 
percent, top left zero, decide 
to break out the containing 
Element, the parent which is 
container is statically position
ed so we have to say positioned.
 We'll do relative. And that'll 
brings them back in.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That looks pretty.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know, looks amazing, give 
me time, I have a lot of faith 
in where we're going.  Right, 
there's still not a hundred 
percent, wow, you need to be 
width a hundred percent, that's 
why. The container needs to be a
 hundred percent, now there we 
go. In the middle. But it looks 
ridiculous. Let's fix that, 
we'll set background Ooooo here
's an idea, let's do color --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Custom properties.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Color -- this will be a green
-like color.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Of course you know that (
Laughing) oh, by the way, just 
because before anybody ( 
(Laughing) Whoooaaaa (Applause).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A 3 is more than two, six and
 one -- all right, all right, 
fine, fine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; By the way, I don't know what
 we're doing today, to be fair 
we wanted to say that Paul did 
rehearse this we're strictly 
time box this time and don't 
have this discrimination that we
 can go on as long as we want to
. So, this has been rehearsed by
 him, not by me, so I don't know
.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks for telling them, for 
telling them that was green by 
myself.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We don't immediate the red 
anymore we know this is working.
 The front 234 the back and the 
back is sitting on front of the 
back which we don't want, we 
want a front and a back face, we
 want to rotate the back face by
 180-degrees.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But like the front side --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have a front and a back, 
right, so the front is facing us
, but the back is also facing us
, which is not real life, the 
back has to face away. Okay, so 
we have to do a transform, and, 
we're doing rotate Y 180-degrees
 like so. And now the back -- it
 is back but because the way 3D 
transforms work, they show do 
you the back face of the thing 
by default.  I's back face 
visible?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Back face visibility.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get your CSS right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sorry. Back face visibility, 
I can't type today. And hidden. 
Okay, that will make the back --
 the back is still there but it
's now hidden away.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you ever done open GL or 
web GL work you will have 
encounted similar behavior. So 
if you had flipped something 
around, sometimes it's visible, 
sometimes it's not depending on 
how you configure the engine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's do the bit where it 
flips over, that's more fun. In 
oridance herb to do  that, is on
 the host I'm going to set a 
perspectivewhich you set always 
in fix  sells, I'm going to push
 the container -- in the pixels,
 I'm going to push it back 250 
pixels, it will pivot and push 
the front and the back another 
250 so when they flip forward 
it'll be at zero. Does that make
 sense?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I guess.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's do transform.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We don't have -- a flipper 
and just draw.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We so a theory corner.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Theory echo.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; See, that's the German.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  -- tell them what the German
 a is for  CSS. Ca) in German 
about
 26 letter
s long).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I push it back into Z space 
or Zed space.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DisZ go into the monitor or 
out of the monitor. So the 
access goes out.  I can never 
memorize that. Well, here we are
. At the moment it's basically 
what it was like 133 pixels, 
right. And the reason is, if you
 want to work out how many are 
going to scale up or down by the
 perspective value divided by p
erspective minus the distance, 
which was minus 250.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is literally in the spec
, it's in a note, a one liner. 
By the way if you would like to 
know if this is the math you're 
always looking for. That's like 
133 because that's like 66 
percent of the 200, right.  
That's why it's that size. So 
what we'll do, tell you what 
we'll do, push the front and the
 back like so.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Are they asking anything.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Robe is answering almost 
everything,  God -- I don't want
 to say you're redundant, but 
I'm glad you're here with me. (
Laughing) shout out to Surma.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, I put the -- you might
 not have seen, actually, I put 
in the extra transform but it 
department do anything. It's 
still at 133, you would have 
expected it to go another 256 
pixels back, the switch flip has
 a perspective value of a   0 
the container pushed back by 250
 pixels, the obtainer is in the 
way with the item with pers
pective, it goes Lol, no. We 
have to ask the congress taper 
to preserve the parent's 
perspective and pass it down to 
the children, we can do by doing
 transform style preserve 3D. 
And now it'll get smaller. Okay.
 So that now is basically said 
I'll take the parent's 
perspective and pass it to the 
children. Now that's all good. 
How are we doing for time.  Are 
we doing all right is this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's easy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So, what we were doing 
the thing where the obtainer -- 
what we'll do is flip it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So one theme in the questions
 right now, is it going to work 
in Firefox, is it going to work 
in Safari.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; With Polyfills yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It probably would work, we 
always say this in our show all 
the time, this is not production
 ready code. We're doing this on
 stage, it's probably horrible, 
don't copy and paste it out. It
's about the technique, and it's
 going to work in Chrome right 
away, we develop in Chrome and 
you could probably use Polyfills
 to work everywhere else.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you didn't use Shadow DOM 
you could make it work as far 
back as which ever browsers were
 the last to get 3D transform.  
It should be fine in IE 10 
maybe.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It should be, I don't know. 
If you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you want to try, make it 
work in IE ten it's your 
homework.  It is going to rotate
 180 degrees. We should see our 
cards go over. We have to ask 
for the container. This.Containe
r. What was it called? It was 
called container.
- People ask to zoom in a bit. 
Why not?
- 
Fine.
- Also on the website. Maybe 
not.
- Here we go. I like to do this.
- The Paul trick.
- No, I'm not going to do this. 
When you click, I'm going to do 
it this way to check everything 
is working. I'm going to flip 
things over. I need a function 
called Flip.
- You are giving the element in 
Api. Nice of you.
- This.Container.Classlist.Tog
gle flipped. Which is going to 
do nothing. No, it is. I'm an id
iot. There you go. Zoom that in 
a little bit. Now the back is 
upside down. Which looks ridicu
lous. Transition on transform. 
And I do honestly this is the ni
cer.
- That's a new one? You usually 
have 0, 0.
- That's really broken. Let's 
fix it. Do you know why?
- I don't know.
- I have seen it before. The 
front and back. I have a transf
orm. I overwrite the back with 
the transform with the rotateY.
- We have a question!
- Hang on. There you go.
- See! The only downside it is 
upside down.
- It is physically correct.
- Let's rotate it in Z. 180 de
grees. And, yeah! Look at that. 
What is the question?
- You added eventlist in uncon
nected?
- Yes,.
- If you remove the element from
 the Dom.
- In a disconnected callback I 
would.
- Production ready code.
- I'll put that in. Right. Where
 were we? The thing is, when you
 click on this, that's kinda o
kay. Let's add some buttons. 
Which we'll do in here. We'll 
have a button.
- Speaking of. Now that you had 
experience with v0 and v1 of 
custom elements and Shadow Dom, 
preferences, differences?
- I think it is still awesome. 
It uses the constructors for cri
tical callback. This is a
 callback. For me, mostly, this 
hasn't really changed. If you 
didn't change you have to de
clare as a static.
- Performance optimisation. Cus
tom elements define and not re
gister element.
- Yes.
- Syntactic changes.
- It is quite fine. We had but
tons on the front. Attractive 
looking one. Let's style up the 
different buttons. Let's do that
. Oh dear, right. Front button. 
Right. width. 100%. Height 100%.
 Let's see.
- That's repetitive.
- Border radius 50%. Outline no
ne. Font size 60 pixels. Backg
round none. It is grey at the 
moment. Border, none. Don't want
 any of that. Yeah. Cool. Nana
na. Make a white color. There we
 go. Let's do... There we go.
- Someone is suggesting maki u
sing mix-in for the sizes.
- In production using tooling.
- We are using what we see on
 screen. The python webserver.
- I'm using a box shadow. Inset.
 With 0 on the XY, on the blur. 
All zero. And 10 pixel spread. W
hich will bring it in 10 pixels.
 Which is kinda cool.
 There you go.
- Why not?
- That's fine. On the back.
- Ship it. I'm trying to save 
time.
Back. We'll do the back ones. I 
get to do something I enjoy on 
this. 25%. It is 4 of them. We
'll make them smaller. Make it 
smaller.
- Someone suggested we use a 
transition box shadow.
- No, no, no, no noy. No! No!
- If you don't know, that's what
 it was about.
- You don't do that. Because, it
 will trigger paint on every fra
me of the animation. So far, you
 have seen me stick to transf
orms. That For that reason.
- Always?
- they are the only properties 
today will animate in an accelle
rated version. Layers on the Gpu
. Or we can fade them in and 
out. It is really fast. Painting
 on every frame is a gamble.
- Mobile you mostly will not.
- You can with
...
If I was doing it differently. I
'd use a before and after. And 
faded in or scale it.
It doesn't involve paint. Where 
was I? In the background. We are
 going to do an inverse color 
thing going on. Like that. And 
wow... That's small. Okay. They 
look ridiculous. Let's put them 
in a nicer place. Position, abso
lute, top. 50%. This is one of 
my favorite little things. When 
you do that, and you've got 
them. They are in the middle. B
ut it is the top left corder in 
the middle. Middle, mled middle 
would be good. You can do a 
translate. Transform. Minus 50%.
- Because the fun is, it works 
on uses for the percentages. Of 
the elements used. Not the paren
t.
- So handy! So good. Right. Now,
 let's see, we have backbones. 
Let's position a bit more... End
 of type 1. I'm going to assume 
we have 4 boxes. It is prototype
 code. So, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Right.
 Bot
tom one stays at -50. And bump 
it up another 100%. 2 is going 
to the side. + 50.
- A ring around.
- Yes, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- A game pad thing. We are going
 to use the gamepad.Api?
- No, shut up. Let's find out if
 it works.
- Sounds abtout rig about right.
 1, 2, 3, 4.
They have a transform here. As 
the default. And a transform 
here. We couldn't take advantage
 of the fact that the parent 
gets flipped. We can do an ani
mation. By doing this. I got it.
 Don't repeat yourself, Paul. G
rab that. Let's make the button 
animate. You didn't see that.
- Let's slow down.
- Great feature of dev tools.
-You can put a delay or curve.
- Thanks for that. Transition de
lay.
- I know some stuff.
- You know loads of stuff. Let's
 delay the animation. We'll do, 
you know, you know, I think that
 a bit of delay... There we go. 
You see how they spread out at 
the end? And then... That's 
good. Change the value. When you
 change the buttons. The value 
on the front. We can do it with,
 let's think about it. Set valu
e.
- Now you are going fancy.
- I know. So good. This.Value = 
value. Fair enough. You can make
 that an underscore. Get value. 
Return this.value. We can say, 
this.Front. This is bad. I 
should be caching this. Textcon
tent equals value. We need to 
know what front is. Equal
 this.Root.
Same for the back. We are going 
to need the back. We know we are
 going to need it. Right. What 
happens is, we got the front. 
Fine. And so what we need to do 
is, this.Front. When you click 
any where on the front. We'll fl
ip the thing over. We'll delegat
e to the back. If we want to de
cide we want more than 1 button.
- Now you give me ideas.
- I know, right? What we'll do. 
There is going to be a problem. 
We'll do flip. We'll do this.Va
lue =
 whatever the target was. That 
will do it.
-You could have used dataset.
- Mwa. Setting the jrlale value.
 If we click on the back. Oops!
- Working as intended.
- Good news is, there are the 
most ridiculously named propert
ies on an event. The current 
target and the target.
- If you don't know, events bub
ble.
- Target and current target. Are
 you the current target? No, I'm
 the target. How does that 
differ? I don't know. If the e
vent target is the same as the 
current target. The one you clic
ked on, the target, is the tar
get that...
- If you have not bubbled.
If you clicked on the back 
itself rather than the button, 
yeah, then we're just going to 
return. So this is like if this 
is -- is the back, bail. Right, 
so hopefully that will work. So 
it doesn't do that, but now it 
does do that. That's that 
problem solved.  Right, so 
that's all working.  I had an  
idea, let's make it a little 
more showbiz --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We had a question by the way 
-- are we doing DOM operation in
 the con instructor right now, 
because that is apparently not 
recommended.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Other than attaching the sh
adow?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We do it curry selector which
 ...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Phhhhh.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.  I mean it works right?
  (Laughing) (Applause)
 oh, I'm going to walk into some
 serious trouble.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Matt's not going to be, hi. 
Matt.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Going to undermine everything
 you say.  Sorry about that. Um 
..., okay, so, let's see, right 
where were we. I'm going to add 
a ripple. Everything likes a 
ripple. &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; class equals 
ripple.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In case you didn't know by 
the way, all of our episode the 
code that comes out is on github
. This will also be on github, 
and the Google Chrome on github 
called UI Element samples, we 
probably have a link on screen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There's dashes, UI --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; True. You'll find it. We'll 
have it in the description later
 on, so go there if you want to 
play around with it yourself, if
 you want to make it work in IE 
10, or whatever floats your boat
.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This sounds really familiar, 
transform, translate, trance 50 
percent, going to position the 
ripple. (Laughing) you didn't 
see that. It's fine.  I expected
 that, now we have a ripple. And
 that looks --  laughing -- just
 bear with me, Surma.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's actually a nice 
aesthetic.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Don't get distracted Paul. 
Richel diversity expanded 
because we want to expand and 
contract. So scale down to zero,
 I'm  going to scale it down to 
zero, then I'm  going to scale 
it up to one what we call this 
class.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's going to go like Whooopp
p.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's make sure we have it in
 place, otherwise it will pop, 
like that, the official sound of
 popping. We'll make it a little
 faster than the flip, ripple 
has quite a long way to go.  I 
like it when it gets on to it. M
ake it a touch faster than the 
actual flipping over animation. 
We're  going to toggle that 
class. It's good because we have
 that stuff already in place.  
Ripple -- ripple.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I have an interesting 
question, we haven't seen a 
single change in your code so 
far.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Give it a moment.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Class list.toggle, expanded.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We also actually proved that 
it doesn't paint.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, but we'll paint. Let 
me show you that it will paint. 
Let's chose' different color.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Green is like dove tools uses
 green to indicate painting.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, Whoops, let's do Rebecc
a ...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; People were asking for this 
color.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What a lovely color. Okay, so
 now we do paint flashing, every
 time Chrome paints it will put 
a green flash on the screen like
 that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Because the border has to be 
added and therefore paint is 
happening, it has to be painted,
 literally.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Because it it's an animation 
on transform, Chrome goes, got 
this, going to give it it's own 
layer, like art work, but at the
 end of the animation, cool, 
don't need that layer anymore, 
buy Bye, you see that green box 
around the ripple, okay, we 
don't want it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The flattening of all the 
layers down to one single image.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So what we can do is we can 
say to Chrome Chrome, and also 
Safari and Firefox. We can say, 
listen, that ripple, like, if 
you're seeing the ripple, it 
should have it's own layer. So 
we'll do will change, which is 
the way to do this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And there we go, we got a 
will change.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anyone translate Z zero 
before in the history, -- 
everybody uses will change.  
Okay, good. But if you haven't 
and you see translate Z zero, 
that's what it's doing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think for Safari,.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Back in the day and every 
browser sense.  Oh yes,'re 
putting a 3D transform, that 
should have it's own compos it l
ayer. We'll do a standardized 
version. See how we continue see
 the paint anymore. Chrome will 
show us anything that it thinks 
it has it's own layer.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's visible.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's really good for us 
here. This one will have it 
because of the fact that it's 
got to perspective on it. It 
knows there's a 3D transform 
here, the ripple gets one pause 
of the fact we told ItaÃº BBA 
needs one.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There is a list of properties
 that basically force our advice
 for the browser to use their 
own layer.  I think it was a 
spec, I don't remember.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah ...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I might link to it in the 
chat. A list of CSS properties 
that force an Element to it's 
own layer from there on you can 
do accelerateed animation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I set the ripple to one pixel
. It seems inadvisable. The 
thing is it wants to be the size
 of the screen, right. We want 
it to take over do a full take 
over, which means --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Do we?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We do. These change sizes 
windows. We node a resize handle
er to figure out how big does 
this ripple need to be, like the
 radius of this ripple. T so I 
set it to one pixel because I 
know I'm going to have to figure
 this out in JavaScript. I'm go
ing to make an on-resize. Like 
so. And we'll do window.add 
event listener, resize. This.on 
resize. You know what that's 
going to fail, I'll show you why
 that's going to fail in a 
little bit Const, middle X, I'm 
going to make the assumption 
that this is always in the 
middle of the screen. If we have
 time, there might be a more 
generalized version I can show 
you you. Middle of the screen is
 the window  Inc.ker width. And 
the Y value is the inner height.
 Also times by five.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If we were really bleeding 
edge, we could use the resize 
observer. That is a thing.  Co
incidentally just wrote an 
article about that. Go raid it, 
maybe. It's basically an obse
rver that only notifies you when
 a resize happens not only on 
the win I do you can do it for 
Elements, it's an vent for El
ementtion. It's amazing. Right 
now it's only in Canay behind a 
flag.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's a little bit keen for 
me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We need a Plagarian distance.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We're doing math now.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We are. Because it's in the 
middle, pick one. And so the 
radius will be the square root 
of misX times midX plus midY 
times  midY, then we can say 
 this.ripple.style.width equals 
template string radius times two
, pixels. Put a space. There's a
 good lad
 also the same thing, great 
extent hate it when it doesn't 
work. Fine, why didn't you work.
 Oh, because I didn't actually 
call it. Awkward. We'll just it 
to here for now. Yeah! And also 
when I resize it, it Greeks. And
 the reason it breaks is if we 
were to do console.log this Whoo
o ... and we say, so the fist 
one says, oh, yeah, this refers 
to the flip switch, but because 
the second one is window.add 
Vint resize. This is the window,
 which is no use to me. So we 
are in the age of ES 20 1 , even
 then sometimes a bind is still 
necessary.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know, I'm so going to bind 
this. Look at this. The Paul Lew
is or the normal way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Owe let me explain why I'm 
doing this.  That's a feature in
 every episode.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm not proud of it. It's 
just --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right the reason we do it 
like this is because I want two 
things, I want to refer to it by
 name, if I do my tidy up, which
 I promise when I do push this 
together we'll have the 
disconnect call back filled out.
  Might move it to this stuff 
here. My way, the thing is I 
want to refer to it by name.  I 
want to say this.resize add 
event listener and remove event 
listener. The thing is when I 
call the function I want this to
 be always referring to the 
instance.  I do not want it to 
refer to the window or anything 
else.  I take a copy from the 
prototype, a class where this 
currently lives on the prototype
, I'm going to take a copy, bind
 it, and shove it as an actual 
property on the instance itself.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Overwriting it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Basically. Yes. No matter 
what, it will always refer to 
the flip switch.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There is in ES 2017, I think 
a proposal for a double   
operator, that would be this 
colon colon resize which would 
achieve the same effect. It's 
not there yet. Sadly.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You'll see when you play with
 it, it's great. Okay. Last 
thing, I feel like we should 
have shadows. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The audience does not seem to
 care  (Laughing).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm doing shadows okay! Yeah!
 (Applause (
 (I like you, I like you very m
uch. Shout out to shadows. Okay,
 we'll do a two pixel one.  
Stick with me. Shadow two pixels
. It's going to be width, height
, hundred percent, background, 
this is going to be a black 
shadow to begin with. And let's 
see, position, absolute. Top 
zero, left zero, border radius,
 50 per subsequent. And --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What a great shadow.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, looks amazing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's like a record.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (Making record scratching 
sounds) that's not the only 
thing I do, I do a great Billy 
as well, I don't mind, if you 
ask a  question, I might respond
 in my best Billy, I don't mind,
 whatever. (British accented).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Code, Paul, code.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You remember the container 
got pushed back 25 pixels and 
the front and back were pushed 
back 25 pixels which we confirm 
is 500 pick 'ems minus and then 
the distance they moved which is
 another 500 which is null point
 5, they're half scaled.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Double negatives are too 
much.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But it's true, half size. We 
could put the shadow inside the 
container as well, when that 
flips over the shadow is going 
to go a little bill Wonky, what 
we'll do instead is treat and 
we'll do a transform and scale 
it down by 0.5. It's hidden but 
it is there. It is there. Let's 
translate it down a little bit, 
translate Y. So it's  peeking 
out of the bottom there. Here's 
what we can do as well. You can 
make it look blurry by adding a 
box shadow. But if you get it 
wrong. Now it's half size, so my
 two pixel blurry shadow is go
ing to have to be 40 pixels and 
we'll make that black as well.  
Yeah, oh, you can't see that. 
You can't see that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Change the color again.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I need to bluer it, that's 
why, I'm an idiot. Let me get 
rid of this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hold up, so many numbers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, all right, yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So interesting question, why 
not filter blur. We have run 
into this problem before, I 
think.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, filter bluer, why 
wouldn't you use that?  Because 
it's a post-processing  effect, 
when the frame gets shipped to 
the  GPU, the GPU goes do I node
 to blur this?  Yes, I do. If 
the animation has changed at all
, if the pixels have changed 
this, it will go oh, I need to 
blur this, and it will happen on
 every frame and that's incredib
ly expensive, it's a post-
processing effect you don't want
 to run on every frame. It's 
good for static content.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The deceptive thing is paint 
flashing will not show up. It's 
not done in the tab's rendering 
but outside of it in the  
post-processing pipeline.  I 
pipeline it's deceptive you 
think you did well in 
performance but your frames get 
really slow.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Back to the shadow, if you 
can see, there is a shadow, you 
can see I have the harden of the
 circle then the shadow kicks in
, if you'd a bit of a spread on 
to this, see how it's now like a
 blurry shadow.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You could zoom in with 
control and mouse wheel.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I don't think I can. The 
thing with the thing. Getting 
very articulate. Let's put it 
back where it was.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Looking good.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What we'll do is add another 
class to this where it goes like
 flipped. Yeah. And we'll -- we 
will -- you know those -- the 
disk, let me just -- the disk 
goes from there and it's like 
big, it's like 200 by 200 again.
 Well, since this oneth was 200 
by 200 when it wasn't scaled, we
 can get rid of the down scaling
 so it reel be the right size.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you don't define it, it 
will zoom.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly, let's transitionnd a
 transform again, so it moves 
nicely, let's do 245. And we'll 
have to add that into the 
JavaScript, won't we to make 
sure it gets told what to do. So
 shadow two pixels. How's 
everybody doing on theWe have  
15chat. 0 people in the chat. 
Can we get to 200?
We have enough people in the 
room, and they are watching you 
type.
- Okay. That looks rubbish. The 
animation is, the thing is it 
should flip over as well. Let me
 put that in. There we go.
- Slow it down.
It is a double flip?
- No. It is not. Obviously a lot
 darker than we need a shadow to
 be. Let's fix that. Drop the o
pacity from 0.2. There you go.
- You are good at numbers.
- I know about shadows.
- I don't think you like lighte
r.
- They get blurrier. I know that
 we can fake it. While you make 
it. From Monica. Meanica I call 
her now. She was mean to me. She
 ruined my name. Meanica!
#revenge.
Let's add another shadow.  We'll
 make it blurrier. Exactly the 
same as the 2 pixels shadow. But
 we will say it is box shadow. A
gain we have to double the 
numbers. 24 pixels. And give it 
a spread of 16 pixels.. And when
 it is flipped over, it is going
 to be the same deal. It is. It 
is going to do the same transfor
mation. What we want is the opa
city to be zero here. And then 
when it is flipped, we want it. 
We are going to get a cross fade
. All being well. Make it... We 
have to animate, just the trans
form.
- Shadow 4? No. I'm stupid.
- You feel good?
- Sometimes saying it out loud 
you feel it is wrong. If you 
have to a problem you can introd
uce it to the rubaduck.
- He is my rubaduck. You are 
not... Okay, now we don't see 
what I wanted to see.
- See, there is something wrong.
- I'm easily confused.  Yeah, I 
have to set the opacity to zero.
 Yes? The other one is not showi
ng up. The reason in the Javas
cript we didn't tell it to show 
up. Like so. How we are doing 
for time? We have another?
- We are doing fine. We're good.
 I'm not sure where you want to 
go. This is pretty decent.
- Classlist of null. Where are y
ou? Helps if you put it in the 
Dom, Paul! There you go. Can't 
do anything with something that 
doesn't exist.
- Slow it down.
That's the thing. If you slow it
 down, it could be better.
- If nobody is expecting it. You
 are like... Do it again? No. 
No, i don't do my tricks a s
econd time.
- At that time it is clicking 
buttons. It is fun.
- We are good. Wow. Tell you 
what we'll do. Couple of things.
 Let's make it so it is a custom
izable
 color. Equals red. Red! Which 
means. We have a question.
- Why don't we determine the 
state of the shadow by the exis
ting elements. Instead of intro
ducing new Javascript. I think 
it is possible.
- True. There are 2 reasons why.
 I didn't want to expose the c
lass that it was open and expan
ded and whatever, on the actual 
element itself. Ideally. So, I 
had to make sure it was going to
 be done here at this level. You
 could make a containing element
 for all those. Sure. I guess 
that would work.
- Exactly. I didn't expect on 
the prototypes to get Pl's. I 
linked it in the chat.
- Good work. Not you. I mean...
You did great. Right, so, we can
 set a color attribute. Or atTRI
bute.
- I'm not a native speaker. What
 I know.
- This.Color = this.Getattri
bute.
Set color. Why not? Let's see, 
this.Color = color.
- Up to d date. We can use co
lor. It had to be data
 dash something.
- I don't know.
Color actually exists. Font co
lor exists.
- I think is going to be fine.
- As long as it is going to 
work.
- I put red in here. I can be 
like,... I can put whatever I 
want. We should tell the handle 
that situation.
- How do you do that?
Teach me Paul.
- You know who is really good. 
Checking to colors to give to 
the browser? The browser. Why 
don't we do div... Huh. Div.S
tyle.Color =
 color. And then, if the div.S
tyle.Color is empty, because it 
didn't like it. Huh. We can do 
console.Warn. Co
lor is not a color.
- Doofus.
- Well done!
- Passive agressive warnings.
- This is a British console.
- Wel done! Any other great s
uggestions? You probably delete 
them.
Otherwise. And then, we can do 
this.Style set property. Set pro
perty. And we can do the color t
hat I did before. We can do col
or.
- Ah, I didn't know about set 
property.
- All being well. Didn't like 
it. Hang on. Didn't warn me. I 
left it here. Oh no! No real co
lor. Well done, Paul!
- It came right back to bite 
you.
- It is red. It is red! That 
worked out just fine for us. And
 if we don't have anything at 
all it is going to say null is 
not a real color. It is over the
 top. If it is not a color, just
 color.
- It is the default?
- Yes. And if you set it. I sup
pose, what we could do as well. 
If you change the attribute, we 
can say, if the attribute that y
ou changed is color.
- You need a  switch case.
- We'll return.
 Well... Color equals new value.
 Now, that will do absolutely 
nothing. And the reason is, I h
aven't told it to listen for 
that. If I do $0.Setattribute 
color red. You think
 it would do something.
- You mentioned it earlier.
- I did. It relies on this. Ob
served p attri
bute. We do that.
- Damn.
- We are done. That worked. How 
are we for time? 5 minutes? I 
can make it work with multiple 
ones.
- I was about to ask about...
- No!
- Because we are doing the good 
old flipping thing. There is 
things in the Dom. About the 
accessibility.
- I think if you are going to do
 something ridiculous in produc
tion. You want to watch Rob's 
cast. And make sure that as the 
animation finishes, whichever 
side is not visible to inert. 
Which tells the browser, you 
shouldn't be able to tap into 
this.
- Right now, you could tap to t
he 4 buttons on the back.
- You can get to them. Which is 
bad. Have added the inert  polyf
ill.
- Rob posted that in the chat. I
 wonder why.
- Color equals
 1EA236. That's green.
There you go. You remember back 
when. If we assume the ripple...
 That's not.
- Not working anymore.
- While I'm here. I feel I want 
to click on the ripple.
- You notice you added another o
ne. Customer elements, it is so 
good.
- If you click on the ripple. 
Now if I do that.
There are 2 problems. One is 
that when you click on the green
 one the purple one is visible, 
which is bad. And the ripple isn
't big enough. We'll fix it. To 
make my life easier. I'm going 
to do the flip switch and add a 
modal class and put a Z index of
 1. What I'll do in the Javasc
ript, I'll say, when you do a 
flip, we'll say this.Classlist.A
dd.
Fingers are getting  tired. All 
the fast typing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; They both have the modal 
class on, which means we're back
 where we were. We need in the 
add event listener, we mode to 
say this this,.container, add 
event listener, and we'll say on
 the transition end,  
transition,.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Very under rated event.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know it's really good.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We will say if this.container
,.class  list,.contains which is
 also incredibly handy, so if 
this is the one that's actually 
actually -- so there are two 
transition end, one when it 
flips forward and one when it 
goes backwards. When it flips 
forward that will be true, the &quot;
if&quot; statement. Other than that 
we want to say, this.class list.
remove (Modal) okay. So we 
should see all being well, yes. 
Good. Yes. No longer broken, 
that's good, that's one out of 
two.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It wasn't broken. It was just
 visually unpleasing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's broken. (Laughing).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Let's do one very quick
ly. One minute to go. The thing 
about this on resize it assumes 
that we're in the middle of the 
screen, which we aren't. First 
thing first, we also call it 
here in the con instructor, 
which is a bad place to be call
ing it (Con instructor) at this 
point it's not added to the 
screen, if we call that. If we 
call the on -- size, it's not go
ing to work out well for us. We 
want to do it on the connected 
call back, we ask an animation 
frame, which basically says wait
 a frame till it's been definite
ly added to the DOM, all the 
styles figured out. Everything's
 up and running.  And then call 
the resize. So that's one thing 
we want to do in the resize its
elf, mid X and midY are no 
longer the middle of the screen,
.get bounding client, which is 
one of my favorite APIs, been 
around  forever, tells where it'
s on the scene, left top right 
top dot top, brilliant.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Be careful. It does force.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you have pending styles, 
make changes to your classes, to
 your style, browser says wait a
 minute, I'm run the style, run 
layout and then tell you where 
everything is on the screen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; To all your reads, dimension,
 then do all DOM changes, class 
changes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. In this case I know 
there's a layout post resize any
 way. So I can afford to do this
 certainly here. So do  
position.left plus position.or 
width.  This'll take us to the 
middle of the box.  And the same
 is also true for the top and 
the height. Now, the good news 
is, that will sort of work for 
this one. Look at that. But it 
won't work for this one, because
 it's nearer the top left corner
 than the top right corner, we 
want to account for it which 
ever one is the max. You see 
what I mean. You're going for 
the left corner, which ever one 
you're nearer is the wrong one, 
go for the other one. Let's have
 two new variables because why 
not. Mid &quot;X&quot; or window.inner 
width, minus max -- no, no,  
midX there we go. go. Same goes 
for Y. Here we are. There we are
. Height. High nurse MY and then
 Rx RY, does that all make sense
?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe you do the math.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One, two, they're both work, 
they're customizable, we've done
 sole showbiz.  Woe're all out 
of time. Thank you so much for 
happening out with us (Applause)
 -- thank you so much for 
hanging out with us.  (Applause)
r).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Monica Dinculescu:  Get out 
of here, my stage. Make your 
site faster, make your site 
faster, it isn't fast enough. 
Well that was absurdly excellent
. We have a break now.  There is
 a code lab on building custom 
overlays if you are interested 
in that, and we'll be back at 
4:15. See you soon. 
Monica:
Welcome back. Last talk of the 
day. They gave me a fancy mic. 
Our next speaker doesn't need an
 introduction. He was an Glee 
club as a child. They were cal
led the ambassadors. Give it up 
for Alex Russell.
Alex: That last thing about the 
Glee club is true. It was called
 the Ambassadors. If you have 
seen Glee. The joke, it was 30 
brads and a perfectionist. It 
was correct.
So, normally when I get up to g
ive a talk some time this year I
 put this slide on stage. And, I
'm surprised not to be giving a 
progressive web talk today. We 
gave it last year and has been 
taken off. We have looked at 
technology behind it. Starting 2
010 I guess. 4-5 years ago, I 
worked, and started a project 
that created web components. We 
had a bunch of new features. I 
spent a bunch of years working 
on the platform from a lot of 
different angles. With a lot of 
folks here today. Basically I 
have been working on other 
stuff. I haven't been involved 
in day to day web development. 
So, this won't be that talk. I 
won't be talking about pro
gressive web apps, web compo
nents,. What I have been working
 on for the past years. Yes, you
 should probably make a progres
sive web app. But what I want to
 talk about is, why the Prpl pat
tern is to important to mobile. 
It isn't everything yet. It is 
about to be everything. All of 
computing. If you go to emerging
 markets it is all of computing.
 The next online users will be 
mobile. They won't be devices l
ike this. This is a 700 dollars 
phone. These are 700-750 dollars
 phones. Basically nobody has 
them. People do have phones, 
this is a bag I carry every
where. Phones like this. $100 
phone from last year in India. 
It is dual core. We'll talk 
about it in a second. Because 
people are running the software 
that we make on devices like the
se, what we are finding out is 
we are not succeededding on 
mobile. I have to say this to t
he Javascript community. It, di
dn't make me friends. I'm surpri
sed I was invited to give this 
talk. I have been making the Pol
ymers sad. Scott, Steve, Monica,
 say this is the pg version. I 
would walk up with one of these.
 Why is this slow. I would do 
this continuously once every cou
ple of weeks I guess. Eventually
 we had uncomfortable meetings 
where they would show a new 
thing and I would pull out a 
phone and say, this is really 
slow. Why is this so slow? At 
some point it was Steve who you 
heard from yesterday, being 
lazy. You need to be more asyn
chronous. Stop doing so much 
work up front. He said: Stop tel
ling us what to do. Stop. Tell 
me what I need to hit. Put a 
finger in the wind. You need to 
be interactive in 3 seconds on a
 3G connection on a $200 device.
 I need to be able to interact 
with that application the next 
time in 1 second. Nobody was 
very happy about it. Eventually,
 what they came back with was 
the Prpl pattern. We'll talk abo
ut why it is important. This is 
desperate stuff. I'm not the per
son saying, you need to stop 
loading a lot of Javascript. I 
spent a many years on it. You ha
ve more power inside the brows
ers. I advocated for senti
bility. The bits of the browser 
process. The things you don't 
have access to it. The thread, 
painting, layout. The parser wi
th web components. You would 
have access to those and plug in
to those with the script itself.
 I helped make Javascript frame
works. To get to this point 
takes a lot from me to say, you 
need to stop putting so much sc
ript in your apps. You have to 
really failed badly to get me 
sending this message. So, how do
 we get here? Well, I'd say we h
ave persistently failed users on
 mobile devices. I think, if we 
put the Rail model in th our 
heads we can understand. We 
talked about the Rail model a 
bunch. We want to respond to u
ser input in less than 100ms. 
And to hit 60 frames per second.
 We have to do our work on the 
main thread in
 less than 8ms per frame. We 
have to wait for the browser to 
do its work. We need to make sur
e we are chunking up our idle 
work in small chunks. So we can 
remain responsive and input to 
respond to. When we load, we 
take an action inside the applic
ation, we want to get back to 
that interactive state in about 
1 second. This is long term user
 research. Validated in a lots 
of ways. 1000ms is a hard limit 
to hit. Interactive in a second.
 That is really, really hard 
thihnc thing to do on a fast 
connection on a desktop. Mobile 
is so much harder than you think
 it is. How fast could we get? 
Probably can't get something 
loaded in a second. What's rea
listic? I think 3 seconds on a 
3G connection is realistic for 
something. That's some data from
 the doubleclick folks research
ed. This caught my eye. 53% of 
visits are abandoned if a mobile
 site takes more than 3 seconds 
to load. And average we are it 
takes 19 seconds to load. We are
 not succeeding on mobile. We 
have to accept that we are not 
succeeding on mobile. I think it
 is worth asking why we are not 
succeeding on mobile. We are 
smart intelligent people who 
build interfaces to people. We 
don't want to make a slow UI. We
 want to deliver great user expe
riences. Noone is trying to 
fail. It can't just be that web 
developers are evil and hate us
ers. I don't think that's true. 
Maybe My first hypothesis 
though. We have failed in mobile
, because we have allowed oursel
ves to only run our m apps on 
desktops. You see the responsive
 design thing. It emulates the v
iewpoint of a mobile devicte.vic
e. You do development there. Who
 has used Chrome Inspect. Hey, I
 like you. All right. Who is u
sing Webpage test? Okay. Cool. 
This is a good crowd. I like 
this. I think, most developers a
ren't doing that. A lot of the 
traces I see are people who ob
viously haven't tried the stuff 
out. And so I'm a one trick pony
. The reason this bag is in by  
bagpack and includes all of 
these phones. When I go to a 
partner meeting, I sit down, 
plug in a phone to Chrome ins
pect and show it to them. On a 
real devivice. $200 device. To g
ive an example what I'm talking 
about. This was the IO website 
from 2015. Super cutting edge 
progressive web app. We just 
launched push notifications in 
the release that was sent to u
sers the week before IO. This 
was bleeding edge stuff. On desk
top this was punchy. Nice intro 
animation. The whole thing gets 
loaded in 700ms. Pretty good. 
Get the onload in 1,5 sec. The 
nice animation kicks in. We get 
smooth frames through most of 
the animation. The whole time 
spent for all of that work, to 
get a nice fade in. Is 600ms in 
JS. I do the exact same thing, w
hich gets me to interactive in 
seconds on 5X. It loops complete
ly different. That JS balloons 
to 2,5 seconds. That is a slug 
of JS. You can't do anything 
with this thing. It gets onload 
in 5,5 seconds roughly. The 
script locks up the UI thread fo
r 2 seconds. Spent 4 seconds in 
script overall. We aren't inte
ractive till late. At the same 
time, we get slow frames. This 
is not okay. Right. We have to 
accept that this is not okay. I 
think we are able. We are one of
 the few systems where we are 
running the same binary on the 
desktop as on mobile device. 
Nobody runs a Win32 app on a 
phone. You can't run it on the i
phone. Nobody takes a Java jar 
and runs it on Android. That 
doesn't happen. We didn't switch
 tools. We have been stuck in 
this world where we think we 
have to build everything. And th
at it is okay. So, traces from 
mobile devices are harsh master
s., and most of the teams that 
we have worked with over the 
past year, start looking at th
eir thing on mobile. And they do
 the stages of grief. Mobile is 
really, really hard. There are 
roughly 3 major areas that make 
this so much worse than it looks
. The Cpu's. The storage. And 
the networks. Let's talk about 
it. We think we have an in
tellectual in understanding why 
they are different to desktop. 
But didn't think about the appli
cations. I say all the same in e
very meeting, the truth is in 
the trace. The ground truth is 
something you can go and copy. 
Take a snapshot and send it to 
someone else in the team and 
have a look at it. If you are 
not inspecting your traces, you 
don't understand what is going 
on. You can get it from the 
tests. This is my desk. These 
are the devices travel with me. 
Including the Macbook pro. 
Almost every phone on that desk,
 aside from the one on the rig
ht, is about 300 dollars or 
less. And that matters. Because 
these are the phones that most p
eople have. I don't most wealthy
 people. Most of the next set of
 customers. Probably have phones
 thaf that are not $700 iPhone 
or Pixel. They probably don't. 
The Macbook has 4 processing co
res. Very deep pipelines. They c
an go from 2.8 gHz. They can sca
le further than that in the pro
cess. 16 gigs of rams. Costs 270
0 dollars. The Pixl Xl has 4 
cores. Same number. There is hy
perthreading. It has 2 of the co
res that can go to 3.1 Ghz. It 
sounds weird. Not if you have
 bought, for different speed. It
 costs 750 bucks. It is a real 
computer. It is limited. The 
Nexus 5X has 2 more cores. Some 
scale higher than the Pixel XL.
And that mow to 4G the 
2,007-dollar device is the most 
edge doughed in terms of number 
of cores. So what is JavaScript 
ten times slower of that Moto 4G
 than it is on my 2700 MacBook 
Pro?  What the heck is going on?
  These things like core count 
doesn't predict anything, right 
is this at this point it's 
really hard to understand what's
 going on here, it's not the 
number of pixels that you push. 
The MacBook Pro hasn't very high
 density screen, the Pixel has a
 very high density screen. 400 
dots per inch, they'll got GPU, 
flash based storage. If you 
think the 500-pound iPhone that 
you may be  carrying with you is
 a stand in for a real device. 
You're not looking at groined 
truth.  The top of the line and 
bottom of the line between the P
ixel and the I classify 
performance and the Moto 4G is a
 different world epitirely. 
Worldwide foreigns are getting 
slower. More people can afford  
phones now. When they buy their 
first phone, they're not buying 
an iPhone or a Pixel, they're 
buying a hundred dollar, one 
hundred fifty dollar, two 
hundred dollar phone, maybe, wit
h incentives and pay as you go 
plans. And the average network 
is getting slower, most people 
are coming on-line with 3G co
nnections and think feel like 2G
 connections the thanks to 
carriers, let's not talk about 
cariers, it'll make us people 
sadder. This is some code, a 
benchmark that the Webkit team 
put together, called motion mark
 on my 15-inch MacBook Pro, 
Safari, Chrome, like we get 
roughly the same performance, 
sometimes we're faster, sometime
s we're a lot faster, sometimes 
we're a bit slower. It's a 
graphic oriented benchmark, this
 is basically Apples to  Apples 
on OS X, same version of chrome 
and run it on a Nexus A X and 
the desktop is 25 times faster, 
not cheeper, 300-dollar  device,
 but this is dramatic, this is a
 huge difference. So, I changed 
just one thing and reran this 
benchmark a couple of times and 
got a significant faster result.
  I think you'll be interested 
to know what the run thing is, 
across a couple of runs I got it
 fifteen percent faster over all
. What did I do differently with
 the same hardware and same 
version of Chrome. Is it magic? 
  (Laughing) could be. But pro
bably not.  Instead magic isn't 
really a thing, right.  Magic 
doesn't exist, instead it's 
science, what I did is I put 
this thing on an ice Preparing a
 democrat plait for a. My 
colleague victor sort of figured
 this out that this was the 
issue when he was trying to -- 
victor and his team were trying 
to figure out why we were 
getting these wildly varying 
results on mobile devices put 
the phone in a Fridbe and ran it
 again and got a significant 
faster result. What you're seei
ng is thermal throatelling. The 
modern desktop style computer 
looks like this, there's going 
to be a heat synch a big chunk 
of copper or high lam numb 
sitting on top of a chip with a 
metal top and by between those 
two is a bit of paste. The same 
thing is true if you open up a 
MacBook Pro there's a fan that's
 evacwhiting heat out from a 
heat Sink, and sometimes you see
 these weird pipe things, copper
 pipes, that's what it is, we're
 trying to take heat away from 
the chip as fast as we possibly 
can. Copper moves heat away, fan
s move the hate out of the area 
and continue to dissipate the 
heat out of the area. The result
 is that a desktop class chip 
like the one in my MacBook Pro, 
it can scale up to about 60 
anothers of power dissipation. 
That's a lot of power.  This is 
what 60-watts looks like if you 
hold it in your hand, you would 
get very uncomfortable quickly 
I've tried this, you probably 
aren't going to be dissipating 
60-watts in your hand, in your 
phone, that's going to be very 
uncomfortable. Heat transfer, if
 the back of your phone felt 
like a lightbulb, you wouldn't 
use it for long. This is a major
 reason why mobile devices don't
 have desktop class  
performance. For the same 
process node and the same 
architecture, the same number of
 transistors, the CPU that porns
 more power into heat is the CPU
 that does more math, right. So 
we probably need to figure out a
 way to do a lot less math to 
turn a lot less power into heat 
if we're going to keep our hands
 from burning on a day-to-day 
basis.  This is the inside of a 
Nexus 5 X, this is the one that 
gave up smoke a couple of weeks 
ago.  I took it apart. This was 
my daily driver phone for a 
couple of years. The round 
circle where the vibrator, sorry
 that square cut out next to it 
is where the camera assembly 
goes, that's one of the hottest 
components in a phone, below 
that is the power supply, and on
 the other side of that power 
supply, on the same PC on the 
other side of it is the system 
on a chip, which is a CPU, GP U,
 base band processor, all that 
stuff. The memory and the radio 
all in one assembly. So let's 
flip it over, take a look at it.
 There's no thermal paste on top
 of that CPU there. That's 
interesting, there's also -- 
you'll note I had to think that 
little aism numb assembly off on
 the other side -- aluminum 
assembly off on the other side. 
The CPU module, it says Samsung 
on the top, but it's a Qualcomm 
chip. The  CPU module is sitting
 underneath that Samsung chip, 
the Samsung chip is the RAM.  
Think about that for a second. 
To get heat out of the CPU to 
the outside world it has to go 
through one layer of ceramics 
and another layer of chip and 
another higher of ceramics to 
air, not assisted by anything 
else to draw it out, no fan, 
there's no fan anywhere probably
 in any phone you own, thank 
goodness, right. (Laughs) and 
this thing backs on to plastic, 
two layers of plastic. Two layer
s of plastic, plastic is a 
terrible thermal conductor. 
Thermal conductivity of plastic 
is about a thousand times lower 
than aluminament right. So, so 
in order to preSeptember us from
 burning up our hands we have to
 make sure we don't run this 
thing to actually draw that much
 power.  It can't do that much 
math. All this reminds me of a 
paper I read a couple of years 
back.  If you have a few spare 
moments I recommend it highly. 
It wasn't perhaps intended to be
 a prophesy about mobile devices
, but it is.  It tells us why so
 many of the transistors that 
are now in the 8 cores that I'm 
 carrying around on Moto 4G are 
dark, why they're not lit up and
 doing useful work for me. The 
reason is thermals and power. 
The reason everything is slow is
 this.  I can hold 2700 MH hours
 in the Nexus happen battery or 
ten watt hours, roughly. Think 
about that in terms of powering 
a lightbulb, you get a couple of
 minutes light bulk out of it if
 you could draw that much 
current attaches, which you 
can't it would probably blow up 
battery. Insert exploding phone 
 jokes here. This is the primary
 limiting constraint on a mobile
 device. This thing has to boyar
 the but tooth radio, the NFC 
radio, the cell radio, WiFi ra
dio, chips and screen and you 
want it to last all day. On som
ething that can't power a 
lightbulb for more than a couple
 of minutes. So everybody has an
 incentive to make sure that you
 actually aren't cloaking the C
PUs very high.  You're not draw
ing that much power. And it's 
much more complicated than this.
 These days what you're seeing 
is big little architecture 
inside the phone, there's a 
couple of big cores they have 
deeper pipelines, more trance 
sister, more cache, not as much 
as the iPhone, the iPhone has 4 
MB of L 3 cache 3 MB of L 2 
cache. My MacBook Pro has 6 MB 
of L 3 cache.  I think the part 
that's in the Moto 4G might have
 a MB of L 2 and L 3 cache total
. Spending tower and spending 
track situation on power is a 
big dale and you don't want to 
do very much of it. So these day
s we're aggressively moving comp
utation out to the middle core, 
slower power more frequently 
cores, they're much more ef
ficient. The amount of power you
 burn at frequency ask non-lin
ear, if you scale frequency in 
the modern conductor, you burn 
more and more power per gig a 
hearts over time as it scales 
up. So schedulers do a bunch of 
things to make sure it works out
.  They try to aggressively move
 work around.  They have a lot 
of different strategies for 
this. Your phone is going to use
 something like clustering or if
 it's very clever it'll have 
multiple ways of thinking about 
each of those individual chips 
powering them up and down and 
moving work between them. We're 
finally getting to energy aware 
scheduling.  Touch boost is w
here you put your finger down 
and the phone spins all the CPUs
 up as fast as it can, the big 
ones to give you the ability to 
animate stuff very quickly. As 
soon as it thinks it can it spin
s it all right back down. Now 
the normal way this you load a 
webpage looks like waiting on ne
twork to do some stuff, couple 
of seconds later you get the 
body of stuff you have to start 
processing. You might have scal
ed the CPU back down by the time
 you get the bunking back. When 
you launch an App we spend a lot
 of time or OS' spend a lot of 
time to make sure that App l
aunches quickly. So they are 
primed to give you a lot of j
uice at the moment you decide to
 launch a new activity or new 
application. The web doesn't 
work that way. Our schedulers 
work against the web's basic 
workload or at least the way we 
built them until today. And 
benchmark eting is really a 
thing. You'll see benchmark  
eting floating around this 
processor is almost as fast as a
 desktop, maybe, but you can't 
keep it spun up very long. You 
will have to scale it right back
 down again. Or else you're 
going to hold a lightbulb in you
r hand. Right. So, all this 
should make us sad. But it's 
worse than that, storage isn't 
actually this good either. When 
you look at the read performance
 on the MacBook Pro, I get about
 2 GB per second -- transfer 
across the storageM It can only 
get 400 mHz. What's going on? In
 Ssd's, pararallelism is king. T
he lacen
cy is low. The throughput is on 
the amount of chips. They are 
all going to have a particular 
size for each of the packets 
that they are storing. You can 
get a lot more read through put 
if you have a fast bus. On the 
Nexus there isn't a lot of space
 for extra chips. Nlc or Tlc. 
Cells on top of cells. 3D chips 
are popular for storage. They 
allow you to pack more transis
tors, lower power. But that
 penalizes you in parallalism. E
verything feels much slower. If 
you read large chunks of conte
nt. The controllers aren't as 
good. You don't have as much 
free memory, power. The file sys
tems are optimized to some 
degree. Basically, when you 
think about mobile, it is about 
the same speed as spinning metal
. Okay. Then there is mobile net
works. You can check out High pe
rformance networking. Mobile net
works hate you. They hate your 
guts. They don't like Tcp. The 
way you use them. If you are on 
3G especially. They have wild va
riance underneath, your high lev
el propotocol stack. It is not 
tuned to understand. The control
 algorithms, built into the cur
rent Tcp, doesn't work well with
 a physical layer we are assu
ming. We see wild variance in 
packet loss. Simulated networks 
don't really explain. A 4G user 
isn't a 4G user most of the time
. You may be spending seconds to
 get the first package across 
the wire. This is really bad. 
Okay. I think is only reaso nabl
e to be tnable to be sad
 about it. We need to do things 
fundamentally different. Of the 
OS and the underlying networks 
and capabilities. We need to 
load less script, better, we 
have to do work on demand and 
able to meet the CPU when it is 
spun up. So, Paul Lewis characte
rized this in a couple of graps
hs. We have these JS bundles and
 feel very slow if you render 
block with them. And you feel 
you have waste time at the 
front. When it evaluates, you 
get a fast application. This is 
okay, because people have these 
instant applications. Maybe your
 interaction app is not very lar
ge. You are probably going to 
bail if it takes longer than a 
couple of seconds to get there. 
There is something clever. I'm 
going to use universal JavaS
cript. And then I'll load that 
giant pile of JS. That only 
works if you actually get the JS
 loaded quickly enough. You tap 
the glass and nothing happens. 
Maybe we can scroll. But if you 
tap on it and doesn't work I 
submit to you as a web develop
er, your thing is broken. It is 
broken. Doesn't work. This does
n't work. What we want is some
thing that looks like this. Load
 and run things. At the time we 
want to interact with them. We 
want quick interactivity. And we
 don't want to be paying for 
stuff we are not using. This is 
why Prpl is so important. They 
delay view loading to the view 
transition moment. So, this is 
the shop app, you have seen a 
few times on a desktop class ma
chine. We have seen the story 
before. That's good. 200ms JS. 
It is 10x slower on a mobile 
phone. Here we are interactive 
on 1.75 seconds. This thing is a
mazing. And it is 1.3 seconds of
 JS overall. If you look at the 
right, all slices are chunked. I
 was interactive at the end of 
the yellow slug. I was faster. I
n the way they do small chunk
ing. They allow the browser and 
platform schedule work. So, the 
other thing about the Prpl pat
tern is that it adds service 
worker. We were trying to solve 
offline. We were. The thing I'm 
excited about is reliable per
formance. The Prpl and Polymer 
give you the ability to respond 
for navigation out of the cache.
 You never have to wait for the 
resource control to spin up the 
radio, to go do J dns and Http 
handshaking to give you content.
 You can pull it out of the 
local cache. It can be faster. 
This is why service work workers
 matter. This is data from this 
year's year. It is a long tail. 
Network suck. That dark green, 
that's with the service worker. 
It moves all of the work to the 
front of the pack. That's rel
iable performance. Where we have
 to be in order to build comp
elling native competition mobile
 apps on the web. How do you 
fight back? Implement Prpl. 
Yesterday it was Rpl. Get as far
 as you can. Load things you 
need for the current route. Ins
tall a service worker. Break up 
your work for the best of your 
ability. Push if you can. And 
then go by 150$ phone if you 
can. Medium prized unlocked dev
ice and use Chrome inspect to 
see how it works. Use Lighthouse
. It will tell if it is PWA and 
has an increasingly good set of 
tools. You can take traces from 
it. Use Chrome Telemetry if you 
have continuous integration. I 
hope. And devtools network and 
Cpu throthing is important. Le
t's have a quick look. This is 
the UI. I plug in a phone that 
has been unlocked for USB debug
ging. I get a view of this. I go
 to the network tab tab. Regular
 3G is a good starting place. If
 I go back to the timeline. I 
should be able to hit control R.
 Select also capturing the paint
 stuff. It will start recording,
 running this thing. There is re
cording overhead. The mobile net
work is better tha
. I have a trace. And I can ins
pect it. Start to look at where 
things actually show up. You ha
ve seen Paul and Sam navigate. 
You can go back to the video's 
how best to learn about all of 
the things causing to be fast or
 slow. The most important is I 
can right click and save it and 
send it to the team mates and 
start to understand the perform
ance over time. Okay. We can t
hen go back into the Chrome in
spector and load it back up. Any
 Chrome devtools can load. I 
save this one to the desktop. 
Let's go there. Great. And slow
ly, from yesterday, loads it 
back up. There we are. On any 
computer with devtools I can see
 how this perforrms on a real de
vice. This is awesome. There is 
also Chrome tracing.
 For Tracing, Inspect. It is a 
powertool. It is the thing that 
browser engineer to diagnose the
 performance. When I use Chrome 
inspect?Tracing, it gives the t
racing. It is a powertool. Lets 
you see every process. and every
thing that is happening. They
 talk to eachother over IPC. We 
are going to ask you to take a 
trace for your application and 
we'll dig in using this. It 
works the same way. I refresh 
the shop app. I stop the trace. 
Can explore it. It feels like a 
videogame. Select things and s
hows what happens. The important
 part is that you can save your 
traces and you can load them 
back up. This is everything. 
Chrome is doing. Basically. It 
will show you the Cpu usage. The
 resources I have. And this is 
what is happening in the rende
ring process. We can select an a
rea and see what is taking so 
long. Parsing, and richer set of
 instrumentation. Lighthouse is 
amazing. Please use it. Please g
o install it. And thank you so 
much for making fast websites 
that are reliably performant.
(applause)
- Awesome. All right. How are 
you doing?, good? Good. All 
right. We are at the tail end. 
That was a super interesting 
talk. I haven't seen that talk 
before the event. That was, how 
many of you saw the Marsian? 
That was super cool. We are g
oing to do a panel now. Monica 
mentioned earlier to ask tweet 
questions.@ #askpolymersummit. 
We have microphones there and 
there. Please welcome Justin, s
oftware engineer on Polymer. 
Wendy, product manager on Poly
mer. Monica, software engineer. 
Steve, and Matt, director of 
Chrome. Give them a hand.
(applause)
Some good twitter questions in 
here. All right. So, remember if
 you have questions, come up and
 line up at the microphone. We 
will start with Twitter ques
tions. This is a few that are 
related. Basically, Alex gave a 
good talk on the importance of H
tml imports. A lot wonder. It 
seems there is disgreemagreement
 across different browsers about
 important Html. Imports or modu
les. Where are these things go
ing? Could you address these 2 
issues? Where are imports headed
 and how you reconcile that with
 modules?
- I can start. I mentioned it a 
little bit yesterday. Like Rob 
said, all the components are 
well on the way. Except Html imp
orts are on hold. It is imple
mented in Chrome, but on hold. 
And really that's because we are
 waiting for the ES6 modules to 
land in browsers. And to be im
plemented.
 it's kind of a funny story the 
way is this hyperinsulinismed, a
nd ES6 modules landed, other 
browsers thought the specs are 
far along they'll be here any 
minute and we can wait to decide
 on how to implement and maybe 
take advantage of the ES6 module
. We'll wait. Turns out, like 
these specs tend to sometime do,
 take a little bit longer to 
settle in to place with the ES6 
modules. As the ES6 module di
scussion was happening, at least
 in conversation we'd been 
having across browser vendors, 
there's more attention back on 
HTML imports particularly as a 
per formant primitive. With HTML
 imimportants you get to take 
advantage like Alex was saying 
all these great built in 
platform browser optimization do
 background parsing, to key up 
all the requests in an efficient
 way.  We've been seeing HTML im
ports could be a per performance
 primitive. One thing we're 
optimistic about as ES6 modules 
come together in ice a great o
pportunity to marry HTMLel 
import mechanism, autolyze 
loadtion HTML, with the ES6 
modules, potentially even along 
the lines of HTML module that 
would interoperate perfectly 
with ES6 modules. So we've seen 
some experiments in this space 
and we're really excited about 
it. Roughly, I think it's fair 
to say that everyone is general
ly on board with the idea the 
need to load HTML primitive with
 HTML how does it interface with
 ES6 modules and we have some 
pretty good ideas around that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Looks like we have an 
audience question.  Really quick
 for all audience questions, I'm
 going to ask one favor of you 
please be considerate of those 
that might want to ask a 
question also. Please know I 
have a  multi-part question, one
 A of 7 style questions. Having 
said that, sir, you there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My name's Dillon, I work for 
best buy Canada, we're currently
 considering  Polymerment we 
were wondering if you had any 
advice for transitioning your 
large applications in the past 
into modular Web Components.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm going to repeat the 
question really quick. Do you 
all have any advice for tran
sitioning your large existing 
application over to using 
something like Polymer?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'll take that one. We've 
seen customers do this before 
where they have inside Google we
 have like I don't know a dozen 
different frameworks that people
 use, and when they start using 
Polymer sometimes they work from
 the leaves up. And they'll say,
 oh, I want to use the outcome 
Material Design components 
because they need to be Material
 Design compliant. And they keep
 working up from the leaves 
using buttons and inputs and 
like, oh, I have this thing that
 uses built tons and input I'll 
make it Polymer, eventually they
 just don't stop and they do all
 the way to the top.  I think 
when you get with the framework 
you have and Web Components 
that's a good way to go.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think the bottom up and not
 stopping also applies to a lot 
of products we've been shipping 
recently as the Polymer team. 
The poly per App toolbox, the 
shop demo, we have a fablings 
siting demos that are similar to
 the shop App on the way. It's a
 great idea to start, the poly 
CLI, it builds right out of the 
box, a Progressive Web App right
 out of the box. You can have 
something quickly within two or 
three days to show an executive 
and convince them this is a 
great experience we can achieve.
 Similarly we're seeing some 
people start there and continue 
with that template until it 
becomes the full application. So
 similar idea, starting with 
what we've got as a starter 
template and then expanding 
there there. With things like 
the PRPL pattern, really their 
scalability scalability becomes 
kind of by default because PRPL 
there's so much emphasis on lazy
 loading as you add pages to the
 application that's no emphasis 
on that load, if you're  
constructing with these template
s if they're built that way by 
default. Start with a prototype 
face with a new bottom up time 
App and see how far you can get.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a fun question, I 
would like to make the panel 
squirm a little bit. When will 
Polymer 2.0 be released as 
production ready?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I can take that one. Fist off
 we have this plan, it was well 
throughout out for the last 
twelve minutes to bring the 360 
vie VR camera on stage, give i
t's own spot call it Blinky and 
throw all the hard question to 
it. At the last minute it didn't
 work out, so we came up here.  
I think the plan is roughly 
around January to have that come
 out with the Elements and 
everything,er it will come out 
when it's ready (Laughing) but 
you know, we had a stretch goal 
to try to get it done for the 
Summit, that was tongue in cheek
.  I didn't want to tell Steve 
until kind of late. Until they 
really started getting stressed 
out. But, yes, the idea would be
 the next couple of months, the 
holly days add at least another 
month to that, that's the plan.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One more thing to'd is that, 
so I mean, just, we are in 
preview mode now, and I  mean, I
 think we were in Polymer 1 we 
got to a phase of Polymer 1's 
development where it became hard
 to change things because of the
 need to not break people. And, 
you know, based on your feedback
 on the preview, we're sort of 
in a nice period where we're 
still trying to maintain b
ackward compatibility with 
Polymer 1, we have a bit more 
wiggle room. Please play with 
Polymer 2 and give feedback so 
we can make it the best we can.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Steve was deaf yous, he can 
realize that he could say on 
camera about when it's going to 
come out that's less ambitious. 
April April 2517, coming to a 
computer near you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Absolutely as soon as 
possible.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You could be a manager. (
Laughing).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, so I have another 
question, this is one we get a 
lot.  I would say this is like 
sixty percent of all questions 
are this question. What about 
using Polymer with ... insert 
framework here. Okay. (Laughing)
 Reacts, Angular, whatever. What
 about using Polymer with other 
frameworks:  Robb do you want to
 take that one.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think we have to throw that
 to Blinky  (Laughing).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I listened today lore's 
keynote yesterday and what he 
told me was you don't have to 
throw out your framework.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Because Polymer is based on 
standards it will work with your
 framework.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, that's right. Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, we get the question all 
the time, this is one of the big
 promises of Web Components to 
have a web standard way to build
 component, frameworks continue 
have to bing a totally custom mo
del like CSSSS encaptionlation. 
With Polymer 2, particular 
particularly, with all the 
things we've been doing to make 
it more interoperable, to strip 
away all the Polymer specific 
idiomatic things this you had to
 know that broke through that 
layer. So that a Polymer 2 
Element is truly a Custom 
Element. It's  going to be a lot
, lot easier to interface Poly
mer 2 Elements with existing 
framework.  On the framework 
side as well it's been evolving 
and shifting to better support 
custom Elements, I think we'll 
see that more in the future from
 some of the big  frameworks. 
Already there are existing kind 
of coupleers that make it really
 easy to use framework X with 
Polymer Element or web component
, the Vaadin team was up here 
thiaminessed angular adapter, 
check that  out, it makes it I'm
less to work with Elements insid
e on Angular application. A lot 
of solutions that already exist.
 Polymer is making it easier to 
happen.  I think this'll be the 
continued oaring of Web 
Components towards seamless  
interoperability. We're on our 
way there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And reminder again, we have 
these microphones if you want to
 ask questions, don't be shy. 
All right, another question we 
have is, we heard -- we had 
partners here, heard from a 
number of partners they ran into
 situations where they had had 
too many components you now, so 
is having a &quot;my App&quot; Element 
still a viable approach, when is
 the right time to create a 
component. That's a few question
s all jammed together there, 
sorry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.  I can handle that I 
guess. So. , I think this is a 
hard question to answer because 
as with many things there's not 
really one size fits all.  I 
think it's perfectly fine to 
have one Element that defends 
your application, if you're 
using the PRPL pattern deliver
ing a small buttede bundle, 
it'll downed lowed and render 
quick the resources. That's 
straightforward. In my talk I 
emphasized that focusing on very
 specific, you know, high 
frequency Elements you want to 
make as fast as you possibly K 
having reasonable goals for 
those, and being careful in 
those Elements, and actual hi 
got some feed babbling, which 
was that the thing I was saying 
do less and be lazy actually 
sounded really hard. So one 
thing I can say about that is 
that because we're using Web 
Components the good news is that
 the hard work that anyone does 
is that anyone can leverage that
 seems potentially good to me, 
as long as someone figures out 
how to make a thing fast we can 
all benefit from it.  I think 
there's a lot of really specific
 questions that go with -- that 
kind of have to be answered in 
the context of your application.
 But from a performance 
perspective, I think just keep
ing in mind that sort of the 
cost of the Element should match
 the task that you're trying to 
have it do. So ... you know 
where you need to make a lot of 
things, make them as cheep as 
you  can.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One thing you can think about
 it is creating a Custom Element
 isn't free, you have a tiny bit
 of cost with every Custom 
Element you have, if you're go
ing to make a Custom Element to 
wrap a span, that's not worth it
 you can just put a class on 
that span, especially if you're 
going to rePete the span, if it
's a sizable amount of DOM  it's
 hard to style it, copy paste it
 is really annoying, that's a 
good place to put a cuss Polymer
 Element in there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Luckily we didn't say 
everything is an Element so we 
didn't encourage that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We never did that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right we have a question 
back here, sir.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This isn't exactly a Polymer 
question, but, it's future
centric and relates to our stuff
 that we do. What's with web 
assembly is this when does that 
arrive in the real world and 
what goodies do we, can we 
expect from that?  Maybe perhaps
 related to Web Components and 
Polymer?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm scanning the room for V 8
 people, there's one right 
behind.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right behind you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't think we really know 
up here, web assembly doesn't 
impact, I don't think it has 
direct access to the DOM right 
now. If you're writing a game, 
yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You found us person he's 
hunting him down (Laughing) 
there in the back corner.  
Standing up. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Time to move on. This is a 
good question.  They pink me and
 they're like I want to make a 
thing like paper input.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Don't, don't do that. As I've
 been doing a lot of 
accessibility work, input gives 
you a lot in terms of 
Accessibility. The question is 
how do you leverage semantics 
when you're writing what 
component, if you're trying to 
write something like input, and 
there are reasons to perhaps 
wrap some of these components, 
how do I leverage  existing see 
man ticks inside of a Custom 
Element that I'm creating, I 
think that would be a good 
question for Monica.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you mean exactly by 
leveraging existing see man tick
s.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you were to redo something
 like paper input how would you 
do that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Paper input in particular is 
enormous,  it's a Hydro with 17 
heads, so it should be 17 sub 
Elements instead. Because it 
wraps and input in it's Shadow 
DOM it has to channel all of the
 properties this you could set 
on an input and sort of expose 
them to the paper input itself. 
So we have a behavior for that 
which basically defines every 
single property that input has 
that paper input could have. 
Which isn't great.  But, if 
that's the thing that you want 
to  do, you can do that. The 
reason why I'm saying paper 
input shouldn't be like it is, 
it should be something like 
paper text  input, paper number 
input, and you can only have 
three or four of these existing 
properties that needs to pass 
down to the input.  I don't know
 if it answers your question.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sounds about right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is sort of tan genital. 
We try to mimic in our custom 
Element what the platform choses
 to do. Paper text Bob, for 
example, it doesn't look like 
input type equals check box, it 
has, it's called Paper-Checkbox,
 but it has the same sort of, it
 has a checked attribute, it has
 a  fairlyier question value 
where it's on or empty, because 
that's what the input type p
eople check box does, we'd like 
it you could replace wherever 
input type people check box and 
have the same semantics without 
you being freaked out about that
.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And that's, honestly I feel 
it's a thing a lot of developers
 overlook is semantics and how 
they relate to Accessibility. 
Which is about, a lot of people 
are like, well, I don't know if 
I have users that need this.  It
's about a billion people 
worldwide that have some form of
 disability. And so if you are 
creating a widget that already 
has an existing analog in the 
platform, you really node to 
make sure you're adding back in 
all of the semantics and the 
proper Accessibility and keyb
oard support and stiff like that
 if you're not going to use the 
existing platform Element. Which
 is why I often tell people just
 use &quot;button&quot; it seems so 
simple, it does a lot for you. 
There's a lot of stuff you don't
 want to add in that you'll have
 to if you mode to turn that 
into a Custom Element. Your can 
do it my friend Eric Bidelman 
did a talk at the PWA dev Summit
 on exactly how to do that. It's
 a great talk you should check 
out. Remember the platform is 
trying to help you and give you 
stuff. When we say use the 
platform  means leverageing 
Vanilla HTML if you can.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Just real quick.  I just want
 to come back quickly to the is 
in V1 Custom  Elements.  This is
 one way you could in the V0 
Custom Elements leverage exist
ing semantics here. And doing it
 yourself with implementing all 
the Accessibility is hard, so I 
mean we, on the team, basically 
really like this idea of is, and
 it's still in the spec, and 
probably implemented in Chrome a
nd we're arguing for it. It may 
evolve, kind of one of these 
things, this is why we're not 
recommending using it going for
ward for now, support may evolve
.  I think that's general 
agreement this is incredibly 
available to be able to leverage
 these capabilities but the 
exact way that it happens is 
tricky and there's some nasty 
things about &quot;is&quot; we engage 
directly with the old legacy 
built in Elements like input, 
and input uses a shadow root, 
you can't add your in, there's a
 lot of tricky stuff there. 
There's still, I think a little 
bit of a growing pain here, hope
fully it will evolve relatively 
quickly.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Fight for the people to get 
&quot;is Commonwealths back, don't 
worry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have a couple of questions
, just moment this is a question
 we get asked, the second most 
popular question.  I really want
 you all on stage to answer this
. How does  SEO work with Custom
 Element can Shadow DOM Elements
 be seen by a search engine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He actually answered one of 
the audience's question.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Nice.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. So, we do get this 
question a lot.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's 23409 a yes or no.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes is the answer. The short 
answer is  SEO Polymer, Web 
Components is no different than 
any other Front-End JavaScript 
framework you work with period. 
Right now no web crawler that I 
know of actually natively 
supports Shadow DOM, so it's not
 a question of actual shadow 
roots you need a web crawler to 
see the page, include the 
Polyfill, any way, right now it
's  irrelevant. And now that Web
 Components are in the spec, I 
highly, highly expect that 
anyone who might build a web 
crawler for search would very 
likely look inside the shadow 
roots as it's part of the HTML 
specs and used across browser.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think the most important 
thing to acknowledge is crawlers
 run JavaScript.  Right.  I 
don't know if everybody knows 
that that, the crawler will 
reppedder your page internally 
as it goes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Blowing post on the Google 
master Blog, I don't have the UR
L on the top mind, from about a 
year ago the team said yes, the 
Google crawler does run Jav
aScript for a brief while again
st your page.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can zig up that Webmaster
 Blog post it's in there. Which 
would give you time to bootstrap
 some koar components.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For obvious reasons I can't 
go into too much detail as to 
how these web crawlers work or 
indexers work, I highly 
recommend if you're skeptical 
about how your site is getting 
indexed I highly recommend the 
fetch as Google tool, which is 
part of the Webmaster tool set 
and what yes can do, go in, give
 it the URL of your page and see
 how Google's crawler seeses 
your page. Recommend you do that
, you can make sure it shows up 
the way you expect. Another nice
 little tip is the site   query 
is a very available query to use
. So if you're skeptical that 
Polymer based, my App apps get p
icked up by the criminaller go 
to Google right now and view if 
source of shop you'll just see 
one tag and that's it. That's 
the entire DOM, if you site 
crawl in query you see eel see 
that everything gets picked up. 
 I highly suggest you do that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You have patiently been 
standing, so you go next.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, I'm Sam. I'm from brain 
lab and my question is about 
supporting old browsers in 
particular like explorer. Is it 
still a plan or ... feasible?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We support IE 112 and edge.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We stylish pert 10 a bit too 
(.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hmmmm ... do we?  ...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So monofy cameoed that noise 
audibly, Steve made a much worse
 noise this his head (Laughing).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We want to end support for 
10.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We do not list IE 10 as 
supported on the Polymer web 
site, if you have checked it 
recently (Laughing).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, yes, so, tick anyically 
-- IE 11 up is supported. We 
used to support EO so until 
Microsoft end of life with most 
of Microsoft platforms, if 
Microsoft is going to end it, 
probably a good time for us too.
 The reason being IE 10 support 
because of some flakiness in 
some features it adds a lot of 
complexity to the Polyfills, so 
that's why we're on the fence 
here is that for most cases 
everything should work fine, you
 might see a touch of flakiness 
which can be fixed, is that 
worth it for your set of users 
that happen to still be on IE 
ten that's the
 all right, over here, question.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm from PG software.  I have
 a question about folly per tool
 leverage a lot of ES6 syntax
 in my project we're using a let
 of -- and everything so we 
would want to make more custom 
builds
 I saw yesterday you're using 
the better syntax and you're add
ing the Service Worker
 by -- it would still be able to
 add if Service Worker and work 
on Polymer too?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, there's a couple way we 
want to integrate compilation in
 the work flow, one is the poll
ly build library the reason it's
 the way it is is to plug-in 
Babel or something in the 
pipeline in the appropriate 
place. It turns out that the 
type of compilation that Babel 
does to output ES five generally
 preserve the ability for the 
analyzer to recognize there's an
 Element there. There's some 
cases where it isn't true if 
you're using TypeScript with 
decorators. So our general 
approach is that like if you 
want to run analysis on your 
program, you want to do that 
before you've compiled it to 
make sure you're looking at your
 original source. We're adding a
 compile flag to the CLI to give
 you a default, good compilation
 via Babel. And we're going to 
add the ability for that to pick
 up the Babel RC file out of 
your project and take what 
seatings you need there. In 
general it should play nice. In 
the Service Worker what we 
determine needs to be in the 
Service Worker is to dependency 
graph, that's not changed by 
Babel. There shouldn't be any 
problems there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. Thanks.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right I have a question 
for our product manager Wendy 
and Taylors what can nonagingers
 do to get feedback and issue 
for Polymer and Polymer Elements
.  I file an issue, how come it
's not fixed.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can e-mail me personally 
it's Taylor zoophage at (L
aughing).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks Matt.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, first of all, we really
 appreciate when you do submit 
feedback, thank you everyone who
 does that already. It's a big 
reason why we're open source we 
love getting the feedback and PR
 from other people. A lot of our
 channels on slack we have tools
 channels they're smaller, 
generally, tools related, Justin
, Fred, Peter, they're in this. 
Woe have some other channels up 
there.  Usually we're on general
 pretty frequently.  If you have
 a question yes might want to 
stick that in there and get 
information, contact us on 
Twitter. There's a bunch of ways
. If you find like it's a pretty
 regular thing, feel free to bug
 us and we'll get back to you or
 try to.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, the best way, by far, t
o get quick response own a bug 
is make it a really really good 
bug. Meaning detailed Repro, if 
can get to it, example of even a
 JSBIN that shows us what the 
bug, actually failing.  Those 
help us triage we know that's 
not  going to be a ton oaf 
overhead digging down to the 
root cause. It helps us also get
 a feel for how serious you are 
about getting this bug fixed in 
a sense. How much it's impacting
 your project if it's worth 
putting that together. Obviously
 we get a ton of  bugs on the 
Polymer project across our 
Polymer library our Elements 
dozens of  tools.  I really do 
wish we had infinity engineers t
o fix all the bugs all the time.
  And we are, fortunately, back
ed by Google which allows us to 
awesome resources. When it comes
 down to it, we are still a 
small team of just people.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And we have hundreds of 
Repositories -- it's really hard
 to manage. Yeah, so we do our 
best. We really do appreciate 
issues that come in. We're 
always looking for better ways, 
better processes to triage and 
get bugs fixed. And we e
specially appreciate the really 
detailed bugs.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you're nervous about send
ing us PRes, we really like them
, even if you're not confidence 
in your fix, I have an idea, it 
may not be great we'll work with
 you to improve your PR, it's 
much easier
 than us to work from something.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think we've been doing a 
lot of things are the team, 
having our own catalog, things 
that have gotten in the way of 
the  ecosystem, so I think 
you're going to see us very, 
very soon, step one was just the
 beta of Web Components.org, 
getting out of the way and allow
ing the community to thrive and 
respond to things better too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Theyl savage at Gm ayeil.com.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sorry dude.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Trey lour.savage atgmail.com.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know who Paul Irish is.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Call Paul on github.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Neighbor the best advice 
would be  Schema.org for the 
time being.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What was the question.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Note a question. Just remark 
with regard to CSCO so maybe 
Schema.org is the answer for the
 time being. My real question is
 about inputs and Shadow DOM 
forms because when you have 
fields inside shadow roots forms
 doesn't -- foundation breaks. D
oes it truly work, really work 
maybe I have to put everything 
in light DOM.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The question is native form 
Element, I want to put Custom 
Elements inside, that does not 
work WTF me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Do you know anyone that knows
 about this?  I don't know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My question, get out of my 
way.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, this is a seven part 
answer, no.  I just did a pollly
 kit, the outtakes you saw this 
morning were from me trying to 
record two Polycast exactly that
 using Polycasts in custom forms
, the punch line is you can 
either copy the value you want 
to hit with input, the form only
 cares about the input tag at 
the moment, that's baked in the 
 parser, kind of hard to change.
 So either you copy your value 
to an input, or you put the 
input into the light DOM. You 
have to copy the value to the 
input if you want to use a 
native form. We're working hard 
to change the spec in this. The 
problem is that it's not a spec 
changing problem as much as it's
 literally baked in the parser, 
the parser will see a form and 
only look for input tags and 
changing that isn't exactlyel s
traightforward. Blink engineers 
have a panic attack when you 
tell them about changing the 
parser. I'm desperately trying 
to add spec to this to make 
inputs. To make you be able to 
get input functionality.  Again 
E equal attribute helps with 
this you can extend the input 
tag and make the Custom Element 
basically fake the input tag 
which would make it work with 
forms.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right, we have one minute
 left so we're going to go 
lightening round here.  I want 
to get to more of the audience  
question, but this one question 
is pretty important. How long 
will Polymer 1.0 be maintained 
now that Polymer 2.0 is a thing.
  What do you all think about 
that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As long as it needtion to be.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Whe.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Remember it's Taylor savage a
t --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Taylor, you know this is 
reported right  (Laughing) I 
hope we made it clear throughout
 the conference how much we care
 about upgrades and up freed 
paths and upgrade cycles and 
making it as easy as possible to
 upgrade. We feel the pain on 
Polymer team, we see it through
out the ecosystem, we really 
taken that seriously with 
Polymer 2 and all the tooling 
around it and the hybrid mode 
and the documentation that's 
coming. We hope that tup grade 
from Polymer 1 to Polymer 2 is 
fairly straightforward. Certain
ly not, I know many people 
mentioned about being around 
from the 0.5 to 1.5 um grade 
which is one of the lessons we 
learned hard.  I encourage 
everyone to upgrade as son as 
possible. We expect Polymer 1.0,
 it's a huge dependency inside 
of Google itself. We're on the 
hook for supporting it for at le
ast many b  months, years to 
come.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I have one tiny addition to 
that. With the V1 Web Components
 be support in the Polymer 1.0?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's not currently planned.
 But you know, based on feedback
 we'll see.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, yeah. So that's kind of
 more gets to when would the 
threshold for V0 usage get low 
enough in Chrome. Chrome shipped
 it, other browsers have not 
shipped it. So it's really a 
question of, it's still baked in
 Chrome, V1 is also in Chrome 
side by side, you can use them 
on the same page in terms of Web
 Components totally fine. Really
 this won't matter unless the 
user gets to such a low point 
that Chrome can take it out su
pport for it entirely which 
would be  fairly well in the 
future.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And just a technical note, 
one thing to be clear, the V1 
specks are not hugely different 
but they're different enough 
that frankly having both in play
 on the same page did just not 
something that makes sense to 
really contend with. So kind of 
having Polymer 1 have this mind 
set of having to deal with 
Virginia 0 and V1 V0 and V1.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, we are overtime, but I 
would like to take one last 
audience question because you've
 been standing patiently. If you
 tweet at@polymer Summit I will 
try to answer all of those on 
Twitter.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rob you know this is recorded
 right is this that's
 fine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, you.  I am Maxim from 
Canada we  talked a lot about 
performance  optimizationnd a I 
would like to know is the PRPL 
meant to replace DOM policety 
server side in server
 side run DOM?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wants to talk about server 
side  rendering.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think service side render
ing is a really interesting 
question, we need to look at how
 it actual hi relates to -- how 
it actually relates to pushing 
less for your actual render, 
itches talking to some engineers
 who work on another framework, 
framework   X
 service side rendering is like 
data compression, a component is
 like a compression, you know, 
using a component is like using 
a compressed format of your 
definition, it should be cheeper
 to use the component than 
expand everywhere elsewhere you 
use it. Service side rendering 
is like decomb pressing the data
 accepting uncome pressed day 
the over the wire and  
recompressing once it gets to 
the browser this should be bad. 
It should be faster to accepted 
your decompression your c
omponent definitions and get it 
down there. This engineer said 
yeah, once we split up our 
application, only sending what 
was needed for the first route 
it was faster than service side 
rendering.  I city our challenge
 with Web Components is that we 
don't have an existing service 
side  rendering solution we can 
compare against.  It certainly 
seems likely to me with the PRPL
 pattern and if you're rendering
 as son as you possibly can with
 the minimal resources for the 
route that it's going to beat 
service side rendering and give 
you a less complicated set up 
and server. So, we need to 
measure it to be sure, but 
that's my hunch.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you for that question. 
All right.  That is all of our 
time, please give a round of 
applause to our lovely panelists
.  (Applause)
 now, I'll leave the stage, I'm 
 going to turn it over to Matt 
McNulty.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Matt:  All right, so this is 
going to be one more minute. So 
first of all I just want to 
thank you guys, all of you, bec
ause you've been a tremendous 
audience, you're in your seats 
another exactly the right time, 
only two people forgot their 
badges. We won't call them out 
specifically (Laughing) and 
there's almost know drop off 
from day one today two, and 
that's super, super important 
for us because we do this for 
you.  This is a tremendous 
amount of work, as you can sigh 
there's a lot of people involved
 in this, there's a lot of 
planning going on, we've been 
doing rehearsals for unGodly a
mount of times, I've heard wall 
of this six times before. It's 
all worth it because you're 
enjoying it and having a good 
times, I keep saying guys, I 
should not do that.  There's two
 people I want to kale out 
specifically to show what a 
great audience you are.  I won't
 call them out by name because 
we don't have it. Two people flu
 in from Iceland yesterday and 
through a variety of planes 
trains and automobiles only got 
here two hours atwo. So we 
started off registration again 
got their badges printed out and
 got them here. Big round of 
applause for them. Wherever you 
are (Applause) so thank you very
, very much, this has been 
awesome, it's just great to have
 people here and finally get 
this out there for everyone to 
see. We have sort of two things 
we still need you to do. There 
is a survey already in your inb
ox, this real hi helps us 
improve and figure out what we 
need to cover next year, what we
 need to do better, what we've 
done really well, it's very 
important, please do your best 
to take care of that.  The other
 thing is just use Polymer, talk
 about it, share the talks you 
saw today, build something, 
build components U. go on 
slacker news and deal with that 
(laughing) so which you know, I 
can't ask you to do that really.
 That's too much to ask of 
anyone. Except Justin occasional
ly. They all laughed. But any 
way, thank you so, so much.  
What's the survey. I'm sure I'm 
forgetting something, thank you 
very much, I'll be here for a 
little bit and see you (Applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
