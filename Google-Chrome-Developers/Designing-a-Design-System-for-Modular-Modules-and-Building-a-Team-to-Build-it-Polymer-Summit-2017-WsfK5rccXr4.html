welcome to the talk with the very long
name designing a design system for
module modular modules and building a
team to build it my name is Josiah
McCann joining me on stage are Mary Ann
Epstein and Josh trout's Josh and I are
representing the core web development
team and Mary Ann is here representing
the UX design team at USA Today first I
want to start off by saying thank you
polymer team for having us out to speak
again last year was a really really fun
year very very practical talks and I'm
really excited about the talks tomorrow
and the rest of the talks today
it's been a great conference so far so I
want to share a little bit about the USA
Today Network and what we're all about
and and we're all about making
communities stronger and we do that and
to and to do that we have to inform them
equip them and empower them fostering
deep and vital connections between
members of our community and the world
around them and we connect these
communities all together through our
national brand USA Today and our 109
local media organizations merging our
national voice with the local
communities as an award-winning news
organization and a modern media company
our 500 plus digital products reach 110
readers every single month we reach 43%
of the internet population with our
content resulting in 1.5 billion page
views every month and as you can imagine
this level of scale and fragmentation
between so many websites has its
challenges and today we want to share
our success as a dev and a design team
focusing on very practical
two cool points you can immediately walk
away with and apply to any size team or
project so to give you a little bit of
context of you know here's what we've
been up to since we last spoke a year
ago we launched our new polymer base web
framework we're test driving it with a
few we test drove it with a few
different micro sites we talked about
one last summit our Olympics coverage
our data-driven Olympics coverage and
after that we launched our continuous
coverage of the election all converging
on election night the biggest news night
of the year where the framework made its
big stands taking on heavy amounts of
traffic and the entire process it was a
great way to see how much faster and
more efficient we could build on this
new framework while also identifying
areas that needed to be improved and at
the beginning of this year we began reap
lat forming our current sites onto this
framework and doing a complete redesign
at the same time right now usatoday.com
on mobile devices is completely powered
by this new polymer web framework part
of this new framework is we want to
figure out can we build quickly can we
build more efficiently and it really
really worked for us and but this new
approach that we took this module
everywhere approach is key to our
success in building for a large news
organization with many developers
scattered all over the nation so this is
this approach it's adopting a module way
of thinking and web components on the
client are front and center or polymer
based approach but also not just our
client but our servers we have server
side module ization
through micro service through a micro
service
this modules everywhere approach is very
decoupled allowing for maximum component
reuse across not just our team but
through any of our web developers spread
across the entire network reducing the
cost of experimentation maximizing
shared code use across each and every
property and to support this development
philosophy design had to be on board and
think module early as well and here to
talk about our new design system that
supports this framework is Mary Ann hi
everyone as desire' said our design team
has spent the past year working on a new
modular design system and today I'm
going to talk about what a big change
this was for us as well as what worked
well for our design and dev teams in
case your teams might be approaching
sort of similar challenges heading into
our redesign last spring we had separate
desktop and mobile sites and we've been
adding new things to them for a couple
of years and over time our designs had
veered off in many different directions
here you can see a story coming into our
desktop site and that same story also
coming into our mobile site and they
look very different from one another
and if you were to hide the logo at the
top you might even think that these came
from two different publications and
these differences we're causing problems
for our business our journalists
couldn't predict how their stories are
going to look which is very frustrating
for them and from analytics we knew that
our readers weren't as happy as they
could be either and because these same
sites were being sent to a hundred
different newsrooms our designs were
frustrating a lot of people every day
which on the UX team is the opposite of
what you want so there were some good
reasons behind everything looking so
different at this point first a lot of
things have changed since these sites
were built reader habits our
storytelling and response to those and
our scale we had grown a lot as a news
network in the past few years meanwhile
we were not set up well for all this
change we didn't have a style guide so
whenever we needed something new which
was pretty much all of the time we would
do our best to make it match but more
often than not we would have to design
it from scratch
so we wanted to really understand our
problems before diving in to redesign so
we shadowed our journalists to find out
what they really needed from our sites
and then we took inventory so we screen
capped every page of our websites to
understand how we were currently meeting
the journalists needs and what we found
were just hundreds and hundreds of
single-use one-off experiences so here's
a specific example to show you what was
happening we are a news organization so
one of the most important things we do
is promote stories to help readers find
things that they're interested in and we
call these story promos and at the time
of our inventory we found this so this
is 12 versions of a very similar-looking
story promo but each one of these could
only be used in a specific place so this
one only ever showed up on home pages
and this one only ever on blog pages
this one only ever appeared on mobile
article pages and this one only in
desktop search results and on and on for
all of these and if you look at these
more closely almost every style here is
unique so every headline has a slightly
different font treatment even the hex
values of all these greys they're all
different so not only had this same
thing been designed 12 times it had also
been dubbed twelve times and this is
just one example so we saw the same sort
of duplication and variation happening
for our video promos or share tools
pretty much everything else on your site
so to sit back for a second as a
designer unearthing all of this is
actually very very exciting so seeing
the same thing done so many times at
such scale and knowing how it was really
causing problems for our journalists and
our users that meant we had a really
good problem to solve it was actually
two problems we had a lot of design
sprawl and a lot of inefficiency and the
design team thought a lot about how to
solve these problems in such a way that
we wouldn't have the same ones again in
another year and we realized our focus
had to be reusability so we needed to
take anything we were doing over and
over and do one thing instead and that
meant we needed smarter modules so for
our segment modules that would either
do the same job in different places so
for example a promo that can live on a
home page or an article or to do the
same job across use cases so one promo
that could support a video story as well
as just a regular story and we needed
smarter styles so that we wanted to be
able to reuse them across these modules
to keep everything cohesive and help
fight designs for all so here's a very
short version of how we got there
based on our inventory we distilled the
needs of our site into module categories
so for us as a new site our promo story
media adds a couple of others then we
distilled all of our style needs into
style ramps so anything we use again and
again like type color spacers we
abstracted those into variables
and finally we designed some
documentation to help us stay organized
and for us documentation was absolutely
the key part of getting all of this to
work because if there's one thing we
learn from our inventory is that
reusability does not happen by accident
so even if dev moved to a component
based approach design still had a role
in making sure those components actually
met the right needs and actually fit
together visually on the page and we
found that reusability only happens when
we pay extremely careful attention to
details and then write them down so this
was quite an adjustment for our team
because not everyone loves writing
things down but we have come to love
what it does for us which is to help us
design things that are in fact reusable
and I'll share our version of design
documentation in a moment but first I
want to show you where we ended up so
here's our news story promo which now
has a real name from our story thumb
small or p1 for short and this was our
single reusable module answer to the 12
different versions we had before and
this module can live on a small screen
or a large screen it can live in the
main content well or in a side rail it
can promote a video story or a 360 video
story it can promote a story without an
image which is often the case for
breaking news or a story without a
timestamp which helps us showcase our
best evergreen content
and it can live on a home page or an
article page or search results or any
other page we build in a future and it
is made entirely of reusable styles so
here you can see that everything in this
module is pointing to one of our style
variables even the space between
elements and Josh is going to talk a
little bit about that for a second so we
implemented this through the usual ways
of styling polymer applications and
elements a custom style element for our
theme and that had CSS custom properties
mix-ins and some classes this sample
shows the colors and typography used in
that Pirlo and also shows how we mirror
some of the Vixens
into classes so we can use that in
server-side HTML we also built custom
elements for some of the more complex
design elements like icons and buttons
and this example on the screen which is
like a little label header that goes
above a lot of our list of promos and
now Marian is going to keep talking to
us about more about documentation
okay thanks Josh ok back to our friends
p1 here
a lot of attention to detail went into
making this one module smart enough to
be reused in so many ways and that's
where our documentation came in so we
wanted to keep documentation as minimal
and lightweight as possible while also
making sure we weren't missing anything
and one exciting thing we learn as we
troubleshot that is that dev and design
actually needed to know the same things
so we found that to make a module
reusable we all had to agree on the
answers to five basic questions what is
it called what is it made out of
what variants do we need how does it
scale and what Styles is it using and
here's a peek under the hood at our
version of design documentation for that
p1 module on the Left we have our
functional spec and on the right our
design spec which we call our matrix
because it's a visual matrix of how this
module can look and together these
documents answer those five questions
so question 1 what is it called we never
used to pay attention to this but now
anything we build gets a specific name
so we can keep track of it and reuse it
and we collaborated with dev on a naming
system which includes three parts a
shorthand ID so in this case it's p1 and
that's just makes it easier to talk
about things category ID here it's promo
and a descriptive ID so this is story
thumb small which tells us this has a
small thumbnail image next question what
is it made out of here we establish that
this module has a headline plus some
optional things like labels and image
and other nested modules like a
timestamp and an icon question 3 what
variants do we need this is where we
capture our modules use cases so for the
p1 we have our default display than
variants for no image different media
types advertiser content and a couple of
others question 4 how does it scale so
here we see with a narrow version and a
wide version and the matrix tells us how
you sit on the grid as well as what the
two sizes look like and finally our
Styles we call out our style variables
over here and this helps us avoid those
one-off styles we used to have so many
of so I hope you can see that for us
documentation is not an end in itself it
has really turned into a thinking tool
for our teams to help all of us check
our work for reusability and over the
past few months we've used this method
to build out an MVP set of modules for
our new site which launched 100 percent
last week and here it is here is our new
story page design and we think it looks
much cleaner and more on brand and much
more trustworthy than the old one and
it's going to be much more predictable
for our journalists and our readers but
what's even more beautiful to me about
this new design is that we now have this
kind of x-ray vision into it so anyone
on our team can look at this page and
know exactly the modules that came
together to build it and this x-ray
vision makes us so much more efficient
than before when we need to change
something which we know we will as we
test things and get feedback and as our
needs change we can change in one place
instead of 12 and we can quickly build
new pages by repurposing things we've
already built the last thing I want to
share with you all is that we've been
beta testing this for a few months
and we can see that our readers are now
spending significantly more time with us
per visit on the new site
so while we love the new the new design
system our readers loving it is what we
care the most about so we're really
happy with that result and we're excited
to keep evolving all of this because
it's brand new it's a work in progress
and there's still a lot to learn but
thank you so much and Josiah's going to
take it from here Thank You Marianne
very good stuff so building a team to
build stuff we've so we've unified
around a module base decoupled web
framework we've established a shared
design system that organizes our vision
behind every component we build but we
we need to think about how to structure
a web development team around component
driven web development because I believe
we're in the post abstraction era of
coding for the web and as we unify as a
team around a standards-based approach
element encapsulation and heavy
reusability we need to structure our
team for maximum efficiency and
effectiveness we've we've all been
building websites and web things the
same way for a very long time now but
web components changes this work dynamic
entirely and because of that it was time
to think about a new kind of team
organization in our internal observation
we identified three coding styles that
make up our team the innovative artists
the disciplines scientists and the very
reliable craftsmen and it's really
important for us to understand how these
different coding Styles work together in
order to build an effective team and
every style has its strengths and
weakness no one's greater than the other
and some of us fall don't really fall
cleanly into one column or the next but
some projects may benefit from one style
being more dominant than another style
for example a banking application is
very focused on being accurate and not
time to market while if you're working
for an innovative startup pushing that
code out the door it's changing the
world it we want to do that very very
quickly for our investors a balanced
team a balanced team can cover the
weaknesses of one single type but only
when good communication and empathy
driven teamwork is applied so let's
learn a little bit more about these
different coding styles let's take the
artists the adventurer the innovator the
fast-moving the problem solver always
figuring out the problem always finding
a better way Wow cutting a few corners
in there I can identify with the artist
the most it's like tests what are tests
I don't know I don't know what a test is
you know our our weakness as ours unique
solutions are great for pushing
innovation and doing things better but
unique means it's harder for someone
else to pick up and maintain code how
the artists would approach building the
p1 modules they would they might say oh
I'm going to use the new grid CSS grid
framework and that's how I'm going to
I'm going to make this happen but we
already have a grid framework and for
the company and we've just fragmented
company standards all of a sudden
someone else comes around to reuse it
and they're like what did you do this
CSS grid framework
so instead artists need to innovate the
right way by focusing on things to
improve everyone's work for a workflow
not just the current vertical that
they're working at the scientist pursues
code as a discipline to be mastered
they're focused on best practices have
very well tested code and this is really
really good but it can all come at the
cost of over engineering solutions and
slower time to market and the scientists
they would approach that p1 promo module
that Maryann showed us they might look
at it and say oh we need the use the
image resizer for this image oh and this
image resizer it's it's really clunky to
work with it needs some refactoring or
how we're fetching data over here for
this p1 it's not very L
again I think I'm going to rewrite it
and so all of a sudden we've taken a
very small scope module and really
really extended the scope but the
positives are there they're continuing
to improve on a framework and plugging
holes in framework and pieces of code
carefully tested disciplined always
seeking the industry best industry
standard practices slower time to market
over engineering you don't know anyone
like that do you maybe the craftsman
very very important these are often
under look coding styles and people that
you work with every day they are the
steady dependable delivering consistent
on-time code that's very very reliable
sometimes they can lacked innovation and
deeper technical expertise they might
approach that p1 module like this
they're using two keyboards and Emacs
not really who uses Emacs they might
approach it oh I wrote 60% of this code
last week or code like it I'm just going
to copy my code I'm going to bring it
over here and I'm going to reuse all
this code great and that's awesome
because we're keeping on the company's
standards we're doing a lot of reusing
but not so good because no one has
stopped to think hey is there a better
way to do what I'm doing is there a
better way to solve this problem and
maybe copying the code that I use from
last week is great but if I'm copying
code from a month ago a lot of things
can change in a month overall the
craftsman is a very very important
addition to the team often overlooked by
the other coding personalities now
adding web components in the mix on top
of these Styles you know web component
development really resonates with each
of these styles in different ways the
artists they get to forge ahead on these
on these new best practices they get to
blazed a new trail because we've been
building this things the same way for a
very long time they get to go back to
the drawing board the scientists will
they get their standards-based web
development you know even though this is
a very free solution they get that
encapsulation they get
clean organized code and ability to test
things logically so the scientists they
love this and a craftsman will they get
to use familiar tools and technologies
that they already know HTML CSS and
JavaScript and polymer has such a
straightforward simplified API it's not
like throwing a whole new abstracted web
framework at a crafts been expecting to
them to learn a completely new API and
framework they get to use the tools that
they already have
that's how web components resonates with
each of these styles so important we
know and we understand these different
styles a little better so how do each of
these Styles work together how do you
balance a team with these styles and we
have to remember and when you're working
with a team with different style coders
we're all in this together and we can
either be building each other up or
tearing each other down and balance is
really struck by the scientists bringing
that structure bringing the hey we need
to harden this and test this to the
artist and the artist saying hey let's
solve this problem that no one's been
able to solve yet let's do it with
innovation and he's bringing that to the
crafts from the scientist and the
craftsman is like hey reality check
everybody we need to be on schedule we
have something to deliver and we just
got a go go go so the other interesting
thing is that this can also be applied
to entire dev teams as entire
development team sort of lean one way or
the other and how do you solve for team
to team interaction that's even harder
than you know just managing a team and
figuring that out amongst the team and
it's through empathy it's through clear
communication and it's through
cooperation so empathy Okies throughout
that word what does that really look
like practically well it's like a
buttons bunch of scientists on teams
saying I can't believe they don't have a
hundred percent code coverage in that
project and we do this all the time and
let's so stop and let's empathize what
does empathy look like here well Anthony
under empathy and understanding says
well maybe the team is
focused on delivering something fast
within perfect code maybe that's what
this particular team needs is focused on
right now and then the artists why
aren't they using the absolute newest
way to build things
well let's empathize maybe it's safer
and easier to build on a proven industry
standard for their project than going
off the rails and building something
else here's what we want to do we want
to fight again extremes and both the
artists and the scientists they can look
at the craftsmen and say oh they're not
real coders they're not up at 3 o'clock
in the morning contributing to open
source repositories every night but
they're there the bread and butter
they're the ones that are there churning
out all this work and we have to fight
against extremes we have to remember to
empathize or else craftsmen will get
impostor syndrome and the walls of
hubris and ego will be built up with
scientists and with artists so now josh
is going to talk about how we've
structured our web component developer
experience specifically Josh so we put
this into practice on our dev team in a
few ways the first is focusing on the
API over the element implementation
because there always be times when you
must compromise on code quality where
speed to market is just more valuable to
the business than having the absolute
most rock rock-solid code ever so what
that means is like focusing on the
reviewing the API which is the names the
properties and public methods of an
element the implementation of all those
things can be refactored later very
safely without having to worry about
anybody breaking anybody else's code the
way we actually make sure that
refactoring actually happens on our team
is we have a program we call adopt a
module and that means we just bake in
some time to every sprint where we allow
developers to go back and review modules
have been maybe sitting around for a
while that we haven't touched and
cleanup documentation clean up some
JavaScript that might be a little messy
maybe some Styles aren't implemented as
cleanly as possible and that let those
kind of get code out to market quickly
but still come back and make sure we are
having
really good code that will be
maintainable and lot long-lasting so
what that looks like in practice is this
is a really simple sample element and
showing a good API with some bad code so
you see there's this horrible little
string function that's filtering out
spaces for some reason but it's got a
nice name for the element it's got a
good property title and all the bad
stuff can be refactored out later on the
flipside you've got a bad API good code
module which is got a really nice
implementation for the filtering it's
just much cleaner it's got some error
checking but there's a problem with it
there's a misspelling and the title
change handler and you can't go back and
fix that because if somebody else is
already using that you can't fix that
spelling and the property is just called
T so now all the elements that are set T
equals whatever they're going to have to
change that and then the element names
not even that great so this is an even
bigger problem when you're dealing with
other teams using your code and it's the
biggest problem when you're actually
open sourcing your code and the rest of
the world is using your stuff you don't
want to be breaking their applications
because you got a little sloppy at the
start so to get this focus we kind of
build things backwards we call it demo
driven development we start by building
examples of how the code will be used
how the element will be used and this is
pretty easy because of the spec
documents we have they list out all the
different variants that design has told
us that we should account for and so we
can show what each of those look like
and think about how the element will be
used to build out each of those things
once we have that solid and we like it
then we actually built the elements
implementation and then finally we'll
come through an edge test and make it
production ready so what this looks like
for our promo module is listing out
stuff like the normal variants the
version with no image a version for
videos version for galleries and all
this lives in a demo file that's right
next to the element and it gets heard
through our custom dev server so as
you're developing your element you can
be testing on this this demo
page and as you build out the
implementation things start to come to
life and when the whole page is working
you know you're done you ready to start
building those tests so the last thing
that we get from web components is
division of labor and what's nice is you
can break out who works on which element
based on their skill set so if you've
got an element that you say well we're
really not sure how to build this thing
out very well so let's give that to our
artist because they're going to be able
to come up with an interesting solution
for this if you've got an element that's
really complicated and you need someone
who's going to really put a lot of tests
behind it and then get that one to the
scientist and then if you've got an
element that you know exactly how you
want to build it but you just need to be
built on time and get it out at the
right moment give that to your craftsmen
and then the great thing is you can
always come back and have the other
style do the refactoring later and so
the the scientists can come in and clean
up the artists code and add some more
tests or the artist could come in and
say oh craftsman you could have built
this a little bit better and so if you
get that kind of interaction it's great
so we hope this glimpse into how we
build things will help you build great
things with polymer as well thanks for
having us here and have a great rest of
the conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
