bidelman from the chrome dev summit 2016
we're just wrapping up the day i'm here
with rick buyers from the chrome team
and robert from developer relations the
party's about to start but before we do
that let's talk a little bit about
predictability and the things you guys
presented today you want to kind of
highlight the show for us sure we want
to make sure that it works for welders
across the board it doesn't have to they
don't have to worry about different
browsers and inconsistencies Alexis and
Rick you show us some really amazing
kind of numbers and where chrome is
going kind of stats and bugs were
crushing can you kind of highlight those
yeah I was just trying to show that
really we're putting a lot of effort
into engineering discipline right we
care a lot about developer feedback we
want the web to just work for developers
and so I just just trying to show we're
not perfect yet but I'm just trying to
show that there's a really good like if
developers file bugs against us we've
now got the process in place so that
folks get ready two teams teams have a
process for triaging their bugs
prioritizing and fixing the most
important things and so it's really
worth developers time to file issues and
I think we're doing a good job at at at
least tackling the most important ones
so what you're saying is we're going to
fix all the bugs and all the feature
requests right no software project ever
fixes all their bugs right but the
important thing to do is that we're
seeing everything we're engaging with
web developers right when you file a bug
against us like engineers are looking at
that and we'll talk to you about it and
you know we rely a lot on stars you
people should start of the bugs they
care about and and the ones with the
most stars get get the most traction
cool and Robert you talked a little bit
about a new kind of offering for web
blur it's a place they can go for
feedback right so we have our developer
site with lots of documentation and
guides and walkthroughs and all that and
the idea there's have a new feedback
section we can learn how to file good
bugs to make sure that they get resolved
you can search across bugs bugs across
different browser engines and find a
different ones and get some consistency
in feeling for how it actually all holds
together and much much more and also
we're going to keep on doing things over
time there so it's not like a stale
content page we're going to have more
offerings and more opportunities with
developers to get involved so that
sounds amazing thanks for joining us
today guys okay welcome everybody
signing off today from chrome dev summit
