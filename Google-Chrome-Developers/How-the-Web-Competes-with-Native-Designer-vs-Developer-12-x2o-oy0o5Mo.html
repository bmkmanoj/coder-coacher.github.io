because I know this topic frustrates you
and you're just gonna do it anyway yeah
of course because it's great it makes
great television PWA is this like it
feels like the new technology the new
thing to be doing and all the cool kids
are doing it our pwace the new native
and i know this is you so i'll let you
rent it
okay so pwace is a term of just like web
tech right like certain api as you can
use in the web to bring native light
features so you could like conceivably
have an offline experience whereas
before you have the dinosaur but this
argument is still basically can web
compete with native which is the
long-running thing and i used to be one
of those guys was like the web can't
compete with native like at all like it
was like flat-out part the community
everyone generally was just like no you
don't use web tech in your apps because
it's a bad experience yeah then i kind
of slowly came around to the idea of
this some web type that you can use and
then eventually was like well the web
views are kind of the problems and then
android change to the chromium based
webview and things got better and then
as i kind of shift more to just web side
of things they started realizing
actually it's just much harder to make a
solid web experience but you can do it
and i think that's it's less to do with
camp ewas compete with native or
anything like that it's much more of a
case of everyone just has to look at
what actually makes sense for what
they're trying to achieve and what are
the team's capable of achieving i
remember way back in the day i was
trying to do just a navigation drawer so
it just slide out fade in a background
that was it couldn't get 60 frames per
second on a desktop and I was just like
I was talking to Paul Lewis and like why
is this not working can you please help
me figure this out and he kind of nude
her on it a bit and then just sent back
like another jsbin he was like hey gonna
fixed it I was looking through the code
not much to change except like one thing
was like opacity had changed from being
naught to naught point 8 to being
or point naught naught 1 2 nor point 8
now this is like what the hell is that
why have you done that that doesn't make
any sense and he explained it was like
well the browser is now trying to render
not point no not one so it's basically
invisible to the user but as far as the
browser is concerned it's rendered it so
when you fade it in its yeah it's
already on there and it can just do some
smart graphic stuff and and it's like no
sane web developer who's new to the
platform would ever do that but if
you've got experience you would and it's
kind of the same with native you're an
experienced native developer on some
platform there's probably certain things
that you see a ton of like new people to
the platform do and you just let that's
no never how you do it
but so I mean it does feel like the web
is there's a lot more hackery involved
there's some more it feels like you're
having to do a lot more experimenting
that's not just as clear cuz I use this
library and this is what I'm definitely
gonna get I know I'm gonna get in
there's no problem the web and in the
sense I think there's almost the best
the charm of the web I know is from a
user point of view that's not
necessarily the greatest thing because
it requires you to have a certain
knowledge and it requires us to like
make certain things common knowledge as
well you it's two things right like on
the one side if you if you wanted like
the nav drawer example like a native
platform you it's almost encouraged that
there's a clearly defined path of this
is the UX best practices for this
platform how you do it and you get like
a ton of stuff for free web it's just
like good luck figuring out what your
navigation patterns gonna be and at that
point it's great because you can come up
with anything that you want you can be
as creative as you want which is awesome
it's a good thing the flip side of that
is you have to build it from scratch
yourself borderline every single time
which is painful because you start doing
that across everything you're doing in
your experience and it's suddenly like
you've got a big workload whereas at
least with native you can pick and
choose what you're gonna do but there's
not what sort of further like could the
I mean you know just to be playing
devil's advocate that doesn't that give
you more freedom there on the web in a
sense because you are responsible for
everything I mean okay you might use
something like react or like one of the
Tibbett and that other sort of like
frameworks or libraries or whatever but
still have that kind of you set the
standard you have that kind of creative
freedom yes but I feel like the native
the kind that comes a certain point of
you can do certain things you get a lot
of stuff for free and then what you end
up spending your time on is the thing
where we're gonna go completely custom
on this one thing we're gonna spend all
the time and effort on it and we know
it's gonna have performance issues and
these issues and these issues but we're
going to fix them we just need to do a
version and then fix it that's an actual
choice commitment thing that you're
doing rather then yeah on the web you
you kind of sit there just being like
well you've got to build this component
need to build this component needs to do
this you need to do that and can we use
any of this ever again maybe maybe not
who knows and it's way too easy to just
get in a scenario where it's not
reusable it sounds like you're arguing
against the way this is I think the
thing for me is like I think both sides
have to acknowledge that one way or
another you have to be an expert in what
you want and you also have to set a
certain bar of what you expect I feel
like a lot of web developers you could
get to a point where actually this
doesn't perform that great and it's very
easy to then sit and go well the web is
like that as a whole because you look at
other examples of websites you like well
that's doing it there and it's doing its
variants being there that's fine when
actually it's like one though just
because they're all doing it doesn't
mean you can then go oh this is fine for
us as well it's no you should be driving
to be better whereas I feel like with
native there's a certain set of things
we you already get further ahead just
from the offset because you're
inheriting other work from the platform
and the other side is the standard
generally is a lot higher because you've
got something that's curated a list of
his a shining example of what we can do
on this platform but again I mean it
does feel like the downside for me is
everything feels very templated on the
native platforms yes everything looks
the same I mean you do occasionally get
like an app which is like you know
completely unique it feels like web used
to be more so like that and webs almost
trying to become templated yeah and
that's kind of the the awkward thing is
you don't you don't want it to be like
that throughout the entire web like I
hit a website where it was like it was
like a Fibonacci cone I see yeah yeah is
amazing because everything like you just
have a square and then the
Paige Scrolls around and it's like over
here it's beautiful I've never seen
anything like it
but the caveat of that is obviously is
like if you you clearly gone so far
afield that is completely custom and you
could do is that the same thing I feel
like with web we have those pseudo
standards where it's just that you
member like the web 2.0 like certain
gradients and border radiuses everywhere
yeah so I feel like the web has it that
the problem is you it's still that whole
thing of everyone's vaguely doing the
same thing but everyone's writing the
exact same thing over and over again and
that's the bit that I think's a bit
frustrating I find it frustrating yes
and I think that's why you see things
like bootstrap like everyone loves that
because it's just a common thing you
just inherit it do it and it works and
it's kind of where I kind of want web
components to to fit into a lot of this
is just like okay do this and then it
works my biggest concern there is if you
look at some of the design patterns from
platforms when this like oh here's a
ListView they all largely follow the
same at least from developers side like
api's and this is how you take your data
set you can do whatever you want in the
middle and then the view will just do
the smart stuff and make it fast
components it still feels like that gap
is still very much in the component side
and it's still very opinionated in terms
of how it produces the final output yeah
and it's just like I need to customize
this this and this and I can't see a
clean way of doing it when I hear the
word components it scares me because it
feels like again the homogenizing is
that why would a modernizing this or
design standards and I know it's it's
from a developer point of view you just
want to have like the right answer so
you know what you're doing is
aesthetically good or functioning or
from a UX point of view we know that
this pattern works yeah but the problem
is is that fear that everything becomes
very same me and I know that to make
things as components it helps like
enterprise applications because once
they've got their styled or design thing
done then having components that they is
like customized on the fly because of
like you know I've made like an
e-commerce site or whatever yeah it
requires that kind of thing but my fear
is when the components becomes a library
then everyone starts looking the same I
mean how do you fight that the thing is
when you use a component on a native
platform for the most part you get stars
but they're normally so
terrific that you foster changed yeah
exactly it's kind of that whole thing of
like if you if you pull in just a list
you it's very clear like they've done
nothing to style this so immediately the
first thing you do is start customizing
each individual item and that's the bit
that is like that's where you start
getting in your own personality of what
the app is the problem with the web is I
see a lot of these things where you go
here's a list view and it's like already
you start looking like a certain kind of
UI app because it's a ton of Styles just
slap on top of it you're like they don't
change it that's the bit that I think is
your fear which is why I'm kind of like
you you need a certain set of components
where they're just like blank boring
disgusting but they're functional and
then you pile on the design and just how
you want it to look and feel on top of
it but you need that good base where
it's flexible enough that you can do
that and it's performant enough that it
doesn't there's no worries about pulling
that in and no fear that you have to
rewrite it yourself
so PWAs are not than you native then is
what you're saying I think what people
should be discussing is more of the fact
of what is the experience you trying to
go for and it's just you shouldn't
really be worrying about the tech it's
like if you have a team of Android
developers yeah you should probably be
building an Android app rather than
asking them all to build a web app same
as if you have a massive team or web
developers there's no reason you should
sit there say go build an Android app
for the sake of it when it's like well
no you can do offline experiences you
can do push notifications you can do
tons of stuff wasn't possible like from
before so if you have the team of web
developers get them building a PWA I
think the main thing is just don't look
at like ah native apps are better in
this way because of their more
performant and they do this it's a site
well no it's just the web can do that
it's just you have to put the time and
effort into it don't just see it as
switch platforms and then all the
problems are fixed which is what I think
this conversation normally encourages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
