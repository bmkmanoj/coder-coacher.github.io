welcome back to the alley cash show
today I want to talk about managing
focus in a single page web application
so this is an interesting topic I had a
Googler reach out to me recently they
were like hey I'm building a single page
web app meaning they click on a piece of
navigation and it just like loads more
content into the page without refreshing
the browser and then we're wondering for
someone using a screen reader what is
the best way to convey like hey this
content has loaded it is ready to
interact with so I wanted to put
together a little example and kind of
walk through the process that I
typically use when I'm doing something
like this so follow me over here my
laptop and I've got this little site
that I've created
if you've ever seen lorem ipsum which is
just like placeholder text that people
oftentimes use in their designs there's
a bunch of fun lorem ipsum is out there
for like bacon and hipsters and zombies
and so this is a site that just loads
different lorem ipsum so get hipster
it's them bacon ipsum zombie zip some
and the thing that I really want to show
off though is what this experience is
like when I use my screen reader so
ideally what's going to happen is we're
going to interact with a anchor over
here on the left and then it's going to
dump us into the page the thing to note
here is that we've got every page
contains this anchor tag I've snuck one
inside of here and so what I want to
show off there is as we're you know
switching over to the page we can
quickly get down to that anchor we don't
have to tab through the rest of our
navigation so let's try that with like
our screen reader voice over on Chrome
managing focus fp8 window you have
visited link zombies visited link
hipsters heading level one hipster
gipson main one item link Wolf Moon
voiceover off so what we're doing there
is we're interacting with the menu the
second the new content loads we're
moving the focus into the page and then
we're because we're inside of the page
then we can very quickly get down to the
next interactive element that we want we
want to go tabbing through our entire
you know side nav are navigating through
our whole side map which in this site is
very small but you could imagine on like
a really big site with a bunch of
dropdowns and accordions and stuff in
there it can be really annoying to have
to like move through all that stuff
yourself using a screen reader or using
the tab key on your keyboard so how do
we do this well basically what I've done
here is I've
created a little h1 it's kind of a big
h1 in this case that's taking up our
entire header and I want to show you in
the dev tools if I inspect this element
so the thing to note here is we've got
an h1 and then it's been given a
tabindex of negative 1
now we shot an episode previously on
using tabindex so I'll include that down
in the show notes you have access to
that but basically tabindex is an
attribute that will opt elements into
the focus order there's kind of three
states the tabindex can have you can
have a tab index of 0 meaning that the
element is you know reachable by the
keyboard so you press the tab key on my
keyboard and that'll boom focus it you
can have a tab index of like greater
than 0 you can have time index like 1 or
5 or a hundred or something that's
generally kind of an anti-pattern
because what it does is it jumps that
element in front of everything else on
the tab order usually you don't want to
actually do that but I did want to
mention it for completeness sake and
have an ex- one like we're doing here
what that does is it means the element
is not in the the keyboard focus order
so I can't reach it pressing the tab key
but I can focus it programmatically by
calling its focus method and that's
exactly what I'm doing every time the
page changes so let's go look at the
code for that and you can see kind of
like a little bit I'll walk you through
so the structure of the page so we've
got our our nav here with the side nav
links right so it's on these hipsters
bacon things like that through my
favorite thing and I've got the this
main element here this is where we're
dumping all the page content when it
loads in and if we look a little bit
further down the page I've just got
these template elements that contain all
that page content so here's the template
for zombie is the template for hipsters
and the template for bacon right you can
see our header with tabindex negative 1
and so if we look at the JavaScript for
our router I'm just using a very simple
router called page Jas you can I mean
you can use any router you want I just
pick this one because it was easy to set
up and what I'm doing is listening for
any URL change that happens so anytime
you click a link it's going to intercept
that it's going to tell me the URL and
then I just say basically you know let's
figure out the bit of the URL after the
slash so in this case I use me like the
page name like just the word zombies or
just the word hipsters and I've got this
little ad pay
for pass function and all we're doing
here is we're finding the template that
matches that page pack so I'm saying
okay cool so get element by ID passing
with that and - template so again you
know someone passed in zombies or bacon
that will match this ID right here
bacon template so then we grab our main
element we clear it out
we drop that content in there we append
child the template content and then I'm
just returning my main element treating
that like the page and the main thing to
note here sort of like the magic that
happens is I then query selector the
page I look for that h1 with that
tabindex of negative 1 and then I'm just
calling its focus method and that just
moves the user right into that content
the nice thing is when you do that the
screen reader is just going to go ahead
and announce that new content something
to note if you only open my my CSS you
can see it here here we go okay so right
now I'm applying a focus style where I'm
overriding the default outline style on
that h1 so anytime you opt an element
into its focus order if it's an h1 if
it's a span whatever you know once that
element gets focused you're going to see
the browser's default focus style on it
and so if I comment this out
save this let me go back to our
application C reload this alright and
you see right away because we start off
on zombies it automatically updates the
URL so you get this blue focus ring on
zombies I changed a hipster change to
bacon got this big focus ring if you you
know show this to your your project
manager or designer or even just like
customers that might be confused by that
they're like I'm not quite sure why put
this weird focus ring on this control so
this is one of the rare instances where
I think it's okay to actually override
the outline on this control because
again we're not asking the user to
interact with it or anything like that
we're really just trying to direct the
focus into that area really we're kind
of moving their focus navigation
starting point if you want to think of
it that way into that area so that the
next time they hit tab and the next time
they move the screenreader it's going to
go ahead and be able to interact with
the rest of that content so again let's
run through that just one more times you
can see how it works
voiceover on Chrome managing
visited black visited blank hipsters
heading level one hipster hip some main
one item blank wolf moon always
overwrought okay
so we've definitely made the greatest
website in the world and by the way I
will be sharing all this code on github
so you too can add your own its them to
the ipsum glossary that we've built here
but yeah this is generally how I manage
focus in a single page web app just find
a heading tab and X negative one on to
it and put the users focus over there
that about covers it for today if you
have any questions forum you can always
leave them down below in the comments or
hit me up on a social network of your
choosing
as always thank you so much for watching
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
