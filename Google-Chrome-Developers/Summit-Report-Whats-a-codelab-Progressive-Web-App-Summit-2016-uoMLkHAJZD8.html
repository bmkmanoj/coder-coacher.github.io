back to the progressive web apps summit
we're here in the the code lab area up
on the third floor I've got Eric
bidelman with me eric is is the coolest
developer advocate that I know Eric can
you tell me just a little bit about like
what what are what are the folks doing
here what kinds of code labs are our
people working on right now what is
going on here there's a so we're just
coding man we're building progressive
web apps there's a bunch of code labs
for the event you can build stuff in
polymer you can build stuff in it and
learn about progressive web apps and
people are just sitting down getting
getting their hands dirty it's good
right not so and so we got polymer
progressive web apps firebase write a
web Bluetooth all sorts of sort of cool
interesting bleeding edge stuff now the
the code lab site itself actually has
kind of a cool architecture which you
touched on a little bit in your session
can you can you talk through that just a
little bit what's up with that site yeah
so we built the the site in house and we
basically wanted to try to build a site
that renders really fast and uses
polymer and web components as you
probably know about web components but
it's exciting because we were able to
use things like serviceworker use
polymer in my talk I actually go over on
kind of how we did it and got a really
fast first paint even on mobile and it
renders great it feels great and it
hosts all of developers code labs that
we have so it's cool and if if these
folks want to go scope out that site and
actually do some of these code labs
where where do they go so they go to
code labs dot developers at google com
and that actually hosts all of our
colapse so not just web stuff you're
interested in anything under the Sun
when it comes to our developer products
it's there and they'll be available for
ever and ever more until the internet
dies so we'll have a link to the code
labs down in the description Eric thank
you so much for being with me today
thank you all so much for watching again
if you want to catch out or catch more
