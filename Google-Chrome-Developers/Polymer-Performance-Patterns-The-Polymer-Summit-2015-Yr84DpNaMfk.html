your polymer apps
not everyone has a Paul Irish in their
pocket they can take around with them
and debug their apps for them so we need
to learn how to build apps really fast
from the start again here's my
information if you want to follow me on
Twitter again all the demos as well are
gonna be on github so everything I show
you today is gonna be up there but let's
hop right in so there's two buckets when
I think of performance the first is load
how fast is your app paint pixels to the
screen how fast is your app load its
resources that's critical that's the
first experience when people come to
your app yeah the next one is render
what happens when they've loaded your
app it's not enough that it loads fast
they actually have to have a good
experience when they're in your app no
jank if you have animations or if
they're interacting with your app things
need to be snappy and really fast and if
we have time we'll talk about future
api's that are really exciting really
really awesome for performance so why
should you care about performance well
you can actually just go to the
definition one of the definitions of
performance which reads the extent to
which an investment is profitable
especially in relation to other
investments I read this and I said hey
what if you replace a couple words the
extent to which an app is usable
especially in relation to other apps
that's performance if people are leaving
your app because you suck at performance
nobody wants that we want to be
successful developers and the reason
they leave our apps for another app
should not be because performance is
suffering Paul Irish showed you this
awesome kind of unofficial table of user
interactions and I'm not going to dive
too much into this but the moral the
story here is 250 milliseconds is that
sweet spot that's where users really
really like in your app feels fast if
you start to go above 100 milliseconds
maybe a tap takes too long something
loads something Jencks you start to lose
people that you do a mental context
which by 10 seconds you should basically
just give up try something else maybe go
maybe go native I don't know so the good
news is for polymer 1.0 we've already
leveled you up polymer 1.0 is faster
than polymer 0.5 and we talked about
this at Google i/o this year it's 3 X
fast
Krum that's even with the native web
component AP is 4x faster in the
polyfill browsers like iOS so this is
great again you're already you know your
baseline is already above where we
started in 0.5 but this could be these
are relative numbers to our old version
of polymer right
maybe it's 3x faster than dogs slow who
knows right I want to put some real
numbers around an app written polymer
some absolute numbers and show you how
to build an app that's really fast from
the get-go
so let's happen let's talk about load
what can we do to paint pixels to the
screen as fast as possible we need to
dissect what we recommend to people this
is the basic scaffold of an application
we typically have in our demos or sample
apps the first thing you do is you have
to load the web components polyfills at
script tag at the top now this is
already better than the old version of
the polyfill because it doesn't load the
full shadow Dom polyfill it loads the
shady Dom polyfill which is much smaller
and just tries to mimic shadow x
capabilities the second thing you do is
you load at limits dot HTML and here
gonna have all of your element imports
and dependencies now the polymer team we
typically just have one of these files
and all the imports inside of it which
is convenient to do that but you can
have a bunch of these on the page if you
want and the last thing we have here is
this unresolved attribute which I'll
talk about this is the polymer feature
that makes working with apps really easy
so this is great this is really easy to
reason about but I wouldn't be here if
we can't do better and of course we can
so already from the start because of
that setup you're hindering yourself as
far as performance is concerned so let's
jump in and dissect this what's wrong
with this app the first thing is we're
loading this polyfill this script tag is
gonna block rendering of our page right
from the get-go so if we're on a slow
connection we're already kind of you
know degra gating the performance so
that's no good we should put a sync on
that which boot a sync on that tag and
then it won't block rendering it'll just
parse that code out which is awesome the
second thing we can do is work with this
import so by default imports actually
block rendering of the page as well
until this elements at HTML loads none
none of those resources and none of the
markup is going to show up it's gonna
block rendering of the page and that's
because imports behave exactly like CSS
so by default style
Sheetz block the page because you don't
want to have this weird flash of
unstyled content come in and imports do
that too because you can actually put
style sheets inside of imports so the
behavior is the same but the good news
is we can pop an async attribute on this
element as well and so by doing this
we're no longer gonna be blocking the
rendering so nothing in our head is
blocking the page it's awesome
this markups gonna render the user right
away it's worth kind of spending a
little bit of time I'm talking about
imports if this is how we load web
components we use it for dependencies
and loading resources it's worth knowing
what they do and how they behave so you
might be asking yourself why don't we
have async imports by default why isn't
that the default behavior if it's better
and the reason is because we want this
snippet of code to always work custom
elements and imports have been designed
together to work really well let's
assume inside of x-foo HTML we have the
import or started the element definition
of the x-foo element by the time we run
this script which comes right after this
import the expectation is that file is
loaded it's registered the element and
you can create in x-foo and all of its
properties and methods are ready to go
that's the expectation then the
invariant that we always want true if
this was async by default the developer
would have to do a lot more work you'd
have to kind of wait for an a load event
or figure that out yourself and you
wouldn't be able to touch this elements
properties or methods and so that's why
they're synchronous by default it's a
more sane thing for developers to grok
right away it's a lot easier to work
with but you don't have to use them
synchronous you can also load imports
dynamically using script so polymer is
this really awesome method import href
that allows you to import it sorry that
allows you to import an HTML file using
are using our nice convenient function
import h ref and essentially what that's
doing is creating a dynamic HTML import
and loading that for you inside of your
document in this example I've just
wrapped it in a promise import page URL
to the HTML file I want to import and
then I want to do stuff so it's really
easy to work with dynamic imports as
well and script
the reason we like the declarative rod
is a it's declarative it's a lot easier
to use and B it's actually a lot faster
for the browser the browser is pre
parser can go off and discover elements
dot HTML and all the resources inside of
it and so we can go and fetch those
resources per emptily download things
stick it in its cache and so by doing
this high in the page we can actually
have stuff load quicker in our app and
so that's really awesome this is one of
the reasons I really want all browsers
to implement imports for this to take
advantage of the browser's pipeline for
loading resources the last thing we need
to deal with to make this app really
fast as scaffold really fast is actually
remove this unresolved attribute so
unresolved is really nice kind of
awesome feature that polymer has that
you can opt into if you want but what it
does is it hides the page until all of
the elements are ready to go so if
you're waiting on a resource you're
actually just showing the user a blank
screen for a long time that's no good if
you remove that and you have a sink on
both these resources here all of your
markups going to render right away and
it's going to get upgraded when those
resources come through and so this is
the fast loading scaffold that I kind of
recommend to people async the imports
async the script tag you're not blocking
anything and remove the unresolved at
reserve power polymer so of course we
can do even better than this you might
be saying hey well what about this
script tag up here
we're unconditionally loading that no
matter what browser were in right even
in chrome where all the native api's are
available so instead as good web
developers we should be feature
detecting the api's and loading it
conditionally based on feature detection
so let's remove that altogether and
inside of a new javascript file fjs
let's do that let's conditionally load
the polyfills only when they're needed
you can do that really easily today just
by three feature checks you check for
custom elements you check for imports
and you check for the template tag so
this feature detected a is actually
really easy
but as browsers implement these
different features of course this is
going to get a bit harder a bit more
challenging but right now this is what
it is if the web components native api's
aren't supported in the browser you can
dynamically load the script tag with the
web components polyfills and so that
will only provide this resource to the
browsers that need it all right so we
made a bunch of improvements let's see
what does two
actual application on the left side you
see the synchronous version with none of
the provements that I made that you can
see loads and you have this big white
screen of death for a number of
milliseconds right so that's what I call
the white screen of death and people
there is waiting for stuff to load it
first paints in about 1.4 seconds on a
3G connection in the dev tools on the
right side you can see the approved
version the asynchronous version
immediately the page loads you see the
green bar you see pixels on the screen
you see a loading message informing the
user hey this thing's fetching stacks
for you and that's 6.2 times faster just
by doing those two or three improvements
that we talked about two hundred thirty
second millisecond paint awesome
that app use one custom element so it's
not really you know a full-fledged app
it does something interesting but let's
take a look at a real app that uses a
bunch of different custom elements that
we have in the material design elements
that we have so this is the example
markup here it uses paper drawer panel
with the app drawer panel paper toolbar
for that blue toolbar up top paper menu
a bunch of different custom elements
here and we're gonna all load this using
these two techniques it's important to
know I didn't write any CSS to make this
look like this this CSS all comes for
free via these elements it's one nice
thing of web components right you're
encapsulating your CSS and logic
together so let's see what happens in
this example this is the asynchronous
version we'll start to load the page on
a 2g connection immediately you see
those pixels of the screen but what you
see is the actual menu items of that
unupgraded app drawer so you're seeing
that stuff before it's actually ready to
go so we're getting pixel to the screen
and then eventually boom the entire app
renders and you have the final layout
but that's no good because you have that
flash of unstyled content now the
synchronous version if we just want to
compare it to the old version what this
is gonna do is this basically just gonna
sit for a while so we're not using any
of the async attributes on the link or
script we have the unresolved attribute
on the body so it sits there it sits
there it sits there and then finally
when the app is ready polymer unveils
the entire app your layouts ready to go
but it's no good because we basically to
have a white screen for a long time so
these two problems we have to deal with
we went a sync with everything now we
have to deal with this flash of unstyled
content of that app drawer
and the reason for that again is because
we went async with this HTML import
until elements.html loads and provides
all of the CSS inside of it we get
nothing and we remove the unresolved
attribute on the body to say we want to
render as quickly as possible so it was
kind of cool and in doom building a
slide deck I came to the realization
that custom elements are really just
progressively enhanced markup and the
idea with this is that you can declare
an ex foo or a paper toolbar on your
page and until you call document dot
register and tell the browser about this
custom element it basically just sits
there as an unknown element to the
browser but it's cool because we can
actually style this element using CSS in
other parts of the platform until it's
in this supercharge mode and this is the
idea of the app shell it's progressively
enhanced HTML the idea is that you
provide all the critical resources up
front your CSU basic CSS basically a
basic markup have it ready to go on the
page and style it to mimic what the
final layout is going to be so it's kind
of cool because you get pixels to the
screen right away but users just see
things upgrade in place and since we can
style markup before it goes to the
supercharge custom element we can do
this very easily so custom elements has
this unresolved pseudo selector the
pseudo element that you can use to style
markup custom elements before it gets
upgraded so for this example maybe what
I want to do for this this app drawer
icon since it's not interactive yet
maybe I just want to hide it so I
actually do that I can style it using
display:none and hide that paper header
panel based on the fact that it's in
this unresolved State it's not useful so
we'll just hide it the second thing I
can do is I can mimic some of the
styling of the paper toolbar that the
paper toolbar CSS actually provides so I
can style that and Target it in its
unresolved state and make it look like
it's a blue like 192 pixel height and
with a blue background so this is
mimicking some of the styles inside of
paper toolbar so let's take a look and
see what this actually does
this is the same app using this notion
of an app shell so this is going to take
care of our flash button style content
so we're on a 2g connection in the dev
tools we'll load the page and
immediately we're going to see is
basically the final shell of the app and
you can imagine you know data requests
and other things happening here it's a
very simple app now but what you saw at
the very end when everything loaded is
the app drawer actually come in it's
been upgraded to its final state and now
the user can interact with it so I'm
able to then style it appropriately so
for this app this very simple app the
app shell idea took off a hundred
milliseconds of first pane so you can
see this stuff adding up over time
hundreds of milliseconds as you make
these improvements but I wanted to do
this in a real app so I've made all
these improvements to Poli mail which is
a version kind of that mimics the native
Gmail app it's all written in polymer
100 uses es6 classes and async imports
and and all the cool stuff like
serviceworker does offline caching it
looks great it uses the gesture library
that Dan talked about before but all
this stuff together let's see what this
did on a real app that touches api's and
and does log in and all that stuff so on
a cable connection on desktop this is
what the app looks like if you're
curious the web page test results are
below here 589 millisecond first paint
so just over half a second it's really
good for an app that does a lot of stuff
one second total load so that's
everything that's data loading that's
the user logging in really fast the
coveted one second load and the speed
index is a 100 1144 and speed index is
the measurement of the visually
completeness of your app so that's
actually really good on a 3G fast
connection and a mobile connection on an
actual hindered CPU let's see what the
numbers are 1.66 first paints are pretty
good 7 second low that went up a little
bit I'll talk about that and then we
have of course because of the low time
went up the speed index also went up so
let's dissect the waterfall band see
what actually happen in that 7 seconds
it's interesting because most the
polymer stuff so you're loading elements
dot HTML bundle J s is the vulcanized
bundle all that stuff is finished pretty
early on maybe 2 seconds 3 seconds all
the other stuff is actually Google's
they've
guys it's like loading iframes and RPC
calls and analytics and fonts API s and
the list goes on it's crazy so it's
actually showing the some of the
slowness I guess of our of our API s but
the interesting part the polymer parts
done very soon I also did the app shell
idea in poly male so on a desktop you
get the true app shell that we just
talked about it kind of mimics the final
version of the app style is it ahead of
time and then data loads in images load
in the users logged in as well on mobile
it's just a splash grant I decided to do
something a little different for mobile
because I thought it was interesting
this is kind of a mobile paradigm eeen
it was cool to show two different
versions but the same idea pixel is is
to the screen right away so the changes
we made for fast load make your imports
async don't block rendering of the page
maker conditional make your polyfills
conditional or make them async manually
load and prevent Phalke using the
unresolved after we remove that and then
the app shell idea is really critical to
get pixels of the screen so these things
together get you really fast load time
the load time is just part of it
so let's talk about what happens when
someone's loaded your app in there
inside of it so I'm in the polymer team
now for a couple years I built a lot of
apps in the old version of polymer a lot
of apps in the new version of polymer
but there's kind of commonalities
between the two different versions so
here's some quick tips for building fast
apps when you're inside of it first is
use native shadow Dom native shadow Dom
is going to be faster than shady Dom if
the browser has it and that's because it
runs C++ a lot faster than your
JavaScript it does reek Aleks faster
layout faster does scoping Dom scoping
faster so you have to opt into this in
polymer 1.0 if you set polymer Dom to
shadow that will opt you into shadow
down if the browser has it otherwise you
get the shady Dom polyfill but this will
actually be faster than working with
shady Dom so that's a pro tip do that if
you can dan talked a little bit about
the touch stuff in polymer use touch
events rather than click events we still
suffer from that 300 that dreaded 300
millisecond delay in some mobile
browsers chrome and firefox have fixed
this if you have the right meta viewport
tag iOS still suffers from this in
certain cases
but the moral story is use on tap don't
use on click if you're working with
gestures and user interaction that's
gonna be faster and get us closer to
that 250 milliseconds yo don't jank
those ripples those ripples are often in
material design we have all these cool
effects a really common thing I see is
people put an anchor inside of a paper
button or paper fab the floating action
button and what happens by default what
happens is you can actually exhibit this
on the polymer site will say let's see
that one more time when you click the
button the ripple just stops halfway
through right and that's because the
browser is no longer running your
JavaScript and that CSS transition it's
gone to navigate to a new page so an
easy way around that is basically just
hijack the click on the anchor tag and
wait for the transition end event that
that ripple fires and then redirect the
user to the new page if you don't want
the ripple at all you can also have the
no ink attribute on the paper button so
really easy to deal with the material
design ripples sir we talked about this
in this presentation reflect to
attribute I see a lot of people are
using reflect to attribute please don't
use this unless you have to the reason
is because you can have a huge
JavaScript object property or a huge
array property and every time you make a
change to those properties it's gonna
get serialized back out from the
property to an HTML string so that could
be a source of performance issues in
your app the only reason you want to use
reflects to attribute is if you want to
style your element based on the fact
that it has this attribute applied to it
so I want to put a border around my
element when it's selected I can do that
and I need reflect to attribute in this
case but only use it for styling
purposes a next one a really important
one that we kind of recently discovered
is yo don't create thousands of elements
on your page though you wouldn't do this
in the world outside of web components
why do it in the world of web components
do lazy render elements so what I mean
what do I mean by this I actually did an
audit of some of the interesting apps
out there some of the more modern apps
that I think are kind of you know
first-class single page applications
Google Maps contacts Google inbox
calendar and github and others that
aren't Google properties when they load
the page they basically create
some create pre minimal amount of Dom
nodes so Maps for instance only creates
624 nodes at page load that's really
good a small amount of markup and then
as the user interacts with the page of
course they generate more but on page
load they're doing a good job of kind of
minimizing how much stuff they throw
down I ran into this myself i ported
chrome status which is a great resource
if you want to know about new web
platform features in chrome it's
basically a list of features and people
can expand the cards and kind of drill
and learn more about each of the
features I pour this at one point out
and I saw my performance go down and I
was like what that doesn't make any
sense polymer one supposed to be faster
right so it turns out what I did was
that I moved from a font icon to using
some of our iron icon elements when some
one expands one of these feature cards I
have a lot of custom elements inside of
these features so there's a custom
element for the link that generates the
link custom element for these colored
icons custom element for the the logos
you see here so a lot of stuff is going
on inside of each one of these 350
features on the page way too much stuff
on page load
turns out moving from that phone icon to
iron eken I was generating over almost
2000 icon elements and so each one of
those has to run its JavaScript and do
its own thing to set itself up so that's
no good I was not being a responsible
developer of course we can do better the
more the story is to generate less
upfront if you can now I had a list of
stuff and there's no better element for
that than the iron list element very
awesome easy to use element it gives you
a virtual scrolling list that works
great on mobile and it only generates
the Dom that's needed at the time so the
current viewport that the user is
viewing I popped that in it's a huge
performance gain the second thing I did
was I used Dom the template Dom if so I
only generated the markup when someone
actually expanded the card there's no
reason to generate everything upfront
because 90% of the stuff would be
totally invisible to the user unless
they expanded the card please don't use
Dom if for stuff like this so do not use
it for HR text first relation but using
a char tags you CSS instead but use it
when the
user is interacting with your app and
you need to generate Dom based on the
fact so if you have a lot of custom
elements or generating a lot of custom
elements and Dom repeat that's a really
good time to use Dom if so let's see
what these two improvements did for
chrome status about 4,000 elements at
1.2 second load time down to 53 Ellison
milliseconds on page load and 383
millisecond load time so it's about 844
milliseconds faster just by reducing the
amount of stuff I was generating up
front all right let's talk about a
couple of really awesome new features
coming down the pipeline since you have
a little bit of time the first is if
you're gonna dynamically load things
right if you're gonna dynamically load
some CSS later on maybe you're loading
an import for later with a bunch of
custom elements inside of it we have the
ability very soon to preload to tell the
browser hey put this resource in my
cache and have it ready to go so this is
a high-priority resource that's gonna go
off and fetch that no matter what you
can declare it as link rel preload with
the resources to your app a link to your
attribute your resource you can set an
HTTP header or if you want you can
dynamically load it as well so you can
set the rel in pre loading script the
other thing that's really awesome is
HTTP to push this is really cool you can
paren
index page push the resource to the
browser's cache and have it ready to go
I got so excited about this I spent a
little time on App Engine putting
together a little demo so the URL is
here and you can see the web page test
results for the different runs the right
the left side shows the version of the
app that has a bunch of HTML imports on
it it's a polymer app and you can see
the waterfall kind of load this stuff as
time goes on so no HTTP to push in this
example traditional waterfall loads in
about 516 milliseconds on the right side
you can see what happens immediately
when server push is enabled so this is
sticking all of the HTML imports in the
browser's cache the CSS the JavaScript
files and the timeline is completely
different right so there's no green
there's no network request being made
because these resources are already in
the browser and you can see that reduces
the page load time just by doing HTTP to
push by 60%
insane that's awesome what's even cooler
is that if you drill into these webpage
test results you see that in it's
actually faster to load a bunch of
smaller files and push those rather than
vulcanizing your entire app so the
browser is actually better at loading
small chunks rather than loading this
huge file with JavaScript CSS and HTML
in it so it means we don't have to
concatenate our JavaScript anymore we
don't have to concatenate or CSS anymore
we don't have to have all these crazy
build tools addy spent a lot of time
talking about this is really exciting
and a lot of servers are actually
enabling this this is really well
supported now if you want to check out
the code App Engine actually has a
special header that supports this today
so you can push resources on App Engine
so lastly before I leave if you can't
measure it you can't improve it Paul
Irish talked about the poly dev chrome
extension that gives you kind of the
atomic weight of all the custom elements
on your page you can identify what's
kind of at fault I've also worked on a
little performance bookmarklet if you
want to install that it gives you some
other stuff it gives you things like
what's the first paint of your app how
long do you think GML imports take to
load maybe there's one that's kind of
hindering your page load it also gives
you a number of elements created and it
gives you things like what properties on
these custom elements are using that
reflect to attribute property so check
that out that's actually really useful
anyway thanks for sticking around for
the entire show I know it's late you
guys have had a lot of information
thrown to you today feel free to again
