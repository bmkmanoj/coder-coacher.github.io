most people don't want to pay for it I
agree with some people don't well wait
for it so here's the thing for me I
don't mind paying for car insurance
because it means that if I destroy my
car or I get stolen I get you get your
money back and then it's fine it's like
this sort of an investment the thing
that I don't like about it is I'm not
gonna read the massive fifty page long
legal document they send you in the
process of getting said car insurance
that's it like I'm fine with it
happening like the payment going out to
get it it's everything around it I don't
ever read those agreements I I'm not
even committed enough to read the iTunes
License Agreement so and yeah that's
basically exactly the same thing as I've
done for my site like the whole point of
SSL is to keep users secure and like
Service Worker it does actually make a
lot of sense yep cuz like you're gonna
have something controlling a page in the
background and if someone can get in the
middle and then like to swap out Service
Worker wait addy osmani com4 slash bug
could go straight to my site my blog
posts I could steal all your address
with you if anything would probably be
improvement in content quality not true
but the I can understand the main point
of it the problem I have with all of
this is like it's really hard to learn
about SSL aid like there's tons of old
content yeah this is how you setup us to
sell on your site it's useful but it's
old yeah and then secondly there were so
many different factors to the whole
thing so I was trying to set this stuff
up on my site and it I don't even
default to the HTTPS just yet because
they're still like I still don't know
how to handle all the mixed content
security warnings I'm getting from the
third parties I'm loading like widgets
and sheer buttons in from yeah and it's
like all the tooling around this is sort
of a minefield it's me and I find it
I've been it hard to navigate those
waters so I've literally I I've done
numerous like steps into how I got it on
my site and even then like I've got
issues so the first one was like
SSL labs you just bung in your URL and
it will look at your site and figure out
with like HTTP redirects a GPS and just
the configuration of HTTP on your site
so if I bang in gaunt face comm in SSL
labs I was at one point getting a
glorious a plus which is very happy
about and now I have been downgraded to
a C have you changed your site a lot new
so has this their own way of said that
what's happened is is there was the
poodle vulnerability yes and I think
that's basically all through SSL 3 and
I've still got SSL 3 support um I see on
my site so even though everything is
actually doing really well like hundred
and ninety s for like the scores on each
like top-level topic they've capped me
to a C because of SSL 3 and poodle I
guess it's cool that they're keeping it
up-to-date yes this is the nice thing is
you can keep on regularly running
through this and it will keep it
up-to-date and track everything yeah
really nice thing with this is it's
really good like it's a ton of
information like possibly too much but
the same time it things like protocols
it's saying do you support SSL - no
useful SSL 3 yes it's insecure these are
the cipher suites that you have in Italy
if there's one particular thing that
it's like this is actually really like a
bad practice it highlights it and then
you can least go and Google and find out
the problem so this was the first thing
that I found I was like sweet these are
all the places that I suck and overall
I'm doing bad well or whatever the best
thing I found after this was the Mozilla
SSL configuration generator and this
thing is a godsend the do all our crew
just soaked it so basically one of the
issues that have was like how do I know
what a good SSL cipher suite is and
that's not allowed to tell you good bad
the problem is it doesn't necessarily
tell you the right names to put in your
configuration file enter in Mozilla SSL
conflict generator so you can select
like Apache or nginx you can select what
sort of browser support you want so you
can be like really harsh and be like if
there's an old browser that requires XYZ
to work you can just basically say sorry
I'm not going to support that for
security reasons or whatever else
and it literally just gives you the
config file like everything just set up
that's awesome
so I'm looking at it and already the SSL
protocol doesn't include SSL 3 which is
why I'm an asset well - poodle so all I
have to do is literally copy this back
over and I'm good to go
then very recently the past week or so
yeah someone introduced me to HTTP
security report com
it's just be security report of that guy
ok what does it do so it literally is
very similar to us as our labs it's kind
of nice because it gives you an even
higher level of like overview of where
you're doing well on your site but this
looks a slightly different things like
I've never considered the content
security policy of my site which is
things like if you're pulling in
third-party resources like Google Fonts
you can basically say if I have a CSP
policy which excludes that it won't load
even though I called it in and my web
page so video makes content thing you
could sit there and say CSP is just a
DDoS money calm that would just get shot
down which is not what you want but it's
an interesting point that I've never
even considered as a thing until I use
this tool this tool is need the the
current default like non-aspirin my site
is getting a very very respectable 17
out of 100 at the moment that's good
it's it's it's great I'm guessing 17 out
of 104 of them 20 just saying let's go
with that and the HTTPS version is
getting a solid 51 nice that that's not
too bad like I'm I'm only on 62 so I've
got some work to do but the interesting
thing with this is it actually picks out
things like web framework information
and that's things like Oh PHP is
actually saying this is a version of PHP
you support or you're actually on
version X's of engine X which again I
wouldn't have ever thought of looking
into because in my head I wouldn't
expect those tools to be sharing that
kind of information by default you know
let alone it be a security issue anyway
but those three things I found immensely
helpful when is I'm using the basic to
guide where I spend all my time and
effort and work it sounds good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
