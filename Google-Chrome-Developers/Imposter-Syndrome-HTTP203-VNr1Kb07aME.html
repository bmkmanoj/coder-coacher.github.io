something I think in in our field work
is talked about a lot on it's brought up
a lot but like everybody around me is so
good and I feel like I'm not actually
that good like you just said like you
say my low-level knowledge is better
than yours but then again I basically
dropped out of my masters and I feel
like I failed that as well okay but any
masters you did is more masters I think
that's why you're tweeting about this
and I I was agreeing with you a lot
because you said there's like a certain
sense that we talk about it almost too
much well I I feel like it's look it
feels like people are using it as a
positive trait and I used to do the same
like thinking well it's a sort of form
of modesty right you're sort of saying
like I don't feel good enough to be here
you know and and maybe in some ways that
other people seeing that will go oh well
if that person doesn't feel like they
deserve to be here then then I you know
my feelings that may mean you fake as
well maybe it's the syndrome thing but
the thing that got me thinking is that
if you have that mindset and you
encounter someone who you know maybe
whether they're new or their skills just
in another area but they're struggling
with a particular thing I worry that if
you kind of really dig into that mindset
that you don't belong when you see
someone who you could subjectively sort
of say they know less than I do and go
they deserve even less to be here you
know and that might get you cannot put
seven a spot where you actually will end
up not being encouraging for someone who
is just learning yeah because the bad
part is it comes with and I don't
deserve to be here yeah there was a
thread that went around on Twitter like
a three months ago I think but it was
people saying hi I have this high
position of authority or you know this
this job and I can't do something that
might be relatively basic to some and I
actually I thought that Fred had all of
the benefits of like so you know other
people could say oh well you know I
maybe I should stop worrying about what
I know because but it didn't have that
and
that's the bid it's not it shouldn't be
up to you decide if you deserve to be at
your work that's not that's what the
interview process is for that my
colleagues are for and I'm very grateful
that I have colleagues who keep
encouraging me and all their other
colleagues that everybody is here with a
good reason and has the right skill
level absolutely and since I keep
learning from basically all my
colleagues everything is fine I think we
just stop deducing ourself and we don't
deserve to be somewhere we'll be in a
better place mentally already absolutely
and I think yeah especially if if you
genuinely don't think you belong there's
definitely an encouragement to kind of
close yourself in to not yeah be found
out you know and not talk openly but on
that Twitter Fred what I said was like
you know I use mdn to look up api's I
designed Oh
are you one of the Service Worker
designers I don't know if you know but
in some replied to me when does that
actually more mean that your API is a
badly designed no means I have the
memory of a human being you know there's
like there's so much I can remember and
especially if I know I can look it up am
i sorry cuz I have this worried that if
I I have a finite amount of space in my
brain right and if I push too much stuff
in something else will fall out so like
if I learn how to do pointers in C then
that might push out how to breathe or
something many people have died from
just forgetting to breathe in the past C
has killed many people learning C has a
yeah Detroit many lives but like you
know I if I can look it up easily then I
think that's actually really good trade
it's something that I always thought
about it really like you try to to
minimize the amount that you actually
have to keep in your head and delegate
the things out two things you can either
look up or you can deduce which is very
mathematical actually what you like you
just remember the axioms and from there
you can go anywhere you want in terms of
knowledge if you really need to learn
something by heart of what happen
automatically because you keep have to
use it over and over anyway through real
usage not just kind of like because
using flexbox I know now
I now know all the flexbox properties
right so I didn't sit down and memorize
them hang on
justify is the horizontal one if it's a
row and a line items is the vertical
here's how I remember it
you know how in in like word or any kind
of text were saying you have the
justified buttons left justified right
justified yes
so that basically makes text that flows
adjust to the right or to the left and
flex box has some no that's amazing
right okay so that so justify is the
horizontal one bro it's it moves the
elements in inline Direction that's
amazing and the align is for the actual
don't belong to the film anymore like
that that is that's the one you know you
you know what you can stay I mean it
based based on that that's that's that's
it that is that is a piece of knowledge
I have failed to grasp in my entire
career and I hole remember it now
because of that because of the word
buttons when I learned English I often
heard this phrase 84 effort but it also
often heard people spelling their names
with like the NATO radio alphabet they
say s for Sierra and for November right
yeah it was like a forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
