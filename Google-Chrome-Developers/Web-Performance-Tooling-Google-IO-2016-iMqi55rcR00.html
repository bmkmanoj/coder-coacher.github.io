websites and tools we we want things to
be fast we want the page to load quickly
we want the user to have a good
experience yep to be happy when they use
our site but somewhere along the process
when we were building our app things
start to get slower and slower and I
don't really realize it right away but
then all of a sudden I reached this
point and I'm like oh my my app is slow
yeah and then I mean you're like you got
two problems you've got poor performance
and now you've got the challenge of
actually having to try and fix it and
like from measuring correctly to
understanding enough about the internals
to make you know an educated guess to
actually trying that out and and doing
something like it's not easy like it's
this this path is it's hard yeah for
once it's hard so I'm Paul I'm Sam we
were really into performance like we're
performance geeks I guess geeks ones
nerds you like that better okay anyway
yeah we're gonna tell you about some
tools techniques approaches and
workflows on making and measurable and
effective improvements in performance
there's some some fresh - fresh tools
fresh tools all right cool before we get
into some of the real-world products all
right kind of step back a little bit you
could think of performance as the art of
avoiding work and making sure that any
work that you do is as efficient as
possible those are some sage words Paul
they are sage sage words it's so nice
Paul Louis all of us actually for this
one Oh real good stuff it's good yeah so
I want to touch on kind of like the
effective workflow for diagnosing and
understanding performance so it all
starts with the user
the user is the most important thing you
got to consider where are they beginning
and what is success to them that is kind
of your bounds for investigation so I
sort of like put myself in that user
headspace yeah you could like get like
in the head and like right up in the
between the head like his glasses and
where his head is okay um you could do
that yeah a few I'm in the headspace I
got it great after that point next thing
is to measure measure with the profiler
get an understanding of what sort of
time we're looking at this is the key
and you say that like measure but the
meters yards milliseconds nanoseconds
Sam I'm doing a slide okay after this
you interpret costs you understand kind
of like categorize characterize this
sort of work that is happening
understand it after this identify the
bottleneck drill into like what is
actually happening you might use
specialized tool for this drill in and
at that point you can try a fix you have
a hunch give it a shot
and for me it's like I just I have a
hunch I sort of guess it's changed
something refresh it again
yeah you wouldn't want it to like that's
my trying you wouldn't want to go like
directly from measure to like try a fix
you don't like skip the rest of that but
yeah and we always end up and we're like
this looks like it might work and that's
fine
but then the key thing here is that
you've got a return back to measuring
again you you take that exact same thing
that we're looking at before you measure
it you understand what sort of change
what is the Delta of the change that we
actually miss oh okay so I found this
function that takes ten milliseconds to
run I'm like I can go Jasper crazy on
this and drop it down to one millisecond
this is awesome but then I look at my
total time to run and it's two seconds
yeah 2,000 milliseconds and we made a
9-mil a $2,000 seconds down to 1991 I
mean it's something something but oh
wait right cuz I'm in that that user
headspace yeah find the glasses like oh
I can't even notice that so doesn't
matter you what it doesn't matter
well I mean to the user it doesn't
matter those nine milliseconds
absolutely absolutely
like what is gonna be most effective for
them alright so in that other way let's
get into some real stuff and I think
we're gonna start out website Android
Auto yeah website cool
alright let's dive into it alright so I
was looking at this site the other day
on my phone and I loaded it they were
just like reloaded the page yeah just
command alright and I saw that when the
page loads in I sort of see the spinner
and then this green thing pops up and I
see a header yeah if you could like yeah
describe what is happening right here in
kind of pull them for them for me the
green fields flow in the spinner no get
 oh yeah so we got this like
situation we got the top coming in we
got the bottom we got this thing in the
middle and we're just waiting for this
spinner right yeah I'm like as a user
I'm like I can't really touch this I
shouldn't touch this because it's
spinning it's loading yep I'm just gonna
wait for it sure okay so I like figured
that okay there's probably like a big
image that's downloading as just taking
a really long time and so I'm waiting
for that probably yeah yeah yeah so
let's look at the timeline okay so I
this time I'm recording that I did when
I reload the page and we can scrub over
this and we sort of see that initially
we get this header painting in pretty
much right away and then we see our
spinner actually saying there's like a
lot happening here yeah can you just
like briefly tell me what I'll just when
I'm sure so here's like our JavaScript
that's going on our main thread activity
good then here's like we see our frames
per second and the green and then the
red is like frames that took a while to
paint like it okay but we'll just ignore
most of that for now sure so we're just
going to go back to the screenshots yeah
just just this film strip it was good so
here's that green field that you
mentioned just
oh yeah that's right poetic I see why
you wanted this place see our spinner
and then then we get our image okay
and you know that's like how long were
we spinning it seems lookin old like
three seconds hold shift it right you
drag and we get to see how long that
took yeah good three almost three
seconds of spinner spinning it must be
loading something big I imagine this is
my guess the header image this shot with
the car is like like two Meg's or
something forgot to compress it yeah
it's just huge all right
it's but like okay so but I'm not I
don't know that yet
so I wanted guess I guess okay so what
do I do not want him to figure out what
I recommend to you is there is a
checkbox at the top of the screen though
network network uh-huh good promising do
it do it whoa all right okay so I see I
have more in this crazy view uh-huh
uh-huh check this out
so basically here we have the exact same
network waterfall that you might see
over in the network panel but now
integrated into this view so the colors
are pretty much images are generally
green style sheets or purple Script is
yellow kind of matching the colors of
the rest of the flame chart but the nice
thing here is we can begin to kind of
coordinate what is happening on the
network side of things and then the
actual like execution of what's
happening on the main thread okay so we
know that the image floating around here
so I'm right let me find that let me
find that image scroll to the bottom the
one megabyte image so you're saying that
like nothing and the network is
happening between here nothing on the
network is happening we have two seconds
of just nothing yeah what okay let's
look at the last thing to load sure okay
last thing like that yeah we can bring
up the bottom any kind of a preview okay
so it's not one there was the other one
yeah see what the sub yeah oh there it
is
okay we go all right there's our image
that's right edge it finished right here
yeah but then it didn't actually show up
for 1.5 seconds what okay
not sure yeah that seems strange so I
guess at this point work I mean we're a
bit confused in this situation right
yeah I don't know what's happening we
didn't build this site unfortunately and
it's not every day but every day that
you're like performing like profiling a
site that you didn't have a part a hand
in so we had to do a little bit of
digging in order to like thinking find
what the story is with this image yeah
okay let's hop to so like like let's
look at the image yeah okay yeah so like
I just hit command shift C or you can
like use this yep so we got the element
and here's our banner image yeah can you
zoom in just a touch yeah all right
check this out
see this data breakpoints yeah I see
this I bet you can some kind of like
responsive images right like thing yeah
yeah so they don't load the two megabyte
image on your phone right so they're
probably using javascript to start that
request which is why it happened a
little bit later event page they could
be using source that big or you know
they could be using a platform feature
for things is something that's fine
okay but now we need to understand what
the connection is to the loading the
spinner yeah like some JavaScript is
doing something right yes I bet you your
bottom dollar that if you one of these
classes here okay Jas header animate
image anything in particular it would be
that all right so I I see it I have it
now what do I do
all right go to the actually use the new
command menu command shift P
nice nice hit search type search yeah
yeah I got a few things in here so this
is gonna search across all kind of the
capabilities of the dev tools just you
know and keys keystrokes I kick that up
is just gonna bring up the search across
all files that we have and oh yeah a
search okay cool we have two results the
results looked like the page our
document and one in some JavaScript
again let's check out what's going on
this JavaScript okay so it looks like
the codes minified hit the button let's
pretty print that there we go there we
go all right good all right so we got
this jeaious header animate image looks
like it's assigned to this yeah let's
just hunt down kind of what happens here
think okay so we're in this function
load content yeah all right so to be
honest I want to break a little bit here
we have done this before it's not
totally surprised to us we have
investigated this there's a good amount
of code here and since Sam has
understood what it does now he's now
gonna explain to you what he has learned
okay so so we look at this and we see we
have a set interval here so every
certain duration we're gonna fire our
function yep
and then I see this 1e 323 so I said
Paul what does this mean because I know
you
you got like a math major or something
yeah yeah it is called exponential
notation okay and I did not believe him
so I copied that and I see we go into
our console here and we just sort of
paste it now it's a thousand thousand
well that is a fancy way to write a
thousand thousand
we have a senator Ville for every
thousand milliseconds yeah so every
thousand seconds what are we doing and
then we're checking to see if this
header image has a class of loaded every
second we just pulled to be like hey you
loaded nope
hey you loaded yet nope hey you yep okay
good so then we're loaded and then what
okay
then we're using this tween library
which is you know doing a little bit of
chancy and I saw we have a delay and
this opacity the delay one millisecond
yeah I thought that too and then I
looked at the docks that's a second
we're polling once a second to see if
it's loaded yep then it's loaded and
then we're like okay great I'm glad that
you finished downloading I'm glad that
we have identified that you're loading
now before I feed you in I'm just gonna
just like pause and hang out a little
bit just hang out for a second second
she looks wait and then we'll fade it in
yeah that's fascinating that is good my
dad once told me he gave me some good
advice for my career he said whenever
there's kind of problems issues a good
way to kind of rephrase the situation is
instead of using negative words you can
say there's a lot of there's
opportunities and so I think we could
all agree that there are some
opportunities in this area where we
could you know try some things
potentially we could improve this yeah I
think there's there's some things okay
so this this accounts for why we have
that gap that big jump yeah like that
would to second gap of nothing happening
yeah so yeah I think that kind of many
of us could could identify a better way
of handling this not so bad
before we move on we've looked at kind
of the load aspect of this page but I
want to touch on kind of a little bit of
the interaction stuff sure all right
check this out
I come back to timeline likely and I
want to look at kind of some of the
scrolling performance the interactions
kind of like once I start using the page
right yeah makes sense
good scroll down to the bottom yeah
let's stuff it doesn't feel so bad like
where I am right now in fact yeah okay
yeah so what I'm gonna do is just
capture a new recording I was turning
that guy off and it's guy there we go
cool and record and I'll just kind of
like scroll fling it and I'm gonna sign
up for the mailing list because why not
Yolo good good reference alright check
this out but what we have here some new
stuff so along the top right here if I
scroll in always mouse wheel mouse
wheels the trick we have just identified
kind of what interactions aren't
actually happening yeah see the words
they're like yeah so yeah exactly fling
so like scroll I have like my finger
down I'm moving it fling I let go and
it's just kind of gliding flinging and
we can even go over here like this
actually here's the response you've
heard it's like we've talked about rail
right measuring response and so this is
actually when my when I clicked on the
fine uplink and saw that so we can open
up the main thread again and kind of see
this is all the JavaScript that was
running and if i zoom back in I can open
up and see some of the detail on this
guy and so check this out so this is the
actual like gestures that the browser is
handling kind of under the hood in order
to to handle this this input so what's
that like that red line Oh God so the
red line the red line if we actually
bring this up here it says time waiting
for me and Fred so what happens is
basically the browser receives the top
right and then it's like cool but like I
just need a second because I might be
busy and I have to have a moment and
then I'm gonna totally like evaluate
this on the main thread and run what
kind of the event handlers to to handle
that so it's kind of like hey I just
tapped you but this is crazy
so to execute your event handlers on the
main thread maybe yeah yeah I think it's
like that pretty much can we we can
rename that right yeah we could just put
that whole like thang of Shane right
here yeah that makes more sense yes
sure okay good so the other nice thing
here is that to kind of bring it back to
what we were looking at before with the
the network activity I hit that signup
form we got away didn't then it's like
oh yeah cool you're all set if I bring
back Network the nice situation is we
can also see a little bit of what is
happening so here you can see it on the
mini-map you can kind of see these the
blue bar right here is actually well
it's kind of yeah the mini view of the
network and we can always open up to see
some of the details of all of that so
it's nice to kind of get the interaction
between main thread network activity and
back I'm kind of into a single view yeah
it sounds awesome seems good um next one
yeah Android auto all right
all right this site you introduced this
to me tell me about this yeah well we're
gonna look up yeah my friend Tracy's
sent me a message and he said hey I
think my site is kind of slow and I load
it on my phone like yeah it seems come
slow can you take a look I said sure so
we're gonna take a look
yep yep yep all right so I have it
loaded here and was that guy it's me
how's that guy in the picture it's me
that's cool all right all right
normal-looking my page right like I
don't know it's like a Bloggie content
videos some podcasts and stuff pretty
well look at well let's just reload this
page real quick and I'm gonna have the
timeline go here yep I just wanted like
show you how it feels do just a command
our commander it was like capture the
page so it's loading cool still notice
the spinner goin finished and this is
again this is on my laptop yeah like
with good Wi-Fi yeah so it took like a
little over 10 seconds to load
10 seconds yeah yeah about that for for
all of the the stuff to finish yeah but
though if we look at like kind of what's
happening here or we roll that out it
looks like this image finally came in
right around here like eight and a half
eight eight seconds sure and then some
other stuff now but like when I look at
this I see this crazy amount of yellow I
don't understand what's going on yeah
like and there's a lot of pastel colors
what is happening if I'm sure that
sounds like what
yeah actually the the different colors
it's colored by file so each file gets a
different color then kind of get a sense
like this this file this is this file
okay so there's a lot of files operating
that's correct
yeah yeah yeah so I look at this and I
say okay there's a lot of JavaScript I
could dive in and look at each function
but that would take a while so I kind of
want a group yeah you probably wouldn't
want I like just like start looking at
this 20 millisecond slice so we want to
get kind of an aggregate view if you
wanted to kind of see that try this okay
hit the on the bottom sure bottom up
right down there okay yeah so what we
have here is this is basically a summary
of all of the costs of of that ran on
the main thread and this is across
everything so you might be familiar say
for instance if we kind of flip this off
and go over to to no group in it
whatsoever if you use the profiles panel
and done kind of like a typical
JavaScript profile you'll see like the
bottom up view and these are the
JavaScript functions etc right what we
have over here well one thing when you
do that at the very top you always see
program in parentheses right and you're
like I don't know what that is but it
seems to be taking a lot of time right
so that is actually revealed all here so
so this tells me that we're executing a
lot of JavaScript yeah we're executing
JavaScript we are doing garbage
collection we're doing layout and recalc
style and person style sheets all these
things in addition to just running
JavaScript functions so there's a lot so
yeah a good amount of work all sorts of
things so this is a bit higher level
than the dive in in a good amount a good
amount okay sure
but yeah you switch that that drop down
back to grouping by domain because in
this way we can kind of just see like by
file by domain where our costs are do it
on a site like this where there's like
files coming in from different places so
we have this YT which is YouTube right
yep YT image is YouTube and then we're
spending almost two seconds and add this
code
yep yep and we also got like Chrome
extensions on here too which is nice
because sometimes you want to actually
see how much like what effect Chrome
extensions that you have installed
affect your page yeah a little handy but
yeah these seems add this in YouTube
seem like a little high like it I get
YouTube because these players I have to
construct each player and okay yeah but
the add this is weird to me and let's
play around with the site and I saw that
there's a button over here where you can
click on the podcast and you get this
little add this widget behind a button
oh wait wait
the the ad this cost that's like two
seconds it's for like the share buttons
that are kind of behind this click yes
so it's a feature that's behind a click
that you know prime most users won't use
alright okay
two seconds alright alright well that's
something
well we wanted you to dig into this so
what do we do next so what if we were to
just disable the whole like podcast
stuff and just see what it feels like
it'd be good to just identify when I
kind of like reduce it down and identify
our key bottlenecks and so yeah I like
it'd be good to take it out of the
picture so if we wanted to do that what
we could do is there's an experimental
feature called request blocking where
we're gonna say like just block these
requests from going out completely that
sounds perfect alright so I'm guessing
we'd go to network available and then
okay so this seems to be the URL yep
these players so you can right-click and
block request domain and it's just kind
of kind of okay yeah I was gonna not be
able to issue these requests so so
should we reload we captured the new
thing yeah let's do that
I see that number jumped up to 13 here
so it's probably working yeah exactly
another thing that I will point out on
our way over is we're doing this right
now on our laptop and the experience on
a phone like this is a responsive site
like will it's the exact same thing that
runs on a phone I'll probably take a
little bit longer than this like a
little bit means a lot of it yeah
absolutely
so there's another new external to
future that we can check out and it's
CPU throttling so just like Network
throttling before where we slow down
things now we can actually slow down how
much time everything from JavaScript to
layout takes to evaluate inside the page
oh so I don't need to like plug in my
phone to sort of experience what it's
like on a phone it'll slow it down and
that's useful you should if you care
about performance still plug in your
phone but this will give you a nice push
in the right direction no that's cool
yeah all right so we go back to our
bottom up group by domain yeah so we we
blocked all those requests and had this
we like removed this we did remove this
I like the joke I worked on it it's
growing on me
I like that all right what do we got as
far as like time time and all this so we
dropped down to like seven seconds now
for the like until main thread is kind
of yeah chill main threads idle and I'm
gonna guess that things were ready
before oh all right
good but we're still going we're still
paying this YouTube costs yes YouTube
cost is a little bit interesting and I
think uh what is that how is the embed
done here there's just the iframes
iframe iframe reference typical iframe
embed right oh yeah but like putting
myself in that user head space I was
thinking as a user I typically want to
interact with the first video first yep
and maybe not the last one right when
the page loads yes so what if we were to
throttle the instantiation of these and
sort of like lazily load them using
something like intersection observer
like when they entered the screen we
could build them and defer the work I
love all of that you should do that
okay turns out I did all right good good
very good so you wanna show us yeah I
have it running luckily with the patch
so you just got like this heaven is like
cloned it and made a patch wasn't that
with my big no it's really small
actually
I think it's just here it's just like I
mean this is a total hack but we like
loop over all these videos and we just
build the player objects yeah yeah do a
little you know what you could have done
and said this time out in 150 you do a
little one 5e - I'm a real classy that
would have been cooler and that would
have been cooler all right so that's
easy enough
yeah let's measure dude - little bit
yeah yeah it seems better already just
seem cut off I don't I don't know what's
up at that cutoff bit but like based on
this it looks like our page like that
one that first frame gets painted in
yeah I just like from the top overview
it looks completely different here okay
and like it's sort of hard to keep this
in your head to look before and after so
we made some yeah pictures so before it
looked like this like we were really
doing a lot of work yeah yeah a lot of
work a lot of work work work work work
work that's good yeah doing some and
then afterwards we dropped it down and
the nice thing here is so there's the
aspect of the fact that there's doing
less work and that's important but we're
also like at the same time as evaluating
how much work we're doing we're also
looking at kind of how visually
available as the page right yeah and
like a combination of things right
because if there's too much work then
you like as a user you're not gonna be
able to like scroll interact with it
immediately because like we're busy you
know waiting for the main thread to call
me right so so here we try to we brought
it down and so we went from nine seconds
to that paint when you a user could
think that they could interact with it
yep four seconds not bad not bad about
at all
all right so Sam and I we like web stuff
we're like doing these websites like
many JavaScript people in the room we
also do a lot of JavaScript work on the
server-side node we've been building
some projects recently and
we like to use tools to make sure that
like the code quality is really good one
of our favorite tools is yes linked yeah
that's good
making sure the code looks the same
everywhere I love it because we were
fighting about like we're fighting about
line lengths and whose base is to tab
yes yes it's nice to put that all to
rest but we run yes lint sometimes and
we're running on our project which is
not like crazy huge no it's like a
couple hundred files and I felt like it
was not going kind of the speed that we
wanted like it was seven seconds
actually pended yeah
seven seconds so we wanted to like this
happens to us and because we are kind of
performance geeks you geeks yeah you
like can't help sometimes you're like I
was doing something but I gotta go
figure out what's up with it before you
were texting it like one IMS man why is
it so slow maybe that was it I'm gonna
it's so well we're gonna show you we're
gonna try and you know look at this
together but I do have to like put out a
little disclaimer wait did they announce
this yet so I need you guys to keep
we're gonna show you if you can keep a
secret
we're officially announcing this thing
like tomorrow but you get a little bit
of stick previous dad if you're quiet so
we're gonna show it so yeah yeah
basically we wanted to take the kind of
the developer tools and the profiling
experience in these tools that we know
from the clients on be able to use them
in this and this bag on experience with
nodejs so we're gonna go check that out
right now yeah it's good all right so
our project here yeah this is yeah this
is ours and I just want to I just want
you to experience this lint hook it up
you ready hook it up running right yeah
it's running yeah
that's good that's good
I want to understand God that's right
there boy did I couldn't take it
alright we're finished look a little bit
up a little bit yeah anyways yeah it
took it took some time there it's just
yeah so this is let's uh let's actually
measure it with a pro at was a little
bit faster let's measure it with a
profiler to see what's really going on
alright so I'm using my node binary and
I'm passing two flags inspect in the bug
break which is going to pause us on the
first line of the program and I'm just
running our lint yep so okay I get a URL
here so I can open that in Chrome I have
it open already oldest reload this page
so we connect to our node so what we
have here is the chrome dev tools modern
chrome dev tools inside a chrome inside
of chrome and we're just talking
directly to no js' like yeah so this is
my node program or this is es one yeah
yeah notice like no elements tab
whatever like we don't need that oh yeah
it's pretty cool thank you we've got our
job to do we got it we got to figure out
what's in our profile this lets profile
oh okay so I'm gonna go over to the
profile tab and I'm just gonna record
this CPU profile and as soon as i record
the CPU profile as soon as you hit start
yeah it's gonna unbreak point yeah I'm
just gonna run our program yep
so let's let's watch for when our
program exits so we can stop our profile
and well go ahead you know that if you
you can use command e to start and stop
these as well if you don't want to click
little pro tip
done okay let's take a look okay ooh
the flame chart that is a great flame
chart all right some good colors out
here um but that's a lot of work again
twelve seconds of work twelve seconds
yeah yeah Wow okay so interesting all
right and we want to like just
characterize the shape of this like at
the end over here we got kind of I don't
know we got this green land green green
kind of world and process text and we're
parsing probably the like the files like
we're looking at what's going on and
like we're actually like interpreting
them and yeah linting yeah okay so we
zoom way out good and I see this other
group here glob sync glob sync big group
glob sing what are what's club I think
it's white gets all the files it says
give me all the files in the project
pass them down got it winsome just give
me the files give me the files hook it
up but this is you know this is six
seconds there's a lot what's happening
like at the bottom of this like what is
what is the actual stuff that is taking
time okay zoom way and zoom a bit in all
right it looks like we're doing like a
reader and reader and glob star let's
click it just click yes
yeah wait seems good is this nice this
is the source cab yeah yeah is here
that's the eslint source and we're just
like gonna view it now from the profile
it's yeah okay cool it's nice to have
that and no yeah that's good now I think
I don't spend as much time in dev tools
as you but these colors in the side look
now these are what is this ah yeah this
is brand new this is line level
annotations of all of the performance
work so basically if you're over and you
taking kind of like a jump scroll file
and kind of you see all this stuff the
self time is the amount of time that you
actually spend doing work inside of that
function those specific things right so
if we take those numbers and we actually
say hey I want to know I want to see
what that looks like
against my source code answer like glob
sink right and I'm just gonna like click
in and see actually what is happening
there but not only like per function but
at the line level as well they're able
to see between functions and lines where
I'm spending time on the CPU doing work
so it's kind of like the perf perfect
cut err it's like it's like we put the
performance work in the gutter of the
editor it's like a perf gutter it's like
a perf gutter perf gutter perf like and
yeah it's like a perf cutter perf cutter
I like that we can call it that right
it's a thing okay I named it IO 2016
perturb cutter we're doing the work here
we're doing the kerf cutter I'm actually
in the other files that we have like
seems like the numbers are smaller right
so like all the work is happening in
here like in the kind of blobby and
we're moving around the file system
Paul Lewis once that the performance is
the art of avoiding work and I feel like
that is some work that we can avoid
right yeah how many ideas I like how we
could you know well let's let's zoom way
out here
yeah okay and sort of look what's going
on and we see that it all kind of starts
in this list files to process function
yeah stops down into this anonymous
function so let's click in again and see
just like what's happening um and this
is this is a lot of code yeah too much
took took me a while to read it and yeah
so you you made me some like artisanal
handcrafted yeah all I explain what's
going on here again with the help of my
graphics yeah you're welcome
okay okay so this is what's happening in
that function block we call es lint
which is gonna in our code it calls glob
doubts Inc on our project and gets all
26,000 files of JavaScript which
included node modules yeah and then it
passes each one of those files into this
filter which it reads in our es lint
ignore to know what to not pass on like
node modules and then at the very end we
get 30 files yeah it's like lint these
35 does it yeah that's something that's
one way to do it is there any way to
well I was looking at the glob options
because like doing the filtered
ourselves seems like too much work
yeah and glob takes and ignore oh you
can like give a black list of what
should be ignored to the glob function
yeah so it's like hey I even look at the
node modules folder and it just doesn't
you don't oh that seems like like a good
approach yeah it does so ideally it
might look like this
we we call es lint it reads in our es
line ignore the constructs this filter
object it passes that to our glob dot
sync and we get 35 yep and the nice
thing here is that like we were looking
at all that self time doing the
traversal and stuff and now we're like
it it's like node modules nope
I'm gonna skip that like big bunch of
files and I let's stick to the project
okay
so I that seems good let's like try it
out yeah I measure yes uncie so I have a
branch where I've actually made this
patch already I like it
okay here we go
so let's rerun our profile and see what
kind of impact this had throughout it so
back to that measure step right it's
measuring again so here we are in the
surahs let's start our profile you know
you're gonna hit command-d wait wait
wait wait what yeah we're done
Wow okay cool yeah I still see that like
green area where it's doing the Linton
at the end and then that that bit before
where yeah but wait for it but there's
no glob anymore I mean I think it's in
here oh there it is oh wait a hundred
and forty four milliseconds now that's
good and so before we're looking at well
I realize it's like 11 seconds in total
for that yeah run that's pretty good
alright cool so um for our project we'll
make you alike just hack the thing does
yeah I can email you the patch okay I'll
blab maybe we should contribute it back
to the community hmm I have to open a
pull request
that's right thing to do after like take
pictures and attach them and write words
and like choose at least four emojis
there's a work there uh I know we're
busy with this but like maybe later you
could do it okay I'm just gonna say that
I started oh good okay like sooner the
better
alright you wanna do now yeah do now
yeah all right
note that the unicorn emoji always the
Innoko Rosie those are good smart stuff
so interview fall what what do what do
we learn today when we go over a good
amount from being able to coordinate
between what's happening in the network
activity in the main thread
understanding and categorizing the kind
of work that's happening understanding
the interactions that your wrist that
the browser is receiving and
coordinating that with my work and then
being able to take all that kind of
performance stuff and then actually be
able to use
seem kind of stuff in know Jess it's
pretty awesome some good stuff some good
stuff so yeah so we're really clear
about some of this stuff happy for you
guys to start using it let us know what
you think some good things if you have
any questions you can find us on the
internet that works yeah cool thank you
guys very much for each other thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
