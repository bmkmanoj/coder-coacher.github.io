users and what they want now you need to
consider how to design for them and you
know this isn't just about stuff like
color you need to think about content
design what does this mean well design
is more than a graphic design and user
interface design when you look at great
progressive web apps you'll see that
they've designed text images and media
for their users focusing on mobile now
many of us have low levels of visual or
textual literacy and some of us can't
understand all kinds of visual elements
most people struggle with long blocks of
text especially when we're tired or
stressed or in a hurry we often think
about accessibility features but you
know that affects all of us at some
point you know trying to understand gray
on white text in sunlight for example or
text that's too small when you're
reading on a phone on a bus always
prioritize content over layout one
golden rule does a change make it harder
for users to consume content or interact
now you need to be honest you need to
think app people are using what you
build because they want to get something
done you may not need a boring footer on
every page for example now I just wanted
to pick up on a part of this and it
doesn't matter whether you're creating a
content site and e-commerce app or even
a game thinking about text for the web
less is more people will give up and
leave your site unless information is
easy to access and understand you can
find out lots more about this at
developers.google.com/live inns and you
know great content design will also make
it easier to build really good UI and UX
when it comes to data cost design on a
data budget and stick to it cut the
clutter reduce image sizes and
remove unnecessary content think about
code design why does this matter
well great responsive designs resilient
UX and performance optimization rely on
well-designed code the phrase separation
of concerns sums it up use HTML to add
meaning and structure CSS for
presentation and JavaScript for
everything else use HTML then CSS if you
need it and then JavaScript if you
really need that take time and effort to
structure your HTML carefully after all
hTML is the core language of every web
page build validation into your workflow
and make sure code is valid before it's
committed to a project the web was
designed first and foremost to be
responsive and mechanisms for
distributing content to a range of
client devices and displays some
elements are naturally responsive now
remember that you can actually deliver
text to any platform simply by using
standard page elements now some elements
like images need some CSS effort to work
well across platforms we're going to
look at this in much more detail in
other parts of this course at every
stage to say it again prioritize content
over layout and remember the golden rule
does a change make it harder for users
to consume content or interact be honest
ok so now you're going to get up and do
some work I want you to find answers for
each of these points who is the audience
what platforms are they on what data
costs can they handle and remember we're
thinking about your users and what
you're building thinking about your
content and the way users need to
interact with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
