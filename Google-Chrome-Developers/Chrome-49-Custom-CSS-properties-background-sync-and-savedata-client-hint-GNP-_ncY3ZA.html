properties sometimes referred to as CSS
variables background sync makes it easy
to reliably send data to the server even
if the user leaves the page closes the
browser or loses their network
connection and the new save data client
hint header enables you to deliver fast
and light applications to users who want
them these are just some of the new
features for developers in chrome 49
let's dive in and see what's new in
Chrome every site has CSS files filled
with repeated values colors margins
padding etc repeating these values over
and over again in your CSS is not only a
chore but it's also error-prone if at
some point one of those values needs to
be changed your best option is probably
to find and replace all the things but
on a project that's large enough this is
dangerous
chrome now supports CSS custom
properties sometimes referred to as CSS
variables allowing you to define
property values in the CSS without a
preprocessor once defined you can use
the VAR function to reference these
custom properties anywhere in the
document one of the more powerful
features of custom properties is the
ability to define or change them
wherever you want for example you could
define a variable in a media query or
use JavaScript to change it you simply
can't do that with a preprocessor well
CSS custom properties just landed in
chrome 49 it's already available in
Firefox 42 Safari 91 I owe s Safari 9 3
so check it out one of the cool features
of serviceworkers is the ability to
cache pages insuring that your page
loads fast even on slow or non-existent
that
but what about the case where you need
to send something to the server in the
past we probably use on before unload to
prevent the user from leaving the page
before we finished the send and if there
was no network connection hopefully we'd
fail gracefully but graceful is hard the
new background sync API improves network
reliability by allowing service workers
to schedule a one-off sync of the user's
local changes when the device next
connects to the network even if the page
isn't open to use background sync we
need to add a sync event listener to our
serviceworker
that calls a sync method our sync method
should then return a promise indicating
success or failure if it fulfills the
sync is complete but if it fails the
browser will try again later until it
successfully sends the data then to
request a sync we grab the service
workers registration and our app and
request a sync check out this article
for more details and try out mo joy a
simple emoji only chat thing every day
hundreds of millions of users rely on
proxy browsers and various transcoding
services to access the web and reduce
their bandwidth enabling a faster
browser experience but the popularity of
proxy browsers and transcoding services
is an indicator that we are ignoring the
high user demand for fast and light
applications and pages the new save data
client hint request header available in
Chrome Opera and Yandex browsers enables
us to deliver fast and light
applications to users who have opted in
to data savings mode in their browser by
identifying this request header your app
should respond with a lighter version
for example reduce the number of image
bytes sent by sending fewer images or
using
higher compression ratios or switch to
on-demand loading of expensive content
these are just a few of the new features
in chrome 49 for developers be sure to

some of the other new features if you
