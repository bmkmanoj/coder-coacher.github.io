good transition from what you have heard
in the in the morning with all the other
speakers talking about the user
experience and and so on so forth so
what I'm trying to talk today is
basically the lessons and the tips that
we have learnt by powering WebRTC into
the enterprise applications and
optimizing the customer experience using
web RTC so a quick show of hands on how
many of you recognize the word CX all
right not surprising that's good so when
you think about UX that's user
experience but when I talk about CX
that's basically the customer journey
through the through your app it's like
sum total of the customer experience as
the customer goes through the app and
experiences different things through
that doesn't work
so what do customers expect from great
experiences so they expect consistent
voice video the data is everywhere so
aggregate the data and make it a
personalized journey for the customers
and connected interactions so that in
turn will give them a very rewarding
relationship with your service and with
your application as well so today I
think we've had speakers talk about the
customer service applications we have
speakers talk about the health care
application so a any kind of
applications works very well with web
RTC so either healthcare insurance
customer service experience and so on
and so forth but I think yeah I skipped
one so but the customer journeys are
really complex so we have seen that you
can definitely use web RTC for a minimum
viable feature set like video voice and
and what have you but there are multiple
devices multiple networks and multiple
channels so taking the customer
seamlessly through the transition
journey is not easy so I so basically
any broken journey any any journey that
is broken here drives customers away so
data shows that if the customer has a
bad experience like a patchy video or a
bad audio once they come to your
application it is ninety-one percent
very likely that they'll they'll choose
an alternate service so that's where the
customer experience becomes very
important and it's one of the top
priorities for all the enterprise's
today to have a seamless journey and
provide a very good customer experience
for their customers so the tip one is
enable seamless journeys what does this
mean so I think in the very beginning
sahi talked about the web angle of web
RTC and the wipe angle of the body she
so whenever we talk about where bodies
we talked about this paradigm shift
right so paradigm shift from
communications as a silo to a
communications as a feature in your web
application but that comes with a
certain challenges as well because if
you are like like me very impatient you
start put pressing the browser reload
buttons whenever the call doesn't
connect or call freezer so the video
freezes what do you do when the page
doesn't come come up in the web browser
you reloaded right so there are web star
I'll browser reloads and the classic
back button and and of course the native
apps do price sometimes and there are
connectivity changes Wi-Fi to 4G device
handoffs and server-side failures of
course nothing here the customer cares
about all the customer cares about is
basically the experience that the
customer would have so what we have done
is we have solved this by the concept of
session rehydration so basically it is
to keep the session alive when the
connectivity is interrupted and
recreated as soon as the connectivity is
reestablished so what we have done was I
think three years ago when we started
building our product which is web RTC
session controller we were looking at
the drafts and there was a draft IET
IETF RTC web draft where we got this
inspiration so basically i think the
session rehydration didn't make it into
the final state because maybe my guesses
it has a lot to do with signaling and
how reliably the signaling is
implemented but we took this concept and
we built on it so what happens is let's
say there's this client and the server
and for some reason the client goes down
and the client has to reconnect to the
server right so what we do is when the
client is reconnected is trying to
reconnect when the client goes down on
the server side we still keep the
session so we still keep the WebSocket
session and when the client is trying to
reconnect for example maybe the browser
crashes
the browser reload when the client is
trying to reconnect we have some session
ID some information with line that we
store so that session ID is passed on to
the server and the server detects that
this is the session ID with which the
WebSocket connection has been made
earlier and then it resynchronize a--'s
that session ID and and it recreates the
WebSocket so basically we built a very
reliable signaling protocol it's called
the JSON RTC protocol so basically
that's based on web sockets so it does a
complete resynchronization so it has a
reliability built to the message level
so whenever the client comes back so it
resynchronize a--'s the client messages
and the signaling is re-established and
then you have the ice procedures you
send the new stp and the whole shebang
to get the message working so what does
it give you it gives from the customer
perspective your connection it's a
seamless journey so even if your app
crashes in you and you bring the app
back it shows as if nothing has happened
maybe there's a little pause on the RTP
side because of RTP is generally UDP and
and that's that's somewhat expected but
it's very unnoticeable I should say and
then I do come from wipe background so
when I compare the wife call setup times
with the web's call setup at times I do
find the web setup times are a little
slow or maybe it's just me but a fast
call setup times impact customer
experience so customer expects the call
setup time to be really fast and web RTC
has this call setup procedure that takes
considerable amount of time to establish
and and why not because there's a lot of
thing that is going on right you have to
gather the candidates you have to
prioritize the candidate exchange the
candidates with the remote partying and
then there's connectivities checks and
then finally you get the candidates that
you connect with so there are multiple
ways this can be solved and I think most
of the people now are talking about
dynamic
reappearing this is where you prioritize
candidate does that are most most likely
to work first then you establish the
connection with that relay candidate and
then at the same time you try in
parallel with the other parties that can
communicate directly and if they can you
switch the media so alternately there is
thus trickle ice that reduces the time
for ice procedures to complete so
basically it is an extension to the ice
protocol and it sort of reduces the time
because it incrementally does the
candidate gathering and that sort of
optimizes the call setup times as well
so customer experience tip 2 so identify
and solve the weak points solving weak
points is one thing but identifying that
is a more difficult thing actually but
so don't be afraid to step back and I
think we have heard this over and over
again today is if the call drops if in
the middle of the conversation that's
one thing but if there is a patchy video
that's a big no-no for the customer so
how do we solve this so there is a good
web RTC stats API that can measure
jitter packet loss the bitrate bandwidth
and of course this is maybe this might
give you some after fact data but then
you have rtcp feedback mechanisms from
which you can calculate the quality of
your stream then with the frame rate you
can find out if the CPU of your device
can handle the video and and also the
battery right if your battery is really
down you wouldn't want your customers to
connect to the video I mean you can
either trigger a message or say that you
can fall back to I audio so there are
different ways you can do that and of
course it need not be audio it can you
can switch from an HD video to a low
resolution video or audio depending on
various factors so it is basically
aggregating all this data and
triggering some sort of a message that
the application can catch and provide a
seamless experience to the customers and
of course this now we have a simulcast
so basically you can encode the same
video stream in different resolutions so
that you don't penalize both the parties
so you only send a low resolution video
to one of the parties and the other
party can have a good HD video or audio
whatever it is so I think we have
different other speakers talking about
simulcast and so on later today so I'll
sort of step this and one thing I
noticed is web RTC notifications and and
I didn't hear many people talk about it
but from where I stand it it's very very
important so the customers expect to
stay engaged when they've and are away
from the app and they want to stay
engaged without draining the battery so
there are multiple things you can do for
this so basically from from my
perspective whoever is handling the
signaling should also handle the
notifications so you can optimize the
web party web socket connections with
push notifications so what how does the
battery drain right so you have the
client you have the server and the
client is always pinging the server or
letting the server know that I am Alive
and that will take up a lot of resources
and the battery goes down pretty quickly
so what you can do here so you can
optimize the WebSocket connection so
basically the client can tell the server
that hey I am hibernating for a while
during the period of inactivity and the
client can go off the WebSocket
connection is broken and on the server
side the server can keep that connection
for a while and whenever there is a
message coming or incoming call coming
in for the client the server can
rehydrate again I am talking about the
concept of rehydration here basically
the car the server can rehydrate the
client session wake up the client using
a push notification and resume the call
so there are many ways you can implement
the push notifications you can directly
connect to the APNs GCM
servers get the notifications or you can
use the mobile you can create your own
push notification gateway basically it
can can connect to multiple notification
services and it can register multiple
apps and so on and of course chrome has
push notifications as well so we have
chrome push notifications based on w3c
api and service worker which works well
on the desktop as well as on the mobile
browsers as well and finally i think i
was thinking whether whether i have to
talk about this or not but sure
certainly we do because we all like
elephants and especially the big ones so
interoperability is a key to success in
the enterprise applications and from
where I stand almost sixty percent of
oracle enterprise customers run their
desktop applications on internet
explorer and oracle has a is a big
player in enterprise application space
so how do we solve the IE stop gap on
the desktop so we we did use the flash
fallback solution for a while but now I
think our customers look at look with a
funny face when we talk about the flash
fall back so I I think in the interim
there are adapters ie plugins that you
could use for multiple versions of to
support the multiple versions of
Internet Explorer because that's the
funny thing right it's not one version
if you look at some of the enterprise's
banks and some insurance companies they
even go back to very old versions of ie
maybe six seven whereas until ie8 even
web sockets are not supported and then
wait for Microsoft edge so Microsoft
edge is now supporting getusermedia so
probably will hear about what and when
in the session that is coming up with
the Microsoft folks how about Safari I
think that that is a question so I think
on the Safari side the stopgap is hedged
with various things so we have the
native iOS web RTC support which sort of
hedges that as well as I think people
can
use Chrome on Macs and so on and then
finally mobile is different and we all
know that right and customers do not
like if their video called drains their
battery on their device so certainly I
think if you are talking if you have a
video call setup for 20 minutes and your
battery goes down south definitely
that's not a customer good customer
experience so how we're acceleration is
very important especially if you're
working with applications where
customers use them mostly on the mobile
devices so video coding with dedicated
hardware is always better has better
video performance and if you are really
working with good quality video 720p
1080p hardware acceleration is very very
important there so chrome 45 is has
started to support h.264 as well so
that's good because there always has
been a big gap between the number of
devices that support h.264 hardware
acceleration versus vp8 hardware
acceleration and that certainly was
troubling us quite a bit so a stopgap I
think certainly you can fall back to
h.264 when vp8 hardware acceleration is
not supported by the native chipsets so
I think web RTC could provide some sort
of an indication that this device has
vp8 acceleration set up and sort of
switch back for a switch back to h.264
or there are AP ice on the native
devices which tell you whether the
hardware acceleration is supported for
the codec or not so v p8 h 264 we have
been struggling with these so far but
now I think we have new candidates in
the mix and certainly I think we are
very excited to look forward to what
comes in so I want to conclude my talk
saying that customer experience is very
important there are many more things
that we have learnt so
I'll be very happy to share my
experiences after this presentation as
well but i just wanted to close with
this code from macy's store managers
which says be everywhere do everything
but never fail to astonish the customer
yeah so now incision doom item a myth is
going to do a quick demo so why don't we
while we're getting set up here we have
time for probably one question questions
search any indications from your
customers on whether they will move from
Internet Explorer to edge it's very
difficult especially I think the when
these enterprise applications have
written their own web pages and websites
that are very specific to a version of
version of internet explorer and I think
they sort of stick to that version and
okay so I've talked about the session
rehydration right so how the session
gets recreated during browser reloads
and so on and so forth so I have a quick
demo here that I want to show that chose
a user log send into a room based
service and we have a lot of them right
now and let's say I am a user Alice and
I login into a service and I create a
room
you
and I'm here so now i take this URL and
i give to my friend which is me again ok
so think let me open up so let me open
the site again
I open another window actually chilled
to give me a moment okay maybe I
okay we can do that as well so let me
try this
okay so now it's okay yes so I become
Bob in the next window so now we have
Alice and Bob finally so we have the
call setup so now i also have a chat
service so bob says hi that comes to
Alice as well and Alice say is hello
there and that comes to Bob so now Alice
for some reason wants to reload and then
the connection get re-established
without any delay and you see the voice
call get three establishes you see that
the data channel gets reestablished so
everything gets seamlessly reestablished
with this so i just wanted to show this
quick demo yeah all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
