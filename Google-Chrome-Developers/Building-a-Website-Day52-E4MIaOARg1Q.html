finally we've got something on the
screen that is actually a thing to look
at and actually even this little header
here has presented some interesting side
challenges mostly around what to do with
mobile let me show you what it does as
the screen gets bigger and smaller there
we go oh yeah so this small sort of 320
is pixel wide which is what you'd find
on an iPhone it looks like that at the
moment it has the little you know the
little menu
thing going on and then as the space
kind of grows you get the actual
sections and you can you know click
around and all the rest of it in the
little the thing is this little side now
here when you click on it pop pops out
like that
but that's all done without JavaScript
and you can toggle it like that and so
on so the way that I've done that is a
little so I'm not the first person to do
this in fact if you google it there are
plenty of people who do similar things
what we've got here is a label and the
label is connected to a check box and so
when you click on the label it basically
toggles the check box state took from
check to not checked and then the menu
is styled that you can see here if the
check box is checked and you I'm using
the general sibling selector tell them
the nav to be display block and all the
rest of it and so you can basically by
toggling the check box you're actually
toggling the visibility of the menu no
JavaScript and now what I'm going to do
is when I get to adding in the
JavaScript to the site I'm going to
progressively enhance that soon and it
slides in and out is my plan because
while that works it's not the nicest for
it to just appear
I'd like it to slide in and out but this
is actually it's working just fine that
the thing that you'll notice when you
look at blog posts or Stack Overflow
answers that that may
and doing something like this is that
they they will set the the checkbox to
display nan and I didn't want to set the
checkbox to display non because it so I
can click on this if you like I can
click on it but I wanted to maintain
keyboard control and I need to put in a
focus state actually that's so when I
want to see this video if I haven't done
it already I want to add a focus state
on to back on to that so that it's very
clear that it has focused because I
think we want that but the reason I
didn't want to set you can see the
checkbox that I the reason I didn't want
to set the display non on the check box
itself is because you lose the ability
to do keyboard shook at the the keyboard
control so right now if I hit and if I
say if it's got focus by clicking on the
label I give it focus and I can I can
still tap to it if I set this like if I
set this to display non I can still
click on it but I can't hit spacebar
anymore no amount of space bar is going
to make that go away somebody who's got
a desire to use the keyboard is going to
get frustrated with that so I figure
there's no harm to having it display but
opacity:0 it seems to give me the best
combination of those two and because
they're the label isn't a bubble I'm
hoping that that's the correct
combination of things I need to check
with Alice box or Rob Dodson to just
help me make sure that I've definitely
done that right but anyway that's there
that's the side nav and I wish it
disappears and so on so that's just a
lot of CSS media break pointy type stuff
and there is this slight curve on the
header or the slight angle which is done
with a an SVG and let me show you that
since we're here looking out this header
it looks like that
and it basically my night sort of scales
across based on that so it's because
it's got preserve aspect ratio non and
it's just with wonders at high
understand basically whatever div I give
it to it's going to stretch to fill mmm
good your voice right Paul okay it's
going to stretch to fill up that element
so that works out just fine actually
that's giving me the kind of look that I
wanted to to have so there we are a CSS
only side nav which is doing just fine
we can click around in the location
schedule and so on so do making a little
bit of progress there and a couple of
interesting little things along the way
ground double get subscribed don't

above an Iowa love course probably catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
