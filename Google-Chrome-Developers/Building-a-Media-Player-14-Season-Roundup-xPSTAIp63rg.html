final video on this media PWA to say
thank you for coming along on this
journey with me when I think about where
I started it was that I knew nothing
about media and I know enough now to be
dangerous and I've hopefully taught you
to do the same okay that didn't sound
quite like anything
nonetheless thank you very much for
coming on listen let's think about kind
of what's in here what are we cover
recovered serviceworker caches - and MSE
HLS background fetch intersection
observers readable streams media session
API ID be full screen orientation lock
and device orientation and just general
PWA goodness you know so if you not
caught the videos I think about watch
those definitely check out the source
code have a read through all that stuff
you know ask your questions below I do
read them and I really enjoy kind of the
the chat that we can have about all this
stuff
but hopefully it's also inspired you to
maybe go and try something new that you
not try before it's a great opportunity
if you can to you know to discover a
brand new part of the web and just give
it a go so with that I want to say thank
you again and I will catch you whatever
in up next hang on I'm going to say this
right whatever I end up building next
that's what I meant to say I will catch
you when I do that hey folks thanks for
watching don't forget that there is more
content that you can find kind of over
here ish and if you want to subscribe is
probably a button oh maybe there maybe
somewhere around there click that if
you've not done that brilliant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
