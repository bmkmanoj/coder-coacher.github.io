that you can see on screen styling is
getting underway which means you know
I've got just place all of the actual
page content but I've got a footer in
place with a couple of links the header
you can go around the individual
sections I'm going to make that a bit
wider code of conduct as well that's in
there need to do a little bit of tally
up their link on the text positioning
but you can see styling is underway
finally getting somewhere a little bit
more visual which is good for me and the
nav also works down here like so pretty
much as we were hoping to see so that's
that's the good news oh I should mention
the other thing which is the styling
I've actually opted for a slightly
different solution in the engine
remember how I mentioned about is going
to do inline styles and then like
full-fat styles and I wasn't sure if
it's going to work okay I've concluded a
couple things firstly that I should keep
things simple so let me show you what
it's like on a normal standard issue
page basically you can see here can get
rid of a bunch of that they're coming we
have just the stylesheet straight into
the style sheet so that is actually what
we're going to do and that would be
render blocking however what I'm banking
on mostly is that we'll most people will
come via the home page to the site so if
somebody comes to hear ya they could
have a bit of render blocking I don't
think it's gonna be that much though I
mean at the moment the styles are six
and a half K it's not a big deal I mean
no they'll get more will get bigger
obviously but hopefully by the time gzip
is on hopefully not a huge deal it's not
loads and loads and loads of styles but
we can still improve it and as I say
most people I think are going to come to
the home page where I take a slightly
different tack and I do use the inline
style so I have a style tacky with with
just those inline styles so it's things
like position information and so on all
fine and a bit of coloring information
and then I load via the JavaScript that
you saw last time I
inject the this style sheet via
JavaScript some people on YouTube were
saying well what happens if you don't
have javascript fair enough great
question that's why no script was
invented and inside the nose script we
can pop in the link to the stylesheet so
we'll get in line styles if somebody
hasn't got javascripts then they'll get
the link injected by the no script
injected it's in the no script that will
cause the stylesheets to download and
then will you know for everybody else
and in both cases by the way if if they
get it from here or they get it from the
injected one now the cash is kind of
primed so when you then go to schedule
or location or code of conduct or
whatever the CSS is already in the cache
and so we'll get that back nice and
quickly there are some final inline
styles a specific for each individual
page so rather making a separate
stylesheet force a home or schedule a
location if there's specific styles for
that page I'm inlining those as well so
it's a kind of combo of those different
approaches we'll see how that pans out
it could be that I and revisited again
just to show you though by the way if i
disable javascript in devtools hopefully
all being well we still get all the
styles because even though we've got the
style there with the no script you can
see that that's actually now is that of
a piece of text that it's actually a
link let's actually become a thing and
you can see here in the network that
while we don't have any JavaScript been
downloaded we do have the stylesheet
coming in as well so it seems like a
pretty good combination of those two you
know in lines versus actual links good
side is it's not render blocking pretty
much when I do this so hopefully that
will pan out but we'll see how we get on
so there you go some styles in place
good and also um so yeah the Machine up
of all those styles it's good that we
get you subscribed by the way you
subscribe no say that again Paul don't
forget you can subscribe I mean you you
should subscribe
if you want to far be it for me to tell
you what to do okay you can subscribe
and you know hopefully you're enjoying
these diary videos thank you to
everybody who's been popping comments in
below and making suggestions and just
you know generally being involved that's
kind of what I was hoping was going to
happen so yeah cool i'll see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
