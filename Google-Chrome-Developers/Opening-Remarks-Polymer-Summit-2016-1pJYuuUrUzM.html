day one it's fun and fun right great
thanks al i want to say thanks to matt
for giving me the opportunity is great
to be back home in London and I think
Madden the whole polymer team have just
done a fantastic job with the summit for
us and with the new release of polymer 2
and the like and I kind of need it I
kind of needed yesterday and I kind of
needed the party because 2016 has been
it's been an interesting year sure we
say no and then I get a little bit
frustrated again I grew up here so I
have certain frustrations about being
here and then now I live in the US and
there's a few frustrations right now in
the US yeah so I kind of looking at
maybe Canada or Australia I don't know I
really I really don't know okay but then
then I have to go to data and have to be
like take a breath it's actually the
best time in history to be a human it's
okay the world is more peaceful there's
less poverty it's going to be okay and I
have to kind of calm myself down and I
sometimes feel a little bit the same way
with technology where I dive in there
and feel a little bit frustrated there's
just so much stuff going on things are
evolving so quickly and I have to
remember that you know I may not have to
learn every single tool that someone
publishes the MPN or github it may be
okay to just focus on actually
delivering something you know for my
users and then I have to remember again
after taking a breath that things are
actually pretty amazing for the web
right now you know I used to work for
Walmart where I started a mobile group
over there a walmart labs which is also
has as her in the in the UK and this was
about five years ago where I got to kind
of get in there kick-out you know mobile
from the ground up they had no native
apps no mobile website and the business
just wanted apps apps apps right this is
five years ago it's a big push
and so we went out there and got things
into the into the App Store but we also
build a brand new website that actually
worked well on mobile and I was able to
see over time things kind of settle
because whenever something new is
happening everything is kind of up into
the riot and a couple of years in I
could kind of see that okay look at this
guy's eighty percent of revenue is still
coming through the website maybe there's
something to this web thing still and so
maybe we should kind of focus a lot of
our attention on that I feel like we're
getting to that across the entire
community we see a lot of the kind of
macro picture on what's going on but
then we can actually look at our data
and see how things are kind of balancing
our but as well as being you know an
important end of the tap experience we
also need to become really native on
mobile and that to me is what the
progressive web apps thing has been
about is about actually delivering all
of those capabilities and that's been
incredibly excited over the last year
but I kind of feel like this at the
moment I feel like I am regenerating
from desktop apps mobile desktop apps
web to mobile web and I feel like as a
whole ecosystem we're still going
through this change and we're not fully
there yet but it's important to note how
far we've actually come you know when
mobile finally took off it was the pinch
and zoom web and it was actually a
genius strategy of Steve Jobs of friends
to do this because the web then
instantly became the back catalogue
right if if he didn't deliver this a
member at the time everyone was working
on whap and these other kind of weird
things for mobile then there wasn't the
path to be able to get access to all of
this content but we've been able to go
from that and move away we don't want
the web just to be the back catalog we
want it to be at the forefront and we
can now deliver these fantastic
experiences like Chopin polar and a lot
of the things that the partners have
been showing and this is really kind of
a sense of where we were able to to get
to over the last few years but we've got
a major challenge and we're an
interesting crossroads right now and I
think it's important to realize that
there is
still an existential threat going on
here and that's about building our
mission for our users to deliver this
fantastic experience but to do it on
this platform that is very different on
the web you have the browser and the
runtime that's obviously already on the
device and so you have to use that as
much as possible hence use the platform
and things that we've been hearing but
we've also got this whole slew of stuff
that has to sit on top of it we've got
all of our frameworks and libraries all
of our app code and then all of the data
and things that we need how are we going
to get that onto the device and in a way
that mobile can actually run this thing
an alex russell is going to tell us a
lot about the actual constraints that
are here and it's really vital to
realize the threat that we're in because
we need to deliver that in three seconds
or we we're dead and so it's kind of
important for us the framework
developers you know and the browsers to
keep evolving this run time to actually
work really well for mobile how do we
solve this we have to do magic right
computer science tends to be a lot of
illusion as you're interacting on your
desktop computer it looks like the
computers they're trying to do some work
for you but we all know that it's really
going through a whole slew of tasks in
the background and at the last minute it
said oh yeah repaint that cursor just
being there ready for the user we need
to work out a way to do that a moniker
and Steve talked about this yesterday
are out being lazy and do unless it's
important that we really push hard using
all of the tricks and smokes and mirrors
that we can Paul Lewis is going to be
talking later he's kind of our master
magician and he'll be here with his
sidekick the safety summer and so you
got to watch him do live coding and see
the different tricks that he's getting
up to here but we need to do two things
really importantly we need to squash
everything down and get our frameworks
and libraries down to a point where
they're optimized for mobile the same
with our own code the same with the data
etc but the flip side is we also need to
take and be able to take a slice of our
information of all you I our UX and be
able to quickly deliver just that slice
and then be able to laze
load things later it's really important
for us to be able to do this and we need
to do it in a way that actually makes
sense for us so again back at walmart we
did a lot of with now called isomorphic
javascript server-side rendering but it
became a little bit of a spaghetti mess
if you went into the code you'd see some
little cheeky hacks like if I'm on the
server actually do this and if I'm on
the client and do this and it was really
painful so we need to have the ability
to do less work and do work later for
our devices but we also need to be able
to do that as developers and for that we
need to have all of the right tools to
give us the abstractions where we can
kind of you know fake this out and let
the illusion actually happen so this is
why I'm really excited about being here
at the polymer stomach so I feel like
polymers got the right match here it's a
great tool to allow us to actually
deliver this experience and super
excited for you to you know see what
else comes up later on in the day and
now I kind of want to get off stage and
allow you to kind of see what's going on
in the world of tooling because I think
it's going to really impress you and
show you what's going to be possible as
you meet that challenge thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
