Lewis how do you
feel about roller coasters I like them
roller coaster of love let's roll
so I've got a bone to pick with you
oh that's unusual I would only get on
just fine well I cuz I've been watching
you know weird notice that you've been
engaging in some degree of Babel
activity you've been using a bit okay
yes 6007 not quite as terrifying as I
thought it might be in this but you
you're the kind of person who says I've
heard you say this that you don't like
writing code that isn't the code that
ends up being executed in the browser
correct you don't like those little
middle steps you're kind of anti
transpiler I am sort of anti-trans but I
want to feel like the code I write is
the code that runs and I'm happy for a
little bit of wool to be pulled over my
eyes but I want to feel like I can back
out of it so I don't think that's
changed the thing for me when I look at
something like Babel or Bailey fire or
any of that one thing is that I feel
like what I feel like I could switch it
out for tracer or I could switch it out
for something else because yeah because
it's an open standard I guess you've
never they're independent
implementations the best exactly and
it's like it feels like this is the
JavaScript I'm gonna be writing right so
a while from now so it's like if it's
gonna get me there then that's fine I'm
okay with that
and then the other thing is if you look
at the es5 that it generates it's like
makes sense it's fine I feel like when
you look at some other things like
weather that I don't know CoffeeScript a
touchscreen something like that you
can't you can never say that because
it's like well you're always gonna be
transpiling across I had this issue
actually I was using a project MPM
installing something using it and there
was a bug and I thought as a citizen in
the Internet I'm going to do a pull
request I'm going to try and fix that
yeah and when I gotten to github and
click click click copy scripts
oh now select one of making this fix is
CoffeeScript yeah and it's like I don't
unless I really really care about fixing
the bug it's not I did for me it's like
JavaScript become you know es6 year 7s
whatever but like you say this kind of
Alice did learn type script for
CoffeeScript or any of the anything else
it's just like I've got to really want
to go off and do that for some reason
and I don't see what that reason is
because JavaScript for me for everything
is fine I actually really liked Babel if
for no other reason than its source maps
were just super so even though I wasn't
really so aiming for that when I did get
an error he was like you know whatever
doc Jay s lime whatever and it was like
yeah that is the correct line and well
is that even if you're not using source
maps with Babel it the output is
actually pretty sensible for the most
part yes as you say source maps just
make it completely transparent it's
almost like you're not using a
transpiler at all exactly so I'm happy
with the illusion of it I think that's
probably what it comes down to but as I
say you you're right if you look at the
actual code it generates for me I was
just like yeah that's not necessarily
code I write but that's okay it's just
about manageable readable to go and then
what you're what are your big hitters in
yes six or seven well what's your babies
oh my faves contentious one would be
classes I actually really like classes
because people like what's wrong with
the prototype you're judging your back
on prototype all using a prototype it's
just sugar
yes exactly nice sugar at that very nice
yeah because I know I find sugar like if
I'm if I'm doing like something dot
proper type equals object your object
create the thing I'm extending and I
keep forgetting the doc prototype on the
end there just one is about it it's
compared to class thing expense thing
but and that's that's the one way you do
it in es6 like with the ear spider
you've got eleventy billion ways of
doing it and not all of them are good
you necessarily or readable or what you
want to see if you're looking at your
own code six months from now or somebody
else's code so it kind of felt like it
was more like the code I want to write
more like the code I want to read it's
where we're going it's a feature it's
not like somebody just went off piste
and did something that they wanted to do
and I can barely remember how to spell
function now you've got you can within
an object it's just the name brackets
off you go there's arrow fat arrow
function was something else I really
like yep yeah a little bit fat arrow
yeah because number times they use
request animation
frameset timeout set intervals and yeah
like that and it's like oh all of a
sudden I'm on the windows scope am i
great thanks for that
so Bynes it's like math don't worry
don't like I mean I don't mind bang it's
better than var that equals this for me
I don't I don't like no don't do that
equals this I I will give it a specific
proper variable name based on the name
the class JQ this VAR jakey this is its
class vehicle yeah inside that I will do
var vehicle equals this like lowercase
vehicle equals this and it's yeah but it
makes sense then I don't like that
because it's like well that's just this
cool because this is a problem in
JavaScript I think it's this what like
yeah and and that's one of the things
that error functions solve is you you
tend to only be one option for what this
is and it's the instance name yeah yeah
explain so ways for me I really like
doctoring I like beautiful especially
for option objects yes at the end of a
would default right so we go this is it
becomes self-documenting you can say
right this this is optional but inside
this object here are the properties I'm
looking for in here at their defaults
yep but in any case I feel like going
back to your original question it's like
the reason I would use a transpiler
today is and if and only if it lets me
experience the future now get used to
like the future now I think it's where
we're going which you get the source
maps it feels like you can almost ignore
the transpilers yeah exactly and and as
I say the code that it generates makes
sense to me so I'm all up for that Yenko
transpilers yay Cheers
we need beers
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
