is Paul and I'm here to help now welcome
to supercharged I'm Paul this is the
show where you submit your sites I go
through them and I try and find the
performance problems and recommend some
fixes now today I've got the Guardian I
have spoken with them before and I know
they actually do a really good job with
things like inlining and so on but we're
gonna run it through webpagetest anyway
first for you only I'm gonna run on
mobile 3G with a nexus 5 this time and
Chrome by watching paint dry welcome to
supercharged I say this taking rather a
long time making people wait their turn
do you know who I am you'll prioritize
me if you know what's good for you so
we've got the web page test result which
looks good
and I tell you what we'll do we'll dive
into the filmstrip view because that's
always good fun I noticed that the the
speed index was about six thousand seven
hundred and so I would expect something
for like the gold standard to be
somewhere around the 3000 mark I mean a
give or take now as I scroll to the left
we're sort of a blank white screen for
about four and a half seconds and then
at five seconds we're actually starting
to see page content now because we're if
we look at the bottom we can see that
there's still there HTML and that's
coming in and as we get to the end of
that we actually start to see render so
that means they are in lining styles
because the only way we could get to the
end of the HTML and start rendering is
if there's some inline style so that's a
really good thing
print CSS now I want a phone I don't
expect to print it's a minor thing is
extremely minor because it's only 2.9 K
but it is a connection that we're making
and I wonder whether that needs to be
made with us
that's throwaway I won't even worry
about it you know unless you're worried
about it if you're worried about it do
something but don't I'm not saying you
should worry I'm not worried that HTML
does look quite large it's 83 K 83 KS
you know even I mean lb gzipped as well
so it's a fair amount to be sending down
as the initial
most of content I I wonder whether it
would be better even though they're
inline Styles I wonder whether it would
be better to actually send down less
HTML and then use Ajax to pull things in
that might just boost things a tiny
amount let's actually have a look at the
HTML itself hey they're hiring too bit
of an advert in there busted that wide
open for you this looks like our inline
styles here okay let's grab some of that
because I am curious as to how much of
inline styling we are seeing ding I'm
going to try that again in English I'm
wondering how much inline styles were
actually seeing so let me grab all this
it keeps on going gonna copy that so I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna fire up sublime
and I'm gonna paste it in let's save
that on our desktop as like fyel'd up
okay so we got the terminal open so what
we'll do is we will go to my desktop
where I saved that file and we'll do LS
- lah - la for file dot CSS and it is
179 Kay of inline styles but that's not
fair because what we should do is we
should gzip file dot CSS just is okay
this is all finger in the air kind of
stuff well let's see what we get so LS
la and then we'll just tap that up and
we'll go okay so it's 22 K when it's
gzip so that's still quite small but if
you want to get something inside the
initial response from a server it's got
to be in the first I think 14 K or so to
be to account for tcp slow-start and all
that good stuff so this is probably
quite a large amount of inline styles
but we have one other trick up our
sleeves here which I will show you now
this the credit for this goes to Matt
gaunt one of my colleagues he came up
with this and it's based off the
filament group's load CSS library what
what I've got here is a bookmarklet
which when I click it is going to switch
off any styles that been loaded in
remotely and just leave the inline
styles what it does is it goes through
the style sheets and it switches off the
the remote styles by just giving them a
media type that is rubbish and there you
go so that these don't apply anymore
has put it on the ridge so this is what
it looks like when there are no remote
stars just the inline Styles applied
Sumi in the United Kingdom what is this
global warming you see climate change
and I I mean unless they're doing work
to undo these Styles it feels like the
inline styles that have been applied
don't set through the layout up now it
could be that there's some other work
that's gone on with the JavaScript to to
change things around but as a first pass
I'll be looking at this going hmm when I
switch off the remotes
I want the inline Styles to be color
blocks and layout and stuff so that we
stop things moving around but mainly so
that we can get something up on screen
the whole point of the inline CSS is
hopefully to just kind of bootstrap up
that initial viewport and get us going
so much for the page load then which is
actually really looking good I think
there are some tweaks that they could
potentially make to crush down the
inline styles and you know not put so
much in there and put what is really
important in there not just what seems
important what we'll do next time is
actually dive into the performance
characteristics of things like they're
scrolling and so on so stick around for
that and I'll see you next time I'm the
only one on camera the only one they let
on camera these days take two or as I
like to call it the professional cut it
ends a point on the top of my head poor
