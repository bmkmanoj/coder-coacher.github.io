to day two of the chrome dev summit I'm
here on the floor we're actually in the
main venue getting ready to start the
second half of day 2 i'm joining with
patrick kettner patrick is a program
manager on the Microsoft edge team so
Patrick you're gonna be speaking today
about progressive web apps and I wanted
to know first of all just like what
inspired you to come do a session on
pwas here totally um so everybody at
Microsoft is really really excited about
progressive web apps we think it's the
future of the web and one thing when
talking to a lot of our partners that
build websites they were sort of like
yeah but we might wait until you guys
support it or something like that like
no no don't just chip it today with
proper feature detection and then it's
automatically done like you can we don't
want people to wait to ship features we
want them to start shipping them earlier
to get feedback before sooner and just
to build stuff faster and we want to be
a big part of that we want to encourage
people to do that not wait for other
browsers to implement stuff just get it
done today right on and so I'm sure this
is what many of the folks out there are
wondering is like when is edge going to
have some of these features absolutely
we have a team actively working on all
of these features we're hoping to get it
out there early next year it's
definitely dependent on timing and
budgets and everything else but it's
definitely definitely a top priority for
our team and something you can check out
the status of on the edge status website
online where we keep track of all the
different features we're adding all re s
seven progress and everything else like
that so it's um yeah it's coming soon
looking forward to it all right it looks
like the house lights are going down so
we're gonna wrap it up Patrick thank you
so much for being with us thank you so
much for watching stay tuned for more
day to see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
