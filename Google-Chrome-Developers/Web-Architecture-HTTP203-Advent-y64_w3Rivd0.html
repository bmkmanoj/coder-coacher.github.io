SURMA: So you're
wearing a Christmas hat
because it's Christmas.
SPEAKER: Yep.
SURMA: And as is
common in Christmas,
we're going to talk about
12 things that we're
excited about for the web.
And I thought I would talk
about architecture on the web.
SPEAKER: OK.
Two minutes.
What is that?
Architecture.
That's buildings.
It's nothing to do
with the web, mate.
You got confused.
SURMA: Well, the thing is
that lots of other fields,
like enterprise
engineering and gaming,
have like these architectural
patterns when they build, like,
really complex things.
SPEAKER: Nope.
Fields don't have architecture.
You're thinking of cities.
SURMA: Software architecture,
software engineering.
You come up with patterns to use
to compose and combine things
and to, you know,
like separation
of concerns, all these things.
And the web hasn't
really done that.
I mean, you could have done,
but developers mostly are like,
here's a little
app that I built,
or they just throw
things together
and do most of the complex
stuff in the back end.
And I think it's time for
the front end developers
to have proper architecture in
their front end code, as well.
SPEAKER: Isn't this what,
like, all of the frameworks
have been doing forever?
SURMA: Exactly.
But I think these patterns
should be exposed more
to the developers themselves.
For example, what I think that
the web has an actor pattern,
where you have independent
threads that are all running
in a single thread
mode, but they
communicate using [INAUDIBLE].
That's pretty much what
we have on the web.
And that is called
an actor pattern,
but these two things have
barely been combined on the web.
And I think there's more
patterns like this out there
that haven't been
applied to the web
to make your front end
architecture more manageable
and nicer to work with.
SPEAKER: So what do we need
to make this work, then?
SURMA: I think we
already have everything
that we need to
make it work, but we
haven't started using it.
Like, we just need to
look for the patterns
that game engineers use, that
enterprise engineers user,
and see if those are
useful for us on the web,
and try to build
things using it.
And just experiment.
SPEAKER: So getting stuff,
like, off the main thread
except for the UI
stuff [INAUDIBLE]??
SURMA: For example.
That's one thing I
want to look into.
And then how do you
separate the concerns?
What goes onto the off thread,
what stays on the main thread?
And then how do you structure
your code off thread, as well,
because that's just one
big bolt of logic still.
How do you, like, compose
those little bits and bobs
[INAUDIBLE]?
SPEAKER: So in 10 seconds, what
should be on the main thread?
SURMA: UI work.
SPEAKER: Right.
In six seconds, what shouldn't
be on the main thread?
SURMA: Not UI work.
SPEAKER: That is correct.
Well done.
[MUSIC PLAYING]

Nailed it.
I want to talk about
weightless CSS.
SURMA: Weightless?
SPEAKER: That is one
of the words I said.
The other one is CSS.
SURMA: So CSS without weight.
SPEAKER: Yes, that is a good
reversal of what I said.
SURMA: What is weight?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
