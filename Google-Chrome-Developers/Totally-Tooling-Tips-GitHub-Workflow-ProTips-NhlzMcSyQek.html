terrible at just open source in general
because people would like raise issues
on random repos and stuff that I'd done
or been a part of and then I'd never
respond because they just never knew
that it existed
mhm and like I tried the github
notification UI at one point it was
super noisy and then emails but then
that would be super noisy and it just
nothing worked
whereas octobe box is this tool that I
found and I love it because it's
literally stuck with me for a couple of
months if not longer and it's working
and I'm in love with it so all it is is
like an inbox for your github issues
pull requests and everything so as long
as you're like watching a repo you get a
long list of all the things that
currently like you should be involved in
oh you need to respond to and it's great
because it tracks like down here all the
things at the bottom these are super old
issues but I know that I need to do
something with them other ones like all
the ones up here I haven't seen their
new and they're all well basically I
need to do something with them and I'm
in love with it because as soon as
you're done with something you just
check it mark it off there we go we got
some new ones there you can even stir it
and then create like a little list of
additional things that's super nice but
it's gotten to a point now where I can
like basically the minute I have time to
do like a load of github issue sorting
out I can just go here refresh it go
through all my list and then get through
everything and then I'm like done go
away and then later on come back and
then I've got a new list of things it's
amazing if you haven't checked it out
you definitely should like for me I'm in
love with it
I'll be honest like the ability to star
specific issues is like huge for me I
gave up on the github notifications UI a
little while ago just cuz there's a lot
of stuff in there yeah I'm definitely
gonna check that out like the only like
it feature request that I've made to
them although like they responded like
super quick no like yeah there's way
harder than you think it is it is like
if someone raises the pull request
against when a repo say you'll get a
notification saying oh there's a new
pull request you think that's fine you
can
and you'll like deal with it and maybe
you'll approve it or what have you and
leave it once that pull request gets
merged and maybe it's like a fix or an
issue so the the issue will be closed
you'll suddenly get like two
notifications one will be for the issue
that's closed and the other one will be
the pull request that's merged and
there's a bit of meanness just like I
could also archive them if I knew that
that's what had happened right but it's
not surfaced anywhere but beyond that
this thing is like perfect for me I love
it
the other tool and they've recently
don't know what date is green keeper the
change that they've made is like it's
much more integrated with github now
like in terms of just being an app and
it is amazing so what green keeper does
is it manages with your NPM modules
right so if there's a new version it
will create a new PR that will basically
say here's the version like being pumped
for you okay I love it so now all you
have to do is you can just go through
the process configure it and it'll
basically sit there and give you all of
the repos that you want to label it for
so you can do it for all of them or just
a select few like I just hand-picked the
ones I know that I want to babysit so
how reliable is this in general so I've
been using this probably for about six
months to twelve months now like as well
as like their older version which is
just a slightly more fit Lea way of
setting it up but it's been immensely
helpful for me like I haven't had any
problems with it because all it's doing
is if you're going NPM is updated here's
a fork like the only thing I think is if
you don't have any tests I think it will
Auto approve the pull request unless
it's a major version bump in which case
they're like this is completely out of
your packages versioning that you're
gonna allow so therefore like we'll just
sit there say you need to approve this
or not because it's probably not cool so
when you say Auto approve does that mean
it will modify your repo directly itself
yes it will approve the pull request if
your test pass yes but the flip side is
what this is actually meaning is like
let's say you said install version 2.0
point oh and you allow any minor or
patch release to be approved users
already getting that okay so you're
you're still sort of in control yeah
chances are as well you could probably
configure it
- approved okay but like I said if my
tests are passing I'm actually like yeah
okay you can just bump that up it's good
that's kind of cool
I like it and the plus side is if it
fails it won't approve it at that point
you also know you have a problem and
then it's in my other box and then nice
and you what saying there was something
else oh there's so many like tools
around get there's like their source
tree there's tower back in the day I use
hub a lot hubs really nice because it'll
like save you having to you know type
out or even paste in the complete URL
for like a repo you can just like git
clone dot files or whatever have you
know like it'll know to clone name stop
files no shorten anything else that you
need to to clone and also lets you like
do things like browse the issues for the
current or posit wreath at your on do
all sorts of other fun things it's a
really nice like helper tool for thin
source maintainer z-- yeah nice it's
kind of like a setup like come online
utilities you can just get yeah nice
yeah and if folks are on the go when
they also want to check out like the
repos and their issues and diffs and
stuff like that
hussein der j released get points get
point Co which is like a react native
app lets you basically it's a it's a
github fewer for mmm nice Rio s so folks
can check that out this yeah I just
noticed that octave books does have a
mobile optimized version as well ah see
Tennessee is it on the coast you wanted
to fancy um but yeah I don't know I love
these that will like get hot tips and
tricks and random things to just make it
a bit easier for my workflow yeah so
what's your github workflow we'd like to
hear from you we'd likes they worried
about any other aliases or tools for
tricks that you've got yeah if we can
still have that be great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
