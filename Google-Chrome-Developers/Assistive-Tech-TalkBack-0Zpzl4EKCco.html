welcome back to the alley cat show today
I want to start kind of like a little
mini series as part of our playlist
where I go through and I look at
different kinds of assistive technology
so in my opinion like the whole goal of
accessibility is making sure that as
many people as possible can access the
content of your site or application
using the tools that make them feel the
most productive and so there's a lot of
different tools that people use in order
to access content on the web they could
use the keyboard and mouse they could
use just the keyboard they could use a
switch device like this fella over here
they could use a voice access right
there's a lot of things out there and as
a developer it can be really
overwhelming thinking like gosh how am I
going to support all of these different
tools and they're different input
methods so what I think is useful is to
first understand you know the full
breadth of tools that are available to
folks and then understand how they work
so you can see where their behaviors
overlap and then as a developer we kind
of target those overlapping spots and
that kind of maximizes our effort and
make sure we're getting as many people
in the door as possible so what we're
going to start with today is a mobile
screen reader so I've got my little
pixel phone right here I'll be using the
screen reader that comes on Android
which is called talkback if you have an
iPhone there is a similar screen reader
called voiceover that comes
pre-installed on those phones and what
I'm gonna show you today is just the
basics of navigating with talkback how
to access a page how to you know work
with some controls and things like that
if you're using voiceover a lot of this
stuff will be pretty similar but I also
want to do a like a later episode and
show you how do you specifically use
voiceover as well so follow me over here
to my phone and we'll get started all
right
so over here on our device the first
thing we're gonna do is go over to the
settings menu and we'll scroll down to
where it says accessibility and there's
a number of options here the first one
that I recommend you turn on is this
accessibility shortcut so if you click
on that make sure that's turned on and
make sure that the shortcut service is
set to talkback and what this does is it
lets you hold both of the volume buttons
down and that will turn on the screen
reader so it's really convenient you
don't have to go to the Settings menu
every time and then there's a lot of
other things inside of here so there
so you know text-to-speech there's
talkback itself which we can turn on
font size bunch of other cool things
we're just gonna use talkback today so
let's go ahead and turn that on and
you'll hear it started announcing the
second I turn this thing on so get ready
for that the first thing I always try to
figure out with any screen reader is
actually how to make it stop talking so
the trick there is once you are on a
piece of text it's announcing you can
just tap the screen again and that'll
tell talkback to to chill out so I'll
show you an example right very useful
for when you're debugging and you land
on a large block of text now as you may
have noticed as I'm kind of like
touching the screen this is a gesture
based UI so most most desktop screen
readers there's a number of keyboard
shortcuts that you can hit to move
around do special things on the phone
we're pretty limited here right all we
can really do is swipe and do different
gestures so in order to move around the
screen the nice thing is if you don't
know any of the gestures yet you can
actually just touch stuff and it's
called explore by touch and you can
touch anything on the screen that looks
like content and the screen reader will
just announce it for you so I'll show
you an example introduction how to use
polymer with over the lip right so
that's really nice if you're just not
familiar with any of the gestures yet
now the the main gesture for navigating
though is pretty straightforward it's
just a swipe to the right to move
forward and a swipe to the left to move
back most frameworks pretty
straightforward and then if you want to
scroll you use two fingers to do the
scrolling action
lastly the the thing you probably wanna
know most is how to click on something
so what I'm gonna do here is all I'll
just swipe down to an anchor and then
once that item is focused by the screen
reader we can double click it or double
tap the screen in order to click it
progress bar 21% it have webpack contra
polymer web pack loader stop there we go
so you see sometimes it gets a little
chatty and you gotta like click on
something on the screen just to just
quiet it down but yeah so we click the
link and we want to go back we can find
the back button 70% double tap that'll
take us back to where we were
so you might remember when we've used
voiceover the screen reader that comes
with the Mac we sometimes open up this
thing called the rotor which gives you
all sorts of like cool global commands
to like quickly jump around the page
we've got a similar thing here in the
screen reader and it requires some fancy
gestures so there's a global context
menu and a local context menu and I'll
show you both of those so the global
context menu you open it by doing kind
of like an l-shape and you gotta do it
really fast so it's a little tricky I
always have to use my thumb you do a
little L shape you see there's like a
number of things inside of here like
it'll read the last item you can jump to
the top of the page you can dim the
screen so some interesting stuff can get
to your talkback settings which is handy
but I tend to not use this menu that
often so I'll cancel the other one
though that's actually very useful is
the local context menu and that's like
drawing an upside-down el local context
menu showing items one to eight of eight
so what this lets us do is change the
navigation mode for talkback so for
instance if we want to navigate by
headings or we just want to navigate by
links we can do that from this menu so
let's change it and navigate just by
headings now the interesting thing is it
looks like nothing has really changed
here but if we start swiping left in and
right now it's gonna jump from heading
to heading how does it work step one
right now it can be a little annoying to
have to open that context menu every
time you want to change the navigation
modes so one sort of last little
power-user feature is you can actually
just swipe up or swipe down and it will
cycle through the different navigation
modes so if I wanted to navigate just by
links I could just swipe down links I've
created a tiny demo you right-click
webpack Duck Hub so you can see it's
just navigating through some of these
links with one in this iframe or if I
want I can swipe back up to go back to
headings or I can go all the way up and
go back to the default navigation mode
default right and now we're back to
navigating as we were before so it'll
trying out from like paragraphs to links
to major landmark regions and beasts
smart as it does so now because this is
a gesture based screenreader and because
we're working with a much smaller
viewport on the mobile device there are
some limitations and some you know kind
of non desirable behaviors that you will
see as you're navigating the mobile web
and I'm going to point some of those out
because they're really important for
developers to understand so over here
I've got kind of like your your classic
responsive website and I've got the
hamburger menu up here on the top left
we can click on that because I want you
to see the content that's off screen
right now so you can see here I've got a
bunch of links in my off screen menu
close and so what I want to do next is I
want to actually navigate the screen
reader and I want you to listen to what
is announced as I'm swiping menu it's
actually reading the off-screen content
there because all that stuff is still in
the Dom it's just not in the viewport
right now but the screen reader doesn't
really know that so it's just reading
through everything assuming that the
user should be able to access it right
now as a developer it's really important
for you to understand that because it
you might think oh well I've got a
smaller viewport I'll put modal windows
and other things off screen
but if you don't mark those as
display:none if you don't add ru hidden
and maybe add tabindex negative 1 to the
interactive controls then those those
items will actually still be accessible
to the user and you might not expect
that they can click on them in that
particular state so that's something to
definitely watch out for it's a good
reason to use the inert polyfill which I
can link to down in the show notes which
we've talked about in previous episodes
the other thing to keep an eye out for
our unique control types so I've got an
input type equals slider over here this
is the native one or sorry input type
equals range this is the native one and
I want you to listen to how the screen
reader announces it 50-50 slider out of
list use volume keys to adjust right so
it told me I can hit the up and down
volume keys you can see this here to
adjust it but let's say I create my own
slider using Aria so below I have this
div that says I'm slider it has role
equals slider on it
listen to you the way the screen reader
announces this 50% slider use volume
keys to adjust so you heard there the
phone instructed us to use the volume
keys to update the slider the problem is
if I hit the volume keys on this phone
those events will not be passed through
to my custom Aria slider that I've built
there's really no way for us to access
those events until we have something
like the accessibility object model
which I can link to down in the show
notes that's kind of an emerging
standard that we're working on part of
the accessibility object model will
actually let you access those cool
accessibility events but today without
access to them there's certain control
types
I really can't replicate that well on
mobile and this being one of them you
might think ah well I could use touch
start and touch in and I can implement
like a custom gesture or something like
that the problem there is that the
screenreader itself is a gesture based
UI and so any gesture that you do want
it will actually be intercepted by the
screen reader there is this notion of
like pass-through gestures so you can
actually like DoubleTap and long hold
the second press to do a gesture and
kind of drag around and that maybe could
work but you're sort of relying on the
fact that the user is a power user in
that case and it was like every feature
of their screen reader but it's not what
the screen reader instructed me to do
just then so I might not know to
actually do that instead of doing your
own gesture UI a suggestion from
developer Patrick Lau is that you could
actually just add plus and minus buttons
next to your slider because we know
clicking works so that way the user
could navigate to those an increment or
decrement that way so sometimes you have
to get a little creative right depending
on the control type that you're building
make sure you're testing it on mobile to
see if you can you know get the same
experience using a mobile screen reader
as you would with a desktop screen
reader so anyway yeah bad about covers
it for today that's the basics of using
talkback on your Android device I'm
gonna do a follow up on how to use
voiceover for your iPhone users out
there but if you have any questions you
can leave them for me below in the
comments or hit me up on a social
network of your choosing
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
