sitting through that Miami Vice opening
credit sequence that was fun so yeah my
name is Rob Dodson I am a developer
advocate here at the googles and work a
lot on web components work a lot on
polymer and today I just want to talk a
little bit about some of the goals
behind polymer cheeto and from there I
think we can then dive into like how
polymer geo actually works under the
hood so um you know as Taylor said in
his talk or the primary goal polymer to
do is to bring developers closer to the
platform and so what we mean by that is
that web components are just this
massive you know awesome powerful set of
specifications that are being
implemented in the browsers and shipping
natively today and so that means that
your users don't have to download the
code to make that machinery run right
it's just it's built-in right it's
already there in the browser and so we
think of web components is this really
massive thing and we think a polymer as
kind of a you know like a smaller piece
just sort of orbiting all of that we
tell developers we want to be use the
platform we really wanted to use web
components as much as possible
be like they're using the native api's
and then use polymer just sort of like
augment things where they need to or
they want you know a little bit of a
productivity boost I like to say the
polymer is just sort of an opinionated
usage of the web component standards it
is by no means the only way to do web
components there are other libraries out
there that that use web components and
they use them completely differently
from polymer and I think it's really
important to note that that web
components are very flexible set of
primitives so polymer is not the only
way to do web components it's just a way
to do web components and it's one that
we've come up with which we feel like
helps developers leverage as much of
that good built in platform as possible
so one of our primary goals aside from
getting people to use a platform or is
to do less magic right to remove things
like like polymer dom these sort of
weird leaky abstractions to simplify our
data binding system and ultimately just
to bring the the syntax of using custom
elements much closer to - just like the
native API and finally we
to make sure that we're bringing the
library size down right one make sure
that polymer gets smaller as as time
progresses and so that means shedding
abstractions using more of what's built
in the platform and and ultimately I
think that you know the way we achieve
all of these goals is just by doing less
and so if you look at the the web
component standards in general when
you're when you're working with them in
polymer we don't actually sugar
most of these api's we don't try and
sugar the way that shadow DOM or HTML
imports works we are just using them you
know directly natively the one exception
to this though is custom elements I feel
like custom elements is the area where
sort of like most of polymers features
are directed so these are going to be
the main focus of my talk because I
really think you need to understand how
custom elements work in order to
understand really what polymer to tato
brings to the table and and how it's
evolved from polymer 1.0 so let's talk
about the dom for a second because to
understand custom elements you really
got to understand the dom opportunity
that you're writing HTML just writing
some markup what you're actually doing
is creating instances of classes so
every HTML element inherits from a base
class that implements the HTML element
interface and then these subclasses get
additional properties and methods that
they expose on their own interfaces so
for instance when the parser sees an
input tag in your markup it says oh I
see an input here I'm going to create an
object that implements the HTML input
element interface and that object has
unique properties and methods right I
can do things with validation and and
with autocomplete the same is true when
it sees an image element right it's
going to create an object that
implements the HTML image element
interface that has a source property can
go out and fetch things for you
even a div which is like a just kind of
a boring tag or it doesn't really do
anything that interesting even it has
its own interface that it implements now
let's say you're trying to do something
like this so you're trying to build your
own kind of widget right so the parser
is going to see this thing that's gonna
be like uh I don't know just looks like
div to me you know so it just going to
create a div element with some image
elements inside of it right so at this
point what do we do
as the
it's like well I really want this thing
to be carousel I'm trying to build this
kind of specific widget so I'm going to
bolt on some JavaScript right and I
might I might turn it into a jQuery
plug-in or something like that I might
use vanilla JavaScript pass the element
to a constructor and that constructor is
going to wrap kind of like a JavaScript
membrane around those tags and kind of
like you know control them but really
what you're doing is you're just taking
a div and you're glomming some
JavaScript on to it and kind of acting
like it's puppet master right you're
trying to make it seem like it's a
carousel even though under the hood we
know it's really just a div and some
image elements and so when you think
about it this is like kind of a weird
way to program because as I said earlier
you know you've got this whole parser
behavior where the parser sees an input
tag and it creates an input element
class right this is whole system and we
as developers can't actually take part
in that you know that means that we've
got to sort of make these weird
JavaScript wrappers and that's just
really how it's always been done on the
web we've never really had a way to say
to the parser you know look when you see
this this input tab or sorry this
carousel tag down here create an
instance of this my carousel classroom
the class that I am defining now and
associate it with that tab right and so
fundamentally this is what custom
elements changes is what custom ellen's
give you just the ability to associate a
tag with a class and and partake in that
really cool parser behavior so it's a
very simple primitive but it's also very
very powerful it's very flexible what
you can do with it
now recently as Taylor mentioned custom
elements have moved from the v-0
specifications over to the v1 specs and
so the changes in the v1 specs were made
so that we could get all the browser's
onboard with the final look and feel of
custom elements and now that all the
browsers are happy and everyone is
either shipping them already or or
actively working on implementing custom
elements it's time for polymer to evolve
and take advantage of these specs as
well so that's what I'm going to be
focusing on for the rest of this talk I
want to talk about how you create v1
custom elements just using vanilla
JavaScript then as I'm doing that I'm
going to highlight some of the pain
points that you're going to encounter
just writing your own custom l
and lastly that's going to help us sort
of illustrate what polymer 2 gives you
and how it can make you just more
productive so let's like look at the
anatomy of a v1 custom element so start
off when you create any custom element
the first thing you do is you create a
class that extends from HTML element and
then you call window custom elements dot
define you pass it your tag name and
that class you want to associate it with
so from here on out you're telling the
parser hey anytime you see that tag
create an instance of this class right
once it's created that instance for you
it's going to start triggering the
lifecycle callbacks on it
lifecycle callback for when it first
there the first lifecycle callback that
it calls for element is going to be the
constructor so in v-0 custom elements
this was the created callback mv1 it's
now just like regular es6 class
constructor which i like i feel like
this is sort of more in line with the
way that classes just work in general so
I prefer that we've moved to this naming
first thing when I do inside of your
constructor is you always want to call
super this is especially important if
your custom ends another custom element
which we'll talk about a little bit
later and then the constructor is also a
great place to do things like set up
your event listeners create some initial
State and attach a shadow root if you
want but when you cannot do inside of
your constructor you cannot go
inspecting attributes or inspecting your
children or doing anything like that you
really don't want to be poking the Dom
at all inside of your constructor this
is actually a requirement of the v1
specs
I think it'll it'll throw if you if you
actually do go like poking at children
and this because they might not have
upgraded yet right so you want to defer
that work to the connected callback it's
going to be called every time your
element is inserted into the Dom so this
is a really good place to go out and
fetch resources if you need them to
render some initial UI there's also a
disconnected callback this is going to
be where you knew your cleanup work
right there's a new adopted callback
which this kiss friends every time your
element gets moved to like a new
document I'm assuming most of you will
never use this but I did want to include
it just for like completeness sake so if
you're computing something based on the
URL you get me
to a new document you might want to you
know do something in this callback but
let probably wanna use it that often and
finally there's the attribute change
callback and this one is pretty
important so this is run anytime and
after we on your element is changed in
some way so it's it's like a very
convenient mutation observer and in
custom elements B 0 this would run for
for any attribute change which could
actually be kind of noisy so in custom
elements b1 you're not have to
explicitly tell the browser which
attributes you would like to observe so
you do that by placing those attributes
in and observe attributes arrays so up
here I've got this selected attribute
that I put in my my observe attributes
array and that is the only attribute
that's gonna be able to trigger my
attribute change callback now a useful
thing to do with the attribute change
callback is to use it to synchronize
your attributes and properties so I
usually do this by defining a a setter
and getter pair on my class so let's say
I'm observing a selected attribute here
and I tell me as we change callback hey
anytime that attribute changes call a
setter with the corresponding attribute
name pass it that incoming value and I'm
going to find a set and get functions on
my class now if you're not used to
writing es6 classes a setter and getter
these are functions that are going to
run any time someone tries to assign to
the property or tries to retrieve the
value from the property so inside my
Center what I typically do is I do a
little dirty check to see if the values
are different if they are I will save
that value instead of like a stored
private variable and then I may also
reflect the change back to my element
itself by setting its attributes in the
Dom you don't have to do that that's
optional but you might do that if
someone is like like sending the
property in JavaScript and then you want
to like reflect that back to the Dom
maybe for styling or something like that
inside the getter I'm just going to
return the the selected value that I've
stored right crazy now a bit of like
personal style is something I like to do
you don't have to you this is something
I like to do by the way that's must be
an Ice Cube wearing sunglasses I asked
my teammate Monica what she thought that
was and she said ham so that is not ham
I'm not trying to be as I mean Heyman is
cool and everything but uh not trying to
be as cool as ham
anyway something I like to do I've been
inspired by the whole sort of
unidirectional data flow movement I
think it's pretty interesting so what I
like to do is I like to make sure that
all the state from my element can be
defined entirely by its properties I
think that you should be able to
describe your element at any point in
time based on its properties so for
instance doing something like this
should work and you should be able to
basically achieve sort of any
functionality and any rendered state or
any rendered UI of your component using
an approach like this where you're just
setting properties so this way
properties become like the source of
truth for your element this means I also
try to avoid methods that change my
elements state especially if they don't
reflect that back to properties and the
reason is because I feel like these
methods tend to duplicate functionality
that can already get out of my
properties and have my setter functions
and also because you know having a bunch
of methods on your element can
oftentimes require a bunch of like
imperative setup steps in order to get
it to like a particular state and that
can be very difficult to replicate if
you're using your element inside of like
a framework you know something like
react for instance so for example if
you're building a dialog
it could be tempting to say okay the
only way that you can open this dialog
is with this open method that's the only
way you can get the thing to open right
and I would say don't do that I would
say instead give it an opened property
and have the underlying setter for that
property handle rendering the new UI for
the dialog again I think that this sort
of simplifies your code you don't end up
with weird methods called like toggle
who's like sole jobs just to like toggle
properties back and forth I've totally
written a check box was like a toggle
method and realized I can just get rid
of this and just use a check property
and it also makes it so your element can
play nicer with those sort of top-down
unidirectional dataflow frameworks again
that's just like personal style is
something I like to do you absolutely do
not have to listen to me but it's just
something I want to do include in this
talk because I think it's perhaps a good
and useful approach now before I went
off on that whole tangent I was talking
about keeping attributes and properties
in sync
using that attribute change callback and
looking at the code for all of this you
might think okay that's cool and all but
that's actually like
a lot of code just for keeping one
attribute and property in sync you know
it's going to be a lot of work to do
that if I have many many many properties
on my element and so this is an area
where I feel like we've hit a bit of a
pain point and a place where perhaps we
could add a good abstraction to help us
out and make us more productive I want
to continue on the subject of data flows
I've already sort of like broached it
for any custom element we like to say
you get data in using attributes and
properties right
if you data out you're going to use
regular Dom events so if I were building
a custom checkbox
I might start off by extending HTML
element in my class in my connected
callback I could add an event listener
for the click event have an onclick
handler inside of that handler I might
set the the check property you know may
have got a setter somewhere that's going
to update my UI and then I'm going to
just dispatch a custom event that that
contains the state for my check value
pay attention to this because this is
also how you dispatch events in polymer
judo right so in polymer one we had this
thing called a fire the stop fire are
you used to dispatch events and you know
as I said earlier we want to remove
abstractions where we don't need them
where the platform is already providing
like something that totally works
so I'm Homer - we got rid of this dot
fire you're going to use the regular
dispatch event because that's the
platform right and we should leverage it
as much as possible another bit of cool
ham personal style here I like to
dispatch events for like every state
change for any sort of like property or
anything like that
and again the reason is because I think
it lets unidirectional frameworks revert
that change if it does not match their
own internal model so we can just dumped
a lien those systems a bit easier so for
instance the way that a library like
react works with a native checkbox is it
listens for its change event if that
does not match its internal model it'll
revert that change on the checkbox so
I'm gonna make sure if I'm building a
checkbox that that same system will work
again personal style that's just how I
do things you absolutely don't have to
listen to me there but that's just
something I think could be helpful now
okay
data goes in the attributes and
properties stages coming out the events
there is
slight mismatch here though particularly
around attributes and properties
specifically attributes properties right
we can use those to pass any value we
want to an element so we can we can you
know imperative ly assign to an element
an array or an object or even a function
right but attributes we can only pass
string values okay and so this can
become a bit of an issue for folks
depending on how you're constructing
your elements if all your building are
leaf elements like simple UI components
like a button or a drop down or
something like that this is probably
fine it's not a big deal okay if you
think about most of the HTML elements
that you use every day they're
essentially all leaf elements so you can
figure them just with strings and their
attributes so for example if I'm going
to drop-down element myself that it's
selected attribute is a string that's
fine no big deal that's how HTML works
another option is you know if I need to
give it a data it can also perhaps come
through the children so the video
element has source elements as children
so you can pass it multiple sources and
it'll figure out based on you know the
environment it's in which of those
sources to use and so you know you can
maybe do the same thing with a leaf
element but this is a problem if you're
trying to build your entire application
out of custom elements that they're just
basically you know there's no
declarative way to pass complex data in
HTML right so this feels like
potentially another pain point this is
something where we could use an
abstraction to make this more productive
for us and kind of like a meta point
because I've like had conversations with
people on Twitter about this I don't
think that this is something that custom
elements or web components needs to
solve
I think custom element has a very
discrete responsibility associated tag
with a class right but I do feel like
this is maybe a sort of a separate
missing feature in the platform it's
something that I would be really really
interested to see if we could ever you
know possibly standardize or turn into
something that but everyone can do but
today we have abstractions we have
libraries to work around this so yeah
anyway I'll get off my soapbox on that
the last thing I wanna talk about is
rendering right so I've got my my custom
element set up how do i render some of
its UI so let's say i'm building a
simple clock element
right and inside of this thing I just
got a template here that I'm assigning
using innerhtml right and Inter HTML it
can be a little weird if you a little
gross so maybe a nicer thing to do would
be to go fetch a template element that
already has some dominant you know clone
that strap that into my element and I
can stamp that into the light Dom or I
could pop it into shadow dome either way
right I'm going to switch back though to
this inner HTML example just so you can
see what I'm trying to work on now again
the I'm building a clock so really the
only thing I want to do is like put some
some text in that span I want to put the
current time in that span so the whole
focus of this element and so to do that
I'll define a setter for my time value
and then look at the code inside of that
setter so what I'm doing is I'm I'm
querying for that span I'm setting its
text content property to whatever the
new value is that just came in whatever
the new time is as you can imagine with
a large element a lot of Dom a lot of
setters a lot of properties that could
become very tedious and very repetitive
right you can end up with a lot of
boilerplate in our element we're just
sort of repeating ourselves we're
creating the Dom or updating the Dom all
over the place so to me this feels like
an another pain point and possibly
another good place to add an abstraction
so we use custom elements we did some
cool stuff but we also hit upon some
pain points and it's because custom
elements are a purposefully low-level
API they're not they're not trying to
solve everything for us and so there are
some places where you know things could
get a little tedious and we might need
to add an abstraction right so let's
look at how we can use polymer to do -
to solve some of those issues again a
big goal of polymer to do so make
developers feel like they're using the
platform as much as possible to bring
them as close to the platform as
possible and so that means removing
magic making it really clear that you're
basically most of the time just
interacting with native api's so where I
was originally extending HTML element
when I created this class now I'm going
to extend polymer element okay so what's
polymer element like what is inside that
thing well polymer element really is
just a collection
mix-ins that extend and add
functionality to HTML element and so if
you want to actually even deconstruct it
a little bit let's say I just want to
use one feature a polymer I don't want
to include the whole library I just want
one piece maybe I just want polymers
templates stamping ability maybe I think
that's nice right so instead of
extending polymer element I could just
add one mix in to HTML element itself
and that is what my element would be
based on that exposes then this stamp
stamp template method that I can pass a
template it will give me back some Dom
and I can choose what to do with that
done I can put it in light Dom I put it
in shadow Dom the Dom also supports
declarative event listeners which is
kind of a handy feature of polymer and
so ultimately that means that you can
use all a polymer or you could just use
a feature a polymer if you would like
you know to enhance a vanilla custom
element which i think is pretty cool so
this is still a little experimental but
this is kind of the direction we went
ahead with these things so yeah polymer
element just a collection of mix-ins an
extend HTML element now another thing
you might want to do is extend another
custom element and so I'm really happy
to say that in Palmer to dotto you can
once again extend custom elements we had
this back and I think polymer 0-5 we
took it out for awhile but it's back in
polymer 2 so you can absolutely extend
other custom elements and to do that
your class just extends that elements
class instead of extending you know
instead of your class extending polymer
element directly so pretty easy right
and when you do this you want to make
sure that you're calling super and all
those lifecycle callbacks so super in
your constructor super connected
callback things like that so that that
parent element runs all of its setup
code as well ok so you have your base
class setup it's time to do some
configuration start by extending polymer
element and then add a static is
function there and that's going to
contain your element name this static is
function is really important for polymer
it's how it actually finds your template
later which we'll talk about in just a
sec the reason we use a static function
for this is because Essex classes don't
support class properties you've got to
do that via a function a static function
so we're just you know dovetailing into
the standard there you want to call a
custom elements dr. fine give it your
element name or the tag name and your
class as well polymer is not going to be
doing this for you you've got
explicitly register your element again
using you know making sure you you know
that you're using the platform such as
possible and then you add a config
object to it and this is where you set
up your properties and your observers so
this is really similar to polymer one
dot o like just to expand this really
quickly you can see that it looks pretty
much the exact same you have your
properties object in there where you
define properties observers array right
just like polymer one and after that you
add your lifecycle callbacks and your
you're off to the races
so it doesn't look that different from a
vanilla custom element and it also
doesn't look that different from polymer
one it's kind of like a hybrid of the
two which I really like right we want to
make sure that you feel like you are
working with the native API as much as
possible we can also tackle some of
these pain points now right so let me go
through a little demonstration here I
know the code is a little small for the
people in in back but don't worry we're
going to we're going to kind of scrunch
this down and make the font bigger as we
add more polymer and this is a custom
element that I was working on before
this is my my fancy clock thing and you
know remember all it does is I'm trying
to get a time value in that span right
there right so I'm going to take this
vanilla custom element migrate it to
polymer two along the way that's going
to help highlight some of polymers
features and also you know I can
demonstrate and sort of tell you how
those features work under the hood okay
so I'm going to start by instead of
extending HTML element I'm gonna extend
polymer element right so far so good and
then all this code that I've highlighted
here this is all just to keep my time
attribute and property in sync
my observed attributes array my
attribute call back my cetera right all
that code is to keep that attribute
property in sync so I think I can
actually get rid of that just by using
the config object and a properties block
and adding a time property there right
so that's eliminated all that code
polymer is now going to handle keeping
my attribute and property in sync so you
might be wondering like well okay that's
cool but like how did that replace all
of that code like what is that actually
doing okay and so under the hood when
you define a property what polymer does
is it just secretly creates the setter
for you and it listens for changes in
the attribute change callback the code
that polymer uses is really similar to
the code that I already had to find
there when a new value comes into that
Center it dirty checks the value
you know if the dirty check passes it
saves the value and then it updates any
nodes in the Dom that that need to have
that value poked into them that's
basically it so I feel like this
actually takes care of our first pain
point polymer is just going to handle
you know synchronizing our attributes
and properties so don't have to deal
with that which is nice now looking back
in the code the next thing I want to do
is I'm going to clean up this inner HTML
right here because it's a little funky
having that in my element not not in
love with that so to do that I'm going
to wrap everything on a Dom module and
my Dom module has to have an ID that
matches my my tag names is property and
my elements is property and this is so
if you run your your element through
like build tool that that strips out
your JavaScript and your HTML and
separates them and move them far apart
and dump some in a bundle or something
it's so polymer can trace it steps back
and find your template and associate
with your elements so that's why we have
the is property and the ID on the Dom
module matching next I'm just going to
drop a template inside of here right so
got my template up there nice now a
polymer is going to do is when it sees
that template it's just going to take
the first template it sees and doll
module and pop that into your shadow Dom
so that's really handy I don't have to
write any of that imperative code myself
to like manually set up the Dom and
render my UI or anything so I feel like
that takes care of that pain point about
having like a lot of boilerplate to set
up my element unless you want to do is
update the UI whenever my time property
is updated right whenever that value
changes I want I want what the Dom to
render so I'm just going to drop in a
data binding right and I want to briefly
explain how polymers data binding system
works under the hood because I think
it's kind of interesting so in a
nutshell when you create a data binding
in polymer what is actually happening is
polymer is just sort of like finding
that element and and poking that
property into it so it means if you've
got something like this right where
you've got a span little binding inside
from text content polymer is just going
to take a reference to that span and
literally set its text content equal to
the value that you're updating right and
because we're using properties this
works for any value type so we can
declaratively say i've got the springs
element it's got a friends attribute
that takes an array I can declaratively
say all right I'm going to pass it the
springs array under the hood polymer is
just going to say all right cool so I'm
signe friends disarray right appreciate
forward now all this work happens inside
of the property setter that polymer is
secretly created for us when it
generated or when we put our time
property in that properties block so if
we were to like peek like kind of under
the hood and look at what that that that
setter is doing so this is sort of it's
gonna be kind of like pseudocode is
essentially what polymer is doing under
the hood so here's my center for that
Bryn's array a new value comes in and
the first thing it does is it does a
dirty check on that value it's like
alright is this different from what I
had before
if that dirty check passes it's going to
store the new value cool then it's going
to loop through an array of objects that
just contain all of our bindings so
there's literally objects in an array
that have references to all the
different nodes and and it's going to
loop through that and say okay got this
new property I'm going to poke it into
all these different notes and and really
that's just how the one-way binding
system works this is also how your
observers get called so inside that set
our setter is just going to call your
observer functions and pass it the new
value and if you've done a two-way
binding you've used that notify true
flag is just going to dispatch a change
event and elsewhere someone's listening
for that changement and that's actually
how the do way binding system works so
it's actually really simple when you see
what's going on under the hood so this
is sort of like the hub of the element
the setter is really important now I
have a question for you all in the
audience which is if I mutate my data so
I push a new value into that array is
that going to call the setter show of
hands if you think about oh okay good
Smarties in here awesome all right so no
Wright is not going to call the Senate
the only way to call that setter is
going to be to directly assign something
to that property and so in polymer 1 we
had methods like notify path and this
dot set which basically you sort of poke
the data buying system so after you
mutated an array or you mutated a sub
property on object you had to sort of
tell a polymer like hey go go update
please please you can still use these
methods in polymer 2 if you'd like
they're still there and you can use them
if you want to you know very
specifically tell the binding system to
update one spot as like a performance
optimization
but we also just made it easier to work
with with objects and arrays and polymer
so if you're mutating an array and you
like to tell polymers binding system
like please go update you can either
assign the array or assign the object
back to itself this would actually work
so you can do this in polymer 2 and a
polymer is just going to bypass a dirty
check for arrays or objects if you do
something like this and we'll just go
update all your bindings that rely on
that or if you're into the whole
immutable data thing you could call this
data break and cat you pass it a copy of
your array or you know something similar
with your object well we can just call
this is new you can just call this dot
set and just pass it the object name
that'll just tell it to go update all
the bindings that rely on that object so
you not just specifically tell it like
the sub thing sub property to change or
anything like that right so ultimately
the buying system now is a little bit
more streamlined a bit easier to use so
I know that was frustrating for a lot of
folks so looking at this final element I
think we've achieved sort of the same
level of functionality as the one that
we started off with but there is a lot
less code now it's much easier to reason
about and I feel like we've solved kind
of our last pain point there as well you
know the binding system gives us a nice
declarative way to pass complex data
just great now to wrap up I just want to
say if you're looking at this and you're
familiar with polymer one it probably
doesn't seem that different right and
that's really the idea we really want
our primary goal of polymer 2 is an
incremental change that brings
developers closer to the platform so if
you have an easy on-ramp for our polymer
1.0 users also making it very clear to
people that what they're actually using
is the native web platform and so with
this release I feel like you know we're
giving developers much more productive
experience with polymer we got less
magic and an overall much smaller
footprint so if you wanna get some
practice with this we have a code lab
area our engineer Keano has written a
code lab on building your first polymer
2 element it goes like more in depth
than I've gone in this talk so
definitely go check that out
and with that said I hope that you all
enjoy the rest of your time here at
polymer summit and I am super excited to
see what you build with polymer team
Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
