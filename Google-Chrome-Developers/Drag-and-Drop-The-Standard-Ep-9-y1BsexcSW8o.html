series about solving web problems with
standards these tips are part of the
platform and work with any framework old
library please a quick tip let's go
today I'm going to upload a file
let's drag here
that wasn't what I meant let's upload
the file in the standard way as we saw
if you drag a file onto a browser by
default it will open the file replacing
the site you had open if your site deals
with files in any way your users might
actually get confused
to prevent this default behavior ad
handle is for the drag over and drop
events both handles just need to call
prevent default and presto dropping
files on your page does nothing of
course you probably do want to do
something so we want to expand on the
drop event handle off if you have an
existing HTML form containing a file
upload element one simple option is to
place the users file there too later to
upload when the user hits submit this
even works if the form element is hidden
but if you want to upload the files
immediately another option would be to
grab the files directly with JavaScript
in this example we choose just the
images and then upload them to our
back-end in parallel not waiting for a
traditional form submission it's worth
noting that it's actually possible to
add these handlers to any element in
your page but my preference is to add it
to the HTML tag you know so the whole
page can be your drop target drag and
drop isn't just about uploading files
you know you can drag text UI elements
really anything from your computer and
my longer article will give you an
in-depth explanation on a variety of
different use cases remember use drag
over and drop to override the browser's
default behavior and for simplicity use
the whole page as a drop target that was
drag and drop the standard way see you
on the next tip how many goals
remember dragon dog isn't just about
sudden so you know you've got good
ethics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
