I am a software engineer on the chrome
security team and today I would like to
take you on a myth-busting journey about
the protocol that we use to send and
receive data on the web over a secure
connection and that's HTTPS and I think
this is one of the most important topics
for a web developer today so our journey
begins in 2010 or thereabout imagine
you're sitting at your computer surfing
the web watching the hamster dance or
whatever whatever people did in 2010 and
you fall into a deep sleep so deep that
you don't wake up until today in 2016
and you look around at the web today and
it's pretty different from when you fell
asleep in 2010 right today we have
things like Add to Home screen which
lets websites behave more like apps push
notifications keeping your users engaged
coming back to new content and cool new
api's like device orientation
geolocation all these things you've been
hearing about at i/o today that let you
build progressive web apps and let web
sites do things they never could have
done before in the past things they they
really couldn't have done in 2010 when
you fell into your deep sleep so these
are all very powerful features for
websites to have but there are also a
lot of responsibilities right like take
take geolocation for example the
geolocation API if a website can access
my location then the website knows where
I live where I work when I'm home when
I'm away where I shop where my friends
live where my doctor is it's a lot of
information for a website to know about
me right so if you woke up to this web
in 2016 this very powerful web
you might be surprised to find that
there are still websites where you can
make a purchase with your credit card or
send a private message to a friend or
research a personal health condition in
such a way that an attacker
eavesdropping on the network can see all
the data that you're sending back and
forth or you might be surprised to find
that there are still websites that spend
tons of money and time and energy
crafting the perfect user experience
only to deliver that experience to the
user and have an ISP or a Wi-Fi provider
or some other intermediary on the
network injecting obnoxious ads like
this and this isn't hypothetical we see
major ISPs injecting ads or other
content all the time and if this was
your website you'd be pretty upset right
because this interferes with that
perfect user experience it might mess
with your revenue streams by covering up
your own legitimate ads and at worst it
might even trick your users into
downloading and installing malware onto
their computers so if you woke up in
2016 you might hope to wake up to a web
where data is protected from this kind
of snooping and tampering from the very
beginning and that's what we get from
HTTPS that's what this green lock
signifies and in 2016 we're hoping to
move towards a web where this green lock
is so ubiquitous that we might not even
need to show it at all
because it's just the default that users
have come to expect as the bare minimum
in terms of security for any site on the
web today this green lock signifies
three main security properties identity
when you type HTTPS google.com into your
browser your browser receives a
cryptographic proof of identity
call the certificate from the server and
the browser uses that certificate to
prove that it's talking to the real
google.com not some other server who's
pretending to be google.com so when you
type a URL in your address bar the
browser gets a proof that that's the
real real domain that you're talking to
confidentiality once your browser knows
that you're talking to the real
google.com both those parties the
browser and the server have a guarantee
that only they can read the data that's
being passed between them not any
attacker eavesdropping on the network
and finally integrity the browser and
the server have a guarantee under HTTPS
that when they send data from one to the
other the data they send is what the
other party receives so an intermediary
on the network can't modify or tamper
with the data that's being sent only the
browser in the server can so these are
the three security properties that we
get from HTTPS in your mind you might
have some other associations when you
see this green lock you might think that
it represents a financial burden or a
performance or maintenance cost and many
of these associations were true five or
ten or fifteen years ago but many of
them are no longer true today so in this
top what I'm going to do is tell you
five stories about HTTPS and try to
separate fact from fiction show you what
might have been true in the past that is
now becoming a bit of a myth to try to
convince you that HTTPS is possible and
important for every site on the web
today my first story is about a web
developer named Alice Alice runs an
online travel guide
and it's a very cool Travel Guide but it
doesn't have any privacy or security
sensitive content it doesn't have any
login forms or credit card forms or
anything like that so Alice doesn't
really think of her site as something
that needs HTTPS but one day Alice is
talking to her friend and her friend
says that on her computer Alice's travel
guide is really slow and sluggish and
Alice is like okay that's weird because
on my computer it's really fast and
snappy and responsive that's the way I
built it to be so she goes over to her
friend's house and checks out what's
going on and you can probably guess that
what's going on is that on Alice's
friend's computer a whole bunch of ugly
sluggish abs are being injected into
Alice's site so it ruins that that the
user experience that Alice has built
covers up her own light weight on
obtrusive ads and I just want to drive
this home point this point home Alice's
friend trust Alice's site so when she
clicked on one of these these ads she
didn't expect to download the malware
that infected her computer and that's
natural right if you're an average user
you click an ad on someone's site you
get malware on your computer you're
gonna blame that site so Alice is bummed
out about this as you would be I'm sure
so to console herself she goes off and
starts working on a new feature and this
new feature say it uses the geolocation
API to figure out where the user is and
then give them localized travel tips but
as she's working on this feature she
goes to try it out in Chrome and she
sees that it doesn't work the reason it
doesn't work as you can see in this
error message in the developer console
is that chrome and other browsers are
starting to remove access to powerful
API s and other web platform features
when they can't be safely used over non
secure HTTP so in order to use the
geolocation API your site needs to use
HTTPS
and there's a good reason for this right
if I'm if I'm going to trust Alice's
site with my location I need to know
that I'm talking to the actual Alice's
Travel Guide not just some other site
pretending to be Alice's Travel Guide so
we need that identity property of HTTPS
to be sure that when I as a user grant a
site access to my location I'm actually
talking to the site that I'd trust with
my location chrome and other browsers as
I said are not limiting this to
geolocation there's a list of features
that have already been removed over when
when accessed over plain HTTP which is
non secure and there are a few more that
covered that are coming down the
pipeline
Alice realizes after all this that in
order to build a progressive web app
with the user experience that she wants
and in order to do it safely and
guarantee that the user experience that
she builds is the one that her users
receive she needs to use HTTPS and
that's why we think that HTTPS is
important for every site on the web
today even if on the face of it it
doesn't look privacy or security
sensitive my next story is about a
data-driven guy named Bob bob has an
e-commerce site let's say and bob has
done some testing and some optimizing
and some a/b tests and he's found that
reducing latency reducing the time that
it takes a user to load a page on his
site is crucial for optimizing
conversions so the faster his page loads
the more sales he makes and bob has
heard some not so nice things about
HTTPS and performance yell comm is an
online business directory that recently
made the switch to HTTPS and they
admirably documented their experience
some of it positive it and some of it
negative
and what was really interesting to see
is that they saw a performance impact
from moving to HTTPS whereas Google Way
back in 2010 was able to migrate to
HTTPS migrate all of Gmail to HTTPS
we're the pretty negligible performance
impact so Bob is seeing these these two
things in doing his research and he's
wondering what's going on where is this
discrepancy come from so let's dig into
what happens when the browser sends an
HTTP request to see what's going on here
and what Bob can do and what you can do
to minimize the performance impact so
I'm focusing here on the network latency
introduced by adding HTTPS there are
some other performance costs so do you
associated with HTTPS but this is far a
far away what people tend to run into
problems with the network latency the
extra round trips so once Bob turns on
HTTPS on his site the first thing that's
gonna happen is that a whole bunch of
his users are going to start having to
take redirects to get to his site so for
example if a user has a link a bookmark
to the HTTP version of Bob site or if a
user follows a link to the HTTP version
of Bob site Bob is going to have to
redirect them to the HTTPS version so
right off the bat that's a little bit of
an overhead that we wouldn't have had if
we were just sticking to http next the
browser has to go and actually speak
HTTP and what's involved here is setting
up a TLS connection TLS is the
underlying protocol used to set up a
secure connection for HTTPS these two
round-trips here are the two round-trips
that are part of the TLS handshake with
the browser and the server do to set up
a TLS connection and this is a bit of a
simplified version but the overall idea
is that the client says hi I want to
cos and the server says hi I can speak
to us and then sends its certificate
which is that cryptographic proof of
identity the client validates the
certificate makes sure everything looks
okay
they agree on some cryptographic
parameters and then the client says ok
I'm done I'm ready to start speaking TLS
and the server says yeah me too let's
speak TLS and then the browser can
actually go ahead and send the HTTP
request so these are the two round-trips
that are needed to set up a TLS
connection before the browser can
actually send the HTTP request over this
secure connection so let's take this one
by one and see what we can do to
optimize here first this HTTP to HTTPS
redirect the web platform has a feature
called strict Transport Security that
you can use to remove this redirect for
many of your users in most cases so
strict Transport Security is an HTTP
header that you can set on responses
that tells browsers I always want my
site to be accessed over HTTPS whenever
the browser sees this header on your
site it'll remember for the period of
time that you configure that your site
should be accessed over HTTPS and that
means whenever the browser is about to
follow a link to the HTTP version of
your site it'll automatically internally
rewrite this link to HTTPS and go
straight there so after the user has
seen this header once they're not gonna
have to take that HTTP to HTTPS redirect
until the header expires but an
important caveat is that when you set
this header you're committing to
supporting HTTPS for that period of time
so this is not something you want to do
while you're testing HTTPS it might not
even be something you want to do until
you're comfortable running and
maintaining HTTPS but once you're there
you can set this header to remove that
HTTP to HTTPS redirect for many of your
users next let's look at the TLS
handshake these two round-trips there
are two TLS configuration options that
you can set if your server supports them
to remove a roundtrip here in many cases
the first optimization arises from the
fact that by default the client waits
until this entire handshake is finished
in order to send the HTTP request but it
turns out that in many cases it's
actually just fine for the client to
send this HTTP request alongside at the
end of the handshake so instead of
waiting for the whole to roundtrip
handshake to complete the client can
kind of stuff the HTTP request in there
before everything is all done and that
means the server can start processing it
without waiting for these two
round-trips to complete and this is
called TLS false start and it's
something you can turn on in your server
configuration if your server supports it
and when the client supports it also
that removes a round-trip from the
handshake latency the next optimization
that you can turn on it's pretty
straightforward conceptually if the
browser and the server have spoken TLS
to each other in the past the browser
can remember a session identifier and
the next time it goes in sets of TLS
connection with the server it can say
hey I have a session identifier we don't
need to do this whole handshake dance
again let's do the bare minimum work we
can to set up a TLS connection and it
turns out that the bare minimum work
involves shaving off a round-trip and
this is called TLS session resumption as
you might imagine and if your server
supports that you should turn it on just
to to illustrate the effect here a
little bit if you go and load google.com
and look at all the
quests that are sent to google.com in
Chrome's developer tools in a common
case only the first one of these would
impose that full two round-trip TLS
handshake and subsequent requests would
be able to reuse the session identifier
to avoid a round-trip all right that was
a lot of work we're finally ready to
send the HTTP request and this is where
things get cool because this is we're
using HTTPS unlocks some pretty dramatic
performance improvements primarily in
the form of HTTP to the next version of
HTTP which is now supported in many
browsers including Chrome and Firefox so
I'm gonna describe some of the
performance wins that you get from HTTP
two and then I'll come back and talk a
little bit more about its connection to
HTTPS and why the two are kind of linked
together in HTTP 1 traditional HTTP
requests and response are kind of sent
in order in the common case the browser
sends a request which for a response
sends another request waits for the
response and so on this means that if
the server takes a while to produce that
first response the client is going to be
waiting a while before it even sends the
second request and the second the second
response is going to be delayed by that
much also in HTTP to multiple requests
and responses can be multiplexed over
the same connection what this means is
that the browser can for example send a
request before even waiting for the
response the browser can send a second
request that it knows what's going to
have to send the server can start
processing the first request maybe even
send part of the first response but then
has to say wait on a slow remote API
call
database call so while it's waiting for
that to happen it can start processing
the second request send the second
response then when it when it when that
database call returns it can finish the
the first response so this means
multiple requests in response can be
interleaved on the same connection which
has much improved Network performance
properties another cool HTTP to feature
is pretty intuitive normally in
traditional HTTP the browser requests
the home page then parses the HTML and
says oh now I need the stylesheet and
the scripts and the images all that
stuff that's referenced from the HTML
but in HTTP to the server can say oh you
just fetched the home page I know that
as soon as you get around to parsing
that HTML you're gonna need a bunch of
scripts and stylesheets and other stuff
also so I'm going to proactively push
those resources to you and the client
can keep them in its cache so that it
doesn't have to go over the network to
fetch them when it actually needs them
now I said that HTTPS unlocks the
massive performance winds of HTTP - what
I mean by that is that browsers have
said they are only going to support HTTP
- over HTTP if you want to use HTTP -
you have to use HTTP and there's two
reasons for this one is that it provides
an incentive to move to HTTPS because we
cruel browser vendors think that HTTPS
is the best thing for the ecosystem and
everyone should be using it so we want
to provide incentives to make the switch
there's also a practical reason of
compatibility and what that means is
that there are proxies and
intermediaries out there that get kind
of confused when they see HTTP - traffic
because HTTP - looks pretty different
from normal HTTP 1 traffic and those
proxies and intermediaries get confused
and in some cases even break things so
we need that confidentiality and
integrity guarantee of HTTPS
to be able to support http/2 without
breaking things if we go back to yell
calm that online business directory that
Bob read about and was was unhappy to
see that they had some performance
impacts from moving to HTTPS it turns
out that there are negative performance
impacts were mostly due to their use of
some outdated load balancing software
it's that they weren't in a position
where they could update before making
the switch to HTTPS but what they have
on their future roadmap is updating that
software so that they can turn on more
of these optimizations and especially so
they can enable HTTP 2 and we have hope
for Yael calm because of stories like
whether comm who saw a small performance
impact from moving to HTTPS but then it
was blown out of the water by the
performance winds that they got by
subsequently turning on HTTP 2 in the
end since bob is in a position where he
can update his server software and where
he can turn on some of these
optimizations and technologies he
shouldn't see any negative performance
impact from moving to HTTPS and if he
does he should be able to outweigh it by
turning on HTTP 2 all right how about a
slightly different kind of story now
this is a story about not a web
developer but an evil person named Eve
and Eve is a little short on cash and
also pretty tech savvy so when Eva needs
some fast money she goes online and she
searches around for the latest HTTPS
vulnerabilities and she picks the one
with the fanciest logo and she runs an
automated tool to find vulnerable sites
on the Internet and then she carries out
one of these attacks against that site
to harvest sensitive information like
passwords or credit card numbers that
she can turn in
cold hard cash this is pretty true HTTP
research is really hot these days there
are hot new techniques like formal
verification that mean bugs are coming
out at a pretty fast clip and it's
increasingly common for security
researchers to make their attacks more
practical than theoretical by writing
tools that scan for vulnerable hosts on
the internet and by building proof of
concepts that demonstrate the video tax
are practical in some cases so I want to
emphasize here after I've shown you all
these scary attacks that the existence
of these attacks makes HTTP kind of like
a life jacket with some minor defects
that come into play in certain cases
under certain conditions but using HTTP
is like no life jacket at all so it's in
most cases when you look at most of
these attacks it's far better to use
HTTPS despite the existence of these
attacks because if Eve wants to attack
an HTTP site she doesn't even need to
try it's trivial that's said I'm not
telling you that you shouldn't worry at
all about these you should use the tools
and support that are out there to keep
your server and configuration up-to-date
SSL labs is a scanning tool where you
can type in the address of your site and
it will scan your server give you a
grade and tell you what configuration
tweaks you should make to avoid becoming
vulnerable to new attacks
similarly the mozilla SSL configuration
generator takes a few parameters about
your server and then it spits out the
configuration that you should be using
that adheres to best practices so that
you don't have to worry about picking
cryptic cryptographic algorithms or key
strengths or anything like that it'll
tell you what best practices are to keep
your
server and your users safe attacks
always get better and I'm betting that
there will be many more HTTPS attacks in
the next few years but it's still better
to wear your life jacket even with a few
minor defects and there are great tools
out there some of which didn't exist
five or ten years ago to help you keep
your site safe from evil Eve how many of
you work at startups cool all right
charlie in my in my next story two years
ago he had a great idea for a startup he
decided that he wanted to build a site
where you can send chat messages to your
friends on the internet and he raised
twenty million dollars in venture
capital funding for him but these days
Charlie's kind of running out of money
and the VC market has gotten a little
tighter so he needs to make sure that
every dollar that he's spending before
he needs to raise his next round is
going to a good cause and he's heard
that HTTPS cost money maybe money that
he can't afford now money is sort of a
part of all of these stories in one way
or another I talked about performance
which ultimately kind of boils down to
money in my last story I'm going to talk
about ads which is also very closely
tied to money so in this story I'm just
gonna talk about two aspects of the
financial parts of HTTP that Charlie's
especially worried about first these
cryptographic proofs of identity that I
keep talking about certificates when you
need to go get a certificate
traditionally you buy it from an
organization called a certificate
authority you prove your identity that
the certificate authority and it gives
you a certificate that you can use to
prove your identity to browsers you
might wonder how much these certificate
things cost and while it's certainly
possible to pay a lot of money for
certificates you don't
to a project called SSL mate has for
many years now been offering
certificates starting at 15 bucks a pop
so even if you need multiple
certificates even if you need one of
their fancier options it shouldn't break
the bank
a newer project called let's encrypt
offers free certificates and both of
these projects SSL made and let's
encrypt in addition to having free or
very affordable certificates they also
offer automated command-line tools that
help you buy and manage your
certificates automatically so that they
don't expire or other certificate
management tasks like that so
certificates are not going to be the
reason that Charlie's startup runs out
of money the other thing that Charlie is
worried about is search ranking so you
can imagine that if you move your site
over to HTTPS search engines might get
confused and you might lose search
ranking because a traditional nugget of
wisdom is that having two different
versions of your site can have a
negative impact on search ranking Google
in particular has a few best practices
that you should follow when moving your
site and here I'm showing the basics
when charlie turns on HTTPS for his site
the first thing he wants to do is serve
301 redirects to tell us search engines
that his site is over at the HTTPS
version now and once the search engine
crawlers gets to the HTTPS version of
his sale it's important to serve a
canonical link element reinforcing the
idea that HTTPS is the canonical version
of Charlie's site there are a few other
best practices that you should follow to
avoid losing search ranking and rather
than repeat them all here they're all
pretty straightforward so I encourage
you to go check out these resources
after the talk
if you do your research and follow these
best practices you can expect a minor
fluctuation in search ranking which
happens anytime you make large changes
to your site yeah but you'll then
recover back to your normal the normal
levels that you had before the
transition in fact Google even has a
small search ranking boost for HTTP so
it's actually considered a positive
signal at present you probably won't
notice any noticeable improvement due to
this boost but it's possible that might
change in the future and it is a small a
small positive signal now in other words
if you follow the best practices and
take a little time to do research before
moving your site over these financial
costs certificates and search rankings
should be negligible my final story
about HTTPS is the story of Francisco
and his adventures with third-party
content I'm sure many of you have lots
of third-party dependencies in your site
so let's meet up Francisco runs the
website of a major news organization and
that means he has a large site with a
lot of legacy content you know hundreds
of thousands of articles and many
different types of third-party content
to worry about and he's heard that if
you move to HTTPS all your third-party
content must be available over HTTPS
also so it's easy to see why this might
freak Francisco out a little bit because
it's true that when you move to HTTPS
you're gonna have to start thinking
about whether all your third-party
content is also available over HTTPS
first and foremost francis goes a little
worried about ads which is what he gets
his money from
so Francisco's wondering if his ads will
be available over HTTPS if he'll be able
to serve them on his site once he's made
the switch
maybe a little-known fact for google
adsense requests they're always served
over HTTPS for most users so even before
a Francisco hasn't moved his site to
HTTPS his Adsense ad requests are
already being served over HTTPS for most
users and so you shouldn't have to worry
too much about this and the exception
here is users who are in countries that
actually block HTTP traffic this isn't
just a Google thing this is an
industry-wide trend in 2015 the
Interactive Advertising Bureau published
a blog post in which they quantified the
number of their member ad systems which
support HTTP 80 percent that's pretty
good and they underscored their
commitment to getting all the way there
and getting to 100 percent in this day
and age it's unlikely that getting your
ads to be served over HTTPS will be a
blocker from moving if it if your
abscess stems don't support HTTPS I
encourage you to ask them about it you
might find that it's already on their
roadmap in the very near future and if
it isn't you should ask them why not and
tell them I said why not the next type
of third-party content that Francisco is
worried about is the partnerships that
he has with external sites that rely on
the HTTP referer header what this means
is that when a user clicks a link on
Francisco's site and that link points to
an external partner that external
partner will look at the HTTP referer
header to see that the traffic came from
Francisco's site and attributed
appropriately now this might be
something that's used for analytics
purposes or it could be something that's
used for revenue purposes but either way
this referer header is important to a
lot of sites on the web today
the problem which may not be obvious is
that when you move your site to HTTPS if
a user follows a link to an HTTP partner
browsers will strip the referer header
for privacy reasons and that's because
if you're doing something sensitive on
an HTTP site the URL that you are on
might be sensitive information and the
browser shouldn't just that leak that in
plain text over the network as you
follow HTTP links so it's important for
privacy purposes that these refer
headers are stripped but that's a
problem for Francisco when his HTTP site
links to HTTP partners
he needs that refer header to be there
refer policy to the rescue this is a web
platform feature and there are a few
different ways you can set it but it
basically allows you to make a
compromise between privacy and
functionality where you can say in some
cases there is an amount of information
that is okay to send in therefore our
header so in this example Francisco has
a link on his site to an external
partner that's only available over HTTP
and Francisco's setting a refer policy
on that link saying that when the user
follows that link it's okay to send the
origin that is not privacy invasive to
send the origin and the origin in this
in this context you can think of it sort
of like the domain so when Francisco
sets this refer policy on his links to
external partners the refer header will
contain the domain of Francisco's site
so this external partner can attribute
the traffic correctly but they don't
need to see the full URL and Francisco
is telling the browser it's okay to
relax this restriction because this is
not going to leak any sensitive
information there are a variety of
different referral policies that you can
set so you can that you can choose a
setting that works for your excited here
finally Francisco is losing sleep over a
kind of general problem called mixed
content mixed content is the general
phenomenon where an HTTP site loads of
sub resource over HTTP and this is an
important case because when an HTTP site
loads a non secure sub resource
nonsense non-secure sub resource can
actually compromise the security of that
HTTP site which is loading it so if you
try to load a non-secure script or
iframe or other active content like that
on an HTTP site browsers will actually
block it because that content is too
powerful and would completely wipe out
all the security of that HTTP site in
the cases of images and these are these
are what tend to be a more common in
cases like Francisco Francisco's site
might have lots of old news articles
that link to third-party images that
aren't available over HTTPS or maybe
they're loaded dynamically and it's not
so easy to find which which strings he
needs to change to load all these
third-party images over HTTP in the case
of content like this what we call
passive content like images browsers
will allow it to load so the site won't
be completely broken but the green lock
goes away so Francisco loses his green
lock to alert the user that there is
something going wrong and something's
not quite right with this site and
Francisco is not happy with this he
wants his green lock that he worked hard
for to tell the user that the security
on his site is is properly configured a
web platform feature called content
security policy is what we usually
recommend developers to help them find
and fix instances of mixed content on
their site content security policy is a
rather general mechanism can be used for
many different things but in this case
what I'm showing is an HTTP response
header time when the browser sees this
header on Francisco's site the browser
interprets this as follows Francisco's
site is saying all of my content should
be loaded over HTTPS with the exception
that dynamically generated and inline
scripts are ok let's just ignore those
otherwise all content all scripts all
images should be loaded over HTTPS and
if the browser
Persis content that violates the policy
this policy that all content should be
loaded over HTTPS then the browser
should send a report to this URL that
Francisco has configured so this header
is basically a way for Francisco to
assert to the browser that all content
should be loaded over HTTPS and he wants
to receive reports about any Content
that isn't and that allows him to go
find and fix instances of mixed content
on all his gazillions of pages and this
header name is report only meaning that
all of this happens invisibly to the
user it doesn't change the behavior of
Francisco's site merely serving this
header will not cause anything to happen
that's visible to the user won't block
any content from loading it'll just send
reports so that Francis Francisco can
find out what's being loaded over a
non-secure HTTP and fix it if you don't
want to run your own infrastructure to
collect these reports there's a great
service called report URI il where you
can go sign up and you'll get a URL and
you can use that URL as your report
collection endpoint in your content
security policy and this service will
collect these reports for you and even
give you some cool data visualization
and analytics tools to help you make
sense of what you're getting for all of
these problems chrome recently launched
the dev tools security panel so if you
go into dev tools in Chrome and you open
up the security panel they'll see a
whole bunch of information that is
designed to help you find and fix HTTPS
configuration problems such as these
problems of loading a third-party
content over a non secure HTTP so we
would love for you to check it out and
give us feedback because our sole goal
here is to help you set up HTTPS as
painlessly as possible
the story of Francisco is true in that
third party providers must support HTTPS
in order for you to move your site over
but what's new what's changed in the
past few years is all these new tools
and support in the ecosystem and in the
web platform to help you upgrade all
your third-party content when I look
back at these five stories about HTTPS
that I've told you today I think there's
one kind of morale that emerges and the
morale is that five 10 15 years ago
HTTPS was kind of slow kind of expensive
kind of a pain to set up but these days
in 2016 browser vendors web developers
like yourselves server software
developers security researchers all
these parties have come together to make
HTTPS a lot faster and easier and
cheaper and all-around better than it
was in the past
and that's why we think it's both
possible and really important for every
site on the web today this very powerful
web that we have every site should be
using HTTPS thank you so much for
listening I really appreciate you coming
I will be in the mobile web sandbox area
if you have any questions and I love to
chat Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
