relations team so I'm happy to be here
today talking about the tools that can
help provide the foundation for your
service worker which is a key piece of
any progressive web app now we'd be
covering both existing tools as well as
providing preview of the next generation
of Service Worker libraries so you might
be asking yourself why use tools to
build your progressive web app many
folks have seen canonical Service Worker
code samples that turn up in articles
and getting started guides out there
you'd be tempting to just you know copy
paste and then ship that code in
production you know I don't want to
sound too negative here you know I'm
personally responsible for writing a lot
of those early service worker code
samples and they're very useful for
learning the basics of the service
worker API so you know I don't want to
say that they're not useful but you know
there are certain things that you need
to worry about and pitfalls when using
those code snippets and production so
presence here is a common code pattern
for pre caching some resources during
your service workers installation URLs
to be precast here are stored in an
array and you need to increment your
version variable whenever you decide
that you need to change one of those
resources if you want to trigger the
serviceworker update okay but you know
in a production web app if you're not
following month if you are following
modern best practices you won't be
loading in this list of friendly file
names in your URLs array you're much
more likely to have a file name that has
some sort of unique hash based on the
contents of that file so as unique file
names that need to be in your URLs array
and you know also what about that brand
new image that you added to your page
but forgot to include a new URLs array
and you know what about scenarios where
you have an existing file like that
index
HTML but you make a change and you
forget to update version these are all
some common pitfalls you might run into
and these pitfalls extend to the code
that you use to clean up your pre cache
entries which is something that normally
happens inside the activate handler a
service worker so you can see code
snippet here used to delete old precash
content whenever a new service worker
activates but what if your service
worker updated because of it just a
small change to a single file you know
why throw away everything else those
previously pre cached instead of reusing
the entries that haven't changed and
finally you may have some samples like
this of a fetch handler that performs
runtime catching and in this case it's
using a cache first policy problem is
the code adds to the run some cash but
never cleans up entries so you may not
realize it but the cache storage API
just ignores the kesha expiration h2b
response headers you know when you're
dealing with the cache storage API it's
not going to look at the max age and
things like that and automatically
expire entries for you so you can easily
clog up every user's device with larger
resources that were needed for one
specific page maybe a month ago but
there never can be used again so
hopefully I've open your eyes to a few
of the things you want to avoid but on
the flip side let's talk about what you
should implement whenever you're
building a production-ready service
worker so first your service worker
should use an asset manifest generated
based on the actual files that you're
deploying to your site you know
including whatever fingerprints might be
in the file names and things like that
that manifest should determine which
resources are used to pre cash rather
than a hard good list and this means
that you don't have to worry about
leaving how crucial files that you added
in late in your build process and forgot
to you know update the serviceworker to
go now second that the asset manifest
should keep track of the hashes or
fingerprints of each file for you and
make sure that only files that have been
changed are invalidated and downloaded
again so anything that hasn't changed
should be kept around rather than being
thrown away and this means you never
have to worry about remembering to bump
that version variable each time you
change a file and it also means that
your activate handler isn't going to
throw away content that's still valid
and useful finally you need at least
recently used expiration policy for your
runtime caches you might use maximum
number of entries or you might want to
have a maximum age for the entries or
you want you might want to have a mix of
both and this prevents your caches from
growing indefinitely and ensures that
frequently used content is kept around
well assets that we're only used in the
past will be cleaned up all right so how
can make sure that all the
production-ready a checklist items are
taken care of hopefully everybody wants
to go out and build something I know and
not surprisingly the answer is tooling
so despite that tongue in
tongue-in-cheek text on the slide I'm
actually a big fan of using the right
tools for a given job and there are few
tools available today that we could
specifically recommend for building a
production-ready service worker okay so
first is SW Prakash it's a build time
tool that can gin that generates your
serviceworker file for you so the
generated file contains an asset
manifest and install activate and fetch
handlers that follow the best practices
we've been talking about all along
there's also a scoby toolbox and this is
a runtime library that extends the
behavior of an existing service worker
and specifically focuses on runtime
caching strategies
so it implements a number of common
strategies that you could use right out
of the box without having to you know
write your own code or more likely go to
jakes offline cookbook and copy and
paste that code we've done that for you
so you know even if you don't realize
that what you see in this diagram is a
Stillwell revalidate strategy you can
make use of it right away and SW toolbox
also takes care of cash expiration for
anything that's added to these runtime
caches so sob precache and sob toolbox
complement each other and they can be
used together to handle both the pre
caching and the runtime caching for your
progressive web app so in fact we've got
a few projects that are pre-configured
to use both of the libraries out of the
box first of all we have a web starter
kit and it provides boilerplate for
common web development scenarios asked
Toby precash now some of your toolbox
are baked right in to the build process
that it uses making your new web app
offline first by default I said polymer
starter kit and it's another great
jumping off point for developers want to
build their progressive web app with web
components and the serviceworker
libraries are included here as well so
they ensure that the assets needed to
render routes are loaded quickly and
that everything works offline but we
know that not everybody is gonna be
beginning from scratch for the star to
get that many developers but existing
projects are using a web pack based
build process and SME precash works for
them too so remember the community will
farley shout out to will is kind enough
to maintain the SW precash webpack
plugin and we appreciate his hard work
there so in fact if talked a little bit
about their new pwa this is what they're
using under the hood to generate their
service worker and you know that we know
there's folks out there like doing
everything using command line tools
either manually or wrapping them
in you know npm scripts to kick off a
build process so we've got you covered
as well as to be precast just as a
command-line interface that can be used
to hook into these build processes and
you can trigger it you know it's part of
your normal build set up so I barely
scratched the surface of you know what s
to be precash w two of us could do or
how to configure them but I'd encourage
folks to visit our new service worker
libraries landing page to learn more and
we have ton of examples there and links
to some previous videos that we've done
and articles they could read talking
about best practices and you know we've
talked about these libraries a lot but
rather than just taking my word about
the value I wanted to dive into
real-world deployment that you might
have heard of the Washington Post's
progressive web app so let's see how
they're using SW precash in SW toolbox
looking at a very lightly edited version
of their entire SW precash configuration
so passing this configuration in during
their build processes all it takes to
generate the serviceworker follow that
they have deployed to actual production
use and let's dig into some of those
specific settings to see how they're
making use them first they're using this
option static file gloves to define a
list of patterns that match files in
their build directory and this is that
alternative to hard coding a list of
URLs anything that matches this pattern
has automatically pre cached and cache
entries are automatically versioned and
kept up to date by the serviceworker
that's generated next comes their
runtime caching configuration this is
actually a way of using both SW precash
SW toolbox together very easily and it
tells SW precash to automatically
include SW toolbox in the generated
surfer serviceworker file and to
configure it based on the provide
settings so in this case we define a URL
pattern matching things that are going
against their content API and they apply
a network first strategy to those
requests they're also able to define
that cash expiration that we talked
about which means that entries from a
given period that I'm not used anymore
will be expired from the cash without
just building up over time and they're
also pulling in some additional code
that we haven't mentioned yet and that's
a library that automatically queues and
retries Google Analytics hits that take
place while their user is using the site
offline so they're using SW off on
Google Analytics which sets up fetch
handlers that automatically Q any filled
Google Analytics requests using index DB
and the filled requests are we tried for
up to a day which is kind of interval
that makes sense for Google Analytics
and then retried whatever the service
workers starts up so library preserves
the original event time automatically
for you meaning that assuming the
request is able to make it to Google
Analytics because the Vice comes back
online the data has the correct time
step attributed to it so everything
works as you would expect and you don't
lose the nuance about when an event
actually happened just because the site
was offline all right so you've seen a
real world example of using the
library's to generate a serviceworker
file but how do you confirm that your
progressive web app is using the
serviceworker effectively so if you've
been listening to any of the previous
talks this is probably not a surprise
we've got a tool for that called
lighthouse and lighthouse automatically
tests for many of the things progressive
web app should do including whether the
serviceworker is behaving as expected so
this screenshot shows a lighthouse
chrome extension interface run against
the Washington Post's progressive web
app you can see confirmation in the
highlighted section that they're pwa has
a registered service worker and that it
serves content even when the network is
disabled and lighthouse will also
generate useful performance metrics
allowing you to judge other stats that
are very relevant to any progressive web
app
so lighthouse is a very useful tool I'm
going to hammer home point that we've
been making again and again it's
something to supplement testing on
actual devices so please don't use it
just exclusively but also confirm
behavior through service worker on real
world of devices on real world networks
but you know while I've been talking
about the Washington Post up to now
they're not alone when it comes to
production s to be pre Cashin smu
toolbox deployments so here's just a
subset of partners that are using these
libraries to power their service worker
in production you can feel confident
knowing that these libraries are ready
to use and battle-tested but the flip
side of being tried and true those that
the libraries were originally written
back in 2014 so I sure there's like some
formula equivalents like dog years but
for JavaScript libraries I'm sure that
by whatever metric these libraries kind
of unlike their distinguish elder
statement elder statesman phase it's
getting out a little bit but you know I
want to reinforce that they're not
deprecated we're not duplicating
everything everything is still supported
and if you're already using them or
starting a new project today they really
do remain the right choice but best
practices are always changing and we
recently started thinking about you know
what a modern Service Worker framework
would look like we're still very early
on but we wanted to give everyone a
sneak preview of what we're thinking
about all right so just want to outline
a few of our high-level goals for this
project developers who want to use just
small bit of functionality like cash
expiration should be able to import just
the code that they want by bundling in
es2015 modules with very little overhead
at the same time developers who opt in
to using all the functionality should
feel like they're using a single
coherent framework kind of wanted to get
rid of that we r divided between us w
precash and also be told
box where they feel like they're two
separate projects and most importantly
you know we have a strong set of
features that we know developers need in
production and we want to have parity
with those features with our new
offering we don't want this to feel like
your regression in any way all right so
let's dive in a little bit about what
we're thinking conceptually we split the
new framework into three layers routing
runtime handlers and request behaviors
so here's an overview of each of those
so first up is a rat and layer which is
responsible for setting up fetch
handlers that respond to specific types
of requests so we're envisioning
built-in classes to handle like regular
expression and Express style routes
similar to how SW toolbox is currently
configured for runtime caching the
router class also lays the groundwork
for more complex routing in the future
and we're excited to see what we could
build on top of that but going down one
layer from routing is our runtime
handler layer and this is sub classes
that implement common runtime caching
strategies like still while we validate
or network first and by default they
won't modify the out-going request and
they'll just use an appropriate cash you
know based on the service workers
registration scope but we wanted to
provide flexible way of opting into
different behaviors to customize those
defaults in a way that makes sense for
your application and that's where we get
to the request behaviors later so this
is the innermost layer and allows you to
configure the runtime handlers and take
specific actions in response to one or
more custom callbacks that the runtime
handlers know how to trigger so to start
with we're thinking about three custom
callbacks and those are requests will
fetch fetched it fail and cashed it
update so here's a quick look at how
those callbacks fit into the request
lifecycle prior to contacting the
network a runtime handler will trigger
any registered request will fetch
callbacks and this allows the service
worker to modify the request before it's
made so if that network request happens
to fail any fetch did callback handler
is get triggered and finally if the
handler was successful you have a new
response from the network and the cash
gets updated this is our opportunity to
call any cash to update callbacks all
right so let's take a look at some of
the behaviors we're planning to
implement on top of this system of
callbacks and triggers so first we're
exploring responsive image behavior that
would be triggered during the request
will fetch call back and it could take
current devices capabilities into
account and modify the outgoing image
request URL accordingly and do some
pretty smart things in terms of what it
actually loads in terms of the URL we're
also thinking about a background sync
cue and the idea is that this would be
triggered by fetch did fail whenever
there's a network requests of fills and
this would be a more general version of
what we have implemented and I talked
about a little bit earlier for Google
Analytics and I would just allow you to
opt in to the same sort of behavior for
your own types of requests and
additionally it probably makes sense to
use that new sink event that gets fired
in the service worker for doing smart
retries of those requests so I'd also
like to take the cash cash expiration
logic that was currently like deeply
embedded in SW tool box and make it
available via a reusable behavior and
this would be triggered by the cash did
update you know something gets the
rhythms of the cash you'd be able to
talk about how the cash would be
modified and cleaning up old injuries
and things like that and we also have
plans for another behavior triggered by
cash should update and this one would be
to use new broadcast channel API which
is super cool and it would let cages
know when a previously cached resource
has been updated the client page could
then you know take appropriate action
like
prompting users to reload the article
that they're reading and see the latest
updates based on the new cache entry all
right so what does it look like when all
these pieces are used together as part
of a new framework let's walk through
the code sample so first thing we're
doing is setting up a request wrapper to
configure our caching and also to
configure the type of callbacks that are
triggered and this particular case we're
using the broadcast broadcast cash
update behavior next we're configuring a
route to automatically apply a handler
whenever a condition is met so here
we're just checking to see if the URL
ends in Jason and if there's a match
will apply the still while we validate
handler using the wrapper that we just
configured for that cache behavior so
finally we take our route and we use it
to configure a new router and this also
lets us set up at a full handler to use
for other requests and aren't explicitly
matched by a wrapped so you can see here
the entirety of the code snippet and how
everything hopefully fits together as a
cohesive framework but we know that not
everybody wants stopped into using a
full framework and we don't money leave
those developers behind so here's an
example of how you could write your own
service worker code to manage caches but
just pulling the broadcast cash update
behavior and manually use it
independence of that you know automatic
trigger cash should update so if you
want to mix it into your existing code
that should work too we'd also like the
request handlers to work in a standalone
environment allowing you to write your
own fetch event handler while still
taking advantage of a canonical
implementation of a get of given
strategy and you can see that here
we're still at the very early stages of
implementing these new libraries their
use cases we plan on addressing but
don't have as much to share about yet
that includes like generating a manifest
and doing a lot of things that you
currently use SW precache for and it
also includes build time tooling and
ways of automatically integrating into
the bills that you have today so we are
definitely thinking about those we just
don't have as much as sure quite yet
that being said you know if you're the
adventurous type and you really want to
dip your toes into the water these new
libraries we do have some very very
clearly alpha quality releases up on nvm
right now expecting interfaces to change
leading up to the official release we're
really just releasing this out there as
a way of getting feedback from folks and
getting the community to a chance to
play around with these in a non
production environment and let us know
what the developer organ amex feels like
and you know we want feedback so please
reach out to us we have this kind of big
github issue open the details of what
we're planning on doing and let us know
what you think and what areas you'd like
to see us focus on or the areas that
seem like they wouldn't work for you and
we're gonna definitely take that into
account so last but not least there's a
great new service worker push messaging
library that was just released by my
colleague Matt gaunts and it provides a
production-ready approach to using
firebase Cloud messaging push
notifications within your serviceworker
so we don't unfortunately have time to
dive into that right now but that will
be at the service worker breakout
session later today and for folks here
love and he'll be demonstrating a bit
there so thanks to everybody for the
time both in person and on video and we
hope that you'll take advantage of all
these tools and build a production-ready
service worker for your progressive web
app so thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
