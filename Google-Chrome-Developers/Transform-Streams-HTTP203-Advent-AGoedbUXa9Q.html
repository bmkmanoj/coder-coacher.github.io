so I'm excited about 2018 I've been
thinking about some of the web features
they're going to be discussed or SPECT
or sort of landing around then and what
to try and describe one of them to you
in 2 minutes you can ask me questions my
subject is transform streams transform
streams is we have readable stream and
right real stream yes
transform stream well a readable stream
right is a thing you can create and like
data comes out of it right you can read
from it you can read from it you can see
where the name comes from writable
stream right you can write to it amazing
there's nothing nothing comes out it's
just a kind of like end point does it go
well when you define the writable you
can get access to the stuff but but you
know doing the other side with code yes
ok
whereas a transform stream it's actually
like the object you get is pretty simple
it's just an object with a readable and
writeable so it's both yes it's one
object that has both on the you have an
object about readable is literally a
readable stream dot writable literally
right caring and stuff goes into the
right of all and comes out the readable
usually changed in some way and you can
define how this change is happening yes
so there's a constructor for it like a
new transform stream and you pass in
sort of details of how to do buffering
and such and then you have a function
that receives
chunks of data in and you can push so
basically in the middle it transforms
the data exactly amazing and this is
like but is this is a kind of huge thing
for the web because it's what we can
start defining a lot of platform level
features on ladies because there's also
stuff in the browser that we don't have
access to like gzip all browsers do it I
guess it I guess it's a transform you if
you put in clear text and outcomes
compressed well it'll probably be bytes
I mean clear text in the you know it's
it's clear bytes and outcome compress
all fine okay fair enough
but also things like image compression
because like all browsers do this for
canvas so you know what if we could push
by it's in get by it's out
our TC has video codecs the same
business so this should expose all of
that to the platform that would be so
good 20:18 go work us I'm aware of them
they're existing they have been existing
for a long time but yeah I think we need
to start using them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
