rendering performance screen it's easier
to collect real user measurement data
with the performance observer API the
browser can now progressively render
content served from a service worker
with streamed HTTP responses and there's
plenty more I'm Pete LePage on the High
Line let's dive in and see what's new
for developers in chrome 52 when an
element changes and needs to be rendered
the browser has to consider how that
single change may affect all the other
nodes in the Dom with the CSS contained
property you can scope the changes to
only a portion of the Dom contain layout
can help reduce the number of elements
that may need to be rear-ended to just a
handful contain paint clips the element
and prevents an element's children from
displaying outside of the bounds contain
size means that the elements children do
not affect apparent size contain style
means that style changes won't get
propagated back up past the containing
element check out Paul Louis's intro
post linked below for more details
collecting accurate real user
measurement data is critical to
detecting performance problems and
regressions that might hurt your user
experience chrome 52 now supports the
performance observer API which enables a
simple and performant way to collect
performance data at run time instead of
polling for updates you can declare what
metrics you're interested in then the
browser notifies you when those new data
points become available service workers
can now stream HTTP responses allowing
the page that made the request to start
working with the response as soon as the
first chunk of data is available unlike
fetch requests that need to wait until
the entire response is received stream
responses can be progressively rendered
as it's downloaded there's also support
for vapid an open standard to
authenticate your server with a web post
service style sheets can now specify
alpha values for colors using hex values
instead
the RGBA syntax and you can now
experiment with persistent storage as an
origin triumph these are just a few of
the changes in chrome 52 for developers
check the description for more details

chrome and know what's coming click the

LePage and as soon as chrome 53 is
released I'll be right here to tell you
what's new in Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
