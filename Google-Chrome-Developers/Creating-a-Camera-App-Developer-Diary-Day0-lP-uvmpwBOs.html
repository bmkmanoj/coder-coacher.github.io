with Google's web developer relations
team I'm building a web app at the
moment and I'd like to share with you my
process for building the app as well as
talking about any problems that I have
and anything interesting to learn along
the way so let's take a look at what I'm
building so here we can see a prototype
of my camera on screen at the moment is
the photos that I've already taken as
well as a photo I've imported mostly my
face because that's what I have have
around when I'm developing and we have
the ability here to either upload a
photo or drag and drop it in or use the
camera on the device to actually take a
new photo on a mobile phone we're going
to be adding in capabilities to do all
of the things that your camera is
capable of like firing the flash or
changing the ISO or changing where the
focus point is on the screen
at the moment I've only got the ability
to change the mirroring for selfie mode
so let's take a photo and now we're into
edit mode you know we have a 30 standard
set of filters here things that you'd
see in any photo editing yet so I've got
saturation and I'm using WebGL to render
the filter effects in real time as you
move the slider as we go on we're gonna
be adding in lots more features to the
app we're gonna start by changing the
camera settings when we actually take
the photo so going to be able to use on
a mobile device will be able to use
things like auto white balance we'll be
able to use change the focus point or
actually fire the flash we're going to
be adding in new filters as particularly
like named filters a set of filters
where you click on it and it does a
whole bunch of things all at once we're
going to try make that really smooth and
really fast
and we'll be adding in all of these
things for video so we have to capture a
video and then live preview the video
with the effects added and create the
output video there on the device so if
that sounds interesting to you please
join me again to hear more about that
and thank you for watching thanks for
watching if you like to see more of our
videos click here and see you again
Cheers
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
