2016 we're completely backstage the only
quiet place we could find i'm joined by
Jake Archibald who is in a very
interesting choice of clothing yes what
happened is well we were asked by
management to sort of dress up a bit
because it's the jazz center so we kind
of did a joke where we wore the suits
and it just change into a t-shirt but
management sort of pressure does into
asking the audience that we had put it
to a vote in the audience voted that I
should wear a suit and I hate it is not
even a joke I really hate wearing suits
I usually only wear them when someone is
getting married or died I don't know how
to respond to that so the reason that
I've grabbed Jake is because you're
giving a talk in a little while what's
it gonna be on well you know it's of
course it's going to be about service
worker um well it's so this is actually
only only the second talk I've ever
given a chrome dev summit the other one
was the first ever one and their service
work it wasn't released so I was just
kind of making stuff up and all of the
stuff in the slides is wrong and I
thought that was a bit of a laugh I'm
gonna do it again so I'm talking about
all the future stuff in service worker
that was shipping the stuff like we're
looking at in 2017 along with a few
things which are kind of related to the
service worker but it definitely
progressive where that things that I've
just made up you've just made up it's
gonna be great so you can catch that on
the live stream on the chrome developer
youtube channel otherwise follow along
with hashtag chrome dev summit and thank
you for watching hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
