welcome back to another episode of ask
polymer this is a little segment that we
do where you send in questions on G+ or
Twitter and I do my best to answer them
okay our first question comes from
Wheatley who asks is it possible to use
sass with polymer and if so what's the
best way to go about doing that so
there's really two things to think about
if you want to use sass with polymer the
first is that sass needs to know about
polymers custom property and CSS mix-ins
syntax the other is that for using like
external style sheets or something like
that you're going to need to bundle
everything into a style module now for
that first point mix-ins and custom
properties there is a master bug in sass
tracking support for this so you can
check that out over here right
recently sass added support for custom
properties but if you want to use mixin
so you're gonna need to escape the mixin
code using a little bit of sass syntax
as for wrapping things in style modules
there's a tool that our teammate Eric
bidelman created called poly styles I
will leave a link to that down in the
show notes so you can use that with an
external CSS file bundle it all up into
a style module that polymer knows how to
work with and that way you can use sass
and style modules in your application so
thank you Wheatley for that question so
our next question comes from George who
was wondering do you recommend putting
every element inside of your elements
HTML file or do you put your elements
inside of other elements so I'm assuming
George that you're using the polymer
starter kit application boilerplate
things so that actually comes with a
little elements HTML file where we put a
whole bunch of element definitions that
we end up importing into our index file
so basically what you want to do is if
you are creating your own element that
element should always list all the
things that it depends on as imports at
the top of its file so if you're
creating an element that depends on
paper button or something like that the
import for paper button should be right
at the top of your elements definition
now if you're then using that element in
your index file then yeah sure
put that element that you just defined
in elements HTML but you don't need to
put all of its dependencies in elements
HTML as well really you can think of
elements.html is all the things that the
index file depends on basically so yeah
elements they import their dependencies
anything that you're using in your index
file that can go into elements HTML hope
that sort of clears things up a little
bit for you George all right our next
question comes from Jesse who was
wondering when are we gonna get a data
grid in polymer so that's a good
question right now the polymer team is
not planning to ship a bunch of new
elements we're working on a few things
kind of related to framework stuff like
like a router stuff working with the URL
but we're not planning to ship a bunch
of new UI elements instead I think what
would we really like to do in 2016 is
see more elements coming from the
community and we want to do our best to
promote those elements because there's a
lot of good stuff that's being built out
there right now but maybe everybody
doesn't know about it if you aren't
familiar with it there's a website
called custom elements dot IO I'll link
to that over here and this is basically
like it's kind of like NPM for web
components you can go there you can just
start typing in what you're looking for
and there's a bunch of things that folks
in the community have just created and
published there and so yeah what we'd
like to do is we'd like to promote some
of the data grids some of the UI
components that are out there already
there's one really good one by a team
called Vaadin I think it's just called
Vaadin datagrid perhaps you can find it
on that website and you know for those
of you out there who are thinking about
building some stuff you're thinking
about sharing it you know share it on
custom elements do and then ping me on
Twitter and we can try and like promote
it and get more people involved in the
ecosystem so thank you Jesse for that
question our next question comes from
Sykes who asks what are the biggest
barriers to adoption today and what's on
the horizon to overcome those barriers
so I think over the last year the the
hardest stuff was just making sure that
components worked well across the
browser and that they were performant I
feel like we're starting to get to a
really good place with polymer where
those things have kind of settled down
where it's still tough today though is
taking a bunch of components and
knitting them together into an
application we're sort of missing kind
of the the framework pieces if you will
and so what we're going to work on this
year is rolling out an improved router
we're going to work out on some stuff
around data bindings and improve data
flow through your
vacation some design patterns that you
can use so you can figure out how to
kind of architect the whole thing
together and yeah I think right now
that's still probably the biggest
barrier and stuff that we're gonna be
tackling this year and rolling out and
hopefully improving the story there so
thank you as Ike's for that question
okay the last question comes from Dan
who asks how can a developer using
polymer contribute the most to the
polymer project so there's a couple ways
that I think you can go about doing that
the first is go check out some of our
projects like polymer starter kit where
we already have like a ton of active
community involvement and you know look
through the issue tracker find a bug
that looks like maybe it's you know
something you could work on maybe
something nobody's working on just yet
you know leave a comment and be like hey
can I can I try and tackle this bug and
and once you do like send us a pull
request and we'll even work with you to
try and you know if you've never done a
pull request before we'll work with you
to set that up and walk you through the
process that stuff is super helpful you
can do that on polymer you can do that
on the element repos too you know if you
find an element there's a there's a bug
in it rather than just filing an issue
see if you can get in there and like try
and fix it also if you're building stuff
share it with the community you know I
mentioned earlier there's a site custom
elements io I'm gonna leave the link
down in the show notes but we're really
trying to get more people building
components more people sharing them
there so we can all kind of benefit from
each other's work so those are kind of a
two big areas that I can think of you
know pitch in on some of these things
send us a pull request if you if you can
and also share the stuff that you're
building you know get it out there get
some other people using it and that way
we can just grow the whole ecosystem so
thank you Dan for sending in that
question all right so thank you for all
of those awesome questions if you out
there if you have some questions that
you want to stay answer just leave them
down below in the comments or you can
ping us on a social network of your
choosing at hashtag ask polymer as
always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time so I think
over the past year too
where most people struggle was just like
kidding what I know I said struggle no
no no I'm fine I just struggled
words they hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
