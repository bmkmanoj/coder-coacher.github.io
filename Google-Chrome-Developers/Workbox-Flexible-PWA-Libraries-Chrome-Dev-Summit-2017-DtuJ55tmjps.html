introduction i'm jeff posnick from
Google's web developer relations team
and I'm really excited to talk to you
today about work box which is a set of
tools that could help anyone who's
building a progressive web app but
before we delve into work box let's
cover some foundational concepts first
so understanding how and from where your
web app loads data is really the key to
understanding your web apps performance
in a traditional model web apps make
HTTP requests against a network like
this request for some HTML if all goes
well which isn't always a safe
assumption the network returns a
successful response with the data our
web app needs so that's been a model for
a while but you've probably heard that
service workers change everything and
they do service workers sit in between
your web app in the network and they can
intercept your HTTP requests what they
do with those requests is completely up
to you so the way service workers
handles requests is called its strategy
and here's an example of an extremely
basic strategy like before our web app
requests me HTML but now we've got a
service worker in the middle and it
intercepts a request this network only
strategy all the service worker does is
just pass on that request to network the
network response goes back through the
service worker and onto our web app okay
and what is the service worker that
implements a network only strategy look
like well it looks like this it's you
know event based JavaScript code and
here what we're doing is just responding
to our web apps fetch events by just
refactoring that same request against
the network and passing a response along
through but you know a network only
strategy isn't particularly useful if
you want to build things let's turn to a
more complex example
so we really see the true power of a
service worker when we add in another
piece of the picture and that's the cash
storage API so now we can implement a
more useful strategy in this case we're
going to talk about still while we
validate now this works by first
returning a cached copy of a response
and then going against the network to
refresh the cache in the background so
the service worker can respond
immediately with previously cached
content but updated content will always
be available the next time the same
request is made so this gets a little
bit more involved and let's walk through
the strategy step by step our web app
again makes a request for an HTML
document and our service worker again
intercepts it but this time we take
advantage of the cache storage API and
check to see if there's a match that
specific URL and if there is you know
greater we can return it to the web app
immediately but a service worker doesn't
stop there
independent of the cache look up it also
makes a network request the response is
stored in the cache replacing the
previous potentially stale contacts and
if there wasn't a match the cache was in
a match in the cache when we originally
checked it then we could also take that
response from the network and pass it
along back to our web app fulfilling
that original request so given
everything that was going on in that
diagram it's not surprising that the
code for a serviceworker that implements
still while revalidate is significantly
more complex and before you go and take
pictures of the slide I'm going to go
and show you something better so don't
worry about that and that gets to one of
the key points that I want to make
service workers offer great power the
width at power comes complexity and
that's where work box comes in work box
gives you access to all the power of
complex caching strategies via a
combination of tools that hook into your
build process
as well as libraries that you could use
from inside of your serviceworker with
work box you get to trade complexity for
flexibility so here's an example let's
go back to that previous slide with the
code for sale while revalidate strategy
work box offers the same behavior in a
single line of code so that's a pretty
clear example of work box handling
complexity for you but I also mentioned
flexibility and that's where work box
really shines so all it takes is a few
additional lines of configuration to
customize the way your serviceworker
behaves here we've got that same scale
while revalidate strategy but we till
work box that cache responses should
expire after 60 minutes and this can be
useful when you're ok was slightly still
data but you don't want to reuse
anything that's too old now it's
possible to manually write all the code
your service worker needs same for me
implement cache expiration but you'd end
up turning your dozens of lines of code
into hundreds of lines and requiring
everyone to reimplementation ality just
from scratch really doesn't make sense
so taking a step back from the code and
diagrams for a minute there's a question
that you might be asking yourself and
that's why should you care about adding
in a service worker to a web app to
begin with caching is cool and all but
what is it really worth that extra
effort so here's a key point that I hope
everyone takes away from this a service
worker properly configured makes your
web app fast and reliable let's break
that down first it's both fast and
reliable and that really should be
everybody's goal even when you have what
you think is a good connection and
network is always a wild card if you
avoid the network your web apps can
start up immediately and not just some
of the time by taking network
variability out of the picture you could
be reliably fast all the time
but he can't just throw together any old
serviceworker and expect your web app to
suddenly become fast and reliable making
sure that you deploy a properly
configured Service Worker one that uses
an appropriate combination of caching
strategies is really crucial and that's
where work boxes two comes in work box
allows you to build on a solid
foundation which you can which you then
configure to meet your specific needs
that's a better alternative than using
copy and pasted code that you have to
cobble together yourself work box also
gives you control over how you build
your serviceworker if you're the type of
developer who prefers to take things one
step at a time
you could use an incremental approach
and manually add in work box strategies
to an existing serviceworker but if you
prefer work box to handle more for you
we have tools that will generate it and
configure your entire service worker
from scratch and using work box means
that you're building on top of
extensively tested production ready code
but you don't have to take my word on
that
let's take a closer look at a couple of
companies that deployed web apps using
work box first up is Pinterest which we
Patti just talked about a bit and it'll
probably company that many of you
already familiar with so Pinterest has
been gradually adopting PWA
functionality and one of their recent
goals was to provide a fast and reliable
experience for logged in users not
surprisingly a serviceworker caching is
key to that goal Pinterest turned to
work box to power their serviceworker
and let's take a closer look at some of
the features that they're using so first
Pinterest is using work box for pre
caching pre-caching assures that the
assets that are crucial to their loading
experience their core HTML javascript
and CSS are always cached ahead of time
and available with free caching work box
automatically takes care of
the old entries and updating new entries
each time you rebuild your site let's
take a closer look at what's going on so
the process starts at Build time when
work box generates a manifest of
versioned URLs this list is stored as
part of the service workers code when a
given version in the service workers
first installed work box uses this list
of revision revision information to
figure out which URLs need to be fetched
from the network and those network
responses are put into the cache for
future use then after the service worker
is activated it could start handling
requests for pre cached resources by
retrieving them directly from the cache
bypassing the network completely these
cache responses will always be fast and
you never need to worry about
reliability but that's just a diagram
and I'm sure folks would like to see the
code that configures work box's behavior
so here's a snippet of the actual
service worker that Pinterest is using
and I want to highlight a few bits in
particular first remember when I said
the pre caching works by passing in URLs
along with revision information into the
Service Worker
so for some URLs like the one shown here
that's easy since they already include a
hash as part of their file name but for
other assets like HTML documents
modifying file names isn't an option
work box handles the situation by
creating its own hash of those files
during its build process and includes
that revision information as part of the
manifest as you can see alongside the
URL work box uses this information to
keep track of when it needs to update
the pre cache URLs and you won't get
stuck serving the same cache HTML
indefinitely Pinterest is also using
work box to handle navigation requests
so these are the initial requests that
your browser makes for the web apps HTML
and traditionally these requests always
had to be served from the network
even if you're following all the other
HTTP caching best practices she would
always have that as a bottleneck but
service workers change that model we can
now serve cached HTML immediately by
passing a network for navigations
entirely using a cache first strategy
net for navigations is crucial for speed
and reliability and work box really
makes it easy to do so let's take a
closer look at that here's a high-level
view of how work box handles navigation
requests so let's say there is a logged
in user that returns to Pinterest and
the service work is already installed
the visitor navigates to a specific URL
and the service worker can tell that
it's a navigation request it gets that
information as part of the fetch event
that it's handling our service worker it
knows that the URL could be fulfilled
with a generic app shell that's been pre
cached previously and that is ultimately
returned to the web app from the cache
avoiding the network completely but
Pinterest needs a more flexible approach
than just serving the same HTML for
every single URL some navigation
requests alike for their about page
can't be satisfied with that same HTML
app shell and the service worker needs
to send those requests to the network
those requests they do lose the benefits
of going cache first but it does mean
that they have the flexibility of
serving HTML that's tailored to some of
their custom pages and here's a work box
code that corresponds with that behavior
that we just saw using work box means
focusing on flexible configuration not
on copying countless lines a boilerplate
code all you do is tell work box which
HTML document should be used for most
navigations ideally there should be a
URL that was previously pre cached and
is always gonna be available and then
you get to customize the navigation
behavior via white and black lists
here's where they've opted out of their
about page from the default shell HTML
so it has a little bit of routing
information involved there too so what
we've just seen is only a few snippets
of Pinterest a serviceworker and when
they started using work box they weren't
starting from scratch has that he
mentioned they had an existing service
worker in place and they had some
established build processes already
around it but work box is flexible and
part of that flexibility means being
able to layer in the new caching
behavior without having to abandon their
existing code base all right so that's
Pinterest and next up is another
familiar company wired so wired recently
started down the path of rebuilding
their web experience as a single page
app and they consider that a great
opportunity to look into making it a PWA
at the same time so their goal their
goals for their PWA are first and
foremost to boost both initial
engagement as well as re-engagement with
return visitors and central to that goal
is providing a fast reliable and offline
capable experience so work box could
help because they're starting without
any existing serviceworker their use
case is a little bit different than
Pinterest
they're fine with letting work box
generate their entire service worker for
them each time they rebuild their site
work box has a few ways of integrating
with it build processes and it's
flexible enough to work with most set
ups in Wired case they were already
using NPM scripts so using work box's
command line interface made the most
sense for them let's take a look at a
stripped down version of their build
setup so you can see their build steps
here they're using webpack for
JavaScript bundling and they also rely
on a custom CSS post-processing step and
even though this is a custom build
process works box is flexible enough to
sit slide in right at the end of their
build chain they just added in a new NPM
script that calls the work box CLI
and there are new service workers
behavior is entirely determined by this
configuration file that they pass in to
the CLI let's take a closer look at that
file you know hopefully it's not too
complicated but it is clearer if you
break it down into two different
sections we've already talked about the
performance benefits of pre-caching and
wired one and take advantage of that for
their PWA as well
sending up pre-caching is as simple as
configuring these two options that you
see here in their a configuration file
they point workbox to the root directory
that contains all of their builds assets
and they provide patterns that are used
to match a subset of the files in that
directory that they want precache so
they've decided the precache all of
their HTML javascript SVG images and
their CSS when they run the work box CLI
each time they rebuild their site that
configuration leads to a section of
their serviceworker that looks something
like this contains that manifest we
talked about before with a list of
versioned urls to pre cache and each
time they regenerate their site the list
will also be regenerated to reflect the
current assets and the current versions
of each so we mentioned that some SVG
images are pre cached by word and that's
not the only type of image that's
displayed and wires web app each article
page has at least one image associated
with it and those images tend to be
larger I really only displayed when
you're reading a specific story it
wouldn't make sense to cache all of
those article images ahead of time or to
keep them stored on users devices
indefinitely so why are you thinking
approach to my colleague Evo described
in her talk earlier today they divide
their images up into different
categories and cache each category
differently so the images that are
crucial to navigation and site design
which are all happen to be smaller SVG's
are pre cached and always available
but their article images you use a
runtime fashion strategy along with
cache expiration works boxes flexibility
makes this easy to setup returning again
to that configuration file let's take a
look at the second section where the
image caching behavior is defined so
these options in the configuration file
are all it takes to cache our article
images at runtime and define an
expiration policy after they run their
build process work box uses those
options to generate this code in this
new Service Worker file up until now
we've been focused on how network
independence makes a web app fast and
reliable and those are very important
characteristics but there's another
benefit to caching as well
wired can now create a rich reading
experience when users come to their site
while they're offline when offline the
web app shows a list of previously
cached articles all available to read in
full one of our Dwyers goals for their
PWA
was reengage in with return visitors and
this offline experience helps ensure
that readers keep coming back even when
they know that they don't have a network
connection so let's take a quick look at
how they're generating that offline
article list a little-known secret of
the cache storage API is that it's also
available outside of the context of the
serviceworker and I'm always surprised
at how many people don't know that it's
very useful a web page can ask for the
contents of any cash directly without
having to go through the serviceworker
to get that information cache storage
API returns a list of cache URLs and
then wive's using that list to populate
its offline view here so why are pw a
journey isn't over yet their team is
hard at work on many areas with their
web app but they're happy to open up a
pre-release version of the PWA to the
public today and so available at PWA
wired.com so give it a try
and feel free to share feedback directly
with their team as they continue to
iterate on the site
all right so those are just two the many
partners that have deployed a Service
Worker using the current version of work
box what does the future hold for work
box as a project for looking forward
here's a quick look back at some history
so work box is a direct descendants of
two widely used projects sw-precache and
sw-toolbox we took the core features
from both and join them together in a
consistent interface we've been busy
work box 100 was released back in May at
Google i/o and the toooo release came
out in August since then our main focus
has been on the work box the REO release
it's not quite ready for developers to
use yet apologies for that but I wanted
to preview a few of the key features
that we're planning for three oh and we
love your feedback and contributions it
really directly affects what we end up
building you can visit that link on the
slide for information how you could
reach out and participate in the
community so in two three oh hi in the
list of priorities for work box Rio is a
revamped web pack plugin while we've
shipped a web pack plug-in since our
launch we've heard your feedback that
required a lot of extra configuration
and it didn't support common web pack
development server environments we've
listened and for the common pre-caching
use case the new web pack plug-in should
be zero configuration so this becomes
this of course you saw the flexibility
of adding in configuration if you need
additional features like runtime caching
we've also put some work into the
existing background sync library it
makes it easy to cue up and retry
requests that require a network
connection when you're offline and new
and version of 3.0 is support for binary
request spot use which is perfect for
retrying uploads of videos images or
other rich media
another focus for 300 was reducing the
amount of JavaScript that the work box
runtime adds to your serviceworker
instead of shipping one large bundle and
encouraging everybody to use that 3 Oh
introduces a lightweight dynamic module
loader you can continue writing code
against the work box SW interface like
before but under the hood only actual
dependency is that your code uses will
be downloaded now lazy loading and code
splitting is commonplace nowadays in
client-side code but there are some
specific hurdles that we had to overcome
in order to do it from within a
serviceworker we're really happy with
the results so our goal is to take the
runtime bundle size down from 47
kilobytes to 15 kilobytes for common use
cases and it looks like we're gonna be
able to hit that goal so another big
change in 300 is our official CDN which
is hosted on Google Cloud Storage by
default our build tools will import the
work box runtime from the content
delivery network URL meaning that
there's one fewer thing that you need to
worry about deploying this also ties in
nicely with that dynamic runtime loading
I just mentioned if you use the work box
s with W library hosted on the student
CDN it'll automatically know how to pull
in all of the additional libraries from
the CDN as well so this is just a small
piece of what we've been working on for
the 300 release and while I'm the one on
stage right now talking about it I'm by
no means the only one writing code and
documentation so I wanted to give a
shout out to all the core contributors
to work box codebase and a special shout
out that person the bottom right will
Farley so will doesn't work for Google
but he's been an active open-source
contributor of code around the web back
plugin for a while now and we really
appreciate his help and speaking of open
source we'd benefited from using dozens
and dozens of other open source projects
while building testing and shipping our
code so I don't have time to go through
them all but I did want to highlight a
few on the slide that were particularly
indispensable when we worked on work box
special thanks goes out to all those
projects maintained errs so while free o
is still on the horizon everyone could
go out and start building with the
current release of work box today
whether you're just dipping your toes
into the PWA waters or if you've got an
existing service worker that you're
looking to turbocharge work box can help
we've got documentation along with new
getting started guides and migration
code lab on developers.google.com at the
URL you see on the screen and feel free
to reach out if you would like to chat
more about work box I love hearing about
how people are using it thanks everybody
for taking the time to learn about work
box today and thanks for all the
partners and members of the community
who continue to show your support
it's very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
