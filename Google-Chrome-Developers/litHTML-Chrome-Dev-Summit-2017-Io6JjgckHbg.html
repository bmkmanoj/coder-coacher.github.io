work on the polymer team here at chrome
and I'm gonna talk about HTML template
and give you an early look at a new
library and approach to client-side
templating that we're very very excited
about on the polymer team first I want
to talk a little bit about why templates
are so important
templates are absolutely critical for
today's web just about every single site
that you visit or build uses some form
of a template system whether you're
building a pure content site that might
use server-side templates or rich
dynamic applications that are rendered
completely client-side one of the
primary jobs of your code is building
the user interface and on the web our
user interfaces are built with HTML a
declarative document format and because
so much of what we're doing is taking
data and transforming it and displaying
it this HTML is usually generated from
data it's not completely static some of
it is like I covered here in green and
some parts are dynamic like I have in
pink and merging and managing this
static and dynamic content it can lead
to some really nasty code that's hard to
maintain like our old friend manual dom
manipulation where we had to create
elements individually build them
together into a tree maybe hold on to
some nodes that we're gonna be
dynamically updated a little later on
and this is you know really difficult to
maintain and so templates can help save
us from this fate templates let us press
our intent in a declarative format
that's much closer to the output and
they let us mix static and dynamic
content via expressions so this is
easier to write easier to read and
easier to get correct so this is great
right templates solve all of our
problems well not quite especially
because writing a good template system
is incredibly hard template systems have
some very challenging requirements to
meet and they sometimes have to make
very difficult trade-offs so first
template systems have to deliver a great
developer experience
because that's maybe their main reason
for existing so this includes things
like how templates look developers
really like templates to look like their
output even JSX
has shown the popularity of using markup
for templates because it brings markup
directly into JavaScript it also
includes how templates are structured
most developers seem to like their
templates to be pretty declarative but
they can't be completely declarative
sometimes because you know often you do
need to do some interesting logic to
build up your user interface it also
includes how it expressions and control
flow work do your developers need to
learn a new expression language and it
includes tools do you need a compiler if
the template has its own file type or
syntax is that widely supported across
editors so even just getting developer
experience right is very very difficult
but as important as developer
experiences it's not nearly enough
templates have to be fast they have to
boot fast because they're on the
critical rendering path for your
application the expectation for great
websites is really really high these
days study after study shows that sites
lose real users and real money for every
extra millisecond it takes to render and
if that's not enough template systems
also have to update fast single page
apps especially really rich content
creation apps they need to respond to
user input and data changes as quickly
as possible and this goal is often in
tension with booting fast because one
way to update fast is to do computation
ahead of time to try to track what data
is associated with what notes in complex
template systems that do that they're
often larger too which can increase the
page load time and then finally template
systems end up being this bridge between
the worlds of JavaScript and HTML which
can be challenging as well so javascript
is where your application logic more
importantly your data lives and hTML is
what we need to build it's the stuff
that the template system manages and
it's the natural way in which a lot of
developers think about their UI so
typically if you write your templates in
JavaScript on the JavaScript side they
either don't look a lot like your output
or maybe the code might be too
imperative and hard to follow and if you
write them on the HTML side you might
not have direct
access to your data the template system
has to type that in for you or you may
lose or have to recreate many of the
features of JavaScript like expressions
so altogether these are some really
really challenging requirements with a
lot of tough choices in the unexplored
territory so it's no wonder that there
are a lot of many different opinions and
approaches out there as framework and
library authors explore all the
possibilities and the limits here and
this is actually really great because we
get to try out a lot of different things
and see what works best and if you are
building a new template system this is a
really really great set of targets to
aim for which brings me to this new
library that we're working on on the
polymer team called Lit HTML which aims
to do as well as possible on all these
criteria so for a little background like
Taylor mentioned a few months ago
polymer announced that we're moving away
from HTML imports we're polymer users
typically write their templates to
JavaScript modules and this necessarily
means that we're crossing this
JavaScript HTML bridge over to the
JavaScript side but for backwards
compatibility we're doing the simplest
thing possible with the templates we're
taking the templates that were written
in HTML and we're just moving them into
a JavaScript string inside of your
component definition so this is really
easy to migrate to but it's a little bit
less satisfying than we'd like so we
started to think about how to make
something a little more satisfying
especially now that we're writing our
templates inside of JavaScript we want
to be native instead of JavaScript and
that's how the experiment that became
HTML was born so what is HTML
well primarily it's a library that lets
you write HTML templates in JavaScript
the both boot and update fast and it's a
very very small library and it has a
simple easy to use but extensible API so
let's look at how we write HTML
templates in JavaScript so this here is
a let g ml template and we're using a
feature of es6 called tag template
literals which in my opinion is one of
the most unsung features of es6 so this
looks like a string a
except for that we use backticks instead
of quotes and it can span multiple lines
and it can have JavaScript expressions
embedded directly into it now this is
really useful for building strings from
data but in addition another really
powerful feature is that template
streams template literals can be tagged
and a tag is a special function that
processes the template literal and the
values from expressions and it can
customize what's done with those values
and the tag goes right in front of the
template literal like a prefix and it's
interesting it doesn't have to return a
string can return any type of value that
it wants and let HTML takes advantage of
this to enable really fast updates okay
so here's our Litton plet and the
expression creates a javascript value so
to use it we're gonna have to do
something with this value like maybe put
it into a variable here but first I want
to talk about exactly what type of value
this is so this looks like it might be a
string but I mentioned that you know
strings would be you know not that
useful maybe they're not that great for
using with inner HTML because if you
produce inner HTML you're gonna have to
you know blow away all your Dom when you
produce some new inner HTML for a
component so maybe they could return
some Dom but we have kind of the same
problem there we don't want to rebuild
an entire Dom tree everytime we render
or blow away the Dom for our component
so instead what we do is we return
something called a template result and a
template result is an object that
contains a reference to the template
that we want to render and the data that
we want to render it with so it's the
instructions for how to render some Dom
not the Dom itself to actually render
the template result we pass it to the
html's render function and then give it
a Dom container to render to and the
first time this is going to render the
complete template and then after that
it's just going to update what's already
there and I keep talking about updating
but this snippet doesn't really show how
to do that a more realistic and useful
way to use the HTML is to write a
function that takes some data and then
returns a template result like this so
here we've moved the tag template
literal into a function that takes some
data passes that data to the template
and returns the result and once we have
that function
can call it over and over with new data
and then we can render it efficiently to
the same container so for those of you
familiar with react you might notice
some similarities here and and there are
some as well as some major differences
so first this definitely looks a little
bit like JSX
but it's standard JavaScript syntax and
templates being JavaScript expressions
and JavaScript values are going to lead
to some of the same patterns that you
commonly see in building up JSX
templates but under the hood the systems
are quite different in particularly HTML
doesn't have any video more doesn't do
any dipping but besides the similarities
in syntax there's another similarity in
philosophy I want to talk about and
that's the idea of building UI as a pure
function of state for any given state
that your application or component is in
it should always render the same output
the same UI and to build your UI you
write a collection of functions that
transform state into a description of
the UI V Dom for react and template
results for live HTML and then the
library takes care of making the UI
reflect that description so this is one
way in which they are very similar ok so
now let's take a look at some examples
of the things you can do with let HTML
starting with the types of values that
you can pass into templates so first a
simple text content anything that you
can turn into a string will just be
rendered in place and this works for
attributes as well and you since we're
using the full power of JavaScript in
our templates you can put JavaScript
expressions in line with the template so
let's say you have a page index and
because we're computer scientists that
index is going to be zero base but our
users are probably not computer
scientists and they expect their pages
to start at page one not page zero so
you can simply add a 1 in line your
expression here and this is a great
place to do that kind of template and
display logic you can also pass a
template result to an expression in
order to compose templates with nested
templates so here we have a header
template that we can include into
another template we can actually include
this in many other templates as well and
then when let HTML renders the
containing template it'll render both of
them together in place
and because simply results are values we
can compute them using the full power of
JavaScript like using a regular if
statement here to display a different
message based on whether a user is
logged in or not let H tml supports
arrays and iterables so if you pass an
array of data it will render each item
in that array in place and this is
really comparable power phul when
combined with nested templates so we can
use JavaScript arrays map function here
to transform a list of data into a list
of templates and then when lit renders
the containing template there it'll
render your UI with a list in it right
in place al it also supports nodes as a
data type that you can pass to a
template so sometimes the easiest or
fastest way to create some Dom is
actually by hand or maybe you're using a
third-party library that builds some Dom
and just gives you a reference to it
well your template library shouldn't get
in the way here and the HTML doesn't so
you can pass a Dom node into any
expression and lit will just render it
there for you and we support SVG as well
since SVG elements have a different
namespace than HTML elements you can use
a special SVG template tag to create
partial SVG templates to build up
dynamic graphics very easily and this is
very similar to d3 maybe but in a
declarative kind of way and we support
promises too so for instance you can
fetch some data off of the network and
put the promise of that data into your
template and when the temp when the
promise resolves the template will
update and render the results right into
your template so putting all this
together you can build some really
interesting and complex templates by
using the full power of JavaScript and
the HTML doesn't try to dictate a style
to you either
if you prefer functional programming
where you want to use map and reduce to
build up you know your templates you can
do that if you're doing an imperative
programming and you want to build up
templates by bit using statements you
can do that or if you want to follow a
more declarative style where you have
like a single template expression and
compose it out of other templates you
can do that too
so you can choose whatever style you
want okay next let's look at how HTML
boots and updates fast so the first
thing that we use is
try to use the platform as much as
possible and we use the HTML template
element under the hood and for those of
you who haven't used HTML templates yet
there are really really useful part of
the web components specs and a template
is basically a container of inert Dom
and here inert means the inside of a
template scripts don't run Styles don't
apply images don't load and so on and
templates can be really efficiently
cloned to create new Dom so typically
that would look something like this now
you write your template in HTML and then
in JavaScript you go find the template
and then you clone it with import node
and then you append it somewhere into
your document but we don't usually want
to repeatedly clone a static chunk of
Dom usually we want to replace some of
it with our data and this is exactly
what lit a ste ml lets you do in fact
you could describe my HTML as a
JavaScript syntax for writing
efficiently updatable HTML templates and
it works like this so here's a little
template and lit takes your template and
it replaces all of the expressions in
the template with these generic
placeholders and so we get a string of
HTML and then it uses that string to
create an actual HTML template element
with the placeholders inside of it and
then once we get that element back we
can walk the element and find the
dynamic parts find these replace holders
and remember where they are and we
create these things we call parts and
these parts have an API that lets us set
the value after we've created some
content so we remove the placeholders
and now we have a template without our
expressions that we can clone over and
over again to create Dom that's just
waiting to accept data and because we've
remembered the locations of these
dynamic parts we can go back after the
fact and we can insert data into the
parts into the placeholders and because
we remember the locations of the dynamic
parts we can then really efficiently go
back and do updates by adding new data
directly to those parts so another thing
that helps make LaCie ml fast is
template literals so they have a couple
of nice properties one of them is that
the literals that are passed to a
template tag are the same for every call
to that tag with the same template so
this lets us do one-time setup work like
that age
email template preparation I just showed
you so this is a little bit subtle but
really important so let's go into a
little more detail here so I mentioned
before how a template tag is just a
function well the first argument to that
function is an array of all the literal
parts of your template literal and if
you evaluate a specific template tagged
literal multiple times the tag is called
multiple times but that first argument
is the same every single time so this
means we can use it as a cache key to
look up our prepared template so all
that work of transforming a JavaScript
template to an HTML template and
remembering the dynamic parts that's
only ever done once per template no
matter how many times you call it or no
matter how many places in your
application you use that template so
this is really really important to howl
HTML works and to visualize this let's
consider a really simple template here
that we call say hi we're gonna call it
once to say hi to Amy and then we're
going to call it again - say hi to Alex
and both times we return our template
result that contains a reference to the
template and the values and these
templates they're the same and they're
not just equal the same they're actually
identically the same object so they
share this template in here and they
only have to compute it once for your
type entire application
okay another property of template
literals that we use is that they
naturally separate static and dynamic
content so let's look at why that's
important every HTML template system is
responsible for creating and maintaining
a tree of Dom nodes but only some of
those nodes are ever updated after
they're created templates have the
structure that I talked about this
separation between static nodes the blue
ones here and dynamic knows the green
ones and then we have the updates not
every dynamic part changes all at once
sometimes you just update one value and
so when thinking about the rendering
costs of a template engine I find it
useful to think about these two numbers
here one is how many nodes are updated
when you make some changes and two is
what is the cost per node and if we look
at something like polymer that has a
very advanced template system it's able
to analyze the relationship between your
data and the Dom and it knows exactly
what Dom changes when
data changes and so polymer can scale
not with a number of nodes in a template
or even the number of expressions but
the number of changes that you have and
if we look at something like V Dom it
takes a very very different approach and
with virtual Dom you rerender your
entire virtual tree for your whole
template every single time so V Dom
scales with the number of nodes in your
template but it tries to make up for
this by driving the cost per mille per
node down as low as possible and so with
let HTML we're trying to sit somewhere
in the middle here and get the best of
both worlds so the HTML never has to
look at or compare the static parts of a
template after the initial render it
just leaves them alone so it just looks
at the expressions so it scales with a
number of expressions in your template
but then it tries to drive that cost
down as low as possible because
expressions are just JavaScript values
and it's mostly just forwarding that
value and if the value doesn't change it
doesn't update the Dom at all and all of
this falls out quite naturally from
using template literals because we can
tell exactly what parts are dynamic and
might change and what parts are static
and never change and we don't even have
to do any work to figure this out the
syntax of JavaScript just does it for us
and next we're fast because we take
advantage of the fast built-in parsing
of the browser for parsing strings which
make up the most of the biggest part of
template literals the parsing strings in
JavaScript is roughly three times faster
than parsing generic JavaScript
expressions the VM just has to churn
through characters until it gets to the
end of the string or the beginning of an
expression and then we take that HTML
content of a template and we pass it to
the highly optimized C++ written HTML
parser and so this gives us fast parsing
speed and it also means we don't have to
ship any parsing logic with our template
system which means that let h TM l is
very small it's really small the entire
core library fits on a single slide here
at 18 point font with a little bit of
room to spare at the bottom let HTML is
roughly 2 kilobytes the size and we're
working really really hard to keep it
that way
ok so here's a lot of things that should
theoretically make the HTML fast
JavaScript template literal
HTML template elements not doing any
dipping being really small doesn't
really add up to speed well it is still
pretty early in the project so we
haven't you know released 1.0 and we
haven't done all the optimizations we
want to but we have started to pour some
benchmarks and one of the first ones
that we've done is called the Marco
search results benchmark so eBay
released their internal UI framework a
little while ago and they included some
nice benchmarks implemented across many
frameworks like pre-act
react view and inferno and so I
implemented this benchmark using kind of
the full vision for the HTML which is
combining li h TM l with web components
using custom elements and shadow dom and
these are very very preliminary
preliminary results i'm about to show
you but they still need to be you know
double and triple-checked but so far
it's looking pretty good so here we go
we've run it against these other
frameworks here and let HTML is amongst
the fastest in this benchmark here
higher is better these are operations
per second and this benchmark also
tracks the bundle size for each
benchmark for each framework that
implemented and here lower is better
inlet HP ml is also the smallest of the
frameworks in there coming in at just
over 6 K for the whole benchmark so
that's not you know the library that's
the library plus the benchmark
components including all of their
templates and a size that's smaller than
most complete libraries on their own so
it's really early but I think we're off
to a pretty good start we've also
started to report the DB Mon benchmark
where lay HTML is also competitive with
the fastest frameworks there and it also
shows really good stability across a
wide range of Update workloads so at
least our assumptions about how to make
something simple and fast appear to be
on the right track and we still have a
lot more optimizations to do so next
let's look at the API and what makes it
easy to use and extensible so in earlier
examples you already saw most of the
HTML API it's really just the HTML
template tag in the render function
those alone get you a lot of
functionality with the types of values
that it supports but let H t ml is also
trying to be as small and as unup enya
nated as possible
and it can't possibly stay that way and
give you all the functionality that
you're going to want soul it is
extensible in two different ways the
first is what we call directives so I
showed you how a value can go into an
expression there and I showed you how
the every expression creates a part
where you can there's an API for the
part that you can call well this is what
a directive looks like a directive is
basically a function that gets invoked
instead of the value being passed
through and you mark something as a
directive by using this directive kind
of decorator function here and that
tells the HTML to call the value instead
of passing it along and what it calls is
a function that takes an argument which
is the part and now that you have the
part you can do whatever you want with
it but the part really only has one API
which is set value so this is the
simplest directive you can write it's
kind of a pass-through directive that
just takes a value and puts it into the
part like you would have with a simple
expression so that's how easy directives
can't be to write let's look at a real
example one of the built-in directives
is called until so I talked about how
promises if you pass them to a value it
waits for the promise to resolve and
then writes the resolved value to the
template well sometimes you're going to
want to have some placeholder text that
shows up before the promise resolves and
so until lets you do that you give it
both the promise and some placeholder
some fallback content and it displays
the placeholder first and then displays
the promise when it resolves and it's
implemented in only two lines of code so
first here's the example of using it we
get the response from the network as a
promise and instead of passing it
directly to the template we call this
until directive with the promise here
and then some placeholder this loading
text over here and then here's the
implementation of until so it's a
function that takes some arguments there
and returns a directive and that
directive only has two real lines of
code in it the first one immediately
sets the content to the placeholder so
that shows up right away and then the
next one goes ahead and right afterwards
sets the value to the promise and this
is going to let lit overwrite the
placeholder when the promise resolves so
that's a really simple example but a
real world example and your directives
can be as complex as you need to handle
custom logic inside of there and so the
other thing the
you can do to extend the htmls to use
what we call custom parts these are ways
that you can customize how values are
handled across an entire template
including the templates that are nested
inside of them so we've packaged
together a couple of custom parts into
an optional library that we call lit
extended which gives you a little bit of
sugar for your templates first it sets
properties by default instead of
attributes and then it lets you fall
back with an explicit sand syntax to set
attributes if you want and it also adds
declarative event handlers and the
entire lit extended library weighs in at
only 540 bites gzipped so here's a
little template it looks just like a
litlle ttml template first we have a
property binding and I want you to
notice something here is that I used
mixed case property name there be even
though lit templates are HTML because we
write them in JavaScript we can actually
go back into the JavaScript value and
pull out the original case sensitive
property names so that we don't have to
do any lowercase to uppercase mapping
here we can set any property name with
one and then if you want to set an
attribute you can add a dollar sign
after the name and here we're going to
set the class attribute not the class
property and finally if you want to add
an event handler you can just prefix the
name with on dash and that will take the
rest of the name there and add an event
handler for you okay so one thing that
helps make lit simple is that we have a
very focused API hTML is doing
templating only it's not a framework it
doesn't have any component model and we
actually designed this to complement web
components very well so to show you what
that's like I wrote a little web
component mix in here that adds some lit
rendering behavior to HTML element and
the way this works is that your class
that you write is going to implement a
render function that returns some
template result a lit template kind of
like react actually and then when you
want to trigger a rerender when you
notice that something changed that you
want to render your element can call the
invalidate method and the invalidate
method simply batches calls tool its
render function and then renders the
result to the shadow root and then here
is a custom element using this mixin so
the first thing we do
we applied the mix in to our base class
and then we want to implement a property
so here I implement a property as I get
our setter pair this is something like
polymer will do automatically for you
but I wanted to show you something that
wasn't magic and so what we implement
here is a setter that calls and validate
when the value changes and that's going
to include the of the element and then
finally you implement a render function
which returns on the HTML template so
this is how simple a custom element can
be and in the future this is actually
going to get even simpler when
JavaScript gets decorators or if you're
already using decorators with Babel or
typescript we can use a decorator to
automatically generate that getter
setter pair for us so this can be really
really simple and lightweight with a
focused templating library like the HTML
I think a full-featured base class that
does some other things too might weigh
in at less than 3k for the whole thing
that's including the HTML uh so together
directives and custom parts they let you
craft kind of your own template system
with the capabilities and opinions that
you want you're not stuck with our
choices so we hope that lit Gmail can do
really well across a lot of different
measures ease of use using standard
JavaScript syntax speed size
expressiveness extensibility we really
hope to you know do well on all of these
different requirements that template
systems have so where are we today we
have browser support across the latest
version of all major browsers and we're
working on ie 11 support which that come
very soon we're also starting to get
some great community contributions
people have made fixes and commits to
lid itself and some people are Microsoft
have made IDE plug-ins for vs code and
their language service but the let you
have syntax highlighting and code
completion hover over documentation and
all the full intelligent intellisense
features right inside of your
HTML templates so next up like I said
we're going to be working on benchmarks
and optimization I eleven support we
want to get feedback from users will
show integration with web components get
some documentation finally written and
then we're going to work towards a 1.0
release
and we would really really love for you
to try it out and give us your feedback
the API is very simple so we're not
worried that the API is gonna change a
lot but we want to see what people do
with it and how would they like working
with the system here so you can install
