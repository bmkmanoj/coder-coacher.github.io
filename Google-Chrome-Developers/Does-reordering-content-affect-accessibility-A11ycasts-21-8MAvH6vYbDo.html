welcome back to the alley cashew today I
want to talk about a question that I got
on Twitter from a developer Sarris Wyden
who is asking if you're rearranging
content on screen visually does that
affect the behavior for keyboard and for
screen reader so that's a great question
it's definitely something that I have
run afoul of a lot of times because
there's some some gotchas to this so
what I wanted to do was kind of walk
through a little example I'm going to
create kind of some form elements
rearrange them and then we'll see how a
screen reader and keyboard behaves when
we do that so follow me over here to my
laptop what I've implemented is is
pretty simple I've got a little form
here I've got a few input controls so
basically it's all the same ordering in
the Dom for each of these so it goes
like label followed by an input followed
by a button right same for each of these
three rows and we'll swap over to Chrome
and this is what you know our form looks
like it's it's not going to win any any
beauty contests or anything like that
but it will help us illustrate this very
important point so let's look at what
happens when I try tapping through this
experience so I want to see the focus of
all controls and the order in which they
receive focus so I start tabbing right
it was input submit input submit input
submit as we would expect it goes left
to right left to right and I go to sort
of top to bottom
cool so again that sort of follows the
the natural reading order of this page
and I think that's sort of what a user
would expect as they're tapping through
this now let's use a little bit of CSS
and kind of rearrange these things a
little bit so all these elements right
now are positioned with Flex blocks so
what I can do is drop in some styles
that I wrote earlier okay and I'm going
to use flex boxes order property to
reorder those children so if you're
looking at code here so on line two
I'm going to change the order so it goes
like button input label and then on line
three I'll go label button input and the
order property just lets me say you know
which of the Flex children how they get
displayed in what order right so go back
here this is what we're rendering now so
the first line I left as it originally
was the second line I went in and the
third line I went in
now things are kind of jumbled so let's
try coming through this now with our
keyboard and see what happens so we'll
go to the input and the submit button
and now of course the question is where
just focus go next you might expect that
it would go to that submit button down
there but it actually goes to this input
which is kind of like in the middle of
the screen then ago this of the submit
and let me go to the next line input
submit you know similarly we turn on our
screen reader right which is over on
Chrome 127.0.0.1 first name edit text
submit button address address bed attack
submit button favorite Pokemon favorite
Pokemon edit submit button voiceover off
right so if you were not used to the way
that this page was structured it would
just kind of feel like it was bouncing
around all over the place now from a
design perspective who knows maybe this
was the layout that you were going for
but for someone using a screen reader it
is almost certainly reading the page
elements out of the order that you were
intending and so the reason why this
happens is because with focus order with
with screen reader focus as well these
elements or the the focus order itself
is following the layout of the elements
in the Dom so browser goes through it
looks at the HTML that you wrote it
generates an accessibility tree it Han
set off to assistive technology and
instance of technologies like sweet this
is the dom order this is how we're
flowing through things right and you
know this doesn't just apply to flexbox
either so for instance let's throw in
some absolutely position children
because I've seen this a number of
occasions as well so I'll drop in like a
like a fake newsletter type thing here
so I'm putting it high up in the Dom
right maybe I'm just not paying a lot of
attention where I'm including this code
or you know maybe I'm using like a
templating engine or something like that
and I'm like what else is cool it's fine
that it's there because in CSS I'm going
to you know render it later on absolute
and I'm going to say hey make sure that
it is absolute stuck to the bottom of
the screen right so you go back and look
at that and I will shrink the browser
window a little bit so this all fits in
the viewport okay so you can see here
and now that I've got this like join our
newsletter line down here I've got a
little input field
and when I press tab it might be a
little hard to see but focus is like
right here at the bottom of my screen
and now as I'm tabbing again it like
comes back up to the top and now we're
kind of reading the page in super weird
order right so the takeaway from this is
although you can reposition elements
visually on screen using a CSS when you
do that there's a very high potential
that you will be throwing off the
reading order of your document for folks
who are using a screen reader or kind of
throwing off the efficiency of the
keyboarding experience for anyone who's
relying primarily on a keyboard to get
to the interactive controls my sort of
takeaway from this is you know if you
need to bring something earlier up or
later in the document you want to
position it visually different in that
way try moving it in the Dom right so
actually go into your markup and say
okay cool well if this newsletter if we
want this to be the last thing the users
going to interact with and we need to
make sure that's like the last thing in
our Dom as well I think if you follow
this rule in general you'll have an
easier time you won't end up in these
situations where the keyboarding flow
feels a little bit thrown off and
hopefully this is you know kind of a
heuristic that you just keep in your
back pocket you want something later in
the document visually later in the
document put it later in the Dom alright
so that is my my takeaway here
be careful reordering things and Sarah
thank you so much for sending in that
question on Twitter if you out there if
you have any questions on Twitter you
can always ping me @ at-sign
Rob Dodson that about does it for today
so thank you all so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
