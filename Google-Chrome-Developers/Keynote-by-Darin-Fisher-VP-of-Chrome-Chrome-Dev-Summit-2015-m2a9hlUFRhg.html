summit it's really awesome to be here
with you all we have over 300 of you
here in Mountain View joining us live as
well as many people on the livestream
it's really fantastic I also want to
give a special shout out to the live
streaming viewing parties that we've
organized in Montreal Waterloo London
and Paris and to our friends joining us
in Paris I gotta say this for everybody
our thoughts go out to you thank you
everyone for being here today I just
want to take a quick moment and reflect
on where we've come with chrome so
chrome has been a product we've had
chrome out for a long time on desktop
but on Android actually it's only three
years old it was in 2012 when we first
brought chrome to Android and we've been
working very hard to make it a much
better product on mobile to make sure
that we are building the best web
platform we can to help developers reach
users on mobile through the web a lot of
works gone into chrome a lot of works
gone into making the web better we're
going to be spending time today tomorrow
talking about that we've also chrome
chrome teams also put a lot of work into
the webview and for users on lollipop
and later it's the webview and chrome
I'm very pleased to say the webview and
chrome both auto-update together and
that's a fabulous accomplishment so
we're really excited about the things we
can do to make the web ecosystem
stronger as well as to make the web work
better in the context of native apps so
I put this slide up last year last year
we had 400 million users on Chrome on
mobile where we were very proud to share
this and this year I'm pleased to
announce that actually the number is
doubled or up to over 800 million users
on Chrome on mobile
so we're excited about this obviously we
put a lot of work into Chrome it's great
to see users liking the product but I
think it's really exciting even more so
because it means web developers get
access to this set of users with a
modern up-to-date web browser that
implements modern features on the
platform and it makes for a very large
addressable population of users for web
developers trying to reach users on
mobile so we're gonna get into some of
that but first I want to spend some time
talking about the web and we talked
about this last year but I think it's
worth highlighting so the web has many
many many virtues things that are great
about the platform but one that really
stands out is that it's low friction and
really stands out that it's low friction
and what I mean by low friction is that
to a user trying to engage with
developers when it comes to the web
platform interactions are just a tap
away a user taps on an ad a user taps on
a search result a user taps on a URL in
a tweet and they end up taken to a
website what does that mean they're
they're landing on the front door of the
web developer the web developer now has
a chance to interact with that user
presents some experience allow the user
to interact with their service develop a
relationship there's no install friction
this is really powerful it means that it
means that just that the experiences you
can build can be presented to the user
right away there's no need to get them
over some install hump and so we're all
about trying to make this work better
and I wanted to spend a little time a
little more time digging into numbers so
earlier this year there was in June
there was a comScore report that was
announced and it had this sort of
numbers that on average users have about
25 apps installed that they interact
with every month on their devices when
we look at chrome browsing data we see
that on Android users are opening over a
hundred sites every month and what does
that mean that means that well not only
four times larger but it means that the
users are interacting with four times as
many developers if you think about it
and this Reach is really interesting
really interesting if your developer and
to put this into more perspective of
those apps that users are interacting
with each month 80% of that time is
by just the top three apps this is also
really interesting and in that report
they they looked at monthly unique users
they looked at the amount of traffic
that these top sites and top apps are
are seeing and so comparing the top 1000
apps to the top 1,000 sites they
actually see this kind of disparity that
there's actually a lot more unique users
reaching those top 1,000 sites than the
corresponding top 1000 apps and this
Reach is really powerful again and it
makes sense given the low friction
nature of the web just to tap away to a
whole new experience just to tap away to
the user being unengaged with the
developer they never never never never
interacted with before and the other
fascinating thing that they should
reported on is that this disparity is
growing in fact the mobile web traffic
is growing at a much faster pace than
app traffic by factor of 2x again
looking at the top 1,000 sites compared
to the top 1,000 apps and then when you
zero in on just the top 50 apps you see
that it's only the top 12 that of those
apps that have a corresponding site that
actually enjoy more traffic on their
native app than on their web site and
these are the youtubes the instagrams
the Pinterest of the world makes sense
but it's not very many apps that enjoy
that sort of benefit and so earlier this
year Flipboard put together and launched
a whole new responsive design mobile and
desktop web experience and they reported
an astonishing number that they saw a
75% increase in their active user base
on mobile thanks to targeting the mobile
web I think this is really impressive it
makes a lot of sense though again given
the reach given the low friction nature
of the web this is a great quote all
great apps need to be on the web
especially the mobile web we totally
agree Chrome's focus is helping you all
be successful at doing this and so I
think it goes without saying at this
point and it's obvious that the web is
critical should be critical to your
mobile strategy some of the strongest
the smartest businesses today are
targeting the mobile web and you can see
how that plays out and so for Chrome's
teams perspective we're trying to try to
make the web work better this means
figuring out how to make the web really
work
but I want to call attention to the fact
that the web it's not just Chrome so
although we have 800 million users on
Chrome on mobile and that's a very large
user base there's a lot more users on
mobile and we we really care about the
web being great and that means that
everyone should enjoy a modern web
browser a modern web platform on mobile
and so our we're very committed to to
working with standards bodies working
with other browser vendors working with
web developers working with others in
the community to build new web standards
features for the bleb platform to that
are built to last that other browsers
are going to adopt so that we can move
the web forward in a very positive way
we've been having a lot of success here
and we're getting only better at working
on building standards I'm very excited
about that and so I want to take a
moment to take a drink of water but just
a second I want to talk about the things
we've done to make Chrome better make
the web platform better and it's really
along these axes axes have a reliability
performance and engagement and let's
just get into reliability so when I talk
about reliability not just talking about
does it crash or not I'm really talking
about can users count on the web working
can account on the mobile web experience
being good for them and when you think
about mobile what are you thinking about
you're thinking about unreliable network
connections flaky network inconsistent
access to the Internet and as a web
we're talking about web apps
well web apps are deployed over the
Internet so their reliance on the
Internet
and so this is a chance this is an issue
but I want to say something crazy which
is that I think as a developers
targeting the mobile web we shouldn't
assume a consistent network connection
we shouldn't count on that and so we
said with this in mind we really set out
to try to build at enhancements to the
platform that would make this the case
that enable developers to reach users
even in the presence of really poor
network conditions and our answer to
this is the serviceworker API something
we talked about last year and I'm
pleased to say that this has been
deployed in chrome for some time now and
users and developers are creating great
experiences on service web service
worker and we're going to talk more
about that a lot throughout this whole
presentation today too
but the service worker in the nutshell
so you so you have context it allows a
webpage to designate a piece of script
that would run outside the context of
the webpage and that's that script has
the ability to serve network requests on
behalf of the pages of your pages it can
control both resource fetching and
caching and gives you the kinds of
control you need to create a robust
experience offline just so for instance
I understand that the verge is live
blogging this event today and they're
live blogging app actually uses a
serviceworker so that it can be robust I
think that it makes a lot of sense you
can imagine conference Wi-Fi is not
always so hot and being able to have
access to such a tool in the presence of
a poor Network makes a lot of sense so I
encourage you to check that out another
example that's really great to see is
the Guardian so the Guardian did
something quite simple actually they
deployed a Service Worker so that
instead of a user experience being like
what you see on the left there Chrome's
error page when you're offline instead
of a sad dinosaur what you see instead
is a crossword puzzle so they're able to
provide an experience that's interesting
when you're offline I think that's a
that's just a clever use of
serviceworker and and not terribly
complicated to add to an existing web
app so another thing that's really great
like I said we're seeing a lot of use of
serviceworker and over 2.2 billion page
loads per day through serviceworker this
is actually this is this is great I want
to call out that this is pretty evenly
split across desktop and mobile and for
those in the know this number does not
include the serviceworker used by chrome
itself for the new tab page the new tab
page is actually the special variant of
the Google home page that use the
serviceworker we actually use it in
Chrome so that we can make sure that the
new tab page is always fully functional
whether you're online or offline now
performance I want to spend a little
time digging in here we put a lot of
work into making the engine faster and a
lot of focus has been on understanding
and characterizing performance and when
I say performance I don't just mean
micro benchmarks JavaScript micro
benchmarks JavaScript performance is
important and I don't just mean
traditional pagelet performance what I
really mean is the things that users
really care about responsiveness
interaction when you when a user touches
your the phone and they tap on something
on your application it should be
responsive it should ease it should it
should indicate that it's listening that
something is happening animations should
be smooth etc so we've taken to
characterizing performance with a metric
that we call rail and I want to
introduce this we're gonna talk a lot
about this today and tomorrow and rail
stands for reaction time animation time
idle time and load time so let me just
detail this a little bit so reaction
time the idea here the guidance is
within 100 milliseconds your application
should respond to the user input it
should indicate that something's
happening it's if it can't complete the
task then then a progress indicator is
present something so the user
understands that that I got you I got
this I'm working on it
animation time this is your classic 60
frames per second the gold standard this
means there's only sixteen point six
seven milliseconds to get work done and
that includes the work that the browser
needs to do and so we're very focused on
making sure people understand how to
achieve good animations in the presence
of these kinds of constraints and what
that really means is making sure your
idle time is man your idle work is
managed properly and our recommendation
is the idle work is chunked up to the
units smaller than 50 milliseconds this
means that the idle work that maybe is
being is happening in the background
isn't interfering with your apps ability
to be responsive and we'll talk a lot
more about how to manage that and then
of course the classic load time and here
we set a very aggressive goal of one
second you think about it this is even
the very first time a user navigates to
your page being able to achieve a load
time like this is important it it
doesn't mean your whole application has
to load but it means that enough of your
application should have load it so that
you can start interacting with the user
and can start responding to them so you
can start showing progress according to
the key to what your app needs and I
think this is really important there's
of course tools like service workers
such that that allow you to manage your
caches and make sure that subsequent
loads are always fast but even the
initial load should be fast and tools
like HTTP 2 and new protocols like quick
these are all designed to help here so
put it all together these are the kinds
of metrics that were really focused on
the kind of user experience we're
we focused on things that make sense to
users and I think we're gonna spend a
lot of time like helping web developers
understand how to achieve good rail
metrics but also chrome team as chrome
team we've put a lot of energy into
making the engine faster along these
same axes so this has been a big focus
for us as well
just looking at chrome itself and so
under the hood we've I'm pleased to
share some of the stats some of the
improvements that we've made there's
been a ton of work and this is just
capturing a few items a lot of focused
work went into v8 and the garbage
collector and on the whole we're
actually reducing memory javascript
memory by 10 percent but on sites that
use a lot more of javascript actually
the reduction is even more and this just
comes from being a lot smarter about how
we're managing the garbage collection
and doing all this
cleverly at idle times so that we're not
interfering with the things that the
page needs to do is all very important
we've also made a lot of strides on
startup time and power reduction power
reduction in particular on Mac has been
a big focus really delighted about that
so there's some great stats moving on I
just want to call attention to amp the
amp project that was recently launched
by Google accelerated mobile pages and
to put this into perspective
the way I look at it is it's a great
great prepackaged way of doing static
content on the web that achieves great
rail performance so following this it's
like a it's like a guide rails to help
you achieve a really good performance on
the mobile web so I'm very excited by
that and polymer is a more general
solution for achieving great performance
in the web again not only heavily
focused on making polymer faster but
also polymer includes a whole bunch of
elements that are designed to enable you
to have a very easy time creating web
web apps that are interactive deal with
large data sets and so on in a
performant manner achieving great rail
metrics it'll be a lot more talk about
polymer later on and so engagement is
this last area of focus that we've had
and I want to call attention to what I
really mean by engagement which is
reengagement helping users get back to
your site so it's one thing that they
have an easy time finding in the first
place so how do they how can you help
them reengage with your website and the
two main areas of focus here really
helping you get on to the home screen
and helping you re-engage to push
notifications these have been features
that we've deployed launched
I want to talk more about them so the
one stat about homescreen that I just
want to call attention to is that we've
seen a real rise in the efficacy of
home screen icons so in other words we
see a lot more traffic 79 percent
increase in launches coming from home
screen icons to websites and this all
makes sense it's what you expect you
expect it to be an effective access
point and indeed that's true so one
thing that chrome does is if a user
engages with the website a lot will
actually promote to the user that they
might want to add that site to the home
screen now this is caveat that the site
is has a service worker has a manifest
and so on but here's an example of such
a site tsumo JP it's a real estate real
estate site in Japan they see about 70%
of their traffic they have a native FF a
web site about 70% of their traffic is
on the web site they integrate it with
Add to Home screen and they get this
kind of experience and a user who's
using the site has an easy time putting
the site onto the home screen and it
just works great for users of the site
push notifications this has been a big
focus of ours I think everybody
understands what it is but it's about
allowing you sites to the web web
developers to push notifications to
chrome that will then be represented to
the user on behalf of your site so on
the left here you see Facebook who
rolled out push notifications to
everyone asking the user to accept push
notifications from Facebook and then on
the right there you see on the home
screen of Android a notification from
Facebook and below that you see an ebay
notification eBay is also working on
integrating with push notifications in
Chrome this was very exciting and in
particular Facebook a couple months back
had their ad still at scale conference
where they had this presentation they
were talking about the mobile web and so
on and the work that they've done to
improve the Facebook calm on the mobile
web and they had this slide up that was
want to read to you it says mobile web
matters mobile first cannot mean native
only and we totally agree this resonates
absolutely that's great to see this and
another great example of of how
effective push notifications can be
beyond the rack
so this ecommerce site deployed push
notifications and saw some really great
that's all of the users who reengage
with their site through the push
notifications they spend on average 72%
more time on the site and they spend 26%
more money on the site this is pretty
pretty great stats and it's not
surprising because you can imagine that
they're able to deploy a very targeted
and timely notifications to the users
and we're seeing quite a large volume of
notifications flowing through chrome up
to 350 million push notifications every
single day just a month ago this was 250
million so it's growing rapidly and
across the world we're seeing about
2,300 sites using push notifications and
this is also growing rapidly which is
great to see so I feel like all of these
technologies put together are really can
really transform the mobile web and
transform people's expectations of the
mobile web the idea that mobile web
experiences can be reliable it can be
resilient to poor network connection
conditions the idea that they can be
fast fluid interactive responsive the
idea that that they can be being the
gauge mccann be strong the idea that you
can be on the home screen they can have
push notifications the experiences you
can create on the mobile web are just
profoundly better and and I think this
is very exciting to us we're very
excited about the kinds of experiences
people are creating with these
technologies and it really reminds me
back to like well well over a decade ago
when at that time pages were very static
people tap on links and a whole page
would reload think of MapQuest if you
pan left or right in the map and it
reloads the entire page and what do
people discover they discovered Ajax it
discovered if xmlhttprequest and so on
that they could use these technologies
to incrementally update pages and with
that ushered in a whole new sort of
decades worth of innovation on the
mobile on the web and I feel like some
of this stuff that we're talking about
here with serviceworker really has a
chance the opportunity to really
transform people's expectations on the
mobile web in a similar fashion and very
excited about that and so as we've been
talking a lot about this we've taken to
calling these web experiences that
people create progressive web app so I
just want to introduce this name because
we're gonna be talking a lot about it
throughout the rest of the conference
and beyond so progressive web apps
I think this name works because you know
you think about like progressive
enhancement
user as matei can manage of
serviceworker well they work better on
browsers that support the serviceworker
obviously but the experience still works
on a browser an older browser so your
your investments are there and you add
add the new features and the application
is progressively better or you think
about a user who's interacting with a
web site more and more and the
experience is progressively better as
the user adds the experience to the home
screen or the user enables push
notifications the experience that they
can get is progressively better or you
just think about the fact that that
these these experiences are that the
developers can create progressively
better experiences overall so very
excited about progressive Web Apps and
the kind of technology the the kind of
experiences that people can create using
the technology that we've developed and
I just want to call attention to one
such example which is flipkart.com
and they are the one of the major
e-commerce players in India I think one
of the things that folks may be familiar
with is that earlier this year they
famously turned their mobile website
into just an ad for their native app but
shortly after that I think some
developers there got got very excited
about thinking rethinking their mobile
web experience and looking at features
like serviceworker and some of the other
work that had been going on in the web
community and they started rebuilding
their mobile experience mobile web
experience around these technologies I'm
very excited to share with you
flipkart.com which just launched last
last week so I'd like to roll the video
now please it's like you to pay
attention carefully as you watch this
video here and notice some of the
animations and the interactions notice
how smooth they are and how fluid they
are and how quickly the applications
experience even when the data is not
there it's changing state it's showing
progress
something is happening in response to
your interactions it's always very
responsive to you and now we're gonna
tap on this and chrome is prompting to
add to the home screen and you see the
icon appear on the home screen and then
when we launch from the home screen what
we actually see is a full screen
experiment experience gone is the
location bar the browser
and so we can flip back to the slides
and I just wanted to call out some of
the tweets that we're seeing I mean
first off this experience is very
delightful to people and you see some of
these tweets like for example if you've
not checked out flip rock duck
flipkart.com and chrome you're missing
out on the future of the web Flipkart
light is the fastest web application
I've ever seen or Flipkart that light is
working as smooth as butter even on 2g
awesomeness awesomeness indeed I really
agree and I encourage you all to check
it out it's really impressive and flip
cards actually hear that they're gonna
give a talk later today detailing and
getting into some of the details of what
they built it's very exciting and so
Flipkart's a great example of a mobile
web app that has really taken to heart
these sort of things they built a very
reliable experience and performant
experience and engaging experience and
in a market place like India where
network conditions are so poor actually
the fact that it works as well that it
works so great is really impressive to
figure the fact that they're built an
experience that not only is resilient to
poor network conditions 2g connections
but it also builds an experience that
initially works well even on such
networks it's very very cool to see and
so I think the theme here is that chrome
team is all is working really hard to
try to help you all be successful in the
mobile web and we're going to get into a
lot of details about what we're doing
along those lines we have a lot of
different talks lined up to share with
you on how we're trying to help you be
successful and in particular I want to
call out in addition to libraries like
polymer that are an amp that I showed
before there's also tools like dev tools
which are there's a lot of work going
there to try to help expose rail metrics
and so on but also documentation efforts
like web fundamentals and MDM we
actually contribute a lot to mdn to
document all the new api's that are on
the platform very excited about that and
I just want to I want to emphasize this
education point by giving an example so
right here I have a stat so we did an
experiment we studied the effectiveness
of Chrome's autofill the autocomplete
feature so as your fill
forms Chrome will suggest contents of
those forms for users and actually this
feature increases people's form
submission rate by 25% pretty darn cool
it turns out though that Chrome is
guessing what what to put in the fields
right and sometimes I think we all have
experienced this chrome gets it wrong
browsers get it wrong and user has to go
and frustratingly fix up what chrome or
the browser put into that field turns
out there is a feature of html5 which
developers can use they can add an
autocomplete attribute to all the input
fields and they can tell the browser
exactly how to interpret those input
fields and this makes these auto
completely the autofill features perfect
right because the developer knows best
what the intent of those fields was
browser shouldn't have to guess and so
with education we have the ability to
get people to realize that they can make
changes to their websites that would
dramatically improve for example though
chances of a user completing a form
submission and I think that's really
interesting so I want to call attention
to another thing which is today Google
and Udacity teaming up to offer a web
nano degree this is very exciting so
it's all about helping developers learn
how to learn the best practices on how
to create we leverage all the
technologies have been talking about the
things that go with the ingredients that
go into creating a great progressive web
app very excited about this please check
it out and so what's next well as I was
saying we have a lot of content for you
today and tomorrow today is going to be
all around detailing how did how to
build progressive web apps getting into
the tips and techniques on that as well
as detailing and previewing some of the
new features that are coming for example
the Bluetooth API and then tomorrow is
going to be all around performance and
tooling and then looking for looking out
further seems like it seems like we
should do this more often so we've
actually decided to hold this conference
twice a year so we'll see you again in
six months next time in Europe thank you
very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
