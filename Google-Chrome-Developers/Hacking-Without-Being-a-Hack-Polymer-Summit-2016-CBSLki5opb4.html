development was in a college class that
class it was nosy web at splash for the
web dev class where essentially we spent
an entire semester just making web apps
and migrated on them the one problem
with this class though is that they
taught zero HTML or JavaScript and on
top of that I to make a twitter clone in
the first few days so that's right
invented fritter and something to be
real with you guys I had zero idea what
the heck I was doing and just like any
college student who had zero idea what
he was doing I looked at the smart kids
were doing and that's when I discovered
jquery it was like a gift from the gods
I can I can just do whatever I want it I
could command the Dom I could add an
event listeners to whatever I wanted to
but it was a garbled mess of dollar
signs in parentheses but it did teach me
something really important about web
development the power of the JavaScript
library and I got a little bit carried
away but first fritter needed a back-end
and you can't have a cool back end
without a note in express right and on
top of that i found out i was completely
just trash and making things look pretty
on the web so here's a library for that
and actually a it all signed to be built
with gold apparently and then after that
I came to contact with the beautiful
thing that we call the JavaScript date
class so there's something right there
actually I have zero idea how to use
that node so i just copied all the
content straight into the index dot HTML
file um well and then you can't have a
cool app without Mongo DP right scratch
that i have no idea to use MongoDB so
there's a library for that as well and
then also there's some more library I
like to this day I have no idea what
these libraries do but they're in there
they're getting loaded so here they are
actually also I don't know how to use
semantic on node so I caught me several
megabytes of CSS and JavaScript strained
to the index HTML but this was fritter
and when you use all of these
technologies together with zero plan he
always result the exact
in thing and these are real commit
messages by the way and I call them the
four stages to irresponsible hacking so
stage number one confusion then stage
number two even more confusion stage
number three anger and stage number four
I need a break but to me before polymer
and web components this was hacking with
the web a slow over encumbered mess but
it worked and of the problem with this
project that I never want to look at it
ever again and uh it's absolutely
impossible to extend without starting
from scratch so that's why I'm here
howdy everybody I'm Elliot Marquez I am
a software developer on the polymer team
and that's my hashtag right there there
might be a poly mon you never know there
isn't and i want to welcome you to
hacking with the web Elliot's tips for
survival so first question right off the
bat what do I mean by a hack a hack I
will define as a software project or
hardware project that is built quickly
off and haphazardly but it gets the job
done the fancy word for that is MVP and
the next question you might have is why
the heck would anybody do this to
themselves well alright say you have
investors coming over and you gotta make
sure you want to get some money and you
got to get show them a little bit of
technology so you maybe want to make a
prototype or say a tech blog they
release your product earlier than you
expected so you know that deadline that
you have at the end of the month no you
don't give that's next week or say that
you sign up for a hackathon so for you
guys and so for anybody that doesn't
know of a hackathon is a convention or a
bunch of nerds come together to make a
really cool software and hardware
projects with the limited amount of time
and unlimited amount of coffee and so
the reason that I know about hackathons
is because I went to one the polymer
team in early September we went to Penn
apps which is the oldest student-run
hackathon in the US and it's hosted by
the good ole University of Pennsylvania
and there we met a bunch of students
either they were new to web development
or we had some seasoned hackers
but they all had something in common
they didn't really want to hack with the
web and the reasons range from either
they didn't know what what development
was or how to do it or some of them just
thought what hacking with the web was
just like my old project fritter but as
soon as we introduced into the beauty
that is polymer and web components they
fell in love with the web so you get to
understand these students came from
generally Java or C++ backgrounds so
they really liked how web components
added a object-oriented like programming
experience to the Dom in HTML and on top
of there just blown away by CSS
encapsulation and it sounds a bit silly
right now but if you think about it
before shadow Dom this was a really big
issue and so watching these students
labor way on web projects I was able to
see some development patterns emerge and
that's where i came up with Elliot's for
tips to hack and responsibly so tip the
first do not repeat yourself I repeat
myself do not repeat yourself tip number
two pass only what you need tip number
three go full front end with and tip
number four slit by feature ok so tip
number one do not repeat yourself so a
shout out to grey to steve saw earlier
and monica's coming up soon you have a
timeline for each vehicle be a lazy
color write less code of ways to do this
is that you can write you can write
elements that fit into dom repeats or
you guys and gals as well have made
amazing an amazing web fonts community
out there so just HTML import something
that somebody else is made and just copy
pasted tag it's really easy and you may
think you you may say Elliot maybe this
is gonna be something more permanent I
want to keep it around so actually now
uh well you will so actually the first
year you got to write ultra extensible
elements as well so what I mean by that
is a is instead of writing a bunch of
boilerplate code right and writing an
element for each possible use case right
elements
that will handle multiple use cases and
then you'll ask but Elliot I want to
keep this thing around I want to make it
more permanent later on well in that
case you just you just gotta rely on web
bunch right there web components makes
it really easy to scale features back
and move things from the back end and do
whatever you want later on okay a tip
number two pass only what you need so
polymers data binding is a powerful tool
that can shoot you in the foot so at the
hackathon we found that a bunch of the
hackers for passing a list of objects to
multiple children this creates multiple
multiple models duplicate models and the
issue with that is that duplicate models
are bad so now you have a bunch of
models that are supposed to be
synchronized with each other but the
issue is it's really easy to make these
unsynchronized each other so what this
ends up at what this ends up causing is
a bunch of elements that just don't
respond to changes or change too much
and now you have a bunch of get eco
that's really confusing so you got to
remember that just like helicopter
parents a parent element should control
its child state all the time not of its
neighbor and and the reason is because
you gotta keep it modular wait if your
if your element relies on it some papers
internal state a shout out to grace hawk
talking about the mediator model you're
not keeping it modular and web
components for designed to be modular so
I assure you if you write your code to
be modular then you'll run into a lot
less you'll run to a lot less issues
like spaghetti data binding and are
unforeseen view changes take number
three go full front end so instead of
switching between multiple modes of
thought you just use from the front end
make it the star of the show the apt
toolbox is great it can handle routing
it can handle layouts it can handle
storage you can even handle offline
capabilities for example um putting iron
pages and a prat together you can remove
most needs for a bat for a back-end
router and so you're going to say Elliot
but I want to keep this around just a
bit longer so weapons like I said makes
it really easy the the talker order this
morning
bedding and sorry about ing really
exemplified this web components makes it
really easy to scale things back and
move things to the back and you already
have an API sort of established alright
tip number four split by feature so say
you're unlucky stuck in this hole with a
team so you want to split the work by
feature and experience so before before
web components he would split the work
by pages and so somebody would make the
main page somebody make the login page
somebody would make the messages page
it's like creating a completely
different app all every single time so
now he would split by strengths and
experience so say Bob over here he is
terrible at making lodge of elements but
he can make dirt look like gold he's an
amazing web designer Jane over here
she's an amazing web Zener as well but
she's also a really great logical
elements maker it's like routers for
days but that's it but so in this case
you would have Bob over here make the
visual elements Jane over here make the
logical elements and Xing you know I am
your parallelizing and also with web
components a great thing with
parallelization is also with polymer
you'll probably be making be working on
completely different HTML files so
you'll have so you'll probably run into
a lot less a lot less merge conflicts a
real big issue I actually had a friend
in college who would have a force merge
that would just delete everything
anybody else did and the one coffee I
about this tip though is that requires a
lot of communication with the team make
sure you communicate your api's
effectively and so you know what you're
getting out of each web component tip
number five step back calm down and grab
yourself a beer or coffee whatever you
whatever you love um so beers great
stress isn't so great have a beer also I
hear there's a thing called science and
it created this thing called the Balmer
curve and as you can see with some
alcohol you become an amazing coder asd
so in case you need to prototype
something or you have an unexpected
deadline or you just happen to wake up
in the middle of a hackathon do not
worry remember my five tips to hacking
do not repeat code that you do not need
pass only what you need to child
elements go full front end with our app
toolbox split the work by feature and
experience and finally step back have a
beer coat some more and congratulate
yourself some more beer thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
