we about to enter 2018 mm-hmm and so I
was thinking about what I want to do in
2018 and what I'm excited about and I
thought I would let you ask me questions
about one thing that I make about in two
minutes two minutes okay go the import
function okay it's a function well
technically no but it's a difference
what we've already lied to me in one of
the words no okay we have static imports
in JavaScript yes we do as much in
modules so we say import a table from
blah blah blah and then you get a module
and you can use it yes but sometimes you
don't want to do it at the start right
because right now all of your modules
have to all your important modules have
to download before any of them run yeah
exactly and sometimes you have something
like a spinner that you want to use but
you don't really block the execution of
your module unloading the spinner which
you're gonna use much later or something
okay so you this idea is this is
something that you can defer the loading
off exactly so it's hang on I knew you
would load a spinner this way what are
you going to display while that's
loading okay so maybe not spinners maybe
not okay but like deferred routes oh
yeah or whatever kind of models you want
later on if you view that it's not you
don't need yet and later on you need
then you can load it on demand and
that's where you have now a dynamic
import little function that works the
same as setting import but it's
something you can call in the middle of
your code and returns a promise ah okay
and then it resolves with what was it
resolved with the module exports and a
special name called default which is the
default export export excellent okay so
this is all of those hacks we currently
use to load JavaScript dynamically go
away and here's a fun fact it's not a
function it's not a fun why is another
function because its syntax that's not a
good reason that's just a word or word I
actually don't know the exact reasoning
but I think they had it as a syntax and
not a function so you can't hack it you
can't overload it and hook your own
functions it's supposed to be like a
security mechanism I think okay but it's
just an interesting fun fact on the side
that really shouldn't affect you in your
daily life as a developer at all
excellent so can I use this in regular
JavaScript or just modules
just modules because it is a module so
in that just make sense but I mean you
can just use script type module and then
you have a module and you can use
dynamic import so those hacks just go
away it's gonna be a great you're at a
time last time either goes 40 seconds
left transform streams transform streams
is it we have readable stream and right
real stream yes what is it transform
stream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
