I'm the tech lead for the amp project
for Google tecnique means that I kind of
manage the team that works full-time on
the amp open source project for Google
and I kind of also wrote like some of
the code I guess which is important
because we kind of want to dive into how
am works today and how it achieves its
speed and so even if you know amp might
not be for you because you're working on
an online banking app or whatever you
know you can still take advantage of the
techniques that we that we use and make
your own thing way faster that it might
be right now
so I said and it stands for accelerated
mobile pages which is kind of stupid and
I'm never gonna say again but now you
know what it means and it's really all
about super fast content on the web now
amp is an open source project and it's
launched inside Google in our you know
search engine which most of you probably
use every so often and you know we have
this carousel here it just boom goes up
so load times are way way way faster and
we see on a normal web and you can swipe
between results which is also not
something that you can do with an
everyday web page all right so that's
let's amp it's you know you can go to
your browser so search or something
newsy and you should see these amp
results so you know amps pretty fast but
we haven't talked that much about how
fast it is and we frankly didn't know it
was an experiment but it's been out
there for a while now and this is what
we're seeing across all traffic where
Google search is leading to amp results
and so the median load time is under one
second
the exact number is actually 711 so it's
pretty substantially under one second
which you know if you've heard about
rail and like that's really where you
want to be but one important part of you
know performance optimization is that
you can't only look at your median user
that's important because 50 percent
haven't even better better experience
but 50 percent are worse so what we
typically do is we look at the 99th
percentile so that are your users that
have a really bad internet connection
loading the biggest webpage right and so
for them we're still seeing load times
faster than eight seconds which you know
might seem slow and I find slow and I'm
not happy with but if you look at the
control group of similar pages that are
not amp they have an average load time
of 22 seconds so the one percent worst
amp loads are still much better than the
average non-employees which you know I
think it's pretty exciting and all of
this like the one second that we see it
the median is obviously not instant but
through a technique that I'm going to
explain today called pre-rendering you
go from fast so instant number that we
mentioned yesterday is but there's quite
some momentum around amp and so looking
at the Google search index there's the
crazy number of 125 million Doc's and
growing every day and obviously this
could be like only Wikipedia but where I
find more you know exciting and actually
pretty humbling is that there's
apparently 640 thousand web pages
already different domains you know who
in some form or another implement a temp
which i think is really really cool
and it's a little early it's an open
source project and we are shipping new
releases every week very recently we
finally supported menus which I you know
agree as everyone else is kind of an
important feature we're currently
working on forums and we're supporting
all kinds of features like the pretty
advanced like client-side templating and
on the next slide there's actually my
favorite analogy about am is looking at
this like auto race there's the average
mobile site and it's you know it's kind
of in the back it's definitely not
winning and what I find important to
emphasize is that if your hand tuning
your site you are going to win this race
right amp is not about winning this race
but impossible being up there in front
and more importantly all amp pages are
pretty uniformly up
in front and I think if there's any
secret sauce to how this works is
probably my answer is going to be the
amp validator that's m'kay he's on my
team it's not actually the aunt
validator but this is how this really
looks so you can go to every web page
and add hash development equals one to
the URL and then you will get these
error messages are hopefully none but
you know they're just like compiler
errors and because we're developers and
we used to this like forest it's just
like a to-do list and we're like oh cool
no I'm just gonna fix them that's
awesome the other effect this has and I
might just speak from personal opinion
that you know sometimes you might like
have some disagreements about what the
right thing to do is and so you know in
this case the amp value you can just
come in and say like no that's not a
good idea
cool so going from like these that basic
stuff let's go into how amp works so
obviously we develop this radically new
rendering engine for documents which no
we did not because why would you I think
it's amazing
we're in 2016 and there are all these
browsers and they're all great right and
looking back 10 years that was not the
case so I think we're exciting times for
web development where you know if you
don't really have to worry about
browsers anymore and so amps they're
just web pages there's you know they
don't have a special rendering engine
there's you know for just web pages and
that is why everything that amp is doing
internally to gain a performance is
basically equally applicable to all none
and web pages diving into what's going
on there I want to first talk about
front loading or rather front loading
and I have to tell you secret and I hope
my friends on the chrome team aren't mad
about me but here is browsers really
hate web fonts by the way it's my son
and he's extremely unimpressed with like
in general you'll see and throughout
this presentation so here's here's
what's going on that's why I'm saying
they hate web fonts
so apparently developers sometimes put
like font face annotations in your CSS
that they don't really use on a page so
brows are really careful about
downloading fonts in fact what they do
is they look at your CSS and then they
look at all the other CSS and then they
look at all your JavaScript and then
they apply the styles to the page and at
the very moment where they like could
have rendered the page they go okay I'm
gonna go to the network and fetch the
font and you know Chrome Firefox image
will wait three seconds for the font
Safari for exam will wait forever and so
the font is entirely in the critical
path of rendering your page so getting
that optimized is extremely critical for
good web performance
summarizing all your style sheets and
all your synchronous trips that are in
the hat block font download encode that
means if you have link rel stylesheet or
you have a script source those will slow
down funds from even being started to
put on the network now M has certain
rules about how it likes HTML HTML to
look and for this reason what we say is
you can have style sheets but they have
to be inline in the style tag and yes
there can be script tags but they do
need to have the async attribute which
then takes it out of the critical path
and browser will happily try to render
the page and all of the fonts and the
result of that is that Ann can obviously
having download the document which is
kind of important for rendering it
initiate the HTTP request for those
fonts with zero HTTP requests in the
critical path which is a big improvement
for performance so there's a problem
though and that is why the slide exists
this slide is actually trimmed down it
looks much much worse in reality because
there's window prefixes going on but so
every empty command contains
this bit of boilerplate and well I think
it's pretty cool technique it has some
problems so what's going on because all
the script tags have the acing
attributes but the some of them are
actually needed to render the page you
would get an incomplete renderer early
in life cycle which looks not very good
and so one common technique to avoid
that is to manually hide the page by
saying for example visibility:hidden and
then when the script loads say okay now
it's visible so while that works is that
it has one important downside if for
example your network fails at that
millisecond and that strip never
downloads it could happen that the page
just stays completely blank because it
says you should be blank and that's why
I think this is such an brilliant idea
which came from like some person
commenting on a github issue why don't
you use a CSS animation as a timeout
mechanism so what's going on here is
that amp will go and after eight seconds
show the page if the JavaScript fails to
load so typically the JavaScript as we
see it's much much faster and actually
very likely to be in cash so it it's you
know you would never reach that eight
seconds but it's very important that you
have this extra robustness where a page
you know will eventually show if there's
no JavaScript great so with that I want
to talk about my favorite topic which is
static but responsive layout so for this
I'm going to show you a little video and
I'm just going to ask you to read the
text so when I was first thinking about
amp I had this you know one idea that
this is really the worst thing on the
internet and if I would do anything at
all and I would make it so that just
this would just never ever happen and
now I'm going to explain to you why it
can't happen and and it's
you know again pretty simple so in amp
every single element has to have its
size defined in the markup and it's much
easier to see what that means in code so
in amp you use this web component called
amp - image to load images and while on
a normal image tag you can leave out the
the width and height it's mandatory on
this web component so what will happen
in the browser it's when it like has an
image tag and there's no Whitson height
on it it will say mmm it's probably zero
pixel height right and then it will go
to network fetch it and it comes back oh
it's not zero pixel high because why
would an image V 0 pixel high and then
everything moves down right and so with
mandatory width the height you know
browser can put a box and then fill it
in when it when it's time to have the
image back from network now with this
requirement to put that whitson height
in the source code he might like ask you
know how does this work together with
responsive design and I really want to
emphasize that amp is from the ground up
designed with responsive design in mind
so here's the answer and that's actually
a great example of how web components
can be really really nice in web
development so all you do is you put
layout equals responsive on the element
and what ample then do it will say thank
you for the width and height I'm gonna
use that to calculate the aspect ratio
and I'm going to size the image to the
available space horizontally and make
the height based on that aspect ratio so
coming from this there are those
situations where you can't predict the
size and again this is also a nice
example of the collaboration on the open
source project where I initially was
like you are the luck you can't do
anything and then publishers were well
sometimes we do kind of need to resize
things and so we gave in and came up
with I think a pretty good model to make
it work nonetheless
so when amp thinks about a page it
considers things based on where they are
relative to the position of the
viewports the viewport is what you
currently see
the stuffs in viewport and if you
already scroll down some stuffs above
and if you know there's always probably
if a page is longer than a viewport
there's going to be something below and
so in some things below the viewport and
it says I would like to be a bit bigger
than originally planned then am says
that's cool because that can't really
affect what's in the viewport similarly
but slightly more nifty if it's above
the viewport you can still allow
resizing because you can we know how the
height changed you can just subtract
that from scroll top and you end up
having everything that's in viewport
staying at the exact same spot as before
but finally we come to stuff that's
currently in viewport and their amp is
again pretty opinion in says you cannot
resize it that is until the user
actually interacted with that element so
what you can do for example if you need
to resize and pose just say no but you
can show a little button to say like
allow resize and then empal will say
user agreed that's fine and then from
that moment on that thing can you know
change its size however it wants great
so from that I want to talk about the
next topic so M it's designed in the
modular fashion so basically it knows
very little like about how to do
anything I can load images and like
simple videos and text obviously but but
that's that's about it and for
everything else there's extensions which
are just web components you load you
think about tweets instagrams YouTube
videos all kinds of stuff there's
touching some of them and so they load
them you put the script tag on your page
and again has the async attribute so
that it doesn't block the page and then
you put this in this case amp - YouTube
tag on your page it has the width and
height which is pretty predictable for a
video typically and then the video ID
and but the thing with web components is
when the browser sees a custom element
like am - YouTube and it hasn't actually
learned what it means
it will go hmmm let's draw it like a
span like I don't know what Whitson
height means let's make an inline
element right and that is not the best
default and it leads to the same kind of
effect of the page jumping around and
it's so bad that there's even a name for
it so it's the flash of unstyled web
components and there are several ways
how to work around it the easiest way is
to just wait for the extensions to load
that would actually be similar to a
technic technique were using to wait for
the main script to load which is the
visibility hidden and visible thing that
I explained but we wanted to do better
because if you know some more complex
pages might have like 10 extensions and
now you have the HTTP request they have
to actually finish for something to be
shown they they pile up so instead and
can render the page before all
extensions are loaded and here's how it
works
so the core amp javascript library the
one that is blocking page layout it
knows how the layout elements even
though it has no idea what each of
videos so it goes and says okay I
actually know what width and height
means I know what layout responsive
means I know what layout fixed height
means there's several of them and it
will draw a box it's not actually great
by default but he can make it gray in
CSS obviously and then eventually you
know that YouTube extension downloads
and then that you tip extension will say
and fill in that box and that is a load
behavior that we're all used to because
that's how images for example usually
load on the web and I think people
really perceive it as a as a decent
experience so to summarize in amp the
extension sizing is independent from
their implementation so you don't have
to know what YouTube is to make a box
for YouTube video the extension are
loaded with an async script so they
don't they don't block anything the box
is reserved immediately and then they're
filled with content with the extension
loads
all right coming from this fruity and
specific thing I want to come to a topic
that is really applicable to every
single web app out there and that is Tom
mutation batching so there's simple rule
that everyone should follow which is
that you should not eat relief reading
and writing to the Dom unfortunately
it's actually really hard to do this in
practice here's a contrived but not that
unrealistic example about how you would
do this so your code might say like
window dot cat computed style measure is
something and then based on that it
would set the height of something and I
will say I how high are you and then you
say like oh that other thing has to be
size as well and then what's your height
like so this you know you might not
write code like this but if you have a
team of more than one person and there's
more than one thing on the page going on
you're quickly getting in a situation
where in each animation frame you might
do these various operations that are you
know acting on various parts of the page
and it comes with a big problem which is
that browsers when you read from the Dom
when you say like what's your height or
what's your width or or any of these
like things that require laying out the
page they trigger
recalculation of style which means that
you know they figure out like how does
their CSS affect the page layout all
those Dom elements and so those those
reads trigger a style recalculation and
if you want to make an application that
runs at 60 frames per second you might
be able to you know a for two of those
even though you really shouldn't but at
three your mobile device is gonna pass
out and say like I'm gonna jank this
hell all of this fortunately there's a
very easy way to make this much better
which is to slightly change the order in
which operations are executed so like
here if you first do all the rights and
then you do all the reads from the Dom
there's exactly one salary calculation
triggered and as you can see it's pretty
easy to imagine that this essentially
scale so
number of operations now it's really
really hard to manually write an
application that's larger than one file
to adhere to such a strict rule so
that's why there are helpful libraries
that make it relatively easy so if
you're ever looking at the amp source
code it has a library called vsync where
you can say like I want to measure
something on a mutate something and then
that library says okay I'm going to
execute all the measures and then I'll
execute all the mutations and also FM
there's a very popular library called
fathom that does a very similar thing
and it really helps with the easy API to
make the Dom operations executed in an
ideal order with that I want to move on
to the next topic which is analytics so
obviously analytics is really important
like you want to know how many people
come to your app what they doing were
they clicking how much time they spend
how they scroll and that's really great
but what happens is sometimes you know
more of them come in and I actually have
this like went through this myself where
you would like talk to the salesperson
from the analytics vendor and they would
like say you know we have this awesome
new metric and I'm like okay and so like
we're switching to them and you realize
that whether it's a new vendor like your
that's one thing you're always reported
to your manager
slightly dipped I mean you don't love
research and you realize users there's
not less users it's just that you know
that new vendor interprets that metrics
slightly different and so you're panic
and you put the old thing back in and so
in practice that happens all the time
and and so we're seeing sites that have
like five ten fifteen of these and it
turns out that you know basically too
much of everything is really bad for
performance however we kind of
challenged yourself thinking there's
really very little you can do about this
being a problem so would there be a way
how you can have both so essentially all
you can eat analytics and still have
good perform
and the solution that seems relatively
you know obvious in retrospect is to
separate instrumentation from reporting
so in amp the instrumentation so the
thing that measures your stroll progress
that measures clicks exits only once and
it's built into amp and then it can
report stuff so however many times you
as a developer choose so basically what
what it's the deal is it empty knows how
to talk to major analytics vendors and
then just basically pink stem says like
user scrolled and they and they
interpret that information and if you
have for example in-house analytics or
amp doesn't directly support your
favorite vendor you can you can add
configuration yourself in fact this is
how it looks on the open source project
so just randomly chose comScore and this
describes how to create a request when
you track a page view with comScore so
essentially there's just a rule saying
you know use this host and then this
base URL and then put this stuff in on
the back and so it basically just have
this configuration that says given an
event like a page view how to construct
a URL so that then come score tracks
that as a page view and and this file is
pretty long and basically for every
major vendor and all the events they
support has this small rule set and that
is how you can like talk to them all but
only pay the cost of figuring out when
you need to talk to them exactly once
with that from analytics I want to go to
the final topic and it's slightly
different because it doesn't necessarily
apply to the general web and that's
instant loading so as already like
talked about very quickly at the
beginning instant loading is achieved
through pre-rendering and through
rendering means that you render
something before the user said I want to
go there so on a Google search result
that would mean we think they probably
click on the first result yeah it's not
the worst guess so let's run that
already and that obviously comes with
some problems right because the user
might not go there but now you already
used that bandwidth and that's CPU and a
mobile CPU mates battery and that RAM to
render the page and that can be really
problematic and it was in fact that so
problematic that the native version of
rent rendering which is link rel free
render is essentially unusable on mobile
now to solve this problem we went
through a series of insights that led us
from it being essentially impossible to
working really well and the first
insight which is by the way the most
important insight when you think about
performance optimizations in general is
that humans are actually kind of slow
and I mean that in the best possible way
so our reaction time is you know in the
order of two seconds so from that you
can say in order to appear instant you
only have to appear instant you don't
have to be actually all the way done and
here's what that means in practice so
this is a typical website right now it's
actually not a typical website because
this is a typical website it's really
long but for something to appear as
having loaded instantly the only thing
that's really important is that the
thing that I actually see when I go to
the page is already done everything else
you know because reaction time is low
like I can start downloading all the
other images for example
that incident where I show the page when
the user actually clicks it so what amp
does when it's in free render mode
it will go and say any resource that
isn't visible by the user the instant
the pages actually shown to them will
not be downloaded at all during free
render mode and so that saves you know
all the bandwidth that you know it's it
wouldn't have been necessary in the case
where the user never goes to that page
and you know it's pretty typical for you
know a page that maybe have like one
image or two images in the first seaport
but over all the pages have many many
more images and so not tunneling them
obviously saves a lot of bandwidth that
leaves the harder problem though which
is CPU and RAM usage on mobile which is
a big big big problem and in amp so you
know amp is relatively well optimized
and so we're pretty confident that CPU
usage of amp itself is okay but ample
outs Loing loading all these embeds and
so you know might be YouTube videos
instagrams etc and so first of all M
doesn't control them and you know to be
honest some of them actually do use a
lot of CPU and for this reason and this
what's that what's that all the way
clear can't do it again
so when am pre-render is a document it
will not actually load any of the
extensions implementation so in the
youtube case you can actually do really
well because you can guess their poster
urls and so and we'll put a poster on
the page and so it really looks complete
but the expensive part which is the
YouTube iframe that looks like 500
kilobytes of JavaScript isn't actually
loaded and so when the user then you
know expresses intent that they want to
go to the page and want me to go and say
like okay well you load the YouTube
iframe because now they might want to
actually watch the video but again the
page you know looks pretty complete and
so that user gets that gratification
that everything's done even though in
fact not everything is done
and so with this these two techniques
only loading stuff that's actually
visible and only loading stuff where we
know that the CPU usage and REM use is
relatively minimal you get the
capability to pre render pages on mobile
where it's really busy and feasible with
a general web page and so again like you
have seen initially with the development
equals to 1 again you can put a fragment
parameter on any empty comment I can try
this in their browser and say pre-render
equals 1 and that puts any M document in
free render mode and you'll see it's not
really useful for yourself because there
won't be any images loaded that aren't
in the initial viewport so you can
scroll down and nothing loads um same
with all the embeds they're gonna be
missing but the page you know as far as
the first viewport goes looks very
complete and then there's an equivalent
postmessage api we can tell the page
you're now actually being shown to a
person dole out everything else and that
together gets that you know that's how
basically Google search works so in
google it would load an iframe with the
m page and tell it's your pre render and
then when the user clicks that sends a
quick post message to the iframe saying
like now you're actually being shown go
crazy loading everything you need and we
said that was kind of all I wanted to
talked about in terms of optimization I
wrote this blog post a while ago it's
under J dot and P slash amp - speed and
I do have the URL again at the end which
goes through the entire list of
optimizations that all M pages have and
I'd like to say they cannot not have it
because amp really guarantees that those
optimizations are applied but I think it
can also be used as a really nice
resource just as all the things that
might apply to your none and web page
still you know I'm personally very
impatient and I'm not satisfied at all
with the speed of amp so what is you
know your favorite amp site is still too
slow like it might use an extension that
it's not very optimized or you might
find that you find some education and
where amp
so and I think that's actually the most
exciting thing about Amp which is that
you can actually help you know as an
open source project you can send a poor
request and we're shipping every week so
I think it's actually pretty amazing
that you have this level of impact
because every em page runs the latest
version so if you send an page to amp
and you saw there was like four hundred
sixty thousand domains using it a week
later they will all run your pull
request and so you can really make a big
difference and what I like to say is
that this has been working so far and we
really want to thank all of you for
sending these contributions so I'm going
to github last October and we've so far
got into 1954 requests but what's even
nicer is that it comes from 160
different consumers and so you know I
have a team but it's not 160 not even
close so it's been a really really cool
collaborative effort and again thank you
all because we wouldn't have been able
to do it without you
few more things in terms of bookkeeping
because I really want to point to this
it's not actually a book but I thought
it was funny
so this website called my example.com
and so I'm personally you know I know
JavaScript not the best web developer
and this basically just says like
examples for all the things you might do
in amp and you can that's like what's
the output and the source code and it's
just copy-paste yourself to happiness
it's really useful if you want to get
started with em another shout out is
that Google actually yesterday launched
an API called the NPR API and so this is
applicable to you not if you want to
make amp pages but if you have either a
web app or native app that has links and
you might want to say it'd be good for
our users if we pointed them to the amp
version of those URLs and you can so you
can call this URL and say hey it's
through an amp version for this and they
will say yes or no basically
coming from this it was first shown
yesterday and it's a topic I'm super
excited about so my talk is almost over
I would ask all of you to go to the
amphitheater after this 3:00 p.m. where
Alex Russell will talk about how AM
relates to progressive web apps and it
turns out that those work really really
well together there was a nice demo
yesterday of a Washington Post which
totally impressed me
and it's also it's an anagram if you
turn around to w anyway
that's really all I have here's the link
to our Docs our github and again the
blog posts thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
