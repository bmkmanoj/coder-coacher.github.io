a part of telenor the norwegian telco
and we run the service called appear in
and i'm doing all the weapons he stuffs
there I want to talk about debugging
tools and techniques for WebRTC and
answering the question what happened
when a call went wrong so web receive
works great usually like ninety-five
percent of the time knows it's great the
video quality is awesome the audio
quality is good and everyone is happy
most of the time especially when you
test locally because then you don't get
packet loss however in production bolts
fail one percent or less but they do and
people can't hear each other we've seen
marcio saying that and it's true
unfortunately and there's a large decent
for example between audio and video we
had that in February and people describe
the quality is horrible whatever quality
means and whatever horrible means and
let's not get me started on it our
problems like chrome and firefox not
playing well with each other or chrome
not playing well with Microsoft edge and
I've seen frequently browser upgrades
breaking things so every six week I Oh
something broke okay great if you want
to read more about that I have block on
medium and lots of stuff there so you
get user reports they say oh the call
failed the audio is bad or the video is
bad and then your product manager or
your customer support person is going to
ask you what happened so what do you do
then how do you answer that question how
do you figure out what happened and
maybe what action do you take so let me
show you some of the tools and
techniques I use so
so in terms of tools there is most
importantly Chrome's web police
internals page firefox has the page
about WebRTC and most likely you will
end up building your solution or use
someone a service like where wounds
though Firefox is about whether you see
it has very basic compared to Chrome's
page it shows you all the connections
that are currently active it shows you
the STP and it shows you how the
connection is established so chose the
ice candidates and the state rooms
whoever's internals page is one of the
tools I use most often it shows you API
traces and statistics for all calls for
all player connections and at the top
you can see over here you get all the
connections you get all you get user
media requests you get all the
connections and for each connection you
get the configuration and you get those
API traces on the left side they
basically tell you all the peer
connection cults that happen and on the
right side and at the bottom you get
mystics which are sent to the we're
producing turns page every second and
yeah ipi traces are really useful to
figure out what happened in the call
like when was an offer created did you
get any set local description failure
calls and all that and for example you
would call at stream of the peer
connection and it would show Oh a stream
was added it had this label it had this
audio track and it has its video tracks
that might be important if you for
example expect this to happen with an
audio on the video track and you only
get an audio track here for example then
the user might not have a camera and you
can see how the SDP offer is created
it's what options like here we are
looking at something where we call it
with create offer to receive video and
offer to receive audio so we want to
receive audio and video and we can also
see the set local description call which
shows you the whole SDP it's a big blob
of text if you want to know more about
that there's a great weapon Seahawks
post on that and you can also see all
the on-ice candidate and add ice
candidate events which show your how the
network's behaves what the IP addresses
are that are used to connect you can see
the ice connection state and how it
changes from checking to connect it then
completed and that allows you to
understand the network behavior of your
application you also get these
statistics algae right and your
application can get the same information
that is displayed here which he gets
that's API it shows you things like
whether this is the active connection
that is used currently it shows you the
IP addresses however this shows a good
local address don't use any stats
prefixed with gooks they might change
any time without notice and it shows you
the remote app us as well and for
example it shows you number of bytes
received number of bytes ends and number
of packets sent and you can measure how
the application is behaving on the
network and at the bottom you get a lot
of statistics graph which basically Paul
gets that every second and you extract
the metric from that like bites and and
you make a time line graph which is the
time on the x-axis and the value on the
y-axis and for example here you can see
the number of bytes sent per second in
the number of packets sent per second
it's all nice and stable 1.6 megabits
per second and about 200 packets sent
per second there's no big variation here
so it's flowing nicely that was a local
host connection so no packet loss and
you can also see for example the goop
you gook and code usage person which is
a measure for the encoder CPU usage and
if you use this for reporting that's a
fan swear spinnings that is
graph to look at and another example is
here for example the frame hate input
from the camera and the frame hate sent
on the network that should usually be
the same unless you have bandwidth
adoption because your band was not was
not sufficient or the CPU was not if not
sufficient to send that frame over the
network so basically there are three
steps when debugging something using
representer NAL's the first step is to
get Adam second is reading it and the
insert is importing it somehow I'm going
to walk you through that process so
first you navigate to the Chrome Web
producing holds page then you expand you
click on this great dump and that gives
you a number of options first or the
second insert are quite important when
you need to file a bug they get you
dumps that the google developers will
ask for because it allows them to
understand the behavior of chrome much
better than what we can get from
javascript and what is more important
for you is this button download the pic
connection updates and stats data which
gives you a big JSON file usually and
you can interpret that yourself we're
even I don't interpret Delta two usually
and it gives you a big JSON file which
contains a lot of information and good
luck if you want to read that yourself I
sometimes do that I try to explain it in
back reports and nobody can follow me
them and you can import it I have a tool
written for that it's on github it's
open source which basically takes this
dump re important into a web page shows
the very same information that we have
on we're producing Eternals on purpose
because we have this quazy standard here
and it adds the ice candidate courage
from firefox which is not on chrome
super pretty internals that is useful on
quite often and one nice thing it shows
me by the green
you'll see whether the connection
succeeded if it fails it will show me a
red eyes connection state change so I
don't need to expand all of these states
and then look at them saves me 20
seconds per day so Colts failing the
typical thing to look at is the ice
connection state change and you're
looking for a value of failed there and
if that happened you should check
whether you're using turn service as
chad said you should and whether you
getting real a candidates both in the
on-ice candidate and the add ice
candidate calls and a read a candidate
basically looks like this the important
thing here is the type relay and I have
a whole talk about 20 minutes and you
should get those candidates from both
sides if not something is happening in
the network UDP might be blocked TCP
might be blocked and the user can't get
out in any way and another thing that
Massey already said people don't hear
each other it happens quite often on OSX
and windows and the issue is that if you
send your laptop to sleep too often
chrome can't open the microphone anymore
you don't get a signal from the
microphone and you can see that in the
statistics so here we have a time line
graph 110 seconds on the y axis we have
the audio input level here which is zero
the whole time that could be perfectly
normal if the audio if you microphone is
muted more importantly there are no
packet sent for that period and that is
not normal and you can get that from the
get stats API so you're calling pc get
stats and then you're dealing with your
results you're looking for a report
which has a scent in the name and then
you are looking for a chrome specific
report type SSRC and the media type
should be audio then you're parsing
because chrome stats are a little behind
the spec the report the bite sent and
check was it 0
if you do that you can show a warning to
the user and we got a lot of complaints
about this issue we see it in about 23
percent of the calls which is very bad
but Google is going to fix it next year
and after we show the warning to the
user and recommended that they restart
the browser to reset the application
states the complaints drop to zero you
want to read more there's a blog post
about that so something we saw in
February was a very large decent between
audio and video so it was no longer lip
sync which is very annoying and we gotta
I was working for tokbox at the time we
got a customer report audio and video
are decent then we try to figure out how
to measure that and after some hours we
found this gook target delay millisecond
which describes an intentional delay on
the video to sync up with the audio and
well we saw this graph and we thought
 this increase in this linear way
over time and we saw nope and we filed a
bug and it turned out to be an issue
with specific cameras where the time
stamps were often this decent was
growing it was pretty severe in chrome
47 and Google fixed it very quickly
after they could reproduce it and the
bug fix got back all the way to stable
more about that URL if you're interested
so the quality is still horrible after
you fixed all those things so I'm going
to show you some examples of what to
look for for example if you look at the
sewerage you can see here graph showing
the packet loss over time and you can
see the packet loss is cumulative and
you can see for events where there was
packet loss and typically in those cases
the bandwidth adaption will reduce frame
rate and resolution and the user
perceives that as blocky and bad video
quality you could also have the packets
lost being continuous like in the blue
line and it happens as well it is
different kind of packet loss but you
need to deal with votes
and if you look at for example the
jitter which see here same graph for the
same call we can see huge spikes in the
jitter typically if the teacher is
basically smooth and you have little
variation low variance it's good but
those bikes are really bad that was
about 23 seconds that case and round
trip plan Varun talked about it if it's
smooth it's good if there are spikes
like this it's bad and that was two to
three seconds and that was really bad
and 100 to 400 milliseconds are
acceptable depending on where your calls
happen the globe so another thing to
look at is usually the resolution in the
frames per second so we can see here
that there was an issue in the call the
blue line shows you frame hate over time
and at this point it drops and stays low
for one and a half minutes and at the
same time the number of frames sent went
down so during that period basically
there was not enough bandwidth to censor
frames over the network and in reaction
to that chrome first dropped the number
of frames per second start dropping
frames to reduce the bandwidth and then
reduce the resolution and yeah but you
can also see in that case is that the
CPU usage drops a lot when the
resolution goes down because the encoder
has less frames to process and less
bytes to process another thing to look
at is the bandwidth estimate so in
represents the two piece is continuously
estimated and you want to know how much
bandwidth is available and what we can
see here is that secon started good and
then went to a bandwidth of about 600 k
and then suddenly there's a drop here to
40k and it starts ramping up to 600
again stays there for
a second and then drops down ramps up
again jobs I'm zup jobs amps up is
stable for a while and then drops again
and when rams up and that kind of
behavior is going to be very annoying
for users because what happens then is
that the video quality reduces and it is
perceived as bad though it's caused by
latency and packet loss usually and will
result in that video quality so that
call was not very good user experience I
don't want to be on that call when that
happens so wherever you see internals is
a great tool however there are some
limitations and the most important one
is that you can only you need to ask the
user before things happen to have chrome
we're producing turns open and then send
it to you so when we had this decent
issue we couldn't reproduce it locally
and these requests two weeks or more to
get it done from the customer who
reported it so then we started doing a
saying to automatically collect that
data for each and every call we open
source stood it has it is available on
that URL is a joint project between us
and talk box and you just include a
single line of JavaScript before any of
your weapon disease stuff so it's just a
single line no integration you can have
more a deep integration if you want to
but it's optional and it transparently
modifies all Z we're pretty see api's
and inserts itself into them and that
way you can create the dumps like you
have from where police internals for all
sessions at you run which can be quite a
lot of data and you send all the API
traces center gets that's data to a
server and then you can really figure
out what is going on and as a summary as
a customer support person is going to
ask you what happens now you have the
data to answer and the data is the API
traces and to get stats data
and you can try to figure out what
happened in the call most of the time
honestly it's just bad internet there's
not much you can do but there are some
cases where you're doing something wrong
like not running turn service and you
can figure that out and if you spend
that time it uses well Indian be happy
and use your service more and your
service will grow hopefully and with
that thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
