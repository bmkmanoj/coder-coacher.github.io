try to like you know do the whole
work-life balance thing okay and just
like you know I put my so I took my iPad
with me and I work phone and that's a
good start to work-life balance I only
have my work phone I only have one fun
and that's my brain okay but so to
enforce the work-life balance thing the
phone lived in the safe in the safe and
that's of course a Faraday cage no but
it keeps you in the microwave mate it
keeps me out that's the point - in the
fridge maybe I feel I've not been very
good at the work-life balance in my past
vacations it's I had my phone it has all
my private account of my work accounts
on it so what chat is on there and work
email is on there as well
and so you have this whole you're
browsing things might as well check into
work email and then you read something
you're thinking oh I should react even
bigger on vacation it just it keeps you
engaged in a way that it really should I
find that even if I'm you know not
deliberately going to my phone to check
work stuff I end up doing it well be out
and about and go oh I don't know how to
get to a place so I'll use you know naps
and so I plot my phone and while I'm
there I see tweets and I see the start
of it like saying you know this article
is stupid and and I'm like and even I
might read yes because if I don't
respond then then in my mind is just
gonna be like walk I talking about what
if I got wrong is it genuinely wrong or
are they drawn and you know the way kcd
someone is wrong in the internet and it
might be me it might be then I need to
find out I think I feel like for some
reason you feel you have this obligation
to respond to people quickly yeah if
it's a person you don't know on Twitter
and they're like you know insulting you
for the stupid article you wrote there
is no obligation for you to respond
within 10 minutes of him authoring that
tweet yes you can do it two or three
days later I think this topic is just
interesting because every now and then I
see tweets about people who like having
the time to work on software web
development every aspect
yes a master's privilege and then I see
other people tweeting oh it's the week
and what should I do
wrote on this Twitter poll if I should
learn react or if I should learn and
like this is probably not healthy I know
for myself at some times I have the
massive project my hobby is also my job
or has become my job right so if you do
your hobby a week and you are doing your
job
in a way yes yeah but also the other way
around if I'm working I'm kind of doing
my hobby and I feel that this absolutely
should not be an expectation for anyone
no no I don't think it is but it's
become culturally normal in racine in
the startup scene I feel like you're
expected to have or some companies look
at you get a profile if you have not a
consistently green contribution by
meaning you have committed something on
every day of the week mmm you will have
less chance of being out than somebody
who does do that
whenever I interview somewhere which has
been a while but I you know that bit
where they say do you have any questions
yeah you know every interview someone
that's that the question I ask them is
you know your employees your your
developers they're working late or a
weekend because of a deadline yeah
do you see that as just something that
happens or is a failure in planning okay
cuz it has to really be one of those two
things yeah the answer I'm not looking
for is it's just it's just what we do
yeah that shouldn't be the answer I
think it can be that's something that
happens because it is incredibly hard to
do planning but then there must be the
second thing that says you will get that
time back
right okay that's that's fair yeah
saying it just happens and it's expected
to deal with it that's that's the wrong
answer
the correct answer is yeah you know it
was a failure in the planning but we
couldn't have been predicted but here's
how we deal with it as you say you get
the time back is it's really the ideal
answer you have a wrong answer or
probably the worst answer is that
doesn't happen because that means that
manager is unaware of it happen more
lying and both are not good qualities in
a manager exactly so so yeah and I felt
like it's somewhat ironic because I was
on vacation with no browsing Twitter and
I saw these tweets it's the weekend what
should I do
I was like that my first reaction was oh
I'm just playing literally stupid games
on my iPad maybe I should be working on
a side project
he was the time to expand my horizon
right and I had to convince myself and
it is okay to what might be perceived as
wasting time but I have noticed that
doing following your gut and just
allowing you to be lazy if there you
feel like it is so refreshing it is such
an energy boost
we are definitely saying this from a
point of view of a company which does do
it right yeah like a lot of people are
working weekends because their job
depends on it I mean yeah absolutely
working longer hours is not does not
scale no but that will bite you yeah if
you do it for too long so what's your
answer then summit like if someone's
working putting you on the spot are you
saying or you've got they gonna change
job right that's that's I've seen this
argument before it makes me angry like
people like oh if you have to work if
you have to support ie11 I would switch
jobs I was like not everybody has to
prefer to change a job right absolutely
like I know that in our line of work
specifically web developers there's a
massive demands so you usually can say
I'm just gonna leave Company A and I'll
be pretty confident to find another job
somewhere else
usually in web demand that will work
because the matter so make but if you
are not necessarily in that spot yeah it
can a lot harder or if you don't have
enough experience to get all these jobs
going that one ages of experience which
we act even though it's been only been
out for five yeah I know a lot of people
doing development work up north because
that's where I'm from
north of England and yeah are you I
didn't know yeah you know there's not as
many jobs are in London so that sort of
attitude of like who doesn't change a
job if you don't like it it's yeah is it
comes across as incredibly privileged
not being yeah I think as always it
requires a shift in in paradigms in the
entire field of work and that's not easy
to do but it's just something that you
as a person should be aware of that what
you're doing right now is not scalable
and that you need to take time for
yourself if you have been working in the
last three weekends or something because
it doesn't scale it will eventually you
hit 24 hours and then you can't work
25th hour and at some point you know I
crunch
Wow and dog is not the heat that of the
universe
it's not sustainable so yeah just is
that your advice just work less no I
think it's just like if you need to
fight for your right to party to not
work if you're not gonna work hours it's
if you leave the job it must be okay
people who are working more sensible I
was tend to get the same amount of work
done yeah it's that same problem I had
it last week I was working on a piece of
code and I was just hitting my head
against it for like two hours and I did
the thing where I just I walked away
yeah and just took half an hour just I
left the office I just walked around the
block a couple of times I came back to
my desk and I solved it in five minutes
that's aa I love that I love this I'm
only I hate it because it's frustrating
but I've experienced so often wears like
just take a break yeah but taking a
break while there's a code problem there
it's near impossible yeah I because you
feel like you have this entire thing
contract buildup in your niveau it will
just vanish if you leave and you have to
start over but that's really what
happens because the construct is usually
what is wrong well I haven't I think
I've spoken about it I'm on the show
let's call it show it spoke about it on
the show before is that having if I
leave a code problem and then sort of go
into a social environment yeah we could
just be like you know I think dinner
with my partner or being out with
friends yeah there is still 80% of my
brain trying to solve the problem but
now I don't even have a code editor so
I'm hitting my head against the problem
even worse than I was at my desk so the
break I took was just you know on my own
didn't have to socialize I was still
sort of roughly thinking about the
problem but also listening to fresh
oxygen and just you know getting this
record every now and then and came back
oh yeah
that's the order oh it works so yes I
was a semicolon the yes so overworked
people are bad coders but the answer if
if you're in a situation where you can't
avoid it
no I I'm not saying you have the answer
it's just something I thought about on
vacation was like I'm trying to get
better with this because I have my job
where I can but it should it should be a
high priority for more people
episode we can be spoke a lot about like
needing views and stuff and I think
there was a subtext there that it was
employee review time for us yeah
and it's done now yeah I don't actually
care no no and subscribe yeah yeah we
don't need you yeah please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
