welcome back to the show so in the last
episode I was showing you how to set up
firebase authentication in your polymer
project today I'm going to continue on
from where we left off in the last
episode and start working with firebases
real time database and so what we're
going to build today is going to be kind
of like a simple note-taking app or kind
of like a to-do list sort of thing so
follow me over here in my laptop I'm
already signed into the the firebase
console and because I want to have you
know each user have their own space in
the database for their own unique notes
I'm going to need to set up some
database rules about you know who can
write to which parts of the database so
if I if I go to the database section
here I click on the database tab if you
just set up your project you'll probably
see like a note right here that says
like default security rules require
users to be authenticated and then
there's this learn more button and you
can click on that and actually it'll
open up a new tab and it'll kind of
explain how for our basis database rules
work firebase is database rules use sort
of like a like a JSON like syntax which
is very interesting but the thing that's
really handy here is the sample rules
section so like I said I want to have
every user have kind of their own unique
space in the database and that's such a
common ask that there's already if you
click on this user tab here there's
already some example rules that will do
that for you and so I can kind of walk
through how these work so basically
we've got our rules object and we're
going to define it so it matches the the
URLs that we'll use for our database
calls so we're going to start with a
user's object kind of like right at the
root of our database and then within
that there's this sort of special syntax
here for this like dollar sign UID thing
and that is a kind of like a firebase
database variable of sorts it's it's a
dynamic rule and what that will do is
refer to you know whatever is the
current user ID that we are working with
so it'll be slash users slash some user
ID right and then we're saying who
can read to that space there you ID or
the UID space we're trying to write to
that we'll need to match the
authenticated users UID so that's for
reading and for writing so I'm just
going to copy this a bit of boilerplate
here go back to my console and click on
the rules tab I can highlight all this
paste that in there and then make sure
to click publish
so that these rules become active all
right cool so we've said that you know
only certain users can write to certain
spots in the database basically you
can't read and write to other people's
to-do lists so far so good
now follow me back over to my laptop and
let's go ahead and start start putting
some data in the database so I'm going
to create a new element called
my notes HTML and I'm just gonna paste
in some some HTML imports that I've
saved and I'll close the close the
sidebar there so we can we can bump this
up a little bit you can see what I've
got so in this element I'm importing
polymer I'm importing firebase off so
I'll show you why we need that again I'm
importing firebase query so this is what
we'll use to actually talk to you and
read from the database paper input so
the user can enter some values and then
iron flex layout and I think we've
actually maybe already imported paper
buttons somewhere else but it's really
good to import that here as well because
we're going to use a paper button too so
I'll say paper button okay rat alright
let us begin by defining an element so
we're just going to call this element my
notes and the first thing I'm going to
do is actually use the firebase auth
element again inside of my notes now I
use this in our previous episode to
build our sign-in and sign-out buttons
so here what I'm going to do is I'm also
going to expose the user object inside
of this element and what's kind of cool
about the firebase authentication that
we have kind of sprinkled in our app all
of them will sort of simultaneously get
that new user data they'll get the the
user object and so you can treat this
element kind of
a model that any other element can just
sort of declaratively bind to and
extract information about the user so
you can pop these off elements into
different you know spots in your app
wherever you might need to you know
reference the user for some reason which
is pretty interesting and pretty pretty
handy so we're going to combine that
with the firebase query element so the
firebase query element basically lets us
talk to the firebase database and
specifically talk to like arrays in the
firebase database so I'm going to give
this element an ID of query so say ID is
query we will use that later to
reference it in our JavaScript we're
going to say that it's path so this is
the the path in the database where we're
going to be reading and writing to that
will be slash users slash and then we
will bind to the current users user ID
and then we will write to their notes
section and then we will say the data
that comes back from firebase we're
going to expose that in our app as this
notes object okay so I'll go down here
to my element definition I will define
properties object for that that that
notes thing so we'll say the type is
object alright and now I want to add a
sort of like a list so I can render out
all of those to do start coming back
from the server so let's see
so we'll start we'll define a div will
just call it card or something like that
and then inside of here I'm going to
create a maybe another div called notes
something so I'll say notes inside here
like a ul and we'll call this will give
it an ID of notes list notes list inside
of here I'm going to do a Dom repeat
template so I'll say template is Dom
repeat Dom repeat the items that is
going to iterate over will be those
those notes that are coming in from that
you
and we will say that we want each note
to be referred to just as a note okay
and then inside of here we'll create
list items and inside of each list item
I will just drop in a paragraph tag I'll
get a class of content and I will say
that I want the note content so we
haven't really defined what a note looks
like but we're I'm going to assume that
it'll have this content property on it
and it'll just be the the text content
of the note itself the next thing I need
to do is I need to add some controls so
someone can type in a note and then a
button so that they can add it and it'll
send it up to firebase so I've actually
got a little bit of code for this that
I've just already saved in my clipboard
so I'll just paste that in here real
quick and we can walk through this so I
got a paper input element with an ID of
input that'll be useful later because
we'll refer to it in JavaScript and it's
just got a label that tells the person
hey take a note and then I've got inside
of that a paper button with an ID of add
we're going to refer to this in
JavaScript too and basically whenever
someone taps on it we're just going to
run this add function okay so let's
implement that add function so right
under our properties we'll say add is
function and so what we want to do is we
want to take the the reference to the
firebase database and there's two things
you can do then you can either set a
value or you can push values setting is
if you're you know just dropping in like
a single object pushing is if you're
pushing array like data up to the
database and that's basically what we're
doing with these two views so we want to
use the push method on our firebase
instance so to do that we're going to go
up here we'll look at our query element
which has this idea of query and we can
say this dollar sign query dot ref so
that's going to be a reference to that
path that it just defines so slash users
user ID notes so give me a reference to
that path in the database and then push
an object to it and this object is going
to have one property which will be
content and then that's going to come
from this dot dollar sign dot input dot
value so that's just our input text
field
and after someone hits the Add button
it'd be nice to clear out the text field
so I can keep adding to Do's so right
after we've pushed the value will also
say this dollar sign dot input dot value
equals no okay let's switch over to our
terminal and fire this up so let's say
firebase serve mm-hmm and then go to
localhost 5000 we will open up our
console in case where you know because
errors happen sometimes we will go and
we will start typing a note so let's see
we'll say hello polycasters and we'll
add it and there we go
now it's showing up inside of our list
so that actually you know that just sort
of confirms that everything worked we
could if we want though go over to the
firebase console go back to the data tab
and you can see these green these green
rectangles indicate that we just wrote
some data to the database so you can see
users my crazy user ID notes and then
this unique ID so every time you push
something to firebase and you can be
working with array like data instead of
using numeric indices like 0 1 to
firebase will actually create unique IDs
and this is really useful because if you
have you know a bunch of different
people all trying to push to the
database at the same time if you were
using just like numeric Keys like 0 1 2
you could probably end up with some like
weird transactional issues so instead
firebase creates these sort of unique
identifiers so it can do the bookkeeping
after the fact to make sure data gets
synchronized and pushed together in the
right order and I can see inside Piro
the actual value content hello
polycasters what's cool about you know
the firebase database this is probably
my absolute favorite feature of firebase
is it's super easy to play around with
the data once it's in there so for
instance if I want to change this to you
know finish the demo right I can just
update the text so finish this demo and
hit enter and now everything turns
yellow to indicate that it changed I go
back to my note-taking app you can see
that that value has been updated here as
well so we can add some more you know to
do so we'd say go out and vote it is is
November 8th as I'm recording this and
then we will say
hopefully celebrate question mark
question mark yeah so we can keep adding
things to this to-do list if we want the
next thing I want to do though is I want
to be able to delete items off of my
to-do list and this is this is pretty
easy to do as well so we go back to our
our code editor and I'm going to add a
couple more imports up here to the top
so I'm going to drop in a let's see I
got a couple of these safe so I'll
dropping a paper icon button and I'm
also going to drop in iron icons now I'm
only going to use one icon from the iron
icon set and so normally I would say if
you're if you're using only like a
handful of icons from the iron icon set
it's best to go and create your own icon
set you can do that pretty easily using
iron icon set SVG and literally just
like copy and pasting the stuff out of
iron icons but because we're just doing
a demo I'm not going to go through
making my entire icon set so I'm just
going to use iron icons directly but for
performance overhead it's often a good
idea to just create your own icon set so
I'm going to include a paper icon button
and then basically right after where
we've we've written the the content for
our note I'm just going to drop in a
paper icon button
I'm given giving it an icon of clear so
it'll be like an X and then I've got
this property here called note and I'm
actually just setting a property on the
paper icon button I'm setting a
reference to the the entire note object
that this this line item is referring to
and the reason I'm doing that is because
I'm going to use the the key of that
note to then go on and delete it in
firebase and so lastly I've got this on
tap event listener here and I'm saying I
want to call this remove function so
let's implement that remove function so
let's say remove is function gets an
event so we'll say that the key is equal
to a current target dot note dot key and
I think maybe they use like dollar sign
key to reference it in firebase new key
I think that's right yep and then we're
going to say this dot Belair sign query
dot child and then we will give it the
the key we're giving it this this value
right here this dot child key dot remove
so that basically says go to the
database find the object that matches
this key delete it so go back to the
Chrome's actually before I do that I'm
going to drop in some CSS as well to
make this look really pretty
so right right above our our far based
off will drop an a big style block and
honestly I mean you don't really need to
worry too much about what I'm doing here
I'm just sort of like positioning things
so our icons floating to the right and
our text is to the left using iron flex
layout nothing nothing too interesting
so I'm not gonna spend too much time on
it but I just wanted the demo to look
nice go back to the Chrome's refresh the
page and now we have our notes showing
up here we've got these X's showing up
here and I can go and X them out and Oh
what we got an error this dot dollar
sign that query dot child removed is not
a function y see what I type wrong here
ah ah I need to have ref dot child let's
try that again refresh the page and we
will boom start deleting items yeah yeah
and we win we're all done I think yeah
so that about covers it for today uh we
covered some of the basics of working
with the real time database we've got
user authentication working with this
app the next episode I think I want to
explore maybe how we how we you know
deploy this thing and get it working on
firebase hosting might might might try
to come up with some other interesting
topics to include in that episode as
