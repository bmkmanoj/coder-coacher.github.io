positions please then climb remind me
again why we're wearing suits now
because they said make it jazzy and we
decided that i meant suits she was a
mistake here like a enterprise Java
developer or something like mostly we
have time to change it let's change it
for Jake come on we don't have time for
me we'll be fine we'll be fine we'll be
fine well do you need those sorry about

comfortable now hey you've got 10

my luck
you
what was that beginner's luck welcome to
chrome dev summit 2016 how is everybody
doing in the room oh oh oh no no no no
you can do better than that right open
the top how you doing right on the back
the front the front gets it the left the
right and the live stream wait that's
not gonna work that's no favor actually
speaking to the live stream if you are
joining us on the live stream thank you
so much there'll be viewing parties
around the world people in their offices
in their homes thank you for joining us
it's lovely to have all of you here we
know it's very busy and that's awesome
that you've made the journey to come and
see us today absolutely we also have
some you know matters to deal with
before we get on with the show solutely
do one of those things is the code of
conduct we have a code of conduct has
all good conferences or hold conferences
should have got something like this you
know we encourage you to be excellent to
each other by saying hi to new faces and
building on one of those ideas and
reporting any uncomfortable experiences
of course we have a zero tolerance
policy for harassment of any kind and
please do share your experiences either
the positive or negative with speakers
and the staff and the code of conduct is
posters around the building and on the
website apologies for reading out from
my phone it's the official statement I
want to get right but from a personal
perspective like we've been in the
industry now like over 10 years we're
kind of part of the old crowd now and I
don't know if it's too optimistic to say
that in that time things have started to
get better a little bit slowly but
surely but it feels like now more than
ever like we need to double down you
know you know we need to be kind to
everyone welcoming to everyone and we
need to be heroes to those who aren't
having a great experience like no matter
what's happening out there we need to
make it right in here
in this industry
so we've got two days worth of talks
breakout sessions code labs panels and I
mean as their talks are done the videos
will start to go up onto the website as
well so keep an eye out for those and
you can also set notifications for any
sessions you're actually interested in
on the website your shilling for some
work that you did you make the
notifications didn't you then we talked
about right you've heard enough from us
we should get things started and no
final way than to do that with the
keynote with the vp of chromes
engineering Darin Fisher please give it
up for Darren efficient
