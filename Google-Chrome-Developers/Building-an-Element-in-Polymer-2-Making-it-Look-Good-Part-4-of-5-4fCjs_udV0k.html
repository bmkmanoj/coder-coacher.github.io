back to our series on building an
element in polymer 2 in the last video
we mocked up a simple checklist now we
want to clean it up and make it look
production ready
luckily the polymer team creates a
catalog of elements called the paper
elements which are based off of the
material design spec let's take a look
there's a website called web components
org and here it has a catalog of all
types of web components that people use
for an example we can look up paper
input alright so here we have the paper
input element the paper input element
has a lot of nice things on it it has a
demo where you can change a bunch of
things like here you can change the
email to change it over to Gmail and you
see it changes right there cool so I
want to use this element and the way you
can use it is by going to this section
right here and you'll see a download
feature if you click on this it will
copy it to your clipboard you just go
over to your terminal let's create a new
tab here just make sure we're in the
right directory yes from the polycast
checklist directory and just paste in
the command so this is going to install
the paper input element as a dependency
so if you look over here back in the
Bower components directory where it
installs all of our dependencies you'll
see paper input show up and then again
in the bower dot JSON which is the
configuration file for Bower you'll see
that our dependency now includes paper
input all right so now let's go use it
so polycast checklist let's go into the
paper input directory and within there
is the paper input HTML that you can see
right here and so it's type of that
write in paper - input HTML and it found
it I also know that we want to replace
the button and the checkbox and I know
for a fact that we also have paper
button and paper checkbox
let's do the same thing for paper check
box copy
go to the download over here paste it
into our terminal
go back find peeper button copy this
right here go right over to the terminal
paste it in and install alright so now
let's import the other two paper input
and we have paper check box and then we
have paper button so here we have our
check box let's replace it with the
paper check box check box but and we
don't need that anymore
and this input let's replace it with a
paper input and we don't need this
anymore now let's fix the paper button
to a paper button cool all right we got
that going
let's go refresh the page see what we
got nice looking a little bit better
it's not really styled up nicely but uh
we can fix that and here's a button down
here alright we'll go back and start
doing styling so here you can just make
a style tag within the template and here
we will add a class to this div and call
this a task and in style we'll select
that task and then we can add styling to
the task you'll notice here that I just
called it task this isn't something
you'd typically do in a normal HTML and
CSS project because task is such a
common name and you can be using it all
around and I don't know about you but
I've always had a lot of issues where my
CSS just coloring everything all over
the place and restyling everything
luckily polymer uses web components web
components have a spec called shadow Dom
and shadow Dom encapsulate syou're CSS
only into that node so you can call
tasks and you can call anything else
outside of the element
equals tasks and it won't get styled by
this rule that we're making right here
all right so let's actually start
styling so here we'll make this a
flexbox display flex and we will align
the items so vertically we'll align them
straight across through the center and
this will be a center and then let's
style the paper input onto the same line
as the check box because as you see
they're on different lines and that
doesn't look really nice so to do that
we can do display:inline-block simple as
that all right let's give it a quick
refresh ooh something's wrong oh I don't
need these right here there you go it's
a bit more centered but it still looks a
bit weird to me hmm
let's take a look let's add a label to
this paper input label will call this
task name and see where that shows up ah
so there you go you can see that the
task name right here is actually causing
the display jank where the check box
actually is centered but it's only
centered to the entire thing so we can
remove that by doing no label float so
paper input has a thing where it allows
you to remove the label after you start
typing so we'll set that to true refresh
there you go and when you backspace
there's chest name looks really nice so
this is looking very good we have our
repeating elements and our to-do section
looks almost complete except we can't
really add tasks to our task list but
we'll get to that in the next video
where we'll start adding some logic to
our element to the checklist actually
works
