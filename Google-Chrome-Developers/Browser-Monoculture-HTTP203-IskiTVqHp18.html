well I don't wonder why it couldn't be
in the 11 hour flight
yeah doing may I got myself a diet coke
and it was a wrong move I'm not I need
to convert this
I've got like you've got the Disco's
well I've got flying sugar to the juices
is not necessarily gonna this is gonna
be okay actually really nice anyway we
should talk about the web yeah okay so I
I was upset by something that happened a
few months ago and it was remember when
they did result in an argument on
Twitter no way she kept this to myself I
just got I just got sad inside of myself
and I held it in and this isn't me now
okay got to let it out because it can
bring other problems in your life yeah
yeah yeah so Microsoft with the use of
voice thing where they were asking
people hey like what what you want us to
work on yes I think that was breathing--
actually we should we should probably do
that one of the things that shot to the
top of the list was stop doing what
you're doing and just used WebKit I
don't know that's not I don't think
that's the right outcome but but just
the idea of them stopping what they're
doing and taking on another browsing
engine that made me really sad because I
really think it's the diversity of
browsing engines which which makes the
internet a better place well we have
this when we when we
to make blink was it wasn't about one
code base one code base is not watch
what you want because then you end up
with stagnation all you want is
standards I can understand why
developers might want like a single
browsing engine right because it because
it can be a pain sometimes especially
when you you develop a thing and you
know your wonderful work of art in a
couple of browsers and then you go to
the third one and it's turned it into
some kind of expressionist modern art
when I was working at startup I had a
series of post-it notes on on the wall
right one for each browser
what like things to avoid or things no
no it was just like post-it note
Internet Explorer post-it note Safari
Firefox it's to remind you testing their
browser was that what it was
no it was cuz I'd become did you have
the list of well if you could shut up
for a moment I might be able to tell you
I had one for each browser on the wall
and then when my wonderful work was
destroyed by a particular browser but
rather than getting really angry I would
just calmly stand up pick up a sharpie
walk over to the appropriate post-it
note and just draw a tiny phallus and I
really genuinely thought I was gonna be
a grown up little check mark it was your
book did you apply the appropriate
diagram to self just to my own face yeah
right and and and because this was back
in the day you know like in the day
makeup since then you wouldn't do that
now would you no no I still would do
this but here's the difference is like
back then the Internet Explorer opposed
to note was ran out of space it was
riddled absolutely riddled me but and I
do think they you know modern-day
Internet Explorer has really sort of
turned over leaf but but they saw that
something made me really sad where
people were sort of wanting sort of
really wanting a browsing monoculture
because because we did have it with ie6
at the time yes we did and it was it was
actually awful because the web stagnated
you had a complete lack of progress for
four years the diversity in browsers
actually gives developers more power
because if you in a monoculture like say
say everyone went WebKit like who gets
to decide what features get employees it
this is this is the monoculture thing
right this is exactly yeah it'll be
WebKit that decides in the same way that
unlike native platforms like its Android
that decides what what features get
developed and I'm feeling this with with
Service Worker at the moment I know
right I know I'm only how have you been
it's only been half a day since we last
spoke right but at the moment it's in
Chrome and it's gonna be in Firefox and
Internet Explorer look like they're
they're gonna take it on as well but
Apple we don't know mm-hmm but this is
it puts developers in this position of
power because if they can make sites
work faster in Chrome
Fox and you know eventually ie then
Apple are going to look at that and
they're not gonna have to go well we're
not live not gonna have this we're gonna
be the rubbish just in the town right so
we're gonna have to implement service
worker and the people that made us do
that is real-world developers it's
brilliant more power to developers yeah
and that's what multiple browser engines
give us
