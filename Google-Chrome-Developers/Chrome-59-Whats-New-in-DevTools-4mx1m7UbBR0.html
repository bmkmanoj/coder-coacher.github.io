in debt tools in chrome 59 first up is
the coverage tab the coverage tab shows
you what CSS and JavaScript the page is
using let's see how to use this to speed
up page load time open the command menu
with command shift P on Mac or ctrl
shift P for Windows and Linux type
coverage and select show coverage the
coverage tab opens up at the bottom of
the dev tools window click reload page
wait a little bit for the page to load
and then click stop recording you can
see there's a bunch of external files
getting loaded and most of the bytes and
those files aren't even getting used
click on our URL to see a line by line
breakdown for that file so to speed up
page load time I could inline the use
code into the pages HTML and
asynchronously load the unused code
check out the rendering path Docs to
learn more about that next up is full
page screenshots for awhile now you've
been able to take a screenshot of
whatever is in the viewport but now you
can take a screenshot of the entire page
including everything above and below the
fold to take a screenshot open up the
command menu type screenshot and select
capture full-size screenshot wait a
little bit and Deadpool is eventually
downloads damage next step is block
request URLs this lets you see how a
page behaves when a URL or a pattern of
URLs is blocked this is useful for
seeing how your page behaves when
subscripts fail or maybe a CDN goes down
and so on let's see how the dev tools
home page looks when its CSS is blocked
go to the network panel right click on a
request and select block request URL you
can manage your blocked URLs in the
request blocking tab that pops up at the
bottom of your dev tools window to block
a pattern of URLs click Add and enter a
wildcard pattern when I reload the page
yep looks pretty broken which you would
expect if you disabled all the CSS also
the network panel colors blocked
requests in red
last step is the unified command menu in
the past there is one keyboard shortcut
for opening files and another one for
jumping to a line and so on it's just a
hassle to remember all the shortcuts so
now you can access them all from the
unified map when I open the command menu
there's a greater than character in
front of my cursor now that's the symbol
to run a command if I replace that with
the question mark I can see all the
other things I can do from the menu now
like running this handy snippet that's
