team has been up to in the last couple
months so first I'm Paul Backhouse one
of the poles and I'm the advocacy lead
for dev tools so i give my voice to dev
tools collect input and feedback and
tweet and do whatever else and the other
stage and i also do the outreach for amp
the x-rated mobile pages project now
we've been talking about the forwards a
lot in the last couple years we've did
we've done a lot of performance
improvements are we're going to continue
to do so lots of the front end up story
really to improve the speed of your
pages but today this talk is not about
performance this talk is about something
we discovered makes more sense in this
context which is actually building
websites you know this is the thing that
people do with dev tools as well
actually building websites and turns out
one of the audience's that just add in
particularly our designers so designers
we didn't really focus on designers when
building the dev tools before but it
makes a lot of sense because they've
been doing more and more CSS and a
couple of service that we seen recently
showed us that the most of the design
work most of the prototype work often
happens in devtools which was surprising
to us and because we thought that most
web developers would do change the
nature mail etc but not so much the
designers but it's actually really
powerful tool but it mostly stay lean
ailments panel and we want to want to
make sure that the devtools worked at
work for them work for the crowd so what
we've also discovered is that a lot of
the UI was really cluttered if you if
you look at it from a design perspective
we thought we could do better than that
and so the first thing I want to show
you is a couple of improvements that we
did in the UI and dev tools so three
things I'm going to talk about first is
how will making dev tools a joy to use I
will making it really simple and easier
the second one is how authoring becomes
a
big story in devtools and how we make
that fast intuitive and really fun and
then finally something for the debuggers
and javascript evolved us with us is
more JavaScript control more tools to
make your debugging flow much better so
let's start with how we're making
however improving the I so if you if you
do if you do work on a product that
grows and grows and grows and you put in
more stuff and more stuff more stuff dev
tools are quite complex now as with a
lot of magic lots of good tools in it
but sometimes a user interface can they
come auh which stands for user interface
and we don't really want that right
that's not what we're trying to do so in
order to prevent that we hired max max
is our new full-time designer for the
first time in history we have a
full-time designer working on dev tools
and improving everything around dev
tools and you can also already see the
fruits of his labor in many different
places so let's go through some of them
but first let me show you how far we've
got so we have two thousand nine on one
side with 2050 on the other and there's
a dramatic amount of small improvements
smaller powerful improvements that went
to the dev tools so few of them well one
thing that is new you might have seen is
the new main menu we don't clutter the
UI that much anymore but we we have
jockin now in a new main menu much
easier access all than before and much
simpler than having a long press we have
all the important tools that you only
use sometimes like inspect devices
network conditions sensors and settings
and help all in there for you to access
whatever you needed and then we also
made it possible to reorder taps that's
been a feature that's been long
requested and we finally got it not only
that but we only we also reordered the
taps by default so we brought them into
the position they make sense where they
use the most
we discovered that the console tab is
used is on second place in usage after
the element panel so we put it in its
second place which just made a lot of
sense and then we also added an overflow
menu to the area the drawer where a lot
of the overflew context of free content
citizens events the view do a global
search we put that into the drawer next
to the console because as a closeable
term because it's not something you want
to have around all the time now we add
it we put more and more stuff into it we
make the story more consistent and we
added an overflow menu to always come
back to what you wanted and then we also
improved the context menus in a few
places for instance this is the new
context menu when you right-click on a
dumb panel elements and it gives you a
lot easier control over what you want to
do copy outer HTML phones and something
we didn't have before just copy the note
you don't need to do any special magic
for that anymore you can immediately
trigger the active state of focus state
right from there we still have the other
place in this title but this is a lot
simpler than it was before so we get
that even with those improvements and we
continue doing them there are still
times where you will be completely lost
right there are times where you will
think okay what did I talk about what
just happened and that's okay right
we're here to help and if you've seen
the main menu already you've seen that
there's a new help icon and I help icon
leads to our new home page that new
homepage is not just a facelift to the
old home page but in fact it is it is
heavily rewritten so it becomes
action-oriented so a lot of the guides
and tutorials you find out site are
specific to a problem trying to solve
the performance problem sure here's a
couple of guides for that so that's
really how we build up that page and
then also if all hope is lost if you
really can't find anything and you don't
to dig through page you can still always
get in touch with us we started tweeting
a few months ago on the chrome dev tool
title and it's becoming really
successful because people realize that
we actually answer and reply
and we also tweet a lot about the latest
achievements in Canary and and what the
team is up to as soon as they come in
there so that's that that's some of the
UI improvements recently those were just
over the last couple weeks but there's
been a direct tremendous amount of you I
improvement the last couple of months
some of them you probably don't notice
every day because well a lot of it is
changing every day but about this quite
something quite a focus for the team
let's move on with how we're making
authoring fast intuitive and fun now
here's a page I've been working on
recently in my spare time and I wouldn't
prove it I actually want to create a
dark version of it I thought it would be
nice to do play with the ambient light
sensor and make a dog version so what
did i do well i have to pick colors and
i don't know about you but i'm not
terribly confident picking colors out of
blue maybe some designers are that are
very familiar with color theory but i'm
not so usually what I do is I go to
website I search for palette that looks
nice and I don't really often find what
I'm looking for I mean oh I go to some
color wheel or whatever but I thought we
could do better than that so what we did
here is first of all we made it really
really easy to add in color if there
wasn't one already so you don't have to
type in background color red and then
click on the color picker anymore to
open it we added two buttons that
immediate foreground and background
colour and now you're seeing the new
color picker that we've worked on and
what this new color picker includes is
not just a way to pick random colors
well because that's not what I wanted
but instead phone since it also allows
us to pick something from the page so
hey I see some color that I found in the
header that I really like okay I pick it
right there this was a feature that
people a lot of people didn't discover
because we didn't have that little
eyedropper icon before and ironically I
mean it was always on but people didn't
discover it because it was always on
because they did click on it first so
that's one way but then you can also do
so with a new color palette we've added
the material design
the palate to the color picker to allow
you to choose from colors that designers
have chosen and I'm really glad that
some designers that spend lots of lots
of weeks going through every little
color and tweak it spend more time on
that than I do make that choice with me
now we didn't just we didn't just trip
with the base colors that you see here
those base colors are nice but they
don't work in every context in the case
of my background on the page they don't
work I want to have a very light a very
dark color so instead we also ship with
the shades and the shades come up if you
long press on one of the colors so you
can long press on the colors and pick
whatever you need to in this case this
color I think works really work for me
so finally I obviously also have to
change a few other colors and since the
header here and to do that we make it we
made it really easy to discover what I
need to change so if I now hover over
this dis electro rule in the style panel
all of the colors and all of the other
elements that would apply it at the
selector I actually highlighted and now
it can choose the color with confidence
that I'm picking the right selector ok I
think this works again and finally the
text color right before where I actually
just had to for contrast reasons i just
had to measure what what i thought was
right but now we have this new line that
you're seeing on the color picker still
an experiment it's coming up relatively
soon but this new line is a color
contrast line and and gives you an idea
what contrast works best for
accessibility reasons this is really
powerful because because I I before like
had no idea what what color is a good
color 11 when you know my eyesight isn't
that strong so this is a really great
way to make this happen so that's color
let's move in to mobile so I was in that
situation quite a lot right I feel that
before so you basically you work in a
product you work on it for many many
months obviously you develop and desktop
computers because they have your build
system whatever and it makes it really
easy
but then your boss one day before lounge
asks you if you if you test it on mobile
I like maybe mm well we did an
improvement here last year which is the
new device mode device mode comes up if
you click at the icon next to the
inspect element icon and it brings up
mobile emulation so from here you have a
UI that that you can select the device
from so that network throttling and
emulate a lot of the characteristics of
a mobile phone so that was a good start
we also have media queries in there zoom
a lot of interesting things a good start
but there was one thing that I just
couldn't pinpoint I was wrong with it
and we finally could pimp on it which is
it sort of backwards why are we starting
with the desktop website when all the
traffic comes from mobile in the first
place when most people discover your
page and mobile first and then maybe use
the desktop afterwards it's not kind of
backwards shouldn't we be building
mobile first and then go up well it
turns out that's not a new thing in the
responsive design world that's been you
know the thing that they've been they've
been preaching for a long time just
focus on the mobile website first use
progressive enhancement and then scale
up and use media crees to actually build
the desktop side out that's a not a new
story but somehow our workflow was stuck
in the past the chrome devtools were
still heavily focused on desktop and had
an opt-in mode if you wanted to debug
for mobile now I'm very pleased to
announce that this is changing we are
building a new device mode for a new
mobile first world so well I mean you
could freak out now like are you
freaking kidding me I use traveling that
you I in my face and have it always on
is that really what you're doing because
then I'm gonna leave okay so this is not
what we're doing right that would be a
supreme amount of trolling and we're not
going there now instead we dramatically
simplified the story what we have here
is a new device
as on my own page right now but as you
can see it's just one line that extends
to the main menu and it gives you
control over responsive design which is
start on desktop now we're in responsive
mode but we can also emulate a certain
device that we want to so in this case
once this nexus 5x and edit any and add
any custom devices to it if you want to
so in addition to that we now have
chrome within the device so now you can
emulate how it look like on the keyboard
as well as in landscape on the keyboard
and with the actual chrome of the device
and all it is centered so it's really
focused on the responsive design story
and if your work if your work in a
patron has a lot of media queries you
can also enable media queries like in
the old mode in a much lighter way and
focus on them click on them to actually
preview how it look like a different
media queries so as you can see the
device mode icon is not in the inspect
element area anymore it's not there
anymore because mobile is now the
default in devtools now what does that
mean in other places well first of all
for throttling for instance you haven't
seen sporting in here and there's a
reason for that because we thought okay
in this new world everything in devtools
is focus on mobile so why shouldn't we
put it where it's makes most sense and
it made most sense to us in the network
panel so because it's always important
to test how your site looks like on slow
connections fine sense if you're working
the serviceworker so we put folding my
dinner and the network folding profiles
can be configured in the settings panel
so now I had to slide up last year at
Google i/o I'm going to bring it up
again mobile emulation is not the same
as an actual phone it's important right
we made the story pretty powerful in my
opinion but still not the same if you're
debugging something like performance we
still can really emulate that on on the
actual desktop immolation so for that
previously you had to go through chrome
inspect which was a completely different
window and gives you access to
remote debugging to actually remote
debug your pages on a phone now we
thought we could do better than that and
actually integrate that into the rest of
dev tools as well so now we have an
experiment going that actually does that
so as you can see already in a new main
menu we have inspect devices and now
brings up a dialog with in devtools you
don't have to go to another page anymore
you can continue to stay on page now
it's pending authorization i click on it
on my phone say yes I want to agree and
now it's connected and I can debug any
of the pages i have opened my phone
right there so we think this new mode
makes it a lot easier to work with
actual devices alright moving on from
the vice mode let's talk about something
else here's a rule of thumb pie came up
with the rule of thumb goes a visual
design practice is out of fashion when
browser vendors have added a way to do
it in CSS that sounds a bit abstruse but
it's sort of true I mean if you look at
border radius CSS gradients right as
soon as soon as we got CSS gradients Sun
prefixed and and basically expect in
every browser you know there was flat
design like people were like well it's
not that cool anymore and border radius
was the same thing I mean as soon as we
had border radius everyone's like off it
and and trend was already moving on so
what's the point in doing new stuff if
everyone is not using anymore well the
good news is that this time we feel
faster then trend which is great finally
this feels good so what I'm talking
about is animations but when the
developers think about animations they
often think about those guides of
animations your animations that really
do not improve the experience a lot I
mean sure it makes stuff wiggle but I'm
not really getting how would that
improve how amusing my page that's how
about you but there's probably some some
purpose but I haven't thought it yet um
but if you do animations correctly they
they actually they focus the state of
change right so they make you focus make
the user focus on an actual change
that's happening on the page
and that's really really powerful the
transition that you're animating and as
well as actually hiding from the fact
that something's loading like a loading
animation or you could do both at the
same time like we did on the on the old
google i/o website where you can see now
if you click on another link right it's
it's both the transition that changes
the state but it also hides the fact
that is loading more stuff that's the
best-case scenario so what did we do
here well we added a new animation
inspection mode this is running no here
we go should be running and now it's
running so this is actually this is very
interesting site because this is the
actual spec that's used it's the motion
spec that that the chrome team created
to to work out the animations in chrome
for mobile and and now what you get fear
is if you inspect an element in this
keyboard like didn't really work well so
now I inspected the keyboard and I want
to change the easing I bring up this new
cubic easing editor and I change it to
any kind of value and default I can
change the lines as you could to see and
I can make sure that easing works much
better so now if I click back to that
animation you can see that the keyboard
eases in much nicer but as you can see
in this demo there's a lot of complex
animations like this one like the menu
animation or the animation where I open
the taps those are composite animations
so how do you focus on those composite
animations well that is where the new
animation inspection comes in and comes
free and nicely so you can see once I go
through those pages it constructs groups
sort of tab groups in the animation
panel and if I click on them it replaced
the animation that is just captured yes
thank you
and now we can scrub on that animation
but again it's a composite animation
right so we we kind of realize that you
want to look at that in context of your
page so you can scrub you can make it
slower you can drag around you can debug
any any state right and one thing that's
upcoming that's really cool we're
putting some more work into this and
that's completely ready but it's the
actual ability to change things in this
mode so now I can actually change things
around I can move the delay i can move i
can change the duration of the animation
i can obviously change the easing in the
Styles panel because i click on stuff
and now as you can see i changed it in
real time right there on the page thanks
so what I haven't got for offering we've
got a new improved user experience we
get animation inspection and we get the
new device mode that's always on ok so
one one thing that I have to mention is
that some of the features are so new
that you should be using Chrome Canary
now some some features like the UI are
already in there you can use them the
work but features like the animation
inspection are still behind an
experiment now it's really easy to
enable those experiments just go to
Chrome flags enable devtools experiments
click that relaunch your browser and
then you have in your dev tool settings
a new tab called experiments where you
can toggle any kind of experiments that
we're currently working on and it would
be great if you could do that and
actually give us feedback if we should
do something better so that was all good
and great if you're building website
with devtools but what if you're doing
front-end ops what if you're sitting in
a control center and and focus on
performance improvements etc or actually
debugging JavaScript where we have some
stuff for you too we have a few new
JavaScript things that are really really
nice one thing we've added is in line
variables while debugging so we now show
what gets evaluated on every line once
you're stepping through the code which
is really handy
otherwise you would have to hover over
the variable first dig in there see what
it is but now you always see the context
you're in and the current valuable value
in the debugging flow we also added
proactive compilation so now if you do a
change while debugging to see okay maybe
this loop works this way we actually
show you that you did a semicolon error
and and there's a buck in the passing of
your code without you having to to
continue running it and just discover it
afterwards it's just a nice little
improvement and then we also added
something that makes the working with a
lot of stacks in frameworks a lot easier
so you see there's a lot of stuff here
from amber now if I click on black
boxing in the settings I can black box
the library that I working with and and
now the stack frames are hidden but I
can focus exclusively on the coat I
don't want to look at so in this case
ones that I did not I did not kill
jquery because I want to see the jaqua
code but I could obviously remove Jake
we as well and in addition to that we
also made it easy to do so with the
events so now if I if you see I click on
an event in here but it really didn't go
to the right code now I add framework
event listeners as a checkbox and it
goes directly to the line I specified my
event in and then we get something for
more advanced usage which is object
vomitus object vomitus allow you to D to
do this so it allows you if you if you
have custom objects of any kind of sword
in your framework in your in your
transpiler you can make them look
differently in devtools now you can make
them look a lot nicer than before so
before you have to top which is how it
would have looked like before but now
you can style them and map them up in a
way that they lock in a really nice way
to the console that's object vomitus and
now finally I mean Jake will probably
come up here and I was like well isn't
this a service worker conference what's
the deal
okay well yes we have something with
service work as well so this was this
was service working before this is how
you was what I we're working with Serbs
work at this old world you went to
service work internals same as with
inspect devices it opens a new page and
its really disconnected from the dev
tools and also it it is focusing on all
of the things that are happening across
your browser not just the current
service workers that you want to inspect
instead of that we actually moved it
into rich resources panel so now if you
click on resources you have this new tab
called service workers in there and it's
a lot easier to work with them right
there on your page and it's only showing
you the service workers that are
relevant to you allowing you to do a few
cool things like forcing an update
simulate push inspecting the worker
right there there's still some UI two
weeks that we can make to that thing i'm
pretty sure but i think is a great step
forward so now we've got making offering
a joy to use we we made diffuse fun to
use and we gave more power to javascript
developers but it's actually one more
thing there's one thing that is not
quite ready for prime time but i don't
want to talk about we rarely do this to
give a sneak peek of something but i'm
just so uncomfortably excited about it
that i wanted to show it to you guys and
that's the layout mode at the layout
mode is that what you see is what you
get editor for dev tools and if you if
you like me you might cringe a little
and that's okay right because you
remember this kind of scenario where
what you see is what you get is like
sort of a maybe maybe I get what I see
and that was the scenario with many of
the tools that I grow up with that
generate a lot of garbage code in the
background and you have no idea what's
happening so what was really important
for us with a couple of design
iterations that made this different
first one was if you look at the
classical what you see is what you get
you get hide and whit controls but how
often when you're doing a website do
change the height and weight of
something where you can change it on an
image sure but mostly you change
paddings and margins so we spend
hundreds and hundreds of iterations to
come up with a model that actually works
for paddings and margins this is not the
model at we're using but it's just
design iteration that we're playing with
we also want to make sure there's no
black magic going on so we're not
generating garbage code in the
background and we always have you look
at what's generated right there so with
that being said here's a preview of the
layout mode so i have this new little
icon i click on it it becomes sort of a
select and it can click on anything on
the page and it brings up controls to
change the padding and margin now as you
can see when i hover hovering over it
you get these little stops the walls
that signal in which direction you can
drag and which on you can't because
everything on the website is highly
dynamic so you want to change the
direction right way now all of this
matches up so if there's scroll wheel I
can change the actual rule I can change
the rule that I want to edit and it
changes all at the same time as you
could see the menu now and same thing
here I click on the paragraph i take the
margin or padding handle i change the
rule by using the mouse wheel it flashes
up in a style panel and i change it
right there and it changes the one below
as well so it's a really really simple
way to change what you have in a page it
saves it directly back to the style to
you that you're having your page you can
then take that style to bring it back to
your editor whatever you want and the
handles look very very different than
what you're used to i'm sure and the
reason for that is simply that we want
you to focus on the content we didn't
want to have a bunch of handles on top
of your content so we moved them outside
so this is just a preview of the layer
mode there's a lot more to come we're
still working on this quite a lot and
what we're looking for your feedback and
now next talk is going to be followers
and paul irish afterwards talking about
what we did in devtools when it comes to
performance so not all is lost if you
were so we're looking forward to
performance thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
