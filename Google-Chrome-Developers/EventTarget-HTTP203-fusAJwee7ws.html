popped into canary I kind of knew there
was plans for it but I didn't realize
how far along it was and now it's in
Canary is event.target
that's been a thing that has been a
thing so event.target
is the thing that gives us add it's a
horrible name by the way I think event
yeah because like the thing makes
event.target makes thing something they
can omit event well note cause it event
emitter which is a better name I agree
but event target is being with us for
like many many years and all the things
on the web that are ill named you know
we are yes so we can't change it now but
that's like everything that has a event
listener inherits from thing is it's
usually something that you only see in
the in the specs like you said you see
like this is the thing it implements
event target yes and but it's more
expense or it actually cannot extend it
in your code until now like because if
you've done anything with events before
yeah that you've wanted your own pub/sub
or something kind of system you end up
thinking well I'll get library or I'll
write my own or something like usually
end up with horrible hacks and I was one
of these people who wrote horrible hacks
yeah exactly
just just to repeat something that's
already on the platform it's a total
violation of the extensible web yeah and
so people I think it was Dominic tena
Cola have like got together and actually
respect what the constructor looks like
and how you would extend it beyond how
you would use it and it's it's now in in
Canary you can do new avatars it's so
good you can do class whatever extends
event target and now you have an event
listener now you have dispatch events
you've got the hall which they only do
things you need right exactly
well and this is the thing that there's
this kind of long-term plan that at some
point will replace an event listener or
not replace it will enhance it with
observables yes I've seen the the the
current Lex I'm gonna call it a scratch
pad because
probably too early to call tonight even
an explainer there's been loads writing
loads of little yeah a lot of little
ideas around this but the kind of the
central agreement is that this should be
how we think new events should also be
able to do observables which is this
dream of events are going to be careful
with that rights yes but this means that
you can like if everyone starts using
eventtarget now once we get the support
across the board it means when
observables duel and that's the bots
support it across the board as a good
catchphrase
is that another jingle that we need
maybe I probably probably not yeah but
then then when observables land that you
know you'll get those for free as well
that would be really really good it's
it's one of those things that kind of
seems well I'm not sure the people
listening slash watching are necessarily
aware of what you have to do because the
only things that extended eventtarget
that were like tangible for you were dom
elements yes or message boards yes Mars
I know there's lots of well things like
navigate serviceworker extends
event.target there's there's lots of
stuff yeah yeah but if so point about
the thing I bet he wrote a little tweet
when I was like oh look here's a nice
way we can build your own event target I
would legit just create a massive ship
port measures channel message board rip
out one port and it would have dispatch
event and add event listener and I will
just bind these function to my own
object and suddenly map it would be kind
of Friday's that's a nice hack just
around the very small it's still hack
for example event or target is always
going to be wrong because it would be
the message reported of the actual
object I used and this in the function
would be wrong for the same reason
because unless you bound this and your
functions or you know all these it's
just and then remove event listener
wouldn't work again you know unless you
prefer yeah okay it was just horrible
and people were using it anyway because
there was no other choice and so so good
that they finally came up with something
and is yes it's just another thing in
the browser that's exposed to the bus as
it should have always been silhouette it
works just say no just
so yes sir I'll just punch you in it
okay this is a red brick yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
