in the chrome dev tools called the
vertical timeline the goal of the tool
is to help you identify what is
hampering the responsiveness of your
application so that you can help
identify it smooth it out and make your
application run as smooth as possible to
kind of demonstrate this we're going to
bring up this demo this is made by
interactive developer named Hakeem he
goes by Hakeem L on Twitter and he made
this a bit ago and well let me just show
you what it does so as I scroll we'd get
some these these cool effects so this
one kind of flips in things we can also
just kind of manipulate the skew so this
is pretty cool he put this out about a
week ago and I was looking at and I was
like this is cool I think we could
actually make it a little bit smoother
the animation itself and so I started
looking at the code and I said let's
let's see what we can do here so first I
want to bring up the the vertical
timeline so I'm gonna bring up the
chrome dev tools using my keyboard
shortcut and Here I am on the chrome dev
tools timeline now if I just record a
timeline right now I'm going to hit
record and we'll do let's see the curl
okay got that recording and that's good
so I can zoom in here in the timeline
and I see kind of what's going on but
you know I'm looking down and it's just
scroll event recalc style paint paint
paint paint paint tells me the size but
this is not really telling me anything
this is not too helpful to me but now if
you see up in the top left right here we
have the vertical so I'm going to switch
over to vertical bars and we have quite
a different picture so each bar
represents a frame that's being drawn to
the screen and a frame is kind of how
the browser sends information to the GPU
as it draws so right now it's kind of
the tall bars take longer
purple is rendering time and
and yellow is a script time but that's
all kind of the information that we have
so this is cool but I think we need
something a little bit more useful than
this so what we're actually going to do
is take a look at the code and see if
there's anything that we can immediately
change so over here is a the source of
what's going on
and one of the first things that I
noticed in the source is that we have
this a scroll listener now scroll is
particularly troublesome and does not
work well against sending things to the
screen scroll kind of fires at its own
pace and the screen kind of wants things
you know at 60 frames per second and
scroll is either firing too fast or not
fast enough and so we can do a little
bit top Tomine this so what we're
actually going to do is just get rid of
this because we're going to use
requestanimationframe so
requestanimationframe is you know with
the browser optimal api for rendering so
we have a little shim in here and for
cross browser and back compatibility and
I'm going to use this little loop inside
here so this is just a recursive loop
and we're just going to continue to call
update through requestanimationframe
just ongoing now I'm going to come back
here and I'll reload the page reset my
timeline and now when I start recording
you'll see it's quite a bit different so
one of the things you'll notice is that
the requestanimationframe is just firing
firing firing so I'm getting all these
bars right here right but the good thing
about this is that you get to see what
the height of the bar should be and so
the height of all the bars over here is
essentially indicating 60 frames per
second this is the ideal your your
monitor refreshes at 60 frames per
second and in chrome we've
so that requestanimationframe matches
the refresh rate of your monitor so it's
as smooth as possible you cannot get
smoother than this but when we blow up
above this area we're going above that
and so 60 frames per second translates
into sixteen point six repeating
milliseconds and we can verify this by
zooming into this area and the timecode
across the top of this shows that we're
at 16 milliseconds or so for each of
these frames but once we go into this
area these frames get quite a bit larger
70 milliseconds 116 and so those I
recorded when I was scrolling and so
what we can do is we can zoom in to that
area and investigate what was going on
so it looks like we had this animation
frame fired I'm going to expand this and
here we have a bunch of stuff going on
recalculate style layout recalculate
style layout recalculate style layout
this is not a good pattern but we're
able to see what's actually going on
here so I can actually click right from
here into the code so this is the stroll
j/s that we were just updating and what
it was telling me was line 40 and here
it's highlighting this so it looks like
I'm 40 we have an offset top and an
offset height and if you're familiar
with reflows let's see faster site
reflows they're also called layouts in
WebKit but here's the blog post where
you can identify all the properties and
methods that cause a reflow and so in
here you'll see offset top and scroll
top and an offset height is in there as
well so this is actually causing
the browser to recalculate all the
geometry of the page and this is
happening inside a loop going over all
the items in this list so it's happening
quite a bit so we're able to identify a
nice connection between the rendering
time back to our JavaScript and now I'm
able to see that this line in particular
is really costly now noticing that we
have these two calls which require
calculating the layout and we look down
and we see that we're actually adding a
class in this case adding a class here
and adding classes here what we get into
is a loop where we are setting
properties on the Dom and then
immediately asking the Dom for new
information and that is exactly what is
causing this recalculate style
recalculate style back and forth
optimally we only have to recalculate
our style and/or layout once and not
have to go back and forth so what we can
do in the code is instead of doing this
where we where we get the information
and then we set it and then we keep on
doing our loop and getting it we have
this new version that I wrote and we're
actually going to do a funny thing where
we use two loops so my optimization here
is to translate this from one loop into
two loops in the first loop we get all
of our offsets and then in our second
loop we go through and then we apply our
changes based on the information that we
gathered so we're just getting in a big
row and then we're just setting and so
this is a lot more compatible with with
you know reducing the amount of reflows
that you have so if I bring up this
version this is the new one and I open
up the timeline Oh
hit record
and here you'll actually see that the
bars are much much lower in this case so
they're not spiking as far above as they
were on the earlier case and if I go in
really close
see here's good one yep this is what we
like to see so we have a single
recalculate style followed by a layout
so we're giving the browser as much more
optimizing our code as much as we can to
avoid the reflows and so as a result
we're able to hit our target of 60
frames per second a lot closer so this
is really pretty cool and I'm very
excited about this feature the vertical
timelines if you want to check this out
the best way to do it is go to about
flags right now and here's where you can
turn on a bunch of experimental things
if you search for developer tools you'll
find this and you can enable it here you
restart the browser and then you go down
into the bottom right the settings where
it brings up this and down here on the
bottom right of that we have these
experiments where you can turn on a few
things so right now a vertical timeline
is in there but hopefully soon everyone
will see it by default in their timeline
so we're really excited about that and
hope you enjoy it one of the things that
that we're looking to bring later is per
frame profiling so what this means is
that if I had a lot of script execution
happening in these frames so a lot of
yellow I would be able to pick out one
frame and essentially see what the
profiler captured during that single
frame so I can identify what in my
JavaScript what what methods inside my
JavaScript are causing the most time so
we're looking towards that and hope to
bring that to you soon in the meantime
please take a look at this feature and
let us know
you have any feedback Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
