privilege the challenge and be well yes
it is a challenge of having a very
broadly scope topic but we're going to
be exciting lively and vibrant and we
need you we need you to participate in
that so lots of interaction please from
everybody let me introduce my panel
first of all and gang from the right
here we have Android spoon of his UX
evangelist of Microsoft we have Jenny
Tennyson who is CEO at the open data
Institute to my left we have Scott
Jensen who does user experience at
Google and who's next oh it's Tom over
there Tom Ashworth with front-end
developer over at Twitter and Alex on
the end there does user experience stuff
for the government digital service and I
think we are so sorry and carried away
my own excitement will probably cover
some things that have already been
covered today but I'm hoping recovering
from a slightly different perspective so
we've already talked for example about
varying device sizes and so on but we
are looking for broadening that topic
out i guess and looking to future case
remember we're talking about the future
so every opinion is valid well nearly
every opinions ah I I'm trying hard to
let go of that reference to being older
than make what do you think actually is
Gareth here is he still here the guy
said that he ran off well just
collectively everybody has over 37 would
wish him to say just you
I want to just to verify my own
antiquity I want to make sure that you
understand my first build system was in
fact a shoe box which helped me to keep
the punched cards in order the other
thing I want to say in this rather
lengthy preamble before I introduced you
jenny is that you've heard people say
when they've been asked to ask their
questions oh this isn't what I wrote I'm
expecting for quite a few people who I
call and we'll say I have no idea what
this even means yeah if there's no
relation whatsoever to what I wrote down
now that this is this is not um we did
actually try to keep it through
matically coherent so the people who are
asking the questions may have some words
in Dan's nodding that let there are some
words in your question damn that you did
originally right not not it not not next
to each other and not in the same order
right so Jenny Jenny can you please tell
us where next okay so can I have my
slides up please no maybe it's not
plugged in
it's on the screen here it's just not on
the screen there okay me too oh yeah
yeah you want some beer yeah
arrangement
thank you there alright so for that
slight delay um right so the topic of
future web is a rather broad one the
future being very much longer than the
past and hopefully what have I done
their touch word right and so so
thinking about the future web and
obviously the first person to ask about
where the web might go would be Chrome
come on this is not good ok I think I
might need to use it this is using a
reveal yes by the way and thank you so
we did need a future person sorry about
this at Derek use alternative would you
do to my computer
we are living in the future excellent
that looks much better okie dokie right
yes looks better right thank you and so
let's ask Tim ball now of course
thinking about asking timber what the
future of web holds of course he did his
ask me anything on Reddit and where he
was asked what was one of the things
that you never anticipated about the
internet and famously replied kittens so
in terms of predicting what's going to
happen in the future web I can predict
that there will still be kittens on the
web and pussies too but I want to focus
on three themes three trends that I
think are going to be important as we go
forward as web developers and look at
those in terms of what that means for us
when we're developing web applications
those three themes are going to be more
sensitivity around our personal
information more data being available
and as we've touched on many times today
more devices so more sensitivity first
of all it's no turn the the thing that
one of the things that has happened
recently that has changed the way in
which you think about the web is the
revelations around that it's noting came
about what the NSA is looking at what
GCHQ is looking at and I found this on
Wikipedia fantastic little diagram SSL
added and removed here this is the stuff
that we can get into guys that there at
the back end of Google where there's no
encryption and we have free reign what
does this mean in terms of how we design
our systems our web applications what
does it mean in terms of these
revelations
this thinking about where our private
information is going what does that mean
for us well there's loads of policy
implications loads of things that we can
think of as a legislative level or a
policy level but there are also some
technical ones I'm on the technical
architecture group at the w3c and one of
the things that has come up several
times without any kind of resolution or
in-depth thinking is what we do around
permissions on the web where how do we
balance the need for you to know that
you are being looked at through your
video camera on your laptop with it not
being right so much in your face that
you cannot interact with whatever the
application is how do we balance up the
need to request on a case-by-case basis
information about your location with the
irritation of being requested on a
case-by-case basis about your location
how do we get around these terrible
kinds of permission interfaces that
everybody just clicks through and
ignores everybody being everybody who
doesn't wear a tinfoil hat that is and
so that's one set of kind of questions
how do we handle those permissions when
we have lots of ways or tracking us
another area that I wanted to raise was
how we move away from these centralized
services that are so vulnerable to a
single that are a single point of
failure if you like in our in our
private data so I'm particularly
interested in a couple of activities
that are going on around this around
unho stood web apps the idea of having a
web application over here that operates
on data over here and you can control
how your data gets accessed by that web
app it doesn't actually hold all your
data itself and also the work of Rida
centralized which explores a lot of
these issues and I'd encourage you to to
have a look at how do we get to a web
that isn't a centralized as it currently
is because of these sensitivities that
we have about our personal data being
collected in huge databases which are
vulnerable to
tap that was my first area second area
is about data now so far during the day
the focus has really been on what
happens within a browser context where I
work at the open data Institute all I
hear about is data all I hear about is
smart cities and the data that you can
get from devices and sensors within a
road network in smart cities this is
smart city logo land right we talk about
home automation and the extra
information we can get about our homes
interactions with home systems sensors
more data coming in from from our home
systems we talk about quantified self
wearable computing that monitors us
constantly that provides streams and
streams of data we talk about open data
naturally at the open data Institute
more government data being made
available also from companies data being
made available that we can all use we
talk about Big Data masses amounts of
fast-moving variable data I love the way
that in my search for big data see that
macdonald's why i don't i don't know how
anyway um beta so we talked about
medical data defense day to dicker data
whatever that is morning data mean data
afternoon data the night data everything
is data so what does this mean for the
web when we have so much more data being
passed around it's so much more
streaming data so much more Big Data
HTTP as a protocol is not good for this
kind of streaming it's not good for
these kinds of big files so what are the
protocols are we using what other
protocols do we need and how do we make
them play nicely with the web how do we
make them play well with HTML pages and
HTTP the web was made for documents and
so is Jason the pinnacle of data on the
web is is Jason really all that we need
for
expressing data on the web I don't think
so the other question I'd like to raise
is what does a native where deck native
data browser look like what happens
currently when you have data that's made
it made available on the web is that you
have to create your own kind of
component your own kind of visualization
we have things like this which are data
tables JavaScript plug-in that makes
everything that stream stuff it streams
data in that makes it suitable
filterable page' ball and so on but what
about moving to more more integrated
data and documents using the kinds of
technologies within d3 what does this
mean for us on the web what kinds of
components what kinds of web components
could we build that natively work with
data those are the kinds of questions
that I think are interesting for the
future third area more devices this is
the area that we touched on loads today
so we have a drought so that stopped
working again more devices give me come
on
okay so we have more devices that don't
work and is completely interacts fine
it's fine I know how to get it
incorrectly okay um more devices finds
tablets yes it's a windows tablet um TVs
a watches fridges um cars um and all of
these devices have differences in their
size in their resolution and their
connectivity in their processing power
in their modes of interaction as we've
already talked about and in their
context of use huge variety massive
variety of ways in which we as humans
will interact with the web and of course
that means that we need this like
responsive design + + right not only
responsive layout but responsive images
or in civ interactions changing both in
the way changing based on the devices
that we use responsive stories different
ways of storing the information and
knowing whether you're going to go on
and offline intermittently or whether
you're going to have a constant internet
connection for example will change the
way in which we design our web
applications right and a final thought
we currently dominated by four
particular web browsers and fewer
rendering engines um well okay I'm
perhaps we should be dominated by one
more yell right so it's bling is the
same sake rendering engine so my my
closing question would be are we a July
enough right have we got enough small
pieces loosely joined to enable us to
adjust to the changing future can the
web that we know it be disrupted by the
next best thing or have we built
something that is too big to be taken
down okay thank you look thank you very
much Jenny I I anticipate a future in
which Jenny will give a presentation
using web technology with fewer than
3000 but I don't expect it'll come soon
right um Jenny thank you that was great
and hopefully we can follow up on some
of your themes through some of the
questions that we have put through the
ringer for the final time today at least
in this role i'm going to call on andrew
bets this time to read a question that
he had nothing to do with that is very
true Ashley and I I have no more
questions I promise you what is the role
of the web in the world of wearables
with no screen okay so the question is
what is the role of the web in a world
was wearables with no screen this is a
reference the fact the web is primarily
a visual thing in its output at least
we've talked about different input
modality is what about different output
modalities Jenny do you want to kick us
off on this back just recovering Oh
calmed and so it's one of my bug bears
that we we focus on browsers we focus on
greens and we don't think about the
other ways in which all sorts of apps
all sorts of agents might interact on
the web and I think wearables is just
one kind of example of this era but
there are lots of other kinds of agents
that we need to be need to be thinking
about and understand that they live on
the way up to and they consume web
content to when we're yeah and so it
wearables you've got a difference in
input modality but you've also got and
if ur insane I'll put modality which I
think changes the way in which we need
to think about how we design our pages
in the same way as we talked about
accessibility issues in the in the last
session sorry that wasn't very no that's
great thank you Alice I know that you've
done a lot of work in the Internet of
Things huh how does this strike you in
that context well i mean i think it's i
think i think it's the web is going to
continue in the way it currently does in
a world without screens because as jenny
said there are already plenty of things
that don't have screens and there'll be
new things that don't have screens and
some of those will be objects that we
currently understand like watches that
have a sort of additional have been
elevated by having the web put into them
but then there might be some completely
new invented things that are a middle
ground that you would never thought
about before you are able to put the web
into sort of stuff and there are you
know like i used to work for berg and so
we've made little printer and little
printers we made a mistake by calling it
little printer because it's not well it
is a printer but that's not like its
primary function and you would never
really want that with little printer
without the internet and in that way
it's sort of a new product rather than
like an internet fridge or something
like that but little printer doesn't
have a screen unless you count the
receipt paper that it prints on as a
screen which it you know we we
mischievously say it is sometimes thanks
about I go ahead Scott
fun of the community a little bit though
because right now I don't think that
this that the web community even can get
its head wrapped around the web on a
walk let alone a web not on a screen at
all there's this i think the web has
never recovered from the fact that
screen started getting smaller it's
video I don't know maybe they
continually got bigger and it basically
just immediately just didn't worry about
things and then went reverse direction
we collectively lost our minds and we
still have and we still haven't
recovered from that and so this idea
that we have to have one size fits all
works great as long as you're willing to
scroll everything 20 pages but if you
want to have I'd hate to get into the
web app versus web page thing because
it's a waste of you know but the fact is
that we are trying to make things that
are more interactive and the web has not
got its head wrapped around that quite
yet and so I do think we have a lot of
soul searching to do to figure out what
interaction means on multiple devices
okay and so to summarize some of the
points here what we're saying is we
haven't even got to grips with what
we've got but I would come back and say
hey but you haven't seen anything yet so
we better hurry up and make up online
spell opportunity I can see Remy on the
key let me Remy and come back to you
this is kind of link to the question had
before but and I mean you met you've got
a poker work fun we're going I don't get
right I don't get how my phone is of the
web it it it could it can I think talk
over tcp/ip and it can talk to a web
server but in a priori for my it's not
there's no web eNOS that I can see there
there's no way of me getting it right
can I gotta cut you off there cuz we're
gonna come back to this as a topic later
i'll let you back in fascinating though
your point was we will become effective
he does it qualify as a web device is
not purely syntactic argument me so
I think we as a web community have good
things to say to the people who are
building these wearable devices we may
not be able to and put our technology
stack on them so you know you know not
gonna find a headless web browser
running on a Fitbit but we can say if
you make you are elbow resources
available and connected to each other
and we know that's a good thing we can
point out to these people who are
building these things that that has some
really positive benefits and if we give
things URLs and we make them addressable
and we make them accessible even if they
you know even if it's jason and not HTML
but we use the principles of of the web
and substrate internet that i think we
can have a really positive impact as the
web community on on whatever comes over
the next few years in terms of wearable
devices and things that don't have don't
have screens okay Andrew yeah thing to
just cool inherent to the web is the
presentation format that presentation
layer so to think of the web without the
screen I think it's a little bit weird
completely disagree um that's good new
yourself we're talking about music and
notation and so on what's wrong with a
web of music nothing's wrong with a web
of music but I think we've got all this
data in a particular form that we can
access and we can use web languages in
order to talk to date on all sorts
devices but I don't see it as the web on
those devices jenni John and so that's
the reason that I disagree is that for
me then the web is that the main
definition of the web is use of HTTP it
isn't the use of HTML and if you count
the use of HTTP you can be sending data
over over HTTP which needn't be shown on
the screen which could be interacted
with River wearable device or in any
other kind of way that we if we tie the
web is only being HTML I think
we make a mistake yeah I'm not getting
into the protocols but what the webos is
to me it has it has a presentation and
it's something very visual but we can
certainly use the content and we can use
the languages that we've gotten also
interact with devices but maybe we're
getting crossed right ok I think well we
we could continue on this and I'm very
sorry to everybody is on the queue here
but we are going to move on to the next
topic now because we're we've got too
much to cover we just have I am good to
call again I possibly for the final time
today Christopher you've been a active
participant i hope i didn't mangled your
question beyond your ability to read it
yes i mean if you donated prefaces the
reason why asking these questions all
right you recently had experience with
this but also when we talk about the
future we focus a little bit too much on
the tech side and not about the audience
I'd so my question is the future of the
web will see rising importance in
optimizing sites for the eastern China
and working with their national firewall
many popular and valuable services such
as YouTube were blocked over there how
do we accommodate different
nationalities to privacy sensitive
content and inappropriate content and so
on and there's also the technological
barriers to journey I'm gonna ask you to
leap in here again because this is I
think directly came off the one of your
principal points and I think it was also
because nobody else wanted to touch it
with a barge so on the internet then the
typical way in which we move around
those barriers is that we subvert them
that's tends to be what happens and we
tend to work around those kinds of
issues I and I I don't have direct
experience of issues in China and I
can't really speak to them I think that
the issues about how we internationally
come up with some kind of understanding
about how when we have lots of different
laws around privacy around
protection and so on how we
internationally handle that is it is a
very interesting question I've seen
people from Africa talk about wanting to
have legislation in their countries that
explicitly precludes anybody looking at
data within servers that are in their
countries to make them a more attractive
option for people who are building web
applications to use servers in their
country for example so we might start to
see an arms race between different
nationalities as they try to provide a
more interesting web environment for
people to use maybe the other kinds of
things that I think is interesting you
think about what Tim ball said the 25th
anniversary of the web just the other
week talking about a bill of rights for
Internet users whether we should have a
right to use the internet whether we
should have a right to use it without
with with particular levels of
understanding about what our privacy
should be water or at what access we
should have to content on the web or the
other kind of idea that I've had heard
floating around is whether we should
have a Geneva Convention type of thing
where we know that there are going to be
states that block us from accessing
certain kinds of content but should we
have an international understanding
about the limits of those with of that
blocking that we internationally agree
on these are all really interesting
questions I think that these we're only
at the beginning of starting to have
those conversations particular with
policymakers who really don't understand
any of this at all and that's quite
scary I think we also have to look at
this question from it from
the point of view which is that actually
this is a moot point if we if the
weather is not viable in a Contessa any
particular country so for example in I
won't call them developing nations
because their economies a bigger than
our conv than the UK's but in countries
like Brazil or say China or India we
have to ask is the way that actually a
viable platform that the moment if I for
example work for a social network and
let's say I work for facebook and I want
to and I want to I want to get more
users in a country like one the ones I
just mentioned I've got a range of
technologies that that are available to
me and honestly as where people we have
to say you know what the web does not
win in that battle native wins in that
battle low-powered android wins that
battle and and dusty energy like a good
folks like Firefox OS as well but but
but you but you have to have to admit I
I think for a big company if you're
going to invest a inner technology right
now at low power android phones
particularly if you're heading into
those markets are very good option we
are missing certain key elements of the
technology stack that will enable us to
make gains in those those places there
were quite a few questions in the
moderator actually about am like I'm
gonna cut your photo because I think
that you've done your advertising spiel
thank you very much good can we go to
Robert daily who's on the queue fire and
we currently think of one device one
user but with caro basis and basic joint
touch screens that will have multiple
users using the same app at the same
time how do we deal with say a driver
from the passenger using the same app in
a car at the at the same time about
switching user accounts or you know as
in how do we do multiple people
interacting with with the web or indeed
mobile device multiple people on single
people on multiple devices well as the
eyesight of the problems is
take that one school I actually would
add that I just I feel like that's
exactly the issue the web has right now
is that we've been so enamored with st.
you know one device in one screen that
we just that's just our an entire myopia
I've been go even further that that one
screen has to by the way look and feel
as much like an iPhone as possible but
that's me I mean a lil editorial at that
point but I do think that the web needs
to be exploring these kinds of things so
what would it mean to have something on
my watch which then it entices me to
pull out my phone and it allows me to
continue the experience I don't think
we're considering that and it's
something that frankly I think the web
is most powerful at blaming okay sorry
I'm gonna have to skip to guy and then
we'll move on to the next topic I just
want to kind of get back to the country
question and say that I don't think it's
a foregone conclusion that the web needs
to adapt to those countries I think to a
large extent the country's need to adapt
to the web and it's sort of a force to
be reckoned with and you know Twitter
and other platforms have already
demonstrated that multiple times over
the past few years I think you know when
you talk about the future of the web
it's very much possible that the future
of the web is the openness of it and
it's kind of a government's problem to
sort of figure out how do they navigate
within that world so so the intent is
about getting data from one place to the
other privacy concerns around that etc
but yeah I agree with that I'm really
sorry about who we were actually going
to go light on the a lot of type that
but we've run out of time on it despite
thinking we were not going to spend as
much on it as we might be fun oh right
next topic Daniel Apple crisps because
I'm much nicer than Christian Harlan i'm
going to give you your question okay uh
there we go now this is what I wrote no
so in its march towards increasing
sophistication and I think this question
parenthetically this question kind of
goes back to the more displayed browser
oriented web that we've been talking
about for it's not to discount the
importance of the data oriented web
which I think it's also important but in
its march towards increasing
sophistication is the web losing touch
with
easy to learn and therefore accessible
to a very broad authorship community I'm
going to add one more poetical statement
I think this relates to the whole meme
that's going on right now about teaching
kids to code and getting kids and
especially young people engaged in
development how do we get them engaged
in the web easily okay thank you Dan I'm
going to re paraphrase your question
back to another Fork of the question if
you like which is it used to be terribly
easy to write basic web page it was
pretty but it was very easy to do
that was an on-ramp that point has been
made earlier today but in order to be
competitive or to provide a better user
experience things have got a lot more
complicated have they got
disproportionately complicated in order
to achieve the objectives of being more
specific like I say we can they do no no
no no right you can like back in the day
it was quite still quite hard to get a
web page onto a server and not a lot of
people are interested in doing it
proportionately because it was quite a
lot of effort because there wasn't this
sort of corpus of like help and
tutorials and stuff and now you can do
you can get very very far and do very
cool stuff without knowing basically
anything and like that may are not
really a good thing or a bad thing but
like it's not to say that we've made it
too complicated for people is really
doing people a massive disservice these
people that are like oh it can't be
bothered they always existed and they're
still around and they still can't be
bothered and then there are people who
can be bothered and they also are still
being served by what we have and you can
just go further and the people who will
say oh but it's possible for people to
make like terrible mistakes and do
really dangerous things that's fine
those people are going to learn really
quickly and
that's brilliant too so this kind of
like yeah I learn they learn really
quickly but possibly with disastrous
consequences you know I use this analogy
which is putting a chainsaw in the hands
for six-year-old I've they learn or well
you know they don't I people every week
mostly beginners and in fact go to
people who live in London code bar io
minority people in tech we're trying to
promote particularly women so if you've
got free time and wednesdays please come
to that but I teach teach people every
wednesday and I see this a lot i see
people who are coming new to HTML I need
to CSS and absolutely it is possible for
them to go from zero and in an hour and
a half have a huge smile on their face
because they've just created their first
website there's absolutely no reason to
believe that that's fading away
I think we're doing okay okay valid
Andrew as with any technology ensures
and we realized that some of these
millions to do they look quite difficult
to do we try and simplify those if I
think back when I start to the web just
trying to get some one server just
trying to get data into a form save that
onto a server somewhere that was
actually quite a complicated task it's
quite a very it took us a long time to
do that was in a very expensive thing to
do there's a lot of simple tools out
there that allow people to do that quite
easily now and so whilst and that's an
easy thing to do I think it means that
some people don't understand what it is
that they're actually what's actually
going on in the background but then do
you need to know what's going on the
background it's like they looking like i
canna not hi i just want to add to that
a little bit and say i just recently
started doing code so i teach kids as
young as how are you getting on no but I
teach I teach kids as young as like five
or six how to do programming and the
speed the facility with which they pick
up quite sophisticated concepts is
incredible I think with the low barrier
to entry that the web provides I don't
think we're in any danger of making that
too complex okay i think linda has just
arrived from coke club as we were
speaking about it so yeah without
wishing to put to put words in her mouth
about what the mission of code club is I
mean it really fills a gap in education
that that does exist and there is a
problem with that and and so when you're
talking about you know maybe you're
talking about doing the coming to the
webers as like you know a teenager who
is looking to make their first webpage
and then there's co club who is sort of
enabling kids at a much younger age to
get involved with technology and think
about and programming in a way that just
the you know the education system and
since we're talking about the future of
the web really groups like coke lub and
young rewired state are making the
future of the web which is the people
who've made the web so we should invest
in those
okay thank you we do need to push on
here because i think we probably only
got time for two more things if I'm if
we're going to stick to our timing so
Daniel no danger that okay move moving
on and from EDS or it's no yes this was
a combination of yours or someone else's
so it starts just to get just to check
it starts ease the web so done or salven
could be but I think it's the question
that Remy perhaps wanted to ask that is
bubbling under a few of the
conversations as well it goes like this
is the web going to grow into all into
an all-encompassing platform for all
future computing is there any area which
will be spared or my contrast is the
future of the web just providing api's
for native applications to be built
thank you so this is a question about
what are the limits of the web what is
the definition of the word web I don't
think probably want to go that way but
you know you guys started having a
little bit of a hammer and tongs about
that earlier would you like to continue
that in in the context of this question
so will the web grant an
all-encompassing computation platform
Jenny you say no because some things
that are inherently web like like HTTP
are not suitable yeah I think the basic
how I would define the way we're going
to be about the use of HTTP and the use
of resources identified by URLs and
takes us a long way but there are some
there are some aspects of particularly
data flows on the internet that don't
use web protocols and should not use web
protocols and we need to be thinking
outside of the of the HTTP as the
protocol that we ever use on the
internet hundred well and so is this
it's also about languages and how we can
extend languages to other you can make
it platforms because thank you and III
see the web we've invest so much time in
it we've invested so much time putting
the content into a format that we can
access and we can do so much more with
their languages like JavaScript nowadays
that we they actually started stand-up
to other languages so the web can exist
in almost anything I think about some
words about work I do at the moment
using javascript access the same api's
that i can do through c++ or guy could
do foo c sharp and when creating a place
for Windows 8 for instance things i'm
using the same web technologies the same
wig languages are you saying that the
distinction is a bogus distinction in
some ways you're saying everything flows
into everything else i think i think you
can it can it can exist okay in places
where we don't have it currently yes
ramin is it I'm hoping this was adjacent
to the point that you are making
absolutely nothing to do with it nothing
to do there just so I don't think the
work will be everything and I don't
think it would just be yes or this so I
think like to I agree with what you're
saying I think there's a lot of like
there's a lot of hype around the
internet of things there's a lot of hype
around smartwatches and all that stuff
and I think there are a lot of companies
that are doing a lot of figuring out
through doing at the moment and what
we'll find in in 10 years weren't no not
10 years five years is they'll be that
the web will be in some stuff and it'll
make a lot of sense and everybody will
be like check out my cool web enabled
thing and then it won't be another stuff
and people would be like remember when
we try to put the internet in
fridges that was madness
but there's there's a lot of hype and
lot of marketing stuff that makes all of
this seem like like people are seriously
thinking about this when actually
they're just figuring stuff out and you
know some of it okay seriously challenge
that in the sense i could go back the
audience in the second in the sense that
i'm old enough to have said 15 years ago
do you know what people are going to be
using these devices here to do all kinds
of cool stuff on the move and people
said yeah yeah yeah we'll wait to see
that so I think that expressing
skepticism about direction that these
technologies so I I'd a potentially
dangerous route to take I already
skepticism there wasn't a lie i write
JavaScript all day every day and quite
frankly I do not want JavaScript on a
pacemaker I do know people I just like
if giving you said to me look here's a
web-enabled thing that's going in your
body I've attended go we actually have a
few examples of what we're trying to do
once and when there was no key a series
40 thing we charted an interpreter for
doing things running on a device that
basically you couldn't even fit a
JavaScript interpreter on because I
don't know if you remember that
JavaScript apart from having obvious
limitations regarding how we handle
numbers etc wires requires quite a bit
of stock etc and we ended up doing the
first cut yet engine thing that we built
this company in scheme in a scheme
because it was a smaller interpret that
could fit in like approximately 4k right
so there would be things as we were
saying that basically you cannot use the
HTML CSS for actually making your
interface simpler and you cannot use
JavaScript to kind of reduce what you
have been doing because literally
there's no space so not only because of
the whole a synchronous thing but
because technically some of these things
in the internal things are not even
going to have stack to run JavaScript on
don't know you sexy DB for that matter
Kristen you had a word they wanted to
interject and then we're gonna probably
have to move on
actually one thing is about but amazing
is we talk about HTTP but then we're
actually using a system here users web
sockets and we're using system that uses
web RTC and his peer-to-peer connections
it could even be encrypted between two
computers so that companies starting
with N and ending winners SI couldn't
actually listen to us I find it also
interesting that we when I started on
the web what I loved most about is that
I can use whatever I want to actually
start connecting with it and now we're
talking about smart watches glasses that
cost $1,500 basically toys for the
Western world to beat in the future of
the web and to me the future of the web
lies in as you said emerging markets
with more people than we have and fixing
that to gadgets that are closed in one
environment is to me the wrong way of
making the future of the web okay so I
closing comment from the panel here
Scott if you got something centers well
I'm intrigued with how we want this
future to go because there's clearly
discussion of how the standards bodies
work but I would argue that the vast
majority of conversations that I tend to
have with people is all about well how
can you make this web page scroll on a
small screen I mean and so I think to a
certain set we've trapped ourselves in
our own paradigm which is that these are
just scrolling web pages and I think
there's so much more the web can do and
for example the previous question about
multi displays there's some I don't want
to aspire to be with the iphone was five
years ago and i think the web can do so
much more than that I think issue that
we still say it should look the same
everywhere that's what I always have to
fight this is this is a little off track
I don't agree with that but yeah sorry
so I'm sorry but we're gonna close that
that's my job I quite enjoyed actually
right we have a final question which is
going to set us I think down the path
actually that you were on just now Scott
so well well let me continue on that one
from Andre Barons
hi this is andres question and web
developers and even corporations that
are outside the browser vendor community
have the feeling of being a prisoner to
decisions others make with often limited
means to address certain problems who
should be determining the future of the
web and how so who should be determining
the future of web and how lie so this is
the whole extensible web manifesto
discussion it can be it can be um I
still feel that our biggest issue is our
own myopia of what we think is important
because the vast majorities community is
just trying to figure out and argue
about apps versus native and so to me I
would like the web community to start to
figure out a way to experiment we do
things like how would I write a web app
to work across multiple multiple
displays I have to roll everything from
scratch and I just don't think that
we're talking about ways and to
encourage that kind of experimentation
it seemed to be so standards driven now
that we've lost the ability to kind of
do stupid and I'd like to do more
of it okay you carry on doing more
stupid I'll talk to someone else
listen Jenny people are they view
expressed here is that people don't have
a sufficient voice in the process um so
I think the web is what we what we build
it's what we what we make and it's
through experimentation and that we we
have a responsibility if we want our
voice to be heard to step up and and and
shout so I think that the in terms of
standardization I think the w3c has done
a lot to try and open up discussion
through adding community groups for
example over the past three years but I
do think that there is a massive gap
between developers that are in this room
here and the majority of where
developers out there who probably do
feel that they have no role in the
conversation so so can I just ask for a
little straw poll here
out of everybody in this room here who
has actually or who does participating
particularly the w3c process okay so
respectful it or specifically w3c
specifically w3c I think since we're
talking about the web and I guess I'm
making the web in w3c are kind of what
it needn't be so does is the w3c the
future guardian of web well that's
another question I guess so i'm glad
song could ask it what i think is the
view that his expressed here is that
that that's not working particularly
well but i think everybody in this room
everybody he contacts the browser vendor
and asks them to fix a bug arslan to add
a feature you've all got a voice in this
they're all listening i know that there
was a can't maybe the exact numbers X
thousand of bugs reported to the
internet fraud team there's a team of
hundreds of people sitting there
listening to those implementing those
changes so if you're sending your
requests in there's people listening to
her and ultimately I think everyone in
this room has a chance to input inside
where it don't I would I would ask if
you've had experience of that because
I'm just some examples and I there was a
bug there's a bug in firefox from about
2002 2003 to do with fragment
identifiers in iframes and it was it was
opened in 2003 I hit a year and a half
ago somebody else had bumped it about
three years before that no nothing from
from Mozilla and in terms of internet
explorer I don't know who to talk to you
I don't know how i can how i can get at
those people Apple we all know the story
there Yuri the the end for example when
the developer tooling and guys were at
both of the people who represent is
people who are working on these things
when asked how do we contribute kind of
shrunk up and hands I just don't think
it's true that going both requirements
click connect jetta connect up microsoft
com where you can you could submit your
request and there's people this paid
Microsoft employee will then respond to
you say right yes we know about this
also we this isn't the feature we're
interested in implementing and you'll
get a response from the human being
through that and
loads of people in there who litter okay
let's let's go to the audience on this
week got so on at the back and got guy
and then hang on a second but let's get
to the back fest uh huh I'm kind of
biased on this but I think that out of
the four rendering engines that we saw
at the beginning three of them are open
source so basically people can either
work on the engines themselves or find
someone who will do this for him and the
reason I'm biased cuz i am currently
worried i started a crowdfunding effort
yesterday to add feature the picture
element blink so and i think that the
future should have more of that more
people adding features do the open
source runner again okay coming forward
in the rim guy i think that's a pretty
high barrier to entry there isn't it
most web developers yes I mean yeah that
is it as a suggestion well yeah I mean
if we the sensible web manifesto has
been mentioned if we work towards that
ideal where we expose more of the kind
of primitives that are there in the
browsers but we currently have no access
to if we expose them to developers then
we I think we stand a chance of being
able to at least iterate more quickly
towards and an API that we can then
standardized I think given the choice
between downloading and you know
patching chrome myself or just working
around a problem I would work around it
like yeah right massively so things
actually
it's a little different instead of you
know in general the notion of word as
the web evolved and I think we're losing
sight of the server side that we keep
talking about the clients and those
components but I think the future of the
web lies a lot with the services
consumed on it and I think clearly all
these things and all these devices are
part of the technology but what you can
do on the web especially in the
developing world or annoying the access
to banking or facilities or payments by
the the phone or ordering your groceries
or calling a cab all of those components
I think are a big part of the future of
the web so the fact that it might still
be HTML or maybe we're not involving it
is you know sometimes less critical
versus the creativity or the just
disruptions that happen on the business
side of it on the server side of it okay
can we drop the one row for words I
think okay to roseville thank you in
terms of having an input which is what
Andrew was talking to about getting in
touch with people i found an
inconsistency in SVG i wrote a blog post
about it i managed to get in touch with
one of the editors of the SVG spec i
showed him the thing he's updating in
SVG spec to fix that thing it does
happen it does work it is out there and
you can get involved in it okay go go
right to the back and then we'll start
to close down so we can have examples of
times when community input has worked
what we need is an example of when it
hasn't right when the will of the
community has not been exerted a browser
vendors so maybe an example of that
might be drm an example my bdrm okay
it's going in browsers and generally
speaking that's not what people want ok
fine i want to ask natasha who's sitting
right in the front there and put her on
the spot cuz i know that she has
something interesting to say about when
people are invited to take part they
don't see a specific yes well I I'm I've
been very fortunate with contributing to
w3c i co-chair groovin
I actually feeling Joe shoes right now
it's pretty tough but you know all I got
we need we need people to help out and
we're so grateful if people want to help
out and I well we know there's a
membership issue there but but if you
want to help on what we're doing in the
web group then please come come and
speak to us there's lots of the w3c guys
are moving to using open tools like
github and and Twitter we have a Twitter
account and of course the w3c is open
anyway and so if you want to contribute
you can and please come and speak to me
about that later at the party I'll be
very happy to sign you Tasha ok so the
answer the question Tom do I well I just
enjoyed that yeah the dimension of DRM
um is interesting it's not an area I
know anything about so I'm not gonna
speak specifically to drm but the idea
of people who have a vested interest in
that kind of technology encroaching on
say issues of net neutrality is
something that I think is really
important for us to talk about I mean if
we're talking about the future of the
web we're talking about a situation
where I have to pay you know my my isp
for a group of websites that I'm allowed
to visit and I have to extend that
package you know for just five
ninety-nine a month to get access to
this other search engine all this you
know this this website that wasn't on
their original list and they couldn't
you know that they there was some kind
of you know hostility between the two
parties or whatever and and we have a
commercial we have just skip exactly on
this topic am but well there's a bigger
community that needs to be involved that
the web community is a small part of the
group of people who are involved in
ensuring we keep their kind of net hley
org or maintain the kind of net
neutrality that we wish to have and it's
not my area of expertise but I just I've
sometimes feel like we sort of close
ourselves in and say well let's keep the
web bit of this good know the HTML CSS
JavaScript that stack let's keep this
this goodlett as long as we look after
this everything else be fine sometimes I
wish we could take a step back and say
well you know what maybe we could stop
worrying about that for a bit and say
let's get the the people who work on the
networking hardware and do who-who do
all these other aspects and bring us all
together to mention make sure we can go
and forward keep keep the the web in the
Internet in the way we'd like it to be
okay thank you now this is unscripted
Alice and of down the line in three
words than too close to south what is
the future of the web kids freedom help
let's go lots of arguing Andrew I got to
give the privilege of being lost I don't
you stay connected just connects it to
make em connected okay Jenny reedy
centralization cuz just cuz I like that
way and data and 18 okay thank you very
much to our panel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
