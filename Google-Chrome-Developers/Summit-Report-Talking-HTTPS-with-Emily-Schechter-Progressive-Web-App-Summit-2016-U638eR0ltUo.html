live from the progressive Web Apps
summit here in Amsterdam I'm joined with
Emily Schecter a product manager for
security on the chrome team Emily
actually just got offstage so we're
actually in the sort of like the speaker
greenroom that's where everyone's
getting prepared before they go and give
their talks Emily you were talking about
HTTPS and sort of the importance of
moving over to that if I'm someone who
is not like a total networking pro can
you just something a little bit like
what is the difference between HTTP and
HTTPS yeah so HTTPS actually means HTTP
but over a secure connection so
basically with normal non secure HTTP
you actually don't get any of the
security guarantees that come with HTTPS
so what that means is that with non
secure HTTP anyone else on the network
can actually see any of the data that
you're sending and receiving back and
forth and you also don't actually know
that the website you're trying to go to
is the real web site so if you type HTTP
google.com into your browser you know
that you're getting the real google.com
not some fake Google com and you also
know that the site that you see is the
same site that they're sending to you it
doesn't have any sort of ad injection or
malware injected into the page
yeah and I can tell I'm on that
connection by the little little green
box yeah exactly so there's the green
lock we put in the Earl bar in chrome
it's in other browsers as well okay cool
so if I'm a business and I mean
everything you just described sounds
like something that would be super
important to me as a business I want to
ensure that users are seeing my site and
not some weirdo hacker thing I said I'm
a business and I want to move to HTTPS
is there any you know particular hurdle
or thing that you're you think I might
need to
yes so what I actually talked about in
my talk my talk was called myth-busting
HGPS and htps was invented I think like
20 years ago and at that time you needed
specialized server software and
certificates which are what you use to
set up an HTTP connection are they were
really expensive and it was very sort of
low performance but over the past five
ten fifteen years everyone has been
really dedicated to improving the state
of the unit for a GPS so even though you
might think there are these hurdles
actually now with HTTP you unlock some
really crazy performance improvement so
it's actually faster than HTTP and and
some of those some of those services to
maybe help get me on board things like
SSL mate and yeah there are others right
mm-hmm
yeah so there are a bunch of services
out there that make it really easy for
you today what I want to talk about is
called let's encrypt and that's a new
project that actually gives out free
certificates and also provides a bunch
of command line tools so that it makes a
certificate management all it's up super
easy all right well that sounds pretty
awesome so we'll have Emily's talk on
the chrome Developers YouTube channel
we'll include a link down in the show
notes also to those other resources
let's encrypt SSL main etc all this will
be available down in the description
Emily thank you so much for being with
us today thank good thank you all for
watching I'm Rob from Amsterdam and I'll
catch you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
