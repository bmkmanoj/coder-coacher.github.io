hey there polycasters rob here welcome
back to the show last week we were doing
this thing called askpolymer where we
take questions from you and then we try
and answer them here on the YouTube
channel and as we were collecting those
questions I noticed a lot of folks were
asking you know when's the polymer team
gonna create a data table or what is the
roadmap for this particular element and
stuff like that and as we were going
through that process I really started to
think that you know if web components
are gonna be successful we're gonna have
to scale beyond the polymer team really
it's gonna be up to all of us out here
in the community to start making cool
stuff sharing it with one another and
also like promoting it right so one of
the things that I wanted to do was here
on this show I want to start a new
segment called built with polymer where
I take all the cool stuff that you're
building and we just show it off so
other folks can get involved for the
projects and start using it in their own
applications now to do this we're gonna
start off by looking at a website called
custom elements dot IO I'm curious show
hands how many of you have seen custom
element style before okay I noticed that
you did not raise your hand sir
so so for you and for other folks like
you I want to just walk you through how
this website works and some of the cool
stuff that's on there so if you haven't
seen it before custom elements is pretty
badass you can think of it kind of like
NPM for web components it's sort of a
registry it collects all the things that
are actually in the Bower registry and
then it displays a little bits of info
about it so you can search you can find
the different components that are out
there you go to the website and the
first thing you're gonna see up here are
these three sort of main sections you
got the stuff that is recently created
it's brand new you got the things that
have been recently updated which I
always like to see that's supposed to be
a clock and then you've also got the
stuff that's the most popular elements
out there so the things with the most
github stars all three of these very
useful categories to kind of keep tabs
on and one of the things that I also
really like is you've got this really
huge search field up the top now
anything that you could kind of imagine
needing a component for it you just go
type so I might say oh I want something
like a like a table
so go type in table and now I've got all
of these cool results popping up here
for various kinds of tables
another thing that custom elements that
IO gives you which is pretty awesome is
at any point if you want you can click
on someone's profile photo and this will
show you not only their profile page but
also all the cool elements that they
have produced in addition to that one
that you are looking at so if you think
someone's making some really
high-quality stuff you can kind of stock
them on custom elements do and see what
else they're making going back to where
we were last week a lot of folks were
asking when is the polymer team gonna
create a date picker in the material
design style now this is something that
is not currently on the polymer team's
to-do list
we have a lot of elements that we've
created and right now what we really
want to focus on is sort of polishing
those closing bugs and making sure that
they work really well so at the moment
no one is actively working on a paper
date picker and that for a lot of folks
is sort of a dilemma but if we go to
custom elements do we go to the search
field we can just type in date picker or
just date whatever and we can see right
here right away we've got this paper
date picker that shows up by this guy
named Ben Davis so let's scope that out
and looking at the component page on
custom elements do we get a lot of
information really quick right here so I
can see for instance how many stars this
applicator how many stars this component
has I can see how many people have
forked it and how many people are
watching the issues on it I also get the
one-liner to install this on Bower and
what I think is is maybe one of the most
important aspects of the site I get this
activity panel here and on the activity
panel I can see that the component was
created a year ago and most importantly
I can see that it was last updated 11
days ago which tells me that this is
still being actively developed people
are you know contributing to this thing
they're patching into fixing bugs and
and it's getting a lot of love right now
which is important for anything that I'm
gonna add to my application also we've
got the list of Bower dependencies down
here on the right hand side and again
it's really valuable because I want to
know that hey is this thing depending on
the latest version of polymer or at
least polymer 1.0 and some version above
that I don't want an element that is
polymer 0-5 or polymer 0-3 or anything
that's not
gonna work in my app so having all of
this information just kind of at your
disposal every time you go check out one
of these elements is a huge huge benefit
and one of the main reasons why I think
everyone should be using custom elements
IO now the other thing that it does is
it slurps in the readme for this element
so you can see here on the Left I've got
kind of the the github readme that's
just been pulled into the website and if
you want you can go down here and click
on the component page and this is gonna
give you sort of the classic polymer
Doc's style right you've probably seen
these before or we can see properties
that an element supports you can see the
methods that it supports as well one of
the things that I noticed was not
showing up here usually up in the top
right corner there's a little demo
button it's not it's not showing up on
this page but we can just add that by
typing demo into the URL bar and now
we've got our paper date picker showing
up you can see this thing looks pretty
nice right I can I can go click around
different dates changing the month gives
me these sort of cool material design
ripple effects close it and then I can
click this button again to show you how
it reopens lastly one of the things
that's really important is making sure
that the date picker is responsive so go
grab the corner of my browser start
shrinking the page and then boom you can
see that it has changed its layout which
is really really good for mobile devices
so that is just one element that a Ben
Davis has produced if you go back to his
profile on custom elements do you can
see that he's got a few other items here
paper chip paper time picker slightly
different from a date picker paper full
screen dialog a lot of really
interesting looking stuff there that
hopefully we can show off in a future
episode so go find some elements on
custom illness today oh go find the
author's stalk them stalk them on github
stalk them don't stalk them in real life
but stalk them on github and and on this
website right so you can keep tabs and
all the cool stuff that they're building
another thing that happened last week
was a lot of folks were asking when's
the polymer team gonna create a data
table something that is really
sophisticated that I can filter where I
can rearrange columns and do all sorts
of stuff like that
honestly again this is one of those
things that it's it's such a big
undertaking no one on the polymer team
currently has it on their to-do list
because building a complex data table
you could you could seriously just file
a company just on making a killer data
table and in fact there's a group of
folks who have done just that so
recently a team called Vaadin released a
set of elements which they're calling
Vaadin elements and very similar to the
the product lines that the polymer team
vens things like iron elements and paper
elements they put out this set and the
bottom elements are split into kind of
two categories you've got these business
oriented elements for things like data
tables and combo boxes they've even
created an icon set of kind of business
the icons and then they've also got a
bunch of sort of data visualization
components laden charts now the the core
elements as they call them these these
sort of business layout ones these are
all free and open source they are apache
license you can use them in your project
today and then the chart elements those
are a commercial license which you have
to pay for but since a lot of you were
asking about data tables I thought this
would be a really good one to highlight
because it's available on github and you
can mess around with it and use it today
in your project for free so if you go to
their website which is at Vodacom slash
elements got this little demo button if
we click that it's going to show us this
cool expense manager application so I'm
gonna scope out the live demo for this
puppy and we've got a really really nice
looking experience here so a kind of
classic table layout columns and headers
what I really like about this is there's
these these filters up at the top so I
can just let go and check some of these
values and for instance checking in
progress and reimburse you can see over
here the this this the amount of items
in the table is changing as I'm changing
these values right you can sort of see
them changing over here as well on the
Left we can also look for different
merchants so I could say oh I just want
to see stuff from that the taxi
merchants for instance and we'll just
get only the expenses related to that
category likewise and we can search by
min and Max values a lot of cool things
you can do here they've even got this
little floating action button down here
at the bottom you can use that to open a
dialog and actually add a new expense to
this table really really cool example
really really cool powerful element it's
one of those things that again it's not
on the polymer team's agenda at the
moment to build but he's got this
some community built project which we
can all start using in our own work so
yeah that about covers it for today I
know I've only shown a couple elements
but there's actually a big long list of
elements that I want to start featuring
on this show but before I get into that
if you out there if you've got some
stuff that you've built which you would
like for us to show off it can be
elements it could just be cool projects
that you've built please leave me a
comment down there in the youtube
comments or you can ping me on twitter
at hashtag built with polymer that about
covers it for today so as always thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you next time
and if I guess there's Rob here on a
pause for a second Twitter notifications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
