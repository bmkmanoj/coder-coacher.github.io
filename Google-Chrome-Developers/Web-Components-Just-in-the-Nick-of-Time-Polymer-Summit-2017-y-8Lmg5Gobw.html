today I Matt made me promise not to turn
this into a half an hour of telling you
why your websites are too slow so I'm
going to try to refrain myself I am a
software engineer on the blink side of
the chrome team which is to say the
engine bit and I help lead our standards
efforts on Chrome but once upon a time I
also helped start the team that built
the project that ended up as web
components and es6 and a bunch of other
improvements to DOM and to JavaScript we
put together kind of a kind of kind of a
dream team I think that set out to solve
problems that seemed really urgent to us
back in the day and that problem was why
were the web apps that we were making so
blow and floated bloated and slow that
we were looking at this from the
perspective of Google's own apps gmail
sheets slides Docs all the rest and
after a couple years we'd ask that after
we'd released Chrome and a year after we
would release Chrome Frame what we saw
was that the front ends that we were
making still weren't using the new stuff
that we had finally enabled through
chrome and hopefully and ie through
Chrome Frame we had this huge high query
per second system that did nothing but
generate rounded corner gifts I don't
know if you used to make rounded corners
like this but this was like one of the
highest GPS systems that we had in a
bunch of our backend because it was this
nine grid system that made a table so
every time you wanted to round a corner
to get it to work a 96 and 97 and 98 and
you know to all the browsers that
mattered you would put in some
JavaScript that would generate a table
and all the elements to go along with it
and then make an image request and then
put that around the outside and then you
get the idea right it was super
inefficient and I really bugged me and
that bugged some of the other folks on
the team we used to have a lot of codes
hanging around like this in fact this is
still if you go to the close your open
source repository don't worry that's a
bit of an eye chart but what you get in
the comment there is a sense for the Dom
that's generated to give you a rounded
top and top left right or left right
for your element and that actually
didn't do real rounded corners I didn't
even use the gif hack this is just sort
of faking it with one pixel offsets this
is how this is how we used to make
rounded corners so perhaps you were
lucky to start doing web development
after that era but we were seeing at
Google with the teams that were starting
fresh in 2010 still carried around this
kind of legacy baggage either their
frameworks were baking the sort of thing
in by default and they just used it off
the shelf or they had these assumptions
about which browsers they had the
support had to support which may not
have been questioned in a while and so
they always seemed to bring along this
least common denominator approach even
when most of the users came from modern
browsers they still use these slow paths
to this day closure has components like
this this not at me
obviously what kind of performance is
obsessed at Google and this doesn't seem
great but we didn't really have hard
data about what we were really losing to
this sort of efficient in efficiency how
much was this actually costing us so I
did a little project to find out I stole
a couple of weeks from my 80% project I
kind of just didn't answer any email I
go to any meetings or really I may not
have been on the planet as far as anyone
was concerned basically slept under my
desk and just started hacking up Gmail I
got the server's running that took half
a week don't ask and my goal with this
project was just to remove as many
elements from Gmail as Dom as possible I
wanted to make sure the app was pixel
for pixel the same keystroke for
keystroke the same that it worked
exactly the way that it did but see what
you could do if in 2010 you started
fresh like what would it take to iterate
to use some more modern stuff so there's
a lot of stuff in Gmail this is a
screenshot of a recent Gmail and a lot
of things in the engine are linear in
the number of elements some of the
things are linear or super linear in the
number of nodes above you in the tree
the depths of the tree so fewer nodes
the theory goes and shallower
hierarchies would be faster so looking
at where the elements were going it
seemed that modern platform features
could help remove some of the
inefficiency Ravin corners for instance
getting rid of a bunch of the extra
elements for layout but that was all
conjecture turns out it's really
difficult to measure the contributions
of small
in large systems after about a week and
a half of sleepless hacking my prototype
got to a 40% reduction and the total
number of elements in the Gmail Dom that
904 today used to be a lot larger I was
using CSS rounded corners instead of
nine grid tables and gifts I was using
flexbox instead of a custom dual pass
layout system written in JavaScript we
were dropping hugely nested layouts and
in favor of things that were much more
modern and in general I think for the
thing that you do if you could start
over circa 2010 so did it work and
testing locally on a fast machine my my
development workstation which was a 16
core i7 workstation class box was super
inconclusive was kind of a bummer I'd
spent a couple of weeks on this and I'd
really hoped to find that something was
going to be a lot faster about this
I had thought intuitively now is
something about how the engine works
something about how websites work that
this would turn into a faster experience
but I for the life of me I couldn't find
a way to say that it was faster the
changes made a toilet SOI templates a
little bit smaller but try as I might I
couldn't detect any large performance
wimps on that really fast device but
that didn't keep my front Emel Eklund
from the Gmail team from production
izing portions of my prototype patches
those changes wand of dropping the total
size of the Gmail Dom by something like
30% given the ambiguous data we've seen
locally both in local testing and in a
population control groups at Google we
didn't really have high hopes for
anything other than some code cleanups
we thought that this might lead to a
nicer way to work on Gmail but we didn't
think it was actually going to be a big
performance improvement boy were we
wrong with the reduced element count
version in the wild it turned out that
this was a huge impact on real-world
latency many users saw their Gmail
inboxes load half a second faster to put
that in context this was the single
largest latency win in Gmail in years
and there was an entire team staff to
doing nothing but reducing gmail latency
none of us had any idea that this was
going to work this well
even the folks who decided to
productionize it like Emmel we've gotten
lucky we gotten super lucky with this
but what lesson do you learn from that
that's a fascinating question we started
to ask ourselves what should we do next
as a result of figuring out that we
could make things faster this way
one possible lesson might be that making
JavaScript faster leaves a lot of money
on the table from the platform
perspective in terms of cross-cutting
optimizations that you can make inside
of your applications we'd prove that
lesson to ourselves quite a few times
since in the wake of the blink fork back
in 2013 when we started to remove a lot
of the om squared algorithms that we're
sitting around inside of the layout code
for instance another possible lesson
that we could learn is that moving
common stuff from user space into system
space into the platform itself ìletís
reduced not just the cost of development
time or the reduced our complexity for
dilib developing a particular feature
but it also potentially led us radically
improve the user experience - it turns
out that this only works if we can get
developers to use those features though
compelling new features don't need a lot
of help here
developers eventually tend to realize
that building and sending their own
versions of a standardized feature down
the wire is really expensive this is a
little like the way that in the u.s.
state law is preempted a laws or federal
laws national laws preempts state laws
when the bigger slower moving entity
finally acts it doesn't just add up to
an umbrella to keep you out of the rain
it changes the weather entirely I call
this the doctrine of standards
preemption we see this a lot in the
platform in other areas - queries like
for all promises you get the idea so
with that in mind we started writing
design documents about how you might
upgrade the web platform in time this
turned into a pitch deck for a project
that we jokingly called parkour
this is the slide from that internal
pitch deck my naming of course was very
tongue-in-cheek if you looked at us we
were the least likely set of humans to
actually try real parkour or put the
other way the most likely set of humans
to be grievously injured by trying it
so what did we do well every couple of
weeks we sequestered ourselves every
Thursday we clear our schedules and for
most of the day on Thursday we would
meet in a conference room this crazy
u-shaped conference room that used to be
the gap the building used to be owned by
the gap the clothing manufacturer and so
it was sort of this wood panel like
grandiose thing we expected a marketing
pitch deck for the next line of jeans to
be presented breathlessly
but we filled it with nerds and we just
debated a sort of halfway between San
Francisco in Mountain View near the
airport we just spent our Thursdays
digging in trying to figure out what was
in there what what did we need to add we
spent so many hours in that room arguing
prototyping researching arguing
prototyping lots of arguing and we
recruited from the ends of the earth
this is the 'sydney team and they
eventually wound up owning a large
portion of blinkx style engine they
still do as the fun aside some of these
folks were just coming off of the wave
project a lot of our initial design
documents were written in wave win some
lose some I guess and when we made sure
to have experts from nearly every aspect
of the platform in the room
so looks like Annie and Eric on the
right there knew basically everything
there is to know about how to do web
development in that era and folks like
tab on the left and chris burrows
we're language and standards experts and
together we can figure out solutions
that work not just in practice but also
in theory kind of valuable when you need
to actually go write it down as a
standard sometime in the future we
pulled in designers and toolkit
engineers and folks from all over the
company to help us hone our
understanding and try to understand
aspects of problems that weren't clear
yet both the problems themselves but
also the ambiguous design space around
how we might potentially solve them and
did I mention the whiteboards we had a
lot of whiteboards we spent a lot of
time at wife words so many whiteboards
all the whiteboards and when it wasn't
whiteboards it was videoconferencing
from all over the world at one point we
had folks picture pitching in from
Sydney Tokyo San Francisco Mountain View
Seattle London Munich and st. Petersburg
all at the same time we didn't sleep a
lot it was sort of shocking how many
designs we worked through in the space
of a couple of years
it was exhausting it was an incredible
amount of work and discovery and
prototyping turns out that inventing new
platforms is relatively easy iterating
on existing ones compatibly is much much
harder one of the most fruitful veins of
exploration for us was digging into the
then-popular javascript frameworks to
try to understand how they work what was
in there what was common between the
members of our ad hoc team had built
JavaScript frameworks that were at the
time powering some of the largest
products from Google IBM and Sun
remember Sun and we took it upon
ourselves to learn the ones we didn't
know already we look beyond the
JavaScript tools to not just jQuery
closure dojo and Yui but we looked at
flex and sam'l and Zul and xbl and Java
SX and pretty much anything else we
could get our hands on what we
discovered were striking similarities
but wildly different levels of platform
support there was a huge difference
between some of these environments in
terms of batteries included versus bring
your own the web it turned out was very
much in the bring around camp we try to
boil a lot of what we learned down into
these documents these endless documents
that sort of catalog the ways that
people were trying to plaster over what
the platform did or level it up through
common idioms and interfaces just to
give you a sense this was what we did
please don't read this this is one of
the investigations we did just to try to
compare and contrast the event systems
this was copied directly out of a
document I wrote and it gives you a
flavor for some of this research we
wanted to know what toolkits and
frameworks needed to provide because the
platform wasn't either
nice enough to use or expressive enough
to get the job done I try to identify
areas that were common something that
really jumped out at us was how much
infrastructure each library was bringing
around to support creating widgets or
components this is jQuery use jQuery UI
is idea of something like a menu behind
that dollar under dot widget is a huge
world of infrastructure being created to
support stamping out instances of this
thing here's something very similar from
closure the JavaScript library that
traditionally had powered almost all of
Google's largest front end products that
googan haratz line at the bottom shows
that this class really is trying
to be a widget it's trying to inherit
from a control class this is the dojo
version it's very similar that declare
method at the top that's the thing that
does all the magic it sets up functions
it wires up the prototypes it mixes in
all the interfaces it does all that
stuff for you but under the covers it's
the same thing there's a function it's
got its prototype wired up it's a class
basically that you can instantiate and
it creates some dawn from a template and
manages internals in a component sized
way Jerry queries approach pong all
those custom details and try to stuff
them inside of the element itself
whereas almost all the other libraries
that we investigated did the opposite
they created a parallel tree of
components which happen to have elements
hanging off of them
dojo closure Yui created this parallel
hierarchy that just wrapped the Dom
here's Yui is version for instance it
basically takes the same approach as
dojo enclosure studying the landscape
for a while it became clear that what
everyone was really trying to do was to
create a logical hierarchy of components
that didn't have all the implementation
gunk in the way frameworks are spending
tons of time and bytes on the wire to
make this possible a major challenge for
companies as big as Google was that even
when these tools were open-source they
were also incompatible you couldn't take
a Yui widget and use it inside of a
closure application without pulling in
the entire library that came with it
there was a huge sunk cost to importing
any other thing into your system you
couldn't compose closure widgets into
glit as Google that sucked a lot of us
were X framework authors and at some
point in the distant past we'd all
basically had this question at the top
of our minds why in the heck can't we
subclass the HTML element but when
you're working on a framework this isn't
really a meaningful question you can't
do anything about it it's not actionable
browsers or browsers Dunn's the breaks
you just take what you're given and you
move on but now we worked on the browser
what if we could fix it what if we could
make sub-classing HTML element possible
it seems like we'd be able to finally
build portable components and if we were
able to find our widgets in terms of
HTML let them integrate exactly into the
Dom we might be able to finally end some
of this war between
all the different frameworks that we had
built or that we had discovered and
studied so to validate our assumptions
we started building prototypes we built
entire applications and we threw away
all the libraries that we had used
before we got rid of them and we built
as little infrastructure as we needed to
use tip of tree WebKit and v8 circa mid
2010 to see what was still missing if we
could use the tip of what the web
platform had was it all just sitting
there and we didn't know it we just
hadn't used our CSS rounded corners in
this case it was fascinating to see what
fell away in which parts we had to
rebuild to define menus in our apps we
still needed to contort the word
function to mean class in some cases and
do some nasty underbar underbar proto
wiring to convince chrome that our
instances were actually elements and you
could call methods on them it kind of
worked
it was definitely less messy of than the
other way but it still didn't let you
say what you meant
we built entire apps including a cross
between an RSS reader and Google Maps
you could see the current news if you
zoomed in and search for things all
across history but if you zoomed out and
scrolled down
we back filled with Wikipedia data it
was pretty cool but I can't get a
screenshot of it because I tried to get
it working and unfortunately we built it
on the RSS API as from reader I spent a
couple hours trying to get it revived
and Mihai one of the engineers who
worked on reader was on the team and he
plumbed a bunch of this cool stuff in
I'd like to just take a moment and pour
one out for reader can we do that
just a moment of silence for reader all
right I'm still sad as you build these
apps we took note of every single time
that we had to build a little bit of
library to support ourselves it turned
out that this was a great to-do list for
things that we might go and add to the
platform and over the next few years we
attacked those gaps and I'm proud to say
that we were relatively ambitious we
were not shy between 2010 and 2012 we
developed an attempt to advance work in
HTML and Dom JavaScript and CSS we've
seen what happened to other efforts
which try to solve all known problems in
web development using the single tool
example unbounded extensions to the
input element or dozens of one-off CSS
properties because when all you have is
one hammer everything looks like a nail
so we took out some wrenches we got some
saws we both an entire workbench we
decided that we would try to target our
improvements at the places in the
platform where they made the most sense
and so we built a team that was broad
enough to let us start to attack each of
the problems where they lay not
necessarily where we could most easily
turn the wrench by taking a broad view
we were able to target minimal
interventions in many areas of the
system which each of which I hope are
valuable but to get there kind of add up
to Voltron web components aren't one
edition they're a bunch of different
things that eventually end you up with
something like polymer feet are hell on
the chop on the right here helped us
design classes traits and modules async
and away syntax for instance and
prototype at all in the first JavaScript
next to JavaScript now a compiler called
tracer taking them to TSP nine turned
out to be pretty slow going though but
eventually we got a lot of things that
we really needed to make this better few
for possible done through standards
working through these standards is a
sort of the grinding terror of business
travel combined with the high stakes
whiteboarding it's just as much fun as
it sounds we persisted though and
occasionally we even won a few
incidentally this is Dimitri glazkov my
engineering partner in crime and all of
this and now that uber tech lead for all
of the blank project when I originally
posted this photo to Flickr back in 2011
I initially captured it he's never going
to live this down so I feel like adding
it to this presentation is just sort of
keeping a promise to myself anyhow it
wasn't all smooth sailing after we
opened up the design process and started
making public proposals in 2011 we got a
lot of mixed signals from other browser
vendors the standards process isn't
necessarily something that you can gain
we need to actually Ford agreement Oh
most of what we got was in difference
browser engineers tend not to viscerally
feel the problems that we feel as web
developers the grounding explorations
that we were doing to understand the
state of the art and where the problems
lay were actually not the norm
most browser engine projects don't do
this a lot of people were surprised to
hear that browser engineers
don't understand web development very
well but having worked on both sides of
this line it makes sense to me it's not
like you beat the boss at the end of the
web development level and suddenly get
handed a chromium check out an MSDN
subscription and a copy of effective c++
web development and web engine
development are separate skills and we
hire separately for them the problems
were trying to solve in 2010 and 2011
were partially about speed but also
about expressivity the problems that we
front-end community today is trying to
solve our very much have the same flavor
except that many of us now are so up to
our necks in frameworks and see lies and
tools that we can't really even see how
changing something in our apps would
actually affect that eventual outcome
for our users especially in the context
of the existential threat that we face
in terms of mobile performance back in
2011 we put a slide like this up
developers understood that this code
didn't feel right it was div div div div
div div div it was not saying what you
meant
so the expressivity argument tended to
work but the performance argument has
kind of always fallen flat desktop
computers were getting faster Wi-Fi was
everywhere was this really a problem
that we needed to solve a problem we
needed to solve right now we tried to
sketch out a simpler future one where
you didn't have to have heavyweight
frameworks and build steps to enable the
Edit refresh cycle that we had grown up
on the one that we were so addicted to
and really enjoy all this code came from
a snippet in a slide that we put
together nearly seven years ago and what
we thought it showed was the value of
being able to say what you mean class
split pain extends HTML div element we
built es next to es now compilers to
prototype all this and try to feel it
for ourselves and see if it actually
worked out pretty well and very much
today counter to today's ethos in a lot
of the JavaScript ecosystem we built all
of this with the hope that we will be
able to invest it all into the platform
directly and then we will to evaporate
those tools away we built them with a
sell by date tracer was meant to go away
transpilers were meant to be an
ephemeral feature not something that
lives forever in the platform
and we didn't get it all but this code
works today things like the property
initializers for instances that were so
nice in that last example aren't here
and they've been stuck in committee for
reasons that frankly just make me grumpy
but this code works in Chrome and Safari
and opera and Samsung internet and today
and without any tools and soon in every
other browser because the standards
process allows us to forge consensus
that's broader than just one platform
just one browser just one runtime so we
started all this in the desktop era
right and now and then we we have web
components you've been hearing about
them for at least one day going on to
but we're not in the desktop era anymore
so having finally solved all these
problems does it matter for context 2g
connection still make up almost half of
mobile internet connections if you saw
this that in one of our slides last year
was nearly sixty percent so that's on
the decline which is good but if you're
trying to enter emerging markets 2g is
how your median next user is going to
feel your experience the situation is
changing rapidly in emerging markets
reliance geo for instance is having a
massive impact in India this year but
the global reality for the next billion
users is that 3G is how people
experience your apps and sites so those
users the experience isn't just about
the network it's also about the hardware
that they have in their hands I promise
Matt that I wouldn't make this a
performance rant but we really do need
to understand these devices if we're
going to deliver the sorts of UI that we
want to the users that we want to have
experience them okay quick digression
more cores is not faster more cores is
not faster there's probably no better
trade off in mobile CPU design today
than to take all of the extra cores that
are actually most the time spun down and
turned them into cash is for the cores
that are spun up if anyone from Qualcomm
or mediatek or Samsung or listening or
see this video later just know that we
see you endless marketing of more
courses better has run its course the
king is actually kind of naked
we need devices that have good thermals
which many of them don't this is the
Nexus 5 of course the CPUs are super
slow for lots of reasons and it's not
just the terrible thermals I could go on
and on and on and on about the 28
nanometer process that coincided to
switch to 64-bit and how the electron
volt there's leakage cause everyone to
not be able to scale their CPUs up but
I'm not going to do that what I will say
though is that most of the web
development community has a really long
way to go and appreciating how far from
good the current practice really is are
usually waiting on a huge pile of
JavaScript to arrive and execute just to
see content or to start using it to
start tapping on it doesn't give a whit
about whether or not your developer
experience was very good who are we
doing this work for it's a question
worth answering Kevin saw yesterday
emphasized webpagetest.org slash easy
and time to interactive and I think
that's absolutely the way forward
accurate network stimulation plus real
Hardware gets you actually pretty close
to ground truth of the experiences that
we're building today and shipping to
users over unreliable networks perhaps
the most important thing for us to
understand collectively though is that
when Hardware gets cheaper it has a
different effect here than it does in an
emerging market for wealthy users more
transistors every year Moore's law right
every 18 months double the transistor
count here that turns into basically
constant dollar spend or euro spend if I
spend the same number of euros next year
on a phone it's a faster phone in an
emerging market where most people in the
world or in those countries don't have
devices that turns into a broader market
for a cheaper version of what you
already have that is to say we don't
trade transistors per dollar for faster
phones in emerging markets we trade it
for a larger market for the same speed
of phone that creates a larger set of
users carrying devices that we might
charitably think of as mid tier back in
2015 and we should expect that trend to
continue for a couple of years which
sounds pretty bad so for example this is
the Samsung Galaxy on five you probably
have never held one of these it's just
about a hundred US dollars or 90 euro
more or less it
a gig and a half of RAM and about eight
gigs of storage it's pretty popular
these days in India it's I think the
third most popular phone in Flipkart the
CPU on this device is quad-core but if
you've seen my other talks or heard me
rant just earlier what you'll know is
that more cores doesn't actually mean a
lot what's interesting to me about this
device though is that it runs the latest
Chrome the hardware might be stuck in
2015 but the platform doesn't have to be
so how slow is $100 phone well here are
some Geekbench three scores for Android
ecosystem system-on-chip
packages the awesome line Nexus 5 that
used the Snapdragon 808 that's down sort
of toward the bottom of this as you can
see so where's that galaxy on five you
kind of got to scroll a while oh yeah
there it is but you know what I'm not
bummed out about is that our thesis from
2010 was right we can use the platform
evolution to preempt heavyweight user
space apps and frameworks and get some
of this back we can dispense the tools
that only work for the wealthy users and
thanks to the platform evolution we can
level the playing field for everyone you
all know about the shop app by now it's
beautifully executed example of what's
possible at Palmer but what's
interesting to me about it is it
demonstrates how this progress plays out
and how we can cope with the next few
years of evolution in the marketplace as
we're waiting for phones to actually get
faster we don't have to drown anything
in JavaScript here's shop using polymer
1.7 and I dug it out from an old check
out it load something like 340 k of
resources total when served well it can
be super snappy it can get to time to
interactive on a Moto G 4 on a 3G
network in something like 5 seconds
which is I think the gold standard front
first load but here's the unbundled
version using polymer 2 and es6 it's
exactly the same functionality but is 60
k smaller what changed well it's able to
use the custom elements one API s and
we're able to serve just the things that
this browser can support for users on
slow connections inflate flaky networks
this is huge
shop was fast already but every
the bite we leaned on the platform for
instead of sending down the wire really
pays us back and it pays us back in
terms of reach over the next few years
polymer is converting on the promise of
we believed in back when we started the
parkour project but in a context that we
just didn't see coming
web components it turned out where the
answer to a problem we didn't know to
ask when Darren and Alex and Matt and
the rest of us all bet on this effort
back in 2010 and 2011 es6 and web
components were sort of something we
just were going to figure out something
that we kind of knew were going to be
important but we didn't understand why
but we got lucky again when we started
ripping elements out of Gmail we didn't
know that it was gonna make anything
faster turned out it did when we started
upgrading the platform we knew it would
make it nicer to use but we didn't know
how much faster it could make things but
now we know we're in a special moment
right now smartphones are opening up
computing the people who've never had
access to them before and the web I
believe can be the single best way to
deliver experiences to those users if we
don't drown it in JavaScript web
solution is freeing us up to attack new
and harder problems further up the stack
that's great news for us as developers
but it's mostly great use for our users
if we use the platform thanks for having
me and thanks for making your fast site
