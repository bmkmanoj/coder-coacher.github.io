developer relations team it's nice to
see you this is a brand new develop a
diary about Google Santa tracker a fun
educationally themed website that we
release every year in December this site
is built by a whole team of help or
elves not just me so let's get started
and have a look at the site Santa
tracker is a winter playground we have a
bunch of different scenes here to
explore different houses including some
which are very coding themed which we
really like there's some Easter eggs
hidden throughout the site you know
things like this little balloon here
which you can take off and it's mostly
built with polymer the web framework in
this series we're going to share a bunch
of learnings with you things that we've
discovered in building Santa tracker and
things you can take away and use in your
own sites the most important thing to
remember is that Santa tracker is on
github so you can actually follow along
at home go to the google organization

instructions are below how to build it
