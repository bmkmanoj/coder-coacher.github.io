welcome back to the alley cash show so
today I want to talk a little bit about
the differences between states and
properties in Aria so last episode we
kind of didn't intro to Aria today I
want to continue on with some of that
stuff and talk about this idea of you
know what differentiates a state from a
property or an attribute right you'll
see all these things referred to in the
various Aria spec so I want to help you
understand you know when you're trying
to build a custom control what all those
terms mean so typically what I do when I
want to build any sort of widget because
the first place I go is the Aria
authoring practices guide and I'll
include a link to that down in the the
show notes basically the already
authoring practices guide we've shown it
off in a few of the previous episodes
I'll show it over here on my laptop it's
a really really useful resource that
lists over here on the left-hand side a
bunch of UI widget patterns and on the
right hand side we'll have descriptions
explaining all the steps you need the
keyboard support the RDS States and
rules that you need to have to support
those elements so for instance if I go
and I look at something like this radio
group here I can see that it's going to
tell me what keyboard interaction we
need to support and if I scroll down a
little bit here I'll zoom this up so
it's a maybe a bit easier to read let's
cool down also show me the Aria roles
states and properties so what does it
mean when it says a state versus a
property in the world of Aria these two
terms are oftentimes kind of like
mentioned in the the same sentence but
basically you have an object objects
have property something that describes
kind of their essential nature and then
sometimes you have properties that
really define the state for that object
so to draw some some differences here
for for some elements you might have
Aria multi-line so this is a property
that kind of describes the essential
nature of an element either be single
line or multi line and properties are
probably not going to change that often
it's not that it's not true for all
properties some properties like like
like value properties and things like
that but it might change kind of
frequently by that but most properties
tend to be fairly static whereas States
are other kinds of properties that are
expected to be a bit more dynamic so for
instance if you're building a check box
or something like that you would expect
Aria check to toggle between true and
fall
pretty frequently so how do you figure
out then you know what states and
properties and roles your element should
support or really like the sort of
deeper definition for those right you
can see them here in the re all thing
practice this guide but if you want to
kind of dig under the surface a bit well
usually what I do is I start with the
role so in this case if I'm looking at
the radio group it'll tell me that the
radio group is going to have the role of
radio group and I can click on that and
that will actually take me over to the
Aria spec itself and here I'll zoom out
a little bit so you can see smore the
Aria spec looks it sometimes it can be
hard to tell these documents apart it
looks just like the re authoring
practices guide so that has kind of that
same ol blue on white spec look that is
so enjoyable to read but the Aria spec
itself very similar but the one thing
that I'm showing here now is kind of a
deeper definition of the radio group
role let's walk through this definition
a little bit this sort of table that you
see here on the right is very very
common you'll see a lot in the Aria spec
and it's helpful to understand how to
interpret all of these things so when
we're looking at the radio group role
what it's telling us first of all is
that this role inherits from some other
kind of more abstract roles so for
instance the radio group inherits from
the Select role you can actually click
on this and you can kind of just like
walk these roles up the ladder to figure
out you know who their parents are so
for instance select inherits from
composite in-group right and walk that
up and you can see that group is
inheriting from section and so on and so
on and as you're doing that you can see
subclasses for those and you can also
see additional things like the kinds of
properties that each of these roles
contains so let's go back to radio group
and some of the other things we can see
we can see related concepts or related
roles and things like that so a list is
sort of related to a radio group that
kind of similar you can also see
required elements that need to be within
your element so for instance in the case
of a radio group we are required to own
radio children right and we can you then
go and explore that role and then we can
also get down here we can see these
supported States and properties so again
remember the states are going to be kind
of more dynamic and the properties will
be sort of more essential to our actual
nature so in the case of the the radio
the two live ads that are sort of unique
rreow read-only and Aria required right
but it also has inherited states and
properties and these are coming from
those superclass roles as parent rules
so things like aria active descendant
are you busy Aria controls right those
all come from those more abstract
parents and it means that you know when
we're down here in this more focused
child rule we can still take advantage
of all of those which is really cool one
of the things you may also often see in
these tables you're not seeing it here
but if we go and look at radio you know
there were also often be required states
and properties so in the case of a radio
the actual radio button itself
aria-checked
is a required state so you've got to
have an already checked on all of your
radio children you need to be setting it
to true or false so let's look at some
of these inherited states and properties
then so Aria active descendant okay so
what exactly is that this is actually a
really really useful property in a
previous episode we talked about tab
index and the roving tab index technique
maybe we can include a link to that up
there or something so roaming cam index
we use to sort of manage focus inside of
a complex component Aria active
descendant essentially does a very
similar thing it allows us to tell the
user you know which of our sort of
children is currently focused are
currently active if you will the primary
difference is it doesn't require us to
actually change the tabindex actually
move the focus throughout the composite
control and so we can leave focus on
sort of a parent element and just
dictate which child is currently the
active descendant in most cases for
instance with like a screen reader like
voiceover it'll announce that the same
either way so it really comes down to
which style you prefer for building your
controls so let's look at re active
ascend and I just kind of like show off
how this works you can see that
inherited properties and states work
with with with these rules as well so
our active in system image you can see
here very similar to tabindex the
primary difference is that it works by
taking an ID reference to a child that
should be sort of currently active so
we're here to this example that I've
built this is a little radio group that
I've been working on and let's see if I
can kind of bump this up a little bit so
you can make it easier to see
hit the enhance button
okay so I've got this - radio group with
a roll of radio group and this element
this outer element has a tab index of
zero so focus will land on it but what
we're not going to do is actually focus
the children instead I've given each of
these children of ID I have so ID RB 4
radio button 1 RB 2 RV 3 and what we're
going to do is as you know focus is
moving around or as we're sort of
activating different children inside of
this radio group we'll use active
descendant to tell the screen reader
which one currently has has focused so
to speak now keep in mind we're not
actually moving focus and you'll see
this you'll see that focus does not
change it always stays on that advert
element but for the screen readers sake
it'll be announcing the different
children as if they are focused so the
way we'll view this so I'll turn on my
screen readers you can hear it boys all
around roll one 27.0
radio you've heard the screen reader
there I've selected the first child this
was water radio button you can see we
have some of this strange focus outline
because of the way that I have styled
the CSS for this element I use like
pseudo elements and things like that so
our outline of wrapping around the whole
group but what we didn't do and if you
can sort of see it over here in our
markup we did not change the tab index
on any of the children instead we added
an aria active descendent attribute to
the parent and we've set it equal to the
ID for that first child and if I go and
water radio so to select a great coffee
selected radio voiceover off as I'm
hitting the up and down arrow keys we're
just updating the Aria active
descendents so we're never using that
roving tabindex technique instead we
just stick with aria acted Senden and
again it really comes down to
stylistically like which approach you
want to use for your elements active
descendents really good for things like
like autocomplete widgets where you need
to keep focus in a text box with
something keep typing or you can also
say hey here are some of the auto
completions down here below or you may
just prefer to do all of your you know
have been delegation on some parent and
not have to like you know fiddle with
every single child and set roles and or
set tabindex on them either so anyway
this is kind of just a brief overview of
escapes and properties and I wanted to
do this because I wanted to give you a
better understanding of how to take an
example in the Aria authoring practices
guide and kind of walk it all the way
through the Aria spec to have a better
deeper understanding of all of the you
know sort of the properties that make
up these really essential roles so been
about covers it for today if you have
any questions you can always leave them
for me down below in the comments or you
can hit me up on a social network of
your choosing
