five new features in chrome 63 including
multi client debugging workspaces 2.0
custom push notifications and background
sync events and four new audits up until
now dev tools hasn't played nicely with
other developer tools if you've ever
tried debugging a chrome driver test
with dev tools or using the debugging
extension in vs code or webstorm you
know what I'm talking about
once you open up dev tools your session
and that other tool gets demolished as
of chrome 63 this is fixed we call it
multi client debugging and it opens up a
whole bunch of new interactions between
tools generally speaking clients can now
run at the same time as dev tools and
multiple clients can now connect to the
same time for a while now we've had a
feature called workspaces
which essentially lets you use dev tools
as your code editor within dev tools you
make some changes to your code and the
changes get saved to your file system
version 2.0 brings some UX improvements
to this workflow here on my desktop I've
got the repository where I frantically
hacked together the last minute demos
for these videos let's serve the repo
locally and work on the demo that I'm
going to show you next to map the local
code to the network go to the sources
panel then click the file system tab
then drag and drop the directory chrome
ask you to confirm that you want to give
dev tools read and write access to the
directory after I reload the page
there's a green dot next to some of the
files in the network tab this means
they're mapped to local resources dev
tools does these mappings automatically
style changes in the elements panel
persistent disk for example when I
changed the color of this h1 the green
dot here next to the link means that
this change is persisted in the source
click on the link and back in the
sources tab we can see the change has
been written to the file just to confirm
let's run git diff on the repo and yes
we can see the change has been recorded
in the git repo - now a big current
gotcha to be aware of is that changes
you make in the DOM
don't persist for example change this
each one's text go back to the sources
panel and view the file there and the
change isn't there we load the page and
the text reverts to what was there
before so if you want to persist Dom
changes just edit the file from the
sources panel reload the page and you
can see that the Dom change persists
across the page loads in the
serviceworkers tab you can now send push
notifications with custom content and
background sync events with custom tags
go to the application panel then click
these serviceworkers tab to send a
custom push notification put some
content in the push box then click the
push button to send a background sync
event with a custom tag enter the custom
tag in the sync box then click the sync
button for this demo I've just set up
the service workers to log the tag text
to the console in real apps this feature
is useful when your app is offline and
you want the service worker to do some
work once an internet connection is
re-established using the tag as the
command keyword for which logic to
execute the oddest panel has four new
audits including serving images as web P
using images with appropriate aspect
ratios avoiding front-end JavaScript
libraries with known security
vulnerabilities and logging browser
errors to the console that's all for
chrome 63 here's a tip about a
lesser-known dev tools feature say
you're debugging a page or
deconstructing somebody else's page and
you want to study the logic that gets
triggered winning and the event fires
you could dig around the code and search
blindly for the event handler logic or
you can use an event listener breakpoint
here I've got thermos tinder for bananas
app open and I really need to figure out
what logic runs when I click the like
button to set an event listener
breakpoint go to the sources panel then
expand the event listener breakpoints
section check the mouse check box to
break on any Mouse event or expand the
section and check the click check box to
break on click events specifically when
I trigger there click listener by
clicking the like button dev tools
automatically pauses on the first line
of code in the listener sometimes and
the event causes multiple listeners to
run for example if you've got some
analytics tracking set up you might
pause in the click listener from the
analytics code in which case you can
just click resume script execution and
the page runs until the first line of
the next event listener that's it thanks
for watching see you in six weeks for
Chrome 64</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
