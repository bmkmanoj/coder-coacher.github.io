I'm a product manager on the chrome team
and I'm excited to talk about how you
can build experiences that work for
everyone around the world so one of the
strengths that we know about the web is
that it really is everywhere it's on
every form factor whether it's a laptop
a desktop smartphone or even some TVs
it's on every operating system though it
can be a little bit different on some
operating systems and what this really
means is that it's also available across
the entire world
and what this means is that as we're
looking at the the reach that the web
has the user base for the web really is
anyone who has internet access so if we
look at the total number of Internet
users around the world and we look at
the top 10 countries over the last few
years we see that things have shifted a
fair bit in just a few years so China
still remains one of the countries with
the most number of Internet users and
the US which used to be second for a
number of Internet users has actually
been surpassed by India and you'll also
see that the growth rates are a little
bit different here with India very much
up into the right where some of the
other countries aren't growing as
quickly in terms of the number of total
Internet users but you also see some
other countries coming up here you see
Brazil you see Russia Nigeria and you
also see Germany and the UK but what's
really interesting isn't just to look at
the snapshot of where our Internet users
are right now but take a step back and
look at where our potential new Internet
users are going to be coming from and so
if you look instead at the number of
potential new Internet users per country
and again if we look at just the top ten
you see a little bit of a different
story here you'll notice that the US and
various countries in Europe aren't here
anymore and instead you actually see
that some of those countries that we saw
that already are on the top 10 for the
total number of Internet users are also
on the top 10 for total number of
potential new Internet users so you see
that countries like India and China
Nigeria Mexico and Brazil not only
already have a huge number of Internet
users but are expected to have even more
and so we expect this to continue to
shift over the next several years so
really the Internet users will be
accessing experiences around the entire
world and if we look instead at how we
are actually developing experiences
today we're all we're all used to
testing on different devices to make
sure that the experience looks the way
we want not just on our phone but on
other phones and we're used to testing
on different os's but we don't always
take that step back and look at how we
action can actually build our experience
from the ground up with a global
audience in mind and the reality is that
everyone uses the internet differently
I'm sure everyone in this room uses the
internet differently but as you look
towards different countries and
different people who come from various
backgrounds and maybe are interacting
with the Internet for the first time on
a mobile device the behaviors and
patterns that they're going to be using
to access the Internet are just going to
be a little bit different but well we've
also noticed by thinking about this for
the last few years in particular is that
things are also changing really really
quickly and that it's not just a matter
of figuring out what's going on right
now but where are things headed and
really responding to things as they
change so I just want to walk through a
few of the things to keep in mind as
you're thinking about building
experience does that work for everyone
and specifically focusing on some of the
changes that we've seen so the first
thing to note here is devices vary we're
all used to this we've probably in our
lifetime with with smartphone usage had
seen how quickly devices very just with
what we have in our own pocket this is
also the case if you take this global
stance but it's more than just the form
factor itself of how big the screen is
or the dimensions there and it's
actually the capabilities of the device
for example we actually see that in
India about one third of users in India
on smartphones are regularly running out
of storage and this means that if you're
actually asking them to try your
experience out and expecting them to
download something you're asking them to
make the trade-off of if they want to
remove that photo or the video that they
have in order to just try your
experience so this can have a really big
impact on the number of experiences that
people are willing to give a try but
beyond just the amount of storage space
on the device we also see that the
device specs themself are a little bit
different and this can have an impact on
how people interact with an experience
once they have it if you look at some of
the devices that were sold in the first
half of 2017 we see they're about 24% of
them were under $100
and these devices often just have very
different specs to reach this price
point so they'll have less RAM for
example so less than one gigabyte of RAM
or 512 megabytes of RAM and this can
have a big impact on how users are
engaging with the device app switching
can be more challenging they can have
out of memory crashes and this can just
change the experience that they have but
beyond just the physical device we also
see that access really varies in terms
of being able to access the Internet in
the first place and engage with your
experience we talked a lot in the past
about data costs and how this can be
really prohibitive for certain people
around the world from accessing the
Internet
but what's really interesting here is
how quickly things are changing so if we
look at India for example which in the
past we've talked about as one of the
countries where data costs have been
quite prohibitive we've actually seen
things shift quite a bit over the last
year so reliance geo which is a mobile
network operator actually introduced
unlimited 4G data for about six months
and this drastically cut down the price
of data cost in India and it wasn't only
for Reliance Geo and for 4G networks but
it actually drove down the prices across
all of India and so what we're seeing is
as a result of this one thing over the
course of 12 months the cost in India
for data has really gone down and if you
look at the cost specifically for one
gigabyte per month you see a nice
downward trend there about it what I
really want to call out is that around
q1 2017 the price for one gigabyte per
month dropped below 2% GDP per capita
and 2% GDP per capita is generally
accepted by the Alliance for affordable
Internet as the threshold for
affordability so it's when the cost
drops below this threshold that we tend
to see you users feeling more
comfortable accessing the Internet and
not having to make trade-offs about the
cost of data when they're thinking about
what to what to actually access but I do
want to take it make sure to note that
this is this is India so India
specifically has been a huge shift in
data costs over the last year but there
are still many countries around the
world where data costs aren't even at
that 2% threshold they're actually well
above that 5% gni and so we're seeing
that data cost is still a challenge
around the world but it does have the
option of switching very quickly so it's
important to make note of this and to
not only plan
to build experiences that are
conscientious of data usage but also
adapting to the users who are most
sensitive and going from there now we
all know that data cost can be a
challenge in some areas but we also know
that connectivity can be a challenge I'm
sure all of us have experienced the slow
connection and and complained when we
have to wait too long for things to load
this is even more so the case when you
take a global look at things so if we
look at a report from earlier this year
that looked at the 2016 connectivity
landscape you'll see that 2g data
connections are still really common
around the world and even though we're
seeing that this is shifting in some
countries it's not changing particularly
rapidly so even in India with Reliance
Geo introducing 4G networks if you look
at estimates from 2017 it still suggests
that in 2020
53% of connections in India will still
be 2g and this is just strictly 2g this
isn't even accounting for the fact that
3G connections can still feel like
they're 2g speeds just due to the load
and so this is just strictly 2g
connections so the reality is is that
connectivity challenges aren't going
anywhere and the need for really fast
experiences across all of these
connection types continues to be really
critical for everyone around the world
and as a result of these different
conditions that people are using to
access the Internet there's also some
variations in behavior for how they're
actually accessing experiences and what
they're doing with them and I just want
to call out a few of these that we've
we've seen so far so one is that
downloads are key especially when it
comes to content so we've seen that
connections are slow data costs can be
high and people can actually spend days
offline and what downloading content can
actually address all of these because
you could once you download content
playback if it's a media experience can
be really smooth and fast even if you're
on that slow connection you can re-watch
or reread content multiple times without
having to pay for that data again and
for those days that you spend offline
because you ran out of a data plan or
just don't have any connectivity or in
our scenarios are on a plane or
something of the sort you'll see that
you can still access content and so
downloads really is used across the
board to address some of these
challenges but beyond just this approach
to accessing content we also see just
different behaviors for specific
verticals that people might be working
on
so another one I want to cut this call
out here is payments when you take a
global stance and look at payments you
realize that payments are way more than
just credit cards a lot of us are used
to online payments directly meaning
pulling out your credit card typing it
in or using autofill or any other
solution but this isn't the case around
the world if we look again at India we
actually see that there are 28 times as
many debit cards as credit cards in
India so if you're building a solution
that assumes that someone has a credit
card to be able to go through a checkout
flow or purchase the item you're really
only targeting an india market of about
28 million credit cards in comparison to
818 million debit cards and so it's
really important to think about where
your users are and how they're actually
experiencing the web and the experiences
that you're building and what's more is
if you look at this per country and are
thinking about who you're targeting you
also see that the government can have a
big effect here so in India for example
still focusing on payments the
government actually introduced the
universal payments interface or UPI
which specifically focuses on enabling
bank to bank transfers because of the
lack of prevalence of credit cards and
after introducing this we've actually
seen this grow quite a bit most notably
you see a jump there between November
and December and 2016 this is because
this is Wendy monetization happened in
India and some of the bills that were
commonly used were actually no longer
accepted and so this actually helped
drive the adoption of UPI or alternative
payment methods and what we're seeing as
a result is more and more experiences
coming up that are leveraging these
alternative ways to pay that aren't
reliant Sorley solely on credit cards so
you have Paytm or most recently Google
also launched Ted's that was trying to
think through how we can build an
end-to-end payments experience that
doesn't rely on users just having credit
cards and payments aren't the only thing
this is just one example of many we also
see as users are coming online from
around the world that a lot of people
speak more than one language and a lot
of speak pills don't speak English and
so taking a step back and understanding
what language people actually use is
also important in fact if you look at
some of these most rapidly growing
countries we actually see that about 20%
of our users from around the world are
regularly searching in two or more
languages and so we're seeing that this
is already impacting their behavior for
the how they're in
with the web and has implications for
how we build for them and so across the
board there's a lot of different
considerations that you need to keep in
mind when you're thinking about how you
can build experiences for everyone
but one of the things I just want to
jump into first is the web already helps
with a lot of these it can be really
daunting to think of oh no there's so
many things I need to keep in mind but
the web is fundamentally built to
address a lot of these key issues we
know that with the web it can be easier
to discover something if you get a link
if you search for it and you end up on
the page you've already found it you
don't need to hunt through it and what
more is when you're actually there you
don't need to install it to experience
it by virtue of getting there you're
already experiencing the product and
what it has to offer but we also know
that it's not just about getting users
to interact with your product for the
very first time you're also hopefully
continuing to work on it and make it
better and you want to make sure that
your users are getting those updates and
with the web when they're accessing your
experience they're accessing the most
up-to-date version of your experience
and you don't have any challenges of
actually updating users to the latest
version that you've built and as a
result of all of these we've also seen
that the web can have a tremendous reach
and so these fundamental building blocks
has actually allowed the web to grow
especially in line with how how large
the internet access has grown over the
past few years if you look at the top
1,000 mobile web properties compared to
the top 1,000 native apps you'll see
that even with the large initial user
base the mobile web audience is growing
even faster than native and this is in
part because we've been working on
moving the web forward across all
browsers and this has really been an
initiative that we've been doing with
all of you and a lot of folks around
here to make sure that the web platform
can offer the capabilities that
developers need and that users need and
so we actually today have serviceworker
which is one of the key technologies
that you all heard a lot about yesterday
supported across some of the most
popular browsers around the world so
from Firefox to opera to Chrome to
Samsung Internet and you see browser
they all have set some serviceworker
capabilities to make sure that we can
provide the best possible experience to
our users but there's more that you can
do than just build a website and so I
just want to walk through some concepts
to keep in mind base
some of those challenges that we
outlined before for how you can build
the best possible experience so just to
jump right in we all know that storage
is challenging we've probably all
experienced some storage constraints on
our phone we took too long of a video
and now have no more room we took too
many photos whatever it might be this is
definitely the case around the world as
well and one of the really key
opportunities we have here is that PWA
is just take less storage if we look at
Ola for example which is a popular
ride-sharing app in India you'll see
that they already have an iOS app and
the iOS app was about 100 megabytes they
also had an Android app their Android
app was around 60 megabytes but they
were really focused on how they could
increase their reach specifically
targeting tier 2 and tier 3 cities in
India where they knew that storage
constraints were a real problem and so
they looked into their options there and
actually decided to build a progressive
web app specifically to target this this
set of users and to expand their reach
to areas where people have more storage
constraints and what they built was a
PWA that was 200 kilobytes I just want
to emphasize here that's that's
kilobytes
I know 200 can look bigger but that
means that they were able to build an
experience that was comparable and able
to address the key flows that they
needed for their users at one three
hundredth of the size of their native
Android app and that's compared to their
Android app not not even their iOS app
and so this was huge for actually
increasing the reach and the
opportunities that they had and
fundamentally what we're seeing more and
more is that pwace are a key strategy
for extending the reach of your
experience and making sure that everyone
can access it from the get-go and don't
have to jump any through any hoops and
so what you're really doing is making
sure that there are no unnecessary
barriers to trying out your experience
and one of the barriers we talked about
before was also around data costs so I
do want to focus on that a little bit
and while we've been seeing things shift
in India India is just one of many
countries and we want to make sure that
we're building really for everyone if
we're trying to extend our reach as much
as possible so in chrome on Android
we've had for a while a feature called
data saver which is a server-side proxy
for HTTP content to help users save more
data but what we also want is that you
as developers know what you can do to
specifically identify users who are most
data sensitive and adapt your experience
and so what we have here is a saved
a header and in chrome this maps
directly to whether a user has data
saver on or off and allows you to see
who is the most data sensitive so this
is pretty simple it's either on or off
and you can figure out whether I use
there is data sensitive or not and this
is standardized across browsers as well
and then you but depending on your
experience can decide what optimizations
to make so it might be that you replace
images or you choose which images are
the most critical for your flow it might
be that you choose to change the
bandwidth of video playback or whatever
it is and you can really decide what's
right for your user base based on the
flows that you know that they need to
complete what's also really important
here isn't just saving users data and
identifying who's who needs that data
saved but you also want to make sure
that you show users when you've saved
data because if you've saved someone
data and they don't know you've saved
them data they don't necessarily feel
like they can trust you and that they
can continue to use your experience
because they're not sure that you won't
just use way more the data than they
expect
and we've been taking the same principle
with chrome as well with showing for
data saver users with just one tap so
that they can see their data savings and
learn to trust that the web is looking
out for them and being data
conscientious as they're browsing but
beyond just data use we also know that
memory is a constraint especially as we
see more and more devices being sold at
a hundred dollar price points are lower
and what we want to make sure here is
that it's not just about accessing that
experience for the first time but that
users are really having a good rich
experience as they're interacting with
it and the first step to solving a
problem is always to know what the
problem is so the first piece here is
really to know your memory usage and
Paul Irish will be talking a lot more
about this later today so definitely
check out his talk but one of the key
things to identify here is understanding
where your memory usage is going and
what opportunities you have and memory
usage isn't an equivalent constraint for
everyone so it's also important to
identify which devices and which users
need us to make the most improvements
and so we have device memory header and
a device memory JavaScript API they can
allow you to identify the devices that
are most constrained and we've been
keeping these same principles with
chrome as well we actually did a similar
effort around our v8 and specifically by
focusing on devices with one gigabyte of
ram or less we're able to decrease our
heap memory consumption by 50
percent and so the main thing here is to
make sure you're keeping a very close
eye on your memory usage and
specifically targeting the users that
are most challenged by this constraint
to make sure that you're delivering a
really high quality experience and that
it's not that someone will access your
experience and then how do I have an out
of memory crash because that's not good
for anyone but beyond us the device
considerations we also know that
connectivity can be a challenge and this
goes across the board this happens here
this happens in India this happens in
Indonesia it happens really around the
world just the frequency of some of the
challenges that can vary and so one of
the important things with connectivity
that we talked about yesterday is that
you can build across the board sort of
fast integrated reliable and engaging
experiences but I want to focus
specifically unreliable here this is one
of the considerations that comes up the
most when you're looking at a global
scale and so similar to what we said
before with memory the first step here
again is to know your connection and
know what the challenges you actually
face are so we have the network
information JavaScript API and this is
something that you can use to figure out
what situation is your user currently in
so you can adapt accordingly in the past
we've talked about downlink max and so
downlink max would give you the
information about the maximum throughput
based on the users connection so if
they're on 3G or 2g or 4G what's the
maximum throughput for that particular
next connection type but we also know
that that's not necessarily
representative of what they're actually
experiencing so you can also look at
downlink
or round-trip time which will actually
estimate these values based on recent
connections that we've seen in that area
so we use our network quality estimator
to give you more information about the
actual experience that the user is
getting and beyond this sometimes you
might need the more detailed pieces of
downlink and RTT but sometimes they just
need the high-level summary and so we
also have effective type and this can
give you the details of based on the
current downlink and RTT what is the
effective connection type that the user
is actually experiencing so they might
be technically connected to a 3G network
and so downlink max might give you the
maximum throughput that a 3G network
could provide but the effective type
would let you know that actually this is
functionally a 2g network and you should
treat it like a 2g network and make sure
that you're creating the group vast
experience from there but of course
knowing it isn't enough you also want to
make sure to
adjust the experience accordingly and
we've had a lot of different topics and
presentations about how to make sure
your your site is as fast as possible
but I do just want to highlight that
serviceworker which is something we talk
a lot about for fully offline options is
also really really helpful for
addressing intermittent connectivity or
slow connections whether it's doing
request timeouts when you're on slow
connections or just caching content so
you can handle those intermittent
connection situations it's really
important to think about how
serviceworker can be used to build in
resilience and building for intermittent
connections isn't just about the text
and images on your web page it's also
about more interactive content that you
might have or any media and in fact
supporting offline is really critical
for fast playback on some of these
connections we talked about earlier how
downloads are really common for as a way
for people to access content around the
world and if you support offline this is
in part because playing back video
content that has already been downloaded
is just much more reliable on these
flaky connections or on slow connections
but people are also sometimes totally
offline whether it's on a plane or just
running out of your data pack or just
having really lousy connectivity and
going into airplane mode to maintain
your data cost and so we do have the
capabilities on the web to fully support
offline media experiences and what's
really exciting here is that one of the
challenges we have with supporting off
lining of media is that we need to make
sure that we're still as developers in
control of the experience because there
are trade-offs here that you need to
make sure you're following the media
providers expectations and so with
background fetch you actually remain in
control so you can provide these offline
experiences to users while still
maintaining the control that you need
and this allows users to not only have
video content or audio content that
works completely offline but also allows
users to have quick playback on any
connection type and we're working on the
same concept in Chrome as well so we've
all have the offline dino came with the
with the great game that I know you all
play the physical version over there but
one of our main principles that we're
taking here is we want to make sure
users never hit a dead end so if users
do get to a page where serviceworker
hasn't stepped in to help and they are
hitting an offline Dino page we want to
help them bridge that gap as well and so
we offer an option for users to to
to download the page when they're online
so that when they reconnect will
automatically download that page for
them and let them know so they can get
back to it and continue their browsing
experience and so that they can access
it even when they're offline and so this
is just one way that we're really trying
to make sure that users are not hitting
a dead end and of course as developers
we'd love for you to address this as
well with serviceworker because this is
just our one one-size-fits-all solution
and beyond just the options here we also
want to make sure that when users are
online and engaging its content it's the
best possible experience for them and so
for the multilingual users and users
that speak many languages around the
world
we want to make sure that we're tuning
our experience accordingly so
reiterating here a first step to a
problem is knowing what the issue is and
you have ways to actually know which
language or language is your user speaks
so we have the accept language header
which will allow you to see what
information the browser knows about your
users language preferences and this
doesn't necessarily have to be one
language so for example right here we
see that the user who prefers Danish
otherwise they'd be comfortable with
British English and otherwise they can
use English and so this can just give
you a way to understand what your user
actually wants and adapt your experience
but sometimes you don't necessarily have
information from a the accept language
header and there's other ways that you
can try to figure out what language
preferences your users might have for
example with search console you can see
where your users are coming from so if
we look into the countries here you can
tap into this and then you can easily
see the list of countries where your
users are accessing your experience so
in this fake example here we see that
users are coming from China Indonesia
and Malaysia and you can use this
information to understand to what extent
is multilingual support critical for
your experience and to what extent is
supporting your experience in different
language is important and of course
countries is is great and can give you a
sense of various language diversity of
your user base it's not the end-all
solution
some countries have an incredible amount
of language diversity and just knowing
the country level details isn't
sufficient to know which languages to
prioritize but it's a great starting
point to understanding where to dig in
more and what you should really be
prioritizing for your user base are your
potential new user base and if you do
see that your users are coming online
and using your experience from all
around the world and you do want to
adapt to support different languages we
a number of lower-level api's that can
help you do so and so these can help you
handle different languages figure out
the right ways to pluralize in different
languages appropriately match different
scripts and customize accordingly so you
have the tools in place to also adapt
your experience so the main thing here
is by looking at both the storage
constraints and leveraging progressive
web apps to make sure that users can get
to your experience you can build
experiences that anyone can access and
if you take into account the data costs
and specifically tune it to users who
have expressed particular concerns about
data you can make sure that they're they
feel comfortable freely using your
experience over and over again and if
you look at memory you make sure that
the experience stays high-quality across
the board even when the user is facing
memory pressure and that it's adaptable
to all connectivity types whether it's
slow connectivity intermittent
connectivity or days that they may spend
offline and finally you can also make
sure that it feels personalized and
really built for them by making sure you
support the languages that they prefer
and build experiences that work across
all these languages and then you keep
these things in mind you can build some
really amazing experiences and I just
want to highlight a few here from around
the world so one here is book my show
which is India's largest ticketing firm
they build a progressive web app that's
really smooth and feels immersive like
their native app but it's 54 times
smaller than their Android app and when
they launched this they actually saw an
80% increase in conversion with their
progressive web app and so they were not
only able to deliver an experience that
had much more reach but they were able
to convert the flows that they needed
the most even better to give another
example we also have Garbarino which is
an online retailer in argentina that
sells everything from home appliances to
consumer electronics and pretty much
everything in between and what they've
done here is they've actually used
serviceworker to cache things to make
sure that they load really really
quickly across all connection types so
not just looking at that offline support
but how serviceworker can be used to
speed things up as well and then there's
also companies like compass so compass
is the largest news site in Indonesia
and what they did is they were able to
build a really immersive progressive web
app experience that not only works fully
offline but also sends users
notifications when there's most critical
information and by building these sort
of engagement aspects that takes into
consideration people's connectivity
state
connectivity variations they actually
saw 1.6 X increase in engagement as a
result of this launch and these are just
some examples we're seeing this around
the world and what we really see here is
that everyone uses the internet
differently and we know that things are
changing really quickly but with the web
we're actually uniquely equipped to help
because you're able to reach all of
these users that are coming online for
the first time and adapt your experience
as they're coming online and interacting
with it and with the reality is if you
take all of these aspects into
consideration we really do have a world
wide web that works for everyone
