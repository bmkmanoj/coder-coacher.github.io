promise based code as if it were
synchronous but without blocking the
main thread pointer events provide a
unified way of handling all input events
sites added to the home screen are
granted automatic persistent storage
permission and there's plenty more I'm
Pete LePage here's what's new for
developers and chrome 55 pointing at
things on the web used to be simple you
had a mouse you moved it around and
sometimes people's buttons and that was
it
but this doesn't work so well touch
events are good but to support touch and
mouse you had to support to event models
chrome now enables unified input
handling by dispatching pointer events
pointer event unified the pointer input
model for the browser bringing touch
pens mice together into a single set of
events they're supported in ie11 edge
Chrome Opera and partially supported in
Firefox
check out the updates post link below
for more details
asynchronous JavaScript can be difficult
to reason with take this function with
all its lovely callbacks rewriting it
with promises helps to avoid the nesting
problem but promise based code can still
be difficult to read when there are long
chains of asynchronous dependencies
chrome now supports the async and await
keywords allowing you to write promise
based JavaScript that can be as
structured and as readable as
synchronous code instead of this our
asynchronous function can be simplified
to this Jake has a great post on
developers.google.com slash web slots
updates with all the details the
persistent storage origin trial is now
over you can now mark web storage as
persistent preventing chrome from
automatically clearing the storage of
your site
in addition sites that have high
engagement have been added to the
homescreen or have push notifications
labeled are automatically granted the
persistence permission check out Chris
Wilson's post for full details on how
you can request the persistent storage
for your site CSS automatic hyphenation
is one of Crump's most requested layout
features and is now supported on Android
and Mac and finally it's easier to
invoke native sharing capabilities with
the new web share API which is available
as an origin trial Paul Webb intent
Kinlan has all the details linked in the
description below these are just a few
of the changes in chrome 55 for
developers check the description for
more details if you want to stay up to
date with chrome and know it's coming

to check out the videos from the chrome
dev summit for a deeper dive into some
of the awesome things the chrome team is
working on I'm Pete LePage and as soon
as chrome 56 is released I'll be right
here to tell you what's new in Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
