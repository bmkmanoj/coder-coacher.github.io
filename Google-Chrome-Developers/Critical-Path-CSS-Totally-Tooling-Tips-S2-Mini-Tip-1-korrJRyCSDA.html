totally tooling mini tips with me Matt
go on add addy osmani hello and in this
show we're gonna be looking at critical
rendering path specifically CSS yes so
critical path CSS and optimizing it is
all about making sure about the stuff
that you're shooting down to users makes
sense for the current view and that
you're minimizing the number of blocking
resources that might slow that stuff
down so so the way that you'd normally
do this for your website to find out how
you're doing is you go into dev tools
ivenn up your network panel select maybe
like a network like a 3G or something
make sure you've got this camcorder
clicked click on record and then refresh
the page well this does this starts
taking a set of screenshots of your
website over time so once it's all done
you get a whole slew of all these things
and when you double click on one of the
images you get to see what the first
version or the first render of your page
looks like so here after 283
milliseconds I actually have something
to the screen and it's got the important
content there click through some of the
frames so we've got a bar here that's
basically saying that my asynchronous
CSS has been loaded the additional staff
got fonts loaded in now and then we get
the images and it slowly comes in and
one of the things I wanted to do with
this was basically find a way of well
what happens if I removed all of the
additional blocking CSS one of the
asynchronous CSS the stuff that I didn't
actually care about and poulos turned in
some code that I originally wrote into a
really nice bookmarklet and when you run
it you'll find any remote style sheets
and just disable them so they no longer
apply to the page so here this is what
my web page looks like without that CSS
so if they only got the HTML with the
inline Styles this is what it looks like
just the important bits bother if you
happen to have a build process using NPM
scripts or gob or grant or whatever have
you
I wrote a module called critical that
uses some other stuff like penthouse and
the idea is that basically you just
throw the pages that you need to
generate critical path CSS at this thing
it'll generate a for you inline the CSS
and it takes care of a lot of the
different repetitive steps you usually
have to do to get this stuff set up
so check out grid cool
yeah and it's also worth mentioning
though you wanted to learn more about
this kind of stuff ilya grigorik has
written a super awesome set of
documentation all about the critical
rendering path yeah Ilya also has a
Udacity course that he's done about
critical rendering that's pretty awesome
it's worth checking out yeah which you
can find under these shows on web
fundamentals but we'll link to that in
the video suite thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
