API more useful by providing actual
performance metrics instead of
theoretical results support for OpenType
variable fonts has landed you can
capture media streams from HTML media
elements and I've got a special reminder
about an important change
that's landing in chrome 62 at the end
of this video so be sure to stick around
I'm Pete LePage let's dive in and see
what's new for developers and chrome 62
the network information API has been
available in chrome for a while but it
only provides theoretical network speeds
given the users connection imagine
you're on Wi-Fi but connected to a
cellular hotspot that only has two G
speeds the API would report Wi-Fi in
chrome 62 the API has been expanded to
provide actual and network performance
metrics from the client using these
network quality signals you can tailor
content to the network for example on
very slow connections you could improve
page load performance by serving a
reduced version to simplify your
application logic the API returns the
measured network performance in terms of
how it will compare with cellular
connection for example connected to a
super-fast fiber connection the API
would report 4G these signals will also
be available as HTTP request headers and
enabled via client hints check out the
sample link below and have a look at the
spec to dive deeper traditionally one
font contained only a single instance of
a font family for example one way or one
stretch if you wanted regular bold and
italic you'd need to include three
separate fonts increasing the weight of
your page an OpenType variable fund is
the equivalent of multiple individual
font that can be compactly packaged
within a single font file by adjusting
certain CSS properties stretch style
weight and more can easily be adjusted
providing an infinite number of
stylistic variations those three fonts
can now be combined into a single
compact file open type variable fonts
gives us a powerful new tool to create
responsive typography and reduce our
page weight
you can now live caps or content into a
media stream directly from an HTML media
element like audio and video with the
media capture from Dom elements API
after invoking cats or stream on an HTML
media element the streamed content can
then be manipulated processed
sent remotely or recorded imagine using
web audio to create your own equalizer
or vocoder or stream the content to a
remote site using WebRTC the
possibilities are almost endless these
are just a few of the changes in Chrome
62 for developers of course there's
plenty more the payment request API is
now available on Chrome for iOS you can
start building experimental rich VR
experiences with the web be our origin
trial oh and one more as we announced
previously starting in chrome 62 when a
user enters data on an HTTP page Pro
will mark the page is not secured with a
label in the address bar this label will
also be shown in all incognito windows
for all HTTP pages check the description
for full details all the details
including links docs and specs are in
the description below and be sure to
check out the latest new in chrome dev
tools video for all the new stuff in
chrome dev tools then click the
subscribe button and you'll get an email
notification whenever we launch a new
video I'm Pete LePage and as soon as
chrome 63 is released I'll be right here
to tell you what's new in Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
