and I'm a product manager on the chrome
team and I'm here to talk to you about
how you can use the web to build
experiences that work for billions of
people we know that the way we access
the Internet has changed a lot of us
probably use the internet for the first
time on a desktop machine they were big
machines over time maybe these machines
got smaller could fit on your lap maybe
in a backpack but today a lot of us
regularly access the internet with a
smartphone something that's in our
pocket and goes around with us
everywhere we go and we see this trend
happening everywhere on Chrome we
recently announced that we actually
crossed the 1 billion mark on Chrome
mobile specifically and so we're seeing
that more and more people are accessing
the Internet on different form factors
than what they had button before and
what this means when you're actually
trying to build for billions of people
is that if you want to reach all the
users you need to think about where the
users are and where they're actually
accessing the Internet and the
experience that you're building and part
of doing this means you actually need to
understand who your users are and under
what conditions they're going to be
accessing your experience now for many
of us when we're building our product or
trying to address a specific user need
that were a building for we have a
mental image of who our user is and
sometimes this can be in part based on
research but also inevitably based on
your own personal experience and what
you're used to and what you've
experienced and for a lot of us this can
result in a world that looks something
like this and now for a few of us we
might be thinking slightly outside of
the US and you can throw Europe in the
mix there too but this is not actually
what the world looks like especially
when you think of Internet users so
today we have there are roughly 3.3
billion Internet users and that's more
than 10 times the population of the
United States so if your mental image
looked like that picture of the globe
that's really just a small piece of the
pie and when you're talking about
billions of users and really trying to
reach all of those users and what so
it's really critical here is when you're
thinking of new users for your
experience and for your product you
really need to think globally and think
about the users all around
world and when we look at where the
Internet users are today this is just a
chart of looking at Internet users in
2016 this maps countries and the darker
the country the more Internet users
today and you'll see that well the
United States is pretty prevalent here
there's about 286 million Internet users
in the United States you'll see that
there's a number of other countries that
start to be very dominant here as well
India has almost two times this many
users online today with around 462
million Internet users and China
actually has almost as much as both the
u.s. and India combined with 721 million
Internet users today but beyond just a
snapshot of where Internet users are
accessing the internet from today what's
interesting to see is how this has
changed so looking over the last year
this is a similar chart but this is
looking at just the pure number of users
who came online the last year by country
and what you'll see here is that there's
clearly one country that's quite
dominant in this in this particular map
and we see that in India we had 108
million Internet users come online in a
single year and for India this was a
growth of 30 percent year over year in
their internet population and that
number that a 108 million that's ten
times the growth that we signed China
and over a hundred times the growth we
saw in any other country over the past
year and so this is an immense number of
people but just put this in a little bit
of contact so 108 million people that's
roughly one third of the United States
population that came online in India
alone over a single year so that's a
huge number and so when you're really
thinking about who your internet users
are and who are the sort of pool of
possible users for your experience you
need to think about a lot of these areas
but beyond just where we're seeing the
growth right now you can also sort of
project this out to see where we expect
growth to continue to come from as
you're thinking through your roadmap and
the experiences you're going to be
building and so taking a look at the
users who are not yet online by country
you'll see that here we see more of a
representation of different countries
but we see that over 65 percent of
India's population is not yet online and
that's 864 million people not yet online
and there's a number of other countries
that still
have quite a large number of people who
are coming online but you'll see that
some of these other areas like the
United States for example it's just a
much smaller pool of potential new
Internet users and so the growth that
we're expecting to see for Internet
users and people who are have the
potential to access your experience is
shifting away to some of these countries
that we might have more direct
experience with so great hopefully I've
shown that there's enough growth in a
lot of these areas that we need to think
outside maybe the countries that we have
direct experience with and so the
question comes up of how do I actually
reach these users and as mentioned
before one of the really critical things
when you're building for any user is to
understand who your user is what are the
challenges they face what are the
conditions they face and make sure that
you're taking that into consideration
when you build your experiences so with
a quick show of hands how many of you
guys remember the first time that you
access the Internet okay it looks like
majority of folks in the room remember
that so keep your hand up if that was on
a smartphone okay no hands so most of us
access the Internet I assume on a
desktop or laptop machine for the very
first time and last year I spent a lot
of time talking to users in different
areas I spent a good amount of time in
India and was we were talking to users
about their internet use about how they
use Chrome how they're used mobile how
they use the internet overall and I was
sitting in the living room with a woman
who's sort of in her mid-40s and asked
her the same question if she remembered
the first time she used the Internet and
how she accessed it and her answer was
yes she used the internet earlier that
year for the very first time because she
had borrowed her husband's cell phone
and had tried the Internet out and then
a few months later she got her own phone
and was now accessing the internet on a
regular basis and this is just one
example of how people are accessing the
Internet and it's just fundamentally
different than what we have personally
experienced and so what it really means
we've probably heard the trope
mobile-first a number of times and for a
lot of us that means when we're
designing and building experiences don't
just think about porting what you've
built for desktop over to mobile but
actually think about the design mobile
first but in a lot of these areas it's
not really just mobile first but it's
actually mobile only it's not that
people will be accessing your experience
on mobile and you want to make sure it's
good
might be the only time they see your
experience their only interaction with
it maybe they've never used a desktop
before and there's also a chance that
they never will use a desktop or a
laptop so you can't assume that they're
going to be using these other platforms
to access your experience and so you
really need to make sure that you're
designing an experience that works for a
user who is only going to be interacting
with it from their smartphone and if
people are interacting with your
experience on their phone it's probably
important to consider what their phone
actually looks like so a lot of us
probably have a phone or several in our
pocket or bags and this is the Nexus 6p
so in terms of looking at the Nexus 6p
this was released last year in 2015 it's
a pretty good sized phone it's sort of
5.7 inches measured diagonally it has
three gigabytes of RAM and 32 to 128
gigabytes of storage depending on how
much you feel you need and what you
purchase now just to give a comparison
point when we were in India we went to
store owners as well and just talked to
them and asked what devices do you
recommend what devices are people asking
for and this is just one example of a
device that folks brought up so this is
a Samsung j1 this was also released in
2015
it's 4.3 inches if you measure it
diagonally but it has 512 megabytes of
RAM and 4 gigabytes of storage so what
this means is to looking beyond just the
size of the physical device the actual
specs of these devices can look quite
different we see that the Samsung j1 has
about one sixth for the RAM and even if
we make the closest comparison possible
1/8 the storage capacity and this can
make a really really big difference when
you're thinking about how you can reach
your users but the difference of context
goes beyond just the physical form
factor and the specs of the phone and
also has some implications just by
virtue of the fact that they're using a
smart phone now Vicky as a quick
question here so how many of you guys
connect to Wi-Fi
you'd say on a daily basis just cut
another quick show of hands ok it looks
like most folks in the room so you Wi-Fi
regularly if your primary way of
interacting with the Internet is a smart
phone and you maybe never interact with
the laptop this isn't necessarily true
first of all you don't need to have
Wi-Fi to be able to connect to the
internet and your phones also in your
pocket so it goes where you go which
means that if you go somewhere that has
bad
connectivity that's your internet access
for the day or for the hours that you're
using your you're in that area and we
see a growing number of people relying
only on cellular data around the world
this is a stat that recently came up
which is actually even in the United
States about 20% of households rely only
on cellular data to connect to the
Internet and what's really interesting
is that this is actually doubled since
2013 so we see this on the rise even in
areas like the United States and it's
more pronounced in some of these areas
where we see users coming online for the
very first time and the fact that people
are relying on cellular data means that
it's really important to consider what
the quality of their connection actually
looks like we see that globally about
60% of mobile connections are 2g
connections and this is excluding 2g
liked speeds but just explicitly 2g
connections and we see this more
pronounced in a number of these areas
where we're expecting to see the user
growth of new Internet users with over
two-thirds of users in those areas
relying primarily on 2g connections but
what's really interesting is if you
actually project some of these trends
over time we do expect this to slightly
go down but even by 2020 we expect 1/5
of the mobile connections globally to
still be 2g connections and this has a
really big impact on the user experience
when you're building things we've seen a
whitcross some numbers of studies and
sort of over time that a delay and as
the speed of your experience is critical
to how many users engage with your
experience and how happy they are with
your experience this is just one example
of a study that found that a single
second delay in page times led to 11%
fewer pageviews but also a 16% decrease
in customer satisfaction so suppose has
a quantitative and a very qualitative
impact on the user experience and your
reach and so it's really important as we
think realizing that a lot of people are
accessing experiences on slower
connections that we make sure that the
user experience is still as fast as it
possibly can be because we know that if
your experience is slow that directly
leads to lost customers and we don't
want that to occur and we really want to
make sure that we're planning for this
and building for this
but just beyond just the delay that
relying on cellular connections that may
be 2g or 2g like speeds can incur it's
also important to realize that relying
on cellular data also has a cost
involved looking at the minimum wage in
India with a few simplifications because
minimum wage in India is actually quite
complex it depends on your country and
your job title etc we see that on
average 17 hours of minimum wage work is
needed to pay for a 500 megabyte data
plan and that's if you spend your entire
earnings from 17 hours of minimum wage
work just to buy data and so that's an
incredible amount but just to put this
in context of the web if we look at the
average size of a web page and again
make a little bit a couple of
simplifying assumptions will see that
this means that on average an hour of
minimum wage work will load you 15 web
pages that's it that's if you spend your
entire income from that one hour of
minimum wage work just on the data to
afford loading web pages so take a
moment to think about maybe how many web
pages you've loaded this morning and you
know it's about maybe 10 15 this morning
and think of how many hours of minimum
wage work you would have had to incur
just to be able to afford your browsing
habits
this is incredibly challenging for
people who aren't make regularly making
trade-offs for whether they can spend
the data on something or spend it on
something else that they might need and
so these connection quality and costs
can also directly lead to differences
and how users are going to be
interacting with their network
connection so connectivity frequency
also comes up here
because data is so expensive and because
connectivity can really vary we not only
see that sometimes users just have no
data plant they've either run out or
they don't purchase a new one until they
feel that they need it or can afford it
we also see that when people do have
data plans they're turning it on and off
quite frequently some users that we talk
to in some of these areas mention that
on an average day they think they turn
airplane mode on and off about 12 to 15
times so that when they're not using
their phone their connection isn't there
so that I there they know that they're
not using data that they don't need
because the data costs are so high and
so all of these together
can can make it seem a little bit
daunting right I've just walked through
how people are relying mostly on
smartphones smartphone 12 files look
different than maybe what we're used to
connectivity can be limited it can be 2g
speeds and it can cost a whole lot so
you might be sitting there you're like
great so how do I actually develop for
these users this is a sounds challenging
and there are a number of challenges
right one of one of the big things here
is that installs are hard
if data costs money and takes a lot of
time convincing a user to install your
experience can be really challenging
because they haven't necessarily
interacted with it
you're putting it forward and you're
asking them to not only spend the cut
money that it might take to download the
megabytes that you're size that your
experience or app might be but you're
also asking them to take the time on 2g
speeds apps can take a fairly long time
to actually download but assuming you
can convince a user that they need to
install your app even without having
tried it you also have this lovely
challenge of the apk size if you're
looking at a device with 4 gigabytes of
storage that's just a different
condition under what your user has to
make the decision if they want your app
or not and so you're having a very small
apk size becomes really critical because
you don't want them to have to delete
photos or videos or other apps they
might have just to get your experience
on their phone and beyond that even if
you do get it on your phone
you're probably continuing to improve
your experience and make it better and
better over time and you want your users
to have the latest and greatest product
that you've built so you need to make
sure your users are up-to-date and this
too can be challenging because again
again again I have to have the
connection and the data plan and be able
to incur that cost and be willing to
incur that cost to actually update your
experience and these constraints can be
a little bit daunting when you're just
trying to reach out to your users but
luckily there's actually an app for that
and this may have been spoiled by the
title of my talk but it's the mobile web
so inherent to the mobile web we
actually remove a lot of these
constraints the mobile web is accessible
without an install if you're building a
web experience when users navigate to it
they see the experience immediately and
they can use it right out of the gate
you don't need to convince them to
install it just to try it they try it
just by virtue of having gone there
what's more is that means that storage
constraints are not an issue for that
initial interaction with your experience
they don't need to worry about deleting
videos or photos or apps that they might
really care about just to see if they
want to interact with your experience
and you don't have to worry about
keeping users up to date when they
navigate to your website they are
up-to-date because as you make
improvements the users are always
getting the latest and beyond this we've
seen that removing these barriers has a
real impact on the reach that
experiences can have some stats that we
pulled last year saw that on average
mobile users use about 25 apps a month
but in comparison we've seen that on
chrome on Android users are actually
navigating past over a hundred websites
per month and so we see that the in
short users have about four times the
number of sites that they're looking at
over each month compared to native apps
and this also has a pretty direct impact
on how many users are interacting with a
given experience so an analysis of this
top 1,000 mobile apps risk the top 1,000
mobile web properties found that on
average we see two and a half times more
monthly unique visitors on the mobile
web compared to the top native app
experiences and so what this really
means is that removing those barriers
directly relates to the reach and the
possibility of user base that you can
have with just that initial experience
but beyond that we're also seeing that
these trends are growing over time and
so we see that over time there's been
two times the growth in mobile web
traffic compared to native app traffic
for these same top thousand mobile web
apps and native apps and so removing
these barriers is very critical to
actually reaching users but beyond just
this we also have been working hard on
the chrome teaming with other browsers
to make sure that web has the
capabilities that you and as a developer
need to build good experiences so some
of you may have already heard the term
progressive web apps this the idea here
is that you can build experiences that
have a lot of the features that some of
us often associate with native but with
leveraging the benefits that the web has
to offer so just to walk through a
little bit about what a progressive web
app is and what it really has to offer
so by virtue of being a web app a
progressive web app is discoverable by
all it's a website users
can navigate to it users can find it and
they're immediately in the experience
there's no friction or install barrier
to try out your experience in the first
time but beyond that with a lot of the
capabilities of a progressive web app
you can start creating very fast and
smooth experiences that we often
associate with native it can be
fullscreen they can take over and you
can really interact with this experience
like you would a native app but beyond
that we know that a lot of users are
going to be accessing your experience on
2g or 2g like speeds and so you can also
leverage any web technologies to make
sure that everything loads quickly as
possible regardless of the network type
so you don't incur that one second delay
and the consequences of that regardless
of the connectivity type of the user but
what's more is we do know users are
sometimes offline and with progressive
Web Apps you can actually make sure that
your web experience works whether the
users online or offline and what's more
is we do know that installs do have a
benefit it makes it you easier for users
who have gone through that hurdle to get
back to your experience and the idea
with progressive web apps is that it's
really easy to get to your experience in
the first place but it's also really
easy for users who are engaged and do
want to get back to it easily to install
it and haven't add it to their home
screen so that they can get back to it
and beyond that for those users who are
more engaged we know that there are some
times that it's really critical for you
to re-engage with those users because
your experience can offer something
exceptionally beneficial to them in a
particular time and so we've also built
capabilities to make it really easy for
you to re-engage with the web and so
just to give an example here this is a
Flipkart which is a top ecommerce site
in India and what you'll see here is
that they have actually built out a
progressive web app experience and so
this is something that you can launch
from your home screen or search for
directly it works online and offline
you'll see that it's sort of an
immersive experience and it can scroll
through it and it feels a lot like a
native app but what's really interesting
here is that they've also looked at some
stats of how this performed compared to
their previous website and found that
this had a pretty big impact in the user
experience so first they see that their
progressive web app on average people
are spending three times the amount of
time on this site compared to their
previous mobile web experience they've
also seen 40 percent higher
re-engagement with their progressive web
app compared to their web experience
before what's really interesting here is
for an e-commerce site conversion is
really the critical metric here and
they've
their progressive web app saw a 70%
increase in conversion compared to their
previous mobile website and I just want
to walk through sort of some of the
principles that you can keep in mind as
you're working to develop progressive
web apps that can really leverage the
mobile web technologies in a way that
can work for billions of users so as
we've talked about there's a few things
that really are important here one is
cost
we know that cost can be really
prohibitive if you're making a trade-off
between do I want to access this website
or a different website or a native app
or spend my money on something else and
not use my data plan right now you
really make it have to make sure that
your app and your experience works as
well for users as possible and that
they're not having to make these
trade-offs unnecessarily we also know
that connectivity varies if a lot if the
majority of users globally are still
accessing the Internet on 2g connections
we need to make sure that our
experiences load as quickly as possible
on all connection types and finally we
also want to reduce complexity how can
we make steps as easy as possible and
not only leverage the benefits of the
web but leverage the benefits of
reengagement and making sure users can
get back to it as easily as possible
so just to walk through these so cost we
know this isn't can be incredibly
prohibitive and we really want to make
sure that we are taking this into
considerations and not forcing the user
to make unnecessary trade-offs so on the
chrome team we've been working to
address this issue across the board and
what we've built is a feature called
data saver and this is a setting that a
user can go in and turn on and this will
apply to all HTTP content as they use
Chrome and this is a proxy for HTTP
content that has no fidelity changes but
helps the user save up to 60% of their
data and we found that this helps a lot
of users and we've seen this even more
so in a lot of the areas where users are
coming online for the first time and we
know that data costs are even more
prohibitive than in other areas but
what's more is we actually took a moment
to think about this more and we really
want to make sure that we're pushing the
boundaries on this and helping users
save as much data as possible and that
they stay in control of where their data
use is going so we actually launched an
improvement for this so that for data
saver users for HTTP content when
they're on a very slow connection we
actually automatically replace most
images on the page with placeholders so
the
the user can then choose which images
they need or want to load or they can
choose to load all the images if they
need to we do try to do this in a way
that keeps the page usable so that
smaller images etc such as next pages or
hamburger menus or whatever that might
be are still visible so the user can
continue to interact with the page and
this has helped us get it to up to 70%
of data savings for users but we know
that as a developer you often want to be
in control and make sure that the
optimizations you're doing work for the
experience that you've built and so
we've also been working to introduce
client hints that help you stay in
control to make sure that you're not
only taking this into consideration but
doing so in a way that works for the
products that you're building and so in
m50 46 release of chrome we launched a
number of different client hints
including dpr widths and viewport width
and these are things that you can all
address on the server using data
provided by the user agent so what this
means is that you as a developer can
understand the context under which the
user is accessing your experience and
make sure you're only sending the images
sizes that users need and making sure
you're optimizing the experience and not
using up their data if you don't need to
but we've also added recently a save
data hint and in chrome this maps
directly to whether a user has that data
saver feature on or off which means that
you as a developer know which users are
the most sensitive to data and you can
take extra steps to make sure that your
the experience you've built works for
them as well and so what this means is
depending on your experience you can
optimize what needs to happen you could
choose not to load images that you think
are less critical and you can choose
which images you feel that those are and
make sure that the user stays in control
you could avoid Auto playing videos or
you could make sure that whatever sort
of background fetching or things that
you might want to be doing are only
happening if the user really needs it
but beyond that we know that this gives
you control but we also know that
thinking about all these things can be
challenging so we actually have a module
called PageSpeed module which is a
server-side component that you can drop
into your web server that will do a lot
of these optimizations for you on both
HTTP and HTTPS traffic and what this
means is that we actually have the
single line of code that's optimized for
bandwidth mode that went on will do all
of these transformations with really no
fidelity change and without breaking
anything
which means you can get the data
benefits for your users without having
to worry about any negative impacts on
the user experience so we've also gone a
step further for this and made sure that
if the user does have that data see the
saver feature turned on the PageSpeed
module will automatically take a few
extra steps to save those users even
more data so just to give a quick
example of this this is a screenshot of
a small sort of mock storefront that we
created on the left here you'll see a
screenshot of what the page looks like
with no PageSpeed module on the right
here you'll see a screenshot of what it
looks like with page speed module turned
on and optimized for bandwidth for a
user who has data saver on you might
have noticed these two screenshots look
quite similar actually if you can point
out any differences let me know but they
promise they're different screenshots so
you might be asking sort of what is
actually the difference between these
two so if we actually dig into this and
look at some of the numbers on the left
here this page is relatively light
looking at average size of a web page
it's 350 kilobytes but if we simulate a
2g network and try to load it it can
take of it a little bit over a minute to
actually load this page on a 2g
connection now by just putting that
turning on the optimize for bandwidth
mode we already get a number of
improvements here and we can actually
cut the data by about 50% and lead to
165 kilobyte page load but if a user's
data sensitive and actually has need to
saver turned on we can get even more
benefits so for a data saver user with
the optimize for bandwidth mode in
PageSpeed we actually see that this page
goes down to 120 kilobytes and so that's
about savings about 65% and what's more
if we stimulate it again on 2g you'll
see that this actually goes to an under
30 second page load time and this has
happened with really no difference to
the user experience the fidelity is
completely the same between these two
and this is just one example across
sites we've seen an average about of
about 37% data saving reductions without
any sort of fidelity change for the user
and that's for users who don't have data
saving on when we turn data saver on
we're actually seeing even more
improvements but beyond just taking
steps to make sure that you're taking
into consideration the cost and the data
cost of your experience there's also a
number of things that you can do to make
sure that your experience is as fast as
possible on all network types
so looking for a moment at the different
connectivity profiles we see that the
round-trip time or the time that it
takes between making a request and
getting a response varies quite widely
between these different network types so
on Wi-Fi we can see sort of on average
of 50 millisecond round-trip time but
compare that to 2g which is about 50
times slower and you start getting to
2500 millisecond round-trip times and
this can really impact the user
experience and also how you want to
actually implement and address some of
these problems so one thing that you can
do is first know what connection a user
is on so downlink max which started in
chrome m48 can tell you the maximum
megabits per second of a users
connection and while you can query this
to just find out what the connection
type of user is in you can also
subscribe to updates so that you know
when a user is switching between
different connection types and you can
make sure that if they're moving to a
slower connection you're keeping your
experience as fast as possible so that
you're again not incurring that
one-second delay that can lead to a
really detrimental impact on the user
experience but what can you actually do
about it when you do identify these
slower connections so some of you may
already have heard of serviceworker so
serviceworker is a client-side proxy
that's written in JavaScript and you can
think about it as sort of this
background process that sits between the
server and the OS and when the page is
loaded you can register your
serviceworker and then once it's
registered you can actually start using
it to to cache content and start
supporting as more offline situations
but you can also use serviceworker to
actually improve the performance of your
page and so a lot of us has probably
been in those situations where your
phone thinks it's connected right it
shows you that you're connected whether
it's Wi-Fi or cellular data but you're
trying to load something and just
nothing happens you're sort of in this
life I situation where it's telling you
you're connected but nothing is coming
through and this is incredibly painful
and this has even more so the case in
areas where connectivity itself is just
very intermittent but with serviceworker
what you can do is you can actually
implement request timeouts to address
these slinky connections so that you can
make sure that your caching the content
that's critical and still serving it to
the user regardless of their connection
types and so this can really help bridge
the gap between those sort of fully
connected in flaky situations
but we also know that sometimes there's
just no connection this might be because
the user has turned on airplane mode
might be because they're out of data
might be because you're in a tunnel or
whatever situation that might be and
there's just no connection and you've
built a great experience but you
probably don't want this to be the first
thing the user sees when they tap into
it now iLife love the offline dyno game
as much as the next person and I know
there's stickers outside with the
offline dyno but perhaps not the ideal
way to actually get a user to interact
with your experience and see what you
have to offer and so with serviceworker
you can actually take this a step
further and make sure that even when the
user is offline they're getting the best
possible experience so to give an
example of this this is conga conga is a
top ecommerce site in Africa and they've
gone beyond just enabling accessing of
their experience when they're offline to
actually optimize their experience for
the flows that they need whether users
online or offline so this here is a flow
of someone doing a purchase so they've
added some items to their cart and then
we're gonna go ahead and simulate what
it looks like when the users offline and
so what they've done here is when the
user is actually offline they not only
let the user know that they're offline
with a little thing at the bottom but
when the user goes to do the checkout
flow they actually have a call to order
button instead of supporting their
online flow because the user can't
complete an online flow when they're
offline and this allows you to really
close the gap and make sure that your
user experience for the flows that are
most critical to you work regardless of
whether the users online or offline and
so for his ecommerce experience the user
can finish their purchase even if
they've lost connectivity completely and
then what we've also seen is that this
not only helps with the user experience
and making sure that they can get to
your experience but it also ties back to
that cost that we talked about earlier
what conga team has seen is that their
steps to their first transaction have
been drastically impacted as a result of
using the serviceworker technology they
found that compared to their previous
mobile web site this new progressive web
app takes 84 percent less data just to
get that first transaction done but
they've also found is if you compare it
to their native app experience this
first flow that is most critical to them
takes 82 percent lace less data than
their native app and so this is huge
it's not only helped bridge the gap of
connectivity and made the critical flows
work whether you're online or offline
but it's also helped users
save that data but beyond just
addressing the costs and connectivity
issues we've also seen that this benefit
helps across the board for different
apps and so Flipkart for example also
saw three times data savings for their
experience with compared to their
previous mobile web experience and so
these sort of data saving benefits that
you can get by addressing the offline
connectivity issues can help across the
board to address other issues as well
but the other thing you really want to
consider here is that's great we can
make sure things load quickly we can
make sure that we're removing cost
barriers but we also want to make sure
that we're removing complexity and
making things as simple as possible and
when we're talking about costs we know
that every step is gonna be time and
money if you're on a 2g connection the
steps both in your experience and get to
you're getting to your experience can be
challenging and just take extra time and
ask the user to do more things that are
necessary and so one of the best ways to
actually address cost and connectivity
is just remove some of these steps so
with the mobile web we have an add to
homescreen functionality this is another
example with konga that has built us out
for users who have engaged more with
your experience you can actually suggest
that they just add your website to their
home screen and this doesn't have
storage constraints so there's none of
that apk size barriers we had before but
users can still get back to it with a
single tap which means that getting to
your experience is super easy they don't
have to navigate multiple times go
through different page loads and so
you've removed those steps that extra
time and money to let users get to what
they actually care about immediately but
beyond this and just getting to your
first screen we know that sometimes your
experience needs to get to a particular
part of your screen and you can actually
cut out page loads within your
experience as well so with notifications
you can actually send notifications to
your users using the mobile web so that
you can reach out to your users at the
most sensitive or necessary times
depending on your experience and link
them back to the specific part of your
experience that they care about so they
don't even have to worry about just
loading your experience and navigating
within it but you have removed those
steps as well and so this makes it
really easy for the users to re-engage
with your experience at the times that
are most critical to them
so we've talked a lot about sort of
different situations and the different
constraints that you need to consider
here but one of the things that can be
really hard circling back to the start
is we haven't lived under these
conditions necessarily right all of us
in this room first access the internet
on a non smartphone which is just
different so one of the things that's
really important is to make sure that
you're trying out these experiences
yourself and you're trying them out
under the conditions that are
representative of your user base or your
target user base and so we have a number
of tools to actually let you do this one
thing that we have is sort of a mini
mobile device lab and what this is is
you can actually look it up and download
it from github and it'll let you
simulate what your experience looks like
on these different devices and beyond
this though you can also simulate what
the conditions are for users so we
talked about how challenging costs can
be and how prohibitive it can be and
with chrome dev tools you can actually
calculate the page weight for a given
user so looking here for a moment you'll
see that this is the network tab of
chrome dev tools if you're familiar with
it but I want it what I want to call out
is this at the bottom here so this says
that this page took about seven a little
bit over seven hundred bytes to load now
that's that's pretty small but we can
actually call out a little bit of a
caveat here a lot of these loaded from
cache but you can actually refresh the
page if you want to simulate what it
looks like even when users are getting
to it fresh so you can get a sense of
what the experience looks like as users
are interacting with it as they're going
between different pages and you'll see
that if I go ahead and refresh this page
we also have updated the sizes so you'll
see that in compared to that you know
700 bytes
this page actually took you know 211
kilobytes to load and you can really get
a sense for what this means and what
this costs for your user when you're
talking about data plans but the other
thing I want to call your attention to
here is that you can also use this tool
to understand the time and the loading
experience that users are getting so
you'll see that sort of next to that
byte count we also tell you how long it
took for this page to load so this page
took about 600 milliseconds to load and
this was just using Wi-Fi that I was
connected to but you'll also see up here
that you can actually have no throttling
right now and you can change this so if
I tap into this you'll see that there's
a number of different options and if you
actually go ahead and simulate the same
page load on 2g you
see that suddenly it's a very different
amount of time that it took for this
page to load so we're more at 11 seconds
now and you can actually see what this
looks like and start tapping through
your experience and see how it changes
if you're using serviceworker and some
of these other technologies so that you
can make sure the experience that you
are giving your users is one that you're
happy about and excited about and really
puts your product in your experience and
the best possible light and the users
are able to access it without some of
these barriers so using all of these
tools and using these technologies you
can really use progressive web apps not
only to remove the barriers that the web
fundamentally offers but to address the
cost and the connectivity challenges and
you can also go a step further to use
some of these things to remove
complexity and actually remove the steps
all together so you're not doing
unnecessary page loads if the user
doesn't need it we also have a number of
other tools online and you can read up
more about them you can read more
broadly about how you can build for
billions across Android and mobile but
we also have some web specific tools
that you can look up here as well also
be over in the mobile web tent if anyone
has other questions but the main idea
here is that using all of these
different technologies you can make sure
that you're really thinking globally and
making sure that things not only work
for those twenty percent of US
households that are relying solely on
cellular data but also work for users
who are maybe coming online for the
first time and so using all of these
tools you can make an experience that is
built to work for everyone thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
