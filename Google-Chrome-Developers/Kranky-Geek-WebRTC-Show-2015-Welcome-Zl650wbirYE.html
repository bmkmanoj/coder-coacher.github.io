cranky geek Weber TC show for 2015 and
it's the second one that we're doing
here and for me that's like very
interesting because after the first one
we didn't know what we're going to do we
thought it was going to be a one-off and
now it's the second one and so the first
question I have anyone here was part of
the event that we did last year okay so
we have some second timers here anyone
here doesn't know what Webber TC here
and just came for the food okay we've
got them in there just for the food from
those who do are there people that are
actually using it daily okay so that's
going to be an easy crowd today so I'd
like to start by thanking our sponsors
especially Google and Willow for making
this happen and also atlassian hipchat
and IBM bluemix cranky geek is now three
people so there is geek which is me
there's cranky which is Chris somewhere
around T were hurting more than once
today and we've hadded the chat list
here we didn't give him a name yet
inside that name of ours but that's
that's how it goes we will have breaks
today the brakes are for certain things
one of them is for you to be able to
network so we've done that through
lunchtime we'll have more breaks during
the day will end up I guess somewhere
between five to six depending on how
many additional problems we will have
and how many questions you end up asking
so the speakers that we have today are
varied and well quite a lot especially
if you look at what we've done last year
which we had a lot then as well we've
got google microsoft and mozillas or all
the browser vendors are here we have the
spot the other sponsors twilio and if
chat and a tool atlassian in IBM and if
you are the speakers everything here is
going to be very interesting that time
assuring you and we're also going to
have a lot of topics that are going to
be covered today so we try to hear last
year those that have been there you
wanted more technical stuff so we wanted
to more
technical stuff we try to cover a lot
more details in a lot more areas so III
away a bit of the signaling part we have
that in we've got some media stuff in a
little bit of mobile dev ops and a lot
of other things now one thing to say is
that WebRTC is always I always either is
questions from people like well you know
is it ready yet can we start using it
and a few months ago I've started using
this slide to show people that yes it's
here you know it's not like startup
companies playing with GOP technology
you've got some big names out there that
have announced real product this year so
there's facebook facebook Messenger
today uses WebRTC see if you go to
messenger dot-com and into a video call
that's already sequel if you use the app
and mobile it uses WebRTC there is skype
doesn't use WebRTC yet but they're
already said microsoft said that there's
going to be skype for web and Microsoft
edge there are new browser already
supports getusermedia so things are
getting there in that front as well
comcast lunch service and that service
provides it's called Xfinity share and
it allows people to share videos the
same way to do is chromecast but through
a setup box the Xfinity set about the x1
and I think that they just added the
video chat service through that box AT&amp;amp;T
launched an api platform beta beginning
of the seer general availability i think
from august last month and then that
last you know this small minor icon logo
here anyone knows what company this one
is okay yes that cisco spark cisco
decided to take WebEx and the things
that they are doing in unified
communication and reboot I'd say reboot
everything and try to do it differently
and that Cisco sparked so Cisco is there
as well there are a lot of other
companies big and small it's just the
five that I decided to put on that slide
because a lot of things an announcement
came out at the same time frame of three
months so I found that interesting
now when we talk about WebRTC there are
two sides to a party see there's the web
part of web RTC and the voice over IP
part of WebRTC and it's some kind of a
clash between two worlds people that
come with web development and these
kinds of capabilities interest in
mindset and those that know what void
means I'm a VoIP guy I got the
curriculum for how you do VoIP there are
certain things that you do when you do
VoIP and are different things that you
do when you do web and WebRTC seat
somewhere in the middle so there are a
lot of conversations and fights about
how to use WebRTC and I'll not to use
WebRTC and for me is someone coming from
voice well you know WebRTC is super easy
that's what I think about Weber to see
if you are going to do something that
needs voice or video that's the simplest
way to do it today I know I've been
there I've developed myself stuff in c
and c++ and coded ugly things that need
work with web RTC with voice over IP ok
not easy now you go and look at weber to
see that's like you know crazy easy no
issues about it and then there are the
people that come into the room and these
are the web developers and they look at
all of these api's and permissions and a
synchronous stuff that needs to go on
and server sent in to be set up and they
say well that's too hard ok so we might
not be there yet but you need to
understand if you are a web developer
that web RTC is the easiest thing to get
video calling in voice calling in video
sessions and voice actions today nothing
beats that and yes you need to learn
more and be more professional at what
you are doing but gasps yeah what that's
what you need to do anyway because the
web is becoming more complex as well now
before I live and give the stage for our
real speakers for the day I want to show
this analysis that I've done recently
about stack overflow I used their API
stack exchange has an API and I checked
for the last four years for questions
that were tagged with the world where
WebRTC on them then counted the number
of questions and answers spend per month
and this is about what you get okay so
the numbers aren't really that high but
they are growing their steadily growing
there is no hyper ghor thing there or
exponential growth or whatever and if
you ask me that is this is what going to
happen until the end of the year at
least and maybe even into amp until the
end of 2016 so what we are going to sue
is continued slow growth about
everything that relates to a party see
okay so there is not going to be any
exponential take off of whatever but
bear in mind at the same time that when
someone small like Facebook decides to
put it on messenger you've got 900
million people using it the next day
okay so although not a lot of people
actually working on it it's probably the
best place to be because if you are a
developer and you know a party see
you're a talented people would want to
use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
