alley caches so today we're going to be
talking about aria
what it is and how you can use it to
make non-accessible control accessible
now so far I've sort of strongly
encouraged using native elements
whenever you can in your applications
because they give you focus and keyboard
support and built-in semantics
essentially for free so for instance
I've got this input here wrapped in a
label and that's going to produce a
visual UI like the one that you're
seeing here this radio button but that's
also going to create a spoken UI based
on the built in semantics of those
native HTML tags now if you're not quite
sure how all of that happened or why
those semantics matter be sure to check
out our previous episode on semantic so
I'll include a link down in the show
notes and we can also maybe drop in an
annotation up here for you to click on I
just I have some background on how
semantics work and why those are
important in the first place now this is
all good and everything but there are
instances where a simple layout in
native HTML just aren't going to cut it
and so to handle these situations we
have the web accessibility initiative
accessible rich internet applications
spec which is a bit of a mouthful so you
oftentimes see this referred to as
wai-aria or maybe just Aria so audio
works by allowing you to specify
attributes on elements which then modify
the way those elements are translated
into the accessibility tree so let's
take a look at a really basic example
just to show how this works so if you
create a a plain checkbox a screen
reader is going to announce it as you
know a checkbox it'll tell you what its
label if it has one like we do in this
case where it says receive promotional
offers and it'll also tell you the the
state of the checkbox right whether it's
checked or not but let's say you're in a
situation where for whatever reason you
need to implement your own check box
using something like like a div right
maybe you need to style it in a really
special way so in this case we've got a
div checkbox we've created here and the
screen reader is going to give the user
really like no indication that this
element is meant to be a checkbox it
might announce the the text inside of
the div there but it's not going to tell
you the role of the element I can say
it's a checkbox it's also not going to
tell you the state so excited you
sure is going to be able to see these
visual cues and they'll be able to
figure out that this is a checkbox but
nothing is going to be announced to our
screen reader users and that's a really
big problem
so using Aria we can actually tell the
screen reader about this extra
information here up at the top I've got
some custom checkboxes just created
using gives down at the bottom I've got
some checkboxes using the native input
element so using voiceover let's see how
these are announced differently
voiceover I'm chrome custom checkboxes
in custom check intense group with three
items there and then slices group with
two items heading ten times
check check box and then slices uncheck
checkbox voiceover off so you see there
that the the div elements just are
announced as groups it doesn't indicate
to the user in any way that these are
checkboxes where it's the native element
it indicates it's a checkbox and it
tells you the state whether it's checked
or not so let's see if we can add some
Aria to improve upon this so over in my
dev tools I will select these the
checkbox elements and I'm going to start
off by just giving them a role of
checkbox and I'm also going to give them
a state of Aria checked of either true
or false depending on you know the
actual state of the element there so if
a role checkboxes to the one Aria
checked equals false and let's try it
again using the screen reader voiceover
I'm dropping custom checkboxes 10 pens
check the checkbox and then slices
contract checkbox always go over all so
adding that role and Aria checked
attribute causes the middle Union
accessibility tree to actually have the
desired role and state without changing
you know anything else about the nodes
appearance or its behavior which is
pretty awesome right we're just adding
in additional semantics using Aria so in
terms of the accessibility tree what ru
does is it really allows you to subdue
like tree surgery so you take the
accessibility tree as generated by plain
HTML you add Aria to that and now you
get a different accessibility tree and
it may be subtly different or it could
be radically different depending on what
attributes you use however keep in mind
that this is really the only thing that
ru changes it doesn't change anything
about how the element behaves on the
page
for instance it's not going to suddenly
make your element focusable it's not
going to add keyboard event listeners
for you or anything like that or you
does not change behavior in any way it
really only is for adding in additional
semantics so if you you know if you're
making a custom control it's really on
you to make sure you go back and you
also add in that keyboard support so
you're kind of like maintaining that
that consistent experience for your
users so now that you understand more
about what ru is and kind of some of the
basics of how it works I want to cover
some of the things that Aria will let us
do in our application as we saw in that
check box example Aria can add semantics
to an element where no native semantics
already exists so for instance you take
a div element it has no built-in
semantics but we can use Aria to be able
to role we can use already to give it a
check State for instance build a custom
check box or radio button or something
like that or you can also be used to
modify existing element semantics so for
instance let's say I've got a button
element that I want to actually turn
into more like a toggle button so I can
on/off switch type of control I can give
it a roll of switch I'm give it an
already check state of true or false and
now I've sort of modified the semantics
of this control and now it's more of a
even more specific kind of thing it's
like a toggle button right to switch
button it's important to note here
though that the switch rule is part of
the newer aria 1.1 spec so as I'm
recording this you know there's probably
a number of assistive technologies which
do not support this role just yet just
like all web standards aria is you know
constantly evolving and advancing to try
and keep pace with new UI patterns so
that's something important to realise as
well right if you if you come across an
aria rule you also want to check for the
support of that role in assistive
technology to make sure it's widely
supported and then you can use it
another thing or you can do is it can
express semantics and UI patterns which
really like don't already exist in HTML
and I think this is where Aria kind of
comes into its own
Aria basically will let you create
accessible widgets which are not
possible using plain HTML to give you an
example here is like a tree widget
component okay we can take an unordered
list and add all your rules of
we tree item and group and add an
already expanded attribute to a few
those children and now we're expressing
the more rich semantics of this tree
element and again there's no tree tag in
native HTML so it's something that you
know we wouldn't be able to build
otherwise without aria which is really
important another thing we can do and as
we saw this in our previous episode on
labeling or you can add extra labeling
and descriptive text to an element right
- to give that element an accessible
name so for example if you have like an
image only button which doesn't use an
actual image element so you don't have
access to an alt attribute or anything
like that to put alternative text on it
you can still use Aria you can use Aria
label to give that element its own
accessible name and that way you can
have it be announced properly by a
screen reader to those users or you can
also express semantic relationships
between elements which go beyond just
like standard dom parent-child sibling
relationships so for example a more
complex relationship is something like
this element controls that element over
there even if they're not like you know
direct parent-child or anything so in
this case right here I've got a button
which controls whether a particular part
of the page is visible or hidden and it
does this in the form of kind of a
disclosure widget you can see here where
it shows advanced settings we've
specified using Aria controls that's
actually controlling this group of
elements down here for these Advanced
Settings checkboxes so even though
they're not parent-child they're
actually sort of like siblings we can
create this new relationship indicating
this element over here controls that
elements over there which is really cool
and finally Aria can make parts of the
page live so they can inform assistive
technology right away when something
changes and we saw this in our previous
episode on building alerts so we add
role equals alert to some element we
drop some new content into it and then
it's going to announce that immediately
through assistive technology to the user
so are you giving you a lot of tools to
make sure the experiences you build are
semantically rich and can be easily
understood by assistive technology now
we're definitely going to be diving into
the subject more in the future but that
about covers it for today so if you have
