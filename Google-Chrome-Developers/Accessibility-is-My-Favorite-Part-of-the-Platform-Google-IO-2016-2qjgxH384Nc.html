for coming out this morning I want to
wish you first of all a happy global
accessibility Awareness Day it just so
happens that May 19th is the official
global accessibility Awareness Day so
very cool of y'all to be here for that
so yeah if you're if you're tweeting
during the the talk or whatever like use
the GAA D hashtag that would be very
awesome also before I get into things I
do want to point out because I know this
is being recorded on YouTube and
sometimes folks don't always make it to
the end of a long video that everything
that we're talking about today is also
going to be part of a Udacity course so
you go check this out as well so all the
topics I'm covering today in in brief
will be covered in that course over sort
of like a multi week period doing a very
deep dive on a lot of these things
giving a lot more practical advice on
building accessibility into your
applications so definitely go check that
out now I want to start off by just sort
of telling a story so about a month ago
it was April and like many of you I was
doing my taxes and it was awesome right
then you guys loved it it was great
right no it actually sucked so doing
your taxes is like a really in the u.s.
at least it's a really frustrating
horrible experience because you have
these like amazing tax forms I don't
know how many of you have ever actually
filled out an actual tax form you ever
had to deal with that yeah like you kind
of go off-road with your tax software
and suddenly you end up having to fill
out a real form and these tax forms
they're horrible because there's no real
hierarchy right there's no like I don't
know if I'm going offroad or if I'm in
some someplace I shouldn't be or if I'm
messing up or anything like that
and I kind of think of the tax form as
like my interface to the IRS right okay
and so my goal is very simple right I
just want to pay my taxes but their
interface it's like totally blocking me
and eventually if you've gone through
this process you reach this point we're
just like oh my god I just I just want
to give you my money like I don't I
don't want it you know and I want you to
think about that feeling okay because it
sounds like many of you have felt that
feeling before it doesn't necessarily
have to be taxes but it could be trying
to book a hotel room or something the
websites just not doing it for you
something like that
but really hold on to that feeling of
frustration that you have felt before
okay now for many of us that's just an
occasional thing right it just occurs
during tax time or something like that
but for a lot of our users especially
anybody with a disability or impairment
this can be a recurring theme as they're
trying to interact with websites that
just haven't been programed with
accessibility in mind so for that reason
I personally really like working on
accessibility because I like feeling
like I am sort of actively removing some
of that anxiety and frustration from the
universe and from people's lives to me
that is super super motivating but there
are a bunch of other reasons why I think
accessibility is extremely important and
everyone should be prioritizing it in
their applications now of course there
there are obvious like legal reasons and
potential missed sales opportunities
those are very important but I don't
think that that is what motivates a lot
of developers so instead I think there
are kind of these three other things
which to me I think are super exciting
when I and I think about accessibility
work the first it's just that this is
sort of a big greenfield space and what
I mean by that is that accessibility is
sort of underserved in the platform
meaning there's a lot of room for
developers to come in and build cool new
tools and cool new libraries to write
blog post and to kind of like get their
name out there as thought leaders in
this space
so if you like working on sort of like
interesting technical problems
accessibility is one of those areas we
can really sink your teeth into it and
and do some really awesome work another
is just that like accessibility work
really benefits everyone
the chances are very good that pretty
much all of us in this room are gonna
experience some form of disability in
our lifetimes if not if not right now
then as we age as our is our eyesight
degrades our hearing degrades or our
motor impairment degree it's right all
of these things
so all of us you know are gonna want to
use our computers and our phones when
that happens I'm gonna be happy that
accessibility work has been done on
those platforms when we reach that point
also a disability can be situational it
can be temporary right I'm sure many of
you were outside the other day perhaps
trying to use your phone in very bright
sunlight and it can be very difficult to
read maybe you needed a little
additional contrast on this
green or something like that so you know
disability can affect us in temporary
ways as well finally and for me this is
what sort of is most important gets back
to that earlier point when my users are
using my application I want them to feel
certain and confident in the actions
that they are taking so filing your
taxes booking a plane ticket booking a
hotel room these are not things that you
want to get wrong right and so
fundamentally I just think that good
accessibility equals good user
experience working on accessibility is
going to expose things in your
application that you have overlooked
because it's gonna force you to step
outside of yourself and work with your
app from a different perspective and
when you do that you just going to end
up with a better more polished product
that is ultimately you know usable for
for more users and so when I tell this
to a lot of developers they're like yeah
dude totally I I 100% agree right but
they find working on accessibility to be
difficult you know as web developers I
think many of us have kind of like we
know bits and pieces of how
accessibility works right but in general
we sort of have this like Swiss cheese
understanding of the platform as a whole
and how it all kind of like fits
together so as web developers we need a
more solid foundation in our
understanding of accessibility and once
you sort of remove that mystery then
working on accessibility becomes much
more fun much more exciting because you
don't feel like you're you're guessing
or you're just kind of like making stuff
up you actually know that you're headed
in the right direction so that's what I
want to talk about today I want to talk
about you know how we set a good
foundation for ourselves as web
developers with accessibility and I also
want to cover some practical advice some
stuff that you can use every day in your
applications right now to start
improving the accessibility of them so
I'm going to split this talk into kind
of three sections the first is just like
looking at the diversity of users that
are out there kind of looking at the
accessibility topics that affect them
and then I want to move on to the two
big areas that I see many web developers
struggling with which is focus and
proper semantics but I want to start
just by understanding kind of hue our
users are in the range of accessibility
topics that affect them now I'm going to
focus on people with permanent
disabilities in this section but again I
want to reiterate that accessibility
really does
all of us if you are trying to use your
phone one-handed while you were holding
like a screaming baby then you are sort
of temporarily or situationally impaired
it really makes no difference if you're
if you're you know holding something in
one arm and trying to use your phone
one-handed or if you have like a motor
impairment and you know are paralyzed on
one side of your body again it's sort of
nets out to the same thing so I just
wanna get some stats out there because I
feel like these are pretty interesting
according to the World Health
Organization about 15% of the world's
population lives with some form of
disability and to put that into
perspective we're talking about around 1
billion people across the globe right so
not in significant size and we can
roughly split this into about four
categories there's disabilities and
impairments affecting the visual senses
those affecting motor and dexterity
auditory senses and cognitive senses I
want to go through each of these
individually starting with a visual
impairment so a visual impairment kind
of spans a broad range you can have
users who are completely blind to those
who have limited or low vision users who
are have no vision maybe using a screen
reader device to access the page so this
is a talkback on Android or they might
be using a similar Braille reading
device to access the content of the page
users with limited or low vision may be
using screen magnification though they
might also choose to use a screen reader
or they might use high contrast mode in
the browser to sort of switch the
background color and increase the
legibility of the text on screen users
with motor impairment this could span a
group of folks who you know maybe have
even just like a wrist injury broken arm
repetitive stress injury something like
carpal tunnel right and they prefer not
to use a mouse all the way to folks who
might have physical paralysis or sort of
limited range of motion route with some
part of their body so these users they
may use header eye tracking to navigate
the page this is an example of a program
called Dasher which combines with a head
tracking camera to allow someone to type
these users may also use their keyboard
primarily to navigate they may use a
discreet switch device as we're seeing
here or they may also use voice control
to navigate the page for auditory
impairment this group ranges from those
who are completely deaf to the
who are hard of hearing so I'm
personally in the heart of hearing camp
I'm about 90% deaf on my left hand side
and so for this group of users it's
important to make sure that we're not
relying solely on sound to convey
information in our applications so we've
got captioning
we've got transcripts they were playing
sound in the background that we're
providing some sort of visual indicator
to let the person know that that is
happening
and finally for cognitive impairment
this is a really broad range and
promising everything from ADHD dyslexia
autism just to name like a few items and
for these users the accommodations are
obviously extremely diverse but we do
find some overlap with things with
things like zoom functionality and
making it easier to read the page and
minimizing distraction so this is an
example of a Chrome extension for
someone with dyslexia and what it does
is it applies color gradients to the
page to aid in the the reading order and
make sure that they can read in a linear
fashion so these are kind of like the
four major categories that we need to
keep in mind when we are thinking about
accessibility in our applications but
because accessibility is so broad and
the user ship is just like so diverse
it's really helpful to have a guide to
sort of lead us on our journey here and
we find that in the form of the web
content accessibility guidelines to do
or what CAG to do so this is a set of
best practices but a bit which have been
put together by accessibility experts to
really try and define like what it means
for something to be accessible and the
mechag is extremely comprehensive but it
can also be overwhelming so it's a very
large sort of spec document and you know
for a lot of developers they open that
up and they're just like and they're
like face melts and they're like no no
don't want it right so I hope mitigate
this the WebM group has actually
distilled the kayak down into this
really easy to follow a checklist called
the webaim checklist for what CAG to do
so the nice thing about this is it is
specifically geared towards web content
and now if you we're watching that
previous section you were sort of
wondering like wow how am I going to
cater to that diverse range of users and
all those different assistive
technologies I think a really really
great starting point is to just nail
this checklist and what I think is sort
of a good personal strategy is figure
out what the primary user journeys
are in your application if creating a
new account is like a really really
important journey that you want every
user to be able to complete then go
through all of the steps of that process
and make sure that you can check off the
relevant checklist items so you can
ensure that that user has an accessible
journey that they can complete and then
do that over and over again for the
primary actions in your application and
you want to incorporate this work into
you know not just the development phase
but also obviously the design phase the
planning phase make sure that all of
your stakeholders are bought into this
so with that checklist in hand we're now
ready to actually start exploring some
of the nuts and bolts functionality that
we're gonna need to add to our
application to make sure we can build
those experiences and I want to start
off by looking at focus and really like
what does it mean for something to have
focus what is it when we talk about
focus in the platform really what are we
getting at there and focus that's kind
of one of these like underlying bedrock
key things in accessibility and in a
nutshell what we're talking about is
focus just sort of helps determine where
key word events go on the page okay
that is sort of the main takeaway here
focus determines where your keyboard
events go on the page so if I go over
and I click on this text field I give
this indicator to let me know that it's
focused and as I'm typing keys on my
keyboard right all those key events are
directed right at that field and then it
knows to display the keys that I've
typed now some users drive their
computers entirely with the keyboard or
with some other sort of discrete input
device like a switch control like I
showed earlier and so for these users
it's sort of their primary means of
reaching everything on screen and it's
absolutely critical that we have a good
experience with focus and tab water in
our application now to move focus around
the screen if you're using a keyboard
you can use either tab or shift tab and
the ordering that the items in your
application get focused is known as
creatively enough the tab order tab
orders based on your elements position
in the Dom right so how you write your
HTML and this is great because it means
you don't have to go in and explicitly
tell the platform okay focus this thing
and then focus this thing and then focus
this thing right you don't have to like
programmatically do that it just does it
for you it's just inferred based on the
order that you wrote your HTML but right
away we get to a potential gotcha
because the Dom order is so important
it's possible though that we could
reposition our elements on screen using
something like CSS without changing the
Dom order and then that can lead to all
sorts of kind of weirdness for our users
so I'll show an example here I've got a
little bit of HTML just a few buttons
and then you can see the output over
there on the right hand side okay so I'm
gonna just tab through this really
quickly so I hit tab right focus is my
first button and tap again focus the
second tab again focus is the last right
so far so good no surprises
so now I'm gonna add a little bit of CSS
I'm gonna change that first button so it
has a little inline style so that's
floated to the right now visually I have
updated sort of the the layout and
appearance of those buttons on-screen
now but I have not at all affected their
position in the Dom so let's look at
what happens when I tab through this now
okay well we start at the end and then
we go back to the beginning and I go to
the middle right that's kind of weird
here's an example on a site that I built
and you can sort of see this in a more
real-world use case so I started tabbing
through it starts way over there and
we're going backwards through the
navigation kind of it's gonna jump to
the bottom of the page because I have
something absolutely positioned it's
gonna jump back up to the page right so
you kind of like bouncing around the
page like a pinball and I see this on
websites all the time like go to a
website today and just try and tab
through it and you'll see that focus
jumps around sometimes it just
disappears for a while and it's like I
don't know where whither like comes back
right so the main thing here is just you
know make sure if you're changing the
visual position of something that you're
also updating its position in the Dom
don't fight the platform here it's
trying to help you out actually it's
trying to you know infer your tab order
for you so you don't have to write a
bunch of code to tell it what you know
what order you want things to focus on
but that means that you've got to like
play along with that and if you want to
move something visually later in the
document move it later in the Dom as
well and it's a best practice make sure
that you're just tabbing through your
site occasionally if you haven't done it
if you like work on a big site you
haven't tab through it recently or ever
maybe sit down and do that it can be a
feeling hurting experience but it is an
important useful thing that everyone
does okay so we've talked a little bit
about what can be focused I wouldn't
move on now to just talking about really
like
talk about what focus means I want talk
about what can be focused and really
like what should be focused so many of
the native elements that you're familiar
with are all sort of implicitly
focusable meaning any sort of control
that a user could interact with or
provide some input - so like button
input select these are all implicitly
focusable meaning they get naturally
inserted in the tab order so I don't
have to do any work the user can just
press the tab key and it'll focus them
which is great but not all elements are
focusable so for instance this header
this paragraph of text this image of
this cat these are not focusable these
are not implicitly inserted in the tab
water or anything like that and because
there's no need to focus something if a
user cannot interact with it in any way
so if now this something comes up a lot
of people get worried that a user with a
visual impairment might miss like an
important heading or an important piece
of text or something like that so they
make it focus a bowl but really again
there's no need to do that those users
have tools like screen readers and the
screen readers sole job is to read
headings it's to read text and to make
sure that the user gets all that content
so again you don't need to make
something focusable if it's not
interactive and this now presents'
another sort of interesting gotcha that
I see a lot because generic elements are
not focusable by default then we can end
up in this weird situation where here
I've got some more buttons and I'm gonna
replace that center button with this
very fancy looking button that I have
created using a div but again this is
sort of a generic element right there's
nothing implicitly focusable about it
and so as the user is tabbing through
the page right focus it's the first item
tab again and we just like jump right
past that button so if that button was
your you know give me money button or
sign up for a new account button then a
user who's using a keyboard or a switch
device they're effectively cut off from
that because that item is not inserted
in the tab water so an easy way to fix
this just use the proper element right
use a button tag here we're gonna get
implicitly inserted in the tab order you
can style button elements very easily
and now as the user is tabbing through
this experience right they'll just land
on that button and we don't have to do a
bunch of extra work an interesting bonus
of using the button element is if you
give a button element and on click
handler I use their lands on it and
presses either enter or spacebar it will
run the onclick handler if however you
have a div that you've you know made
focusable and I'll explain how to do
that a little bit later
but if you have a div and you give it an
onclick handler and the user focuses it
and they press ENTER no space
nothing's going to happen because
there's a little bit of browser magic
that actually makes sure that the
onclick gets run with your button so
that means you're gonna have to add an
additional key down handler to your div
button it means you're gonna have to
check which key was pressed when they
when they hit the button it's just
there's no real upside to it so again
don't fight the platform here the
platform's trying to give you some
accessibility for free that's why these
elements exist it's why they're
implicitly inserted in the tab order
right so use the native elements
whenever you can but I realized there
are times when there's just not a native
analog to what you're trying to build or
maybe the native element is just too
difficult and frustrating to style so
there will be times when you need to go
off-road and build your own sort of
custom components now when you're doing
that it's important to make sure that
you're adding back in that keyboard
support for those users who rely on it
now to do this we can use the tabindex
attribute and the tabindex attribute
basically just helps us configure the
focus ability of our elements and it
takes kind of a range of values so
tabindex of zero means that the element
will be inserted into the natural tab
order and it also means that the element
will be programmatically focusable if we
call its focus method so here's another
one of these fancy buttons that no one
can interact with just yet so I gave it
a tab index of zero now the user can
very easily just press the tab key and
focus it okay so far so good
time and X of negative 1 means that the
element will not be in the natural tab
order so the user can't tab or shift tab
to it but we can still programmatically
focus it by calling its focus method and
this can be useful if you need to sort
of temporarily disable an interactive
control or for a technique called roving
focus or roving tabindex so if you're
building a very complex component this
technique can be super useful so let's
say I have this list here and maybe I
have like a hundred items in this list
and I wouldn't want my user to have to
tab through every single one of those
items just to like move past the list so
I'm gonna treat the entire list as one
big
have stopped so you can land on it they
can use the their up and down arrow keys
if they want to interact with it well
they should be able to tap out of it if
they need to and so to do this I'm gonna
set tab next to negative one on all the
elements except for the one that I think
is sort of like currently active or
currently selected and then when the
user does focus this item right they're
gonna land right on the one that's
active and if they press the down arrow
key I can listen for that and say all
right now I'm gonna move my tab index
down so I'll set the next item to
tabindex zero the previous one to tab
index negative one and I'll call its
focus method so this way if the user
tabs out of the control they tap back in
they're gonna land right on that last
item that they interacted with but if
they need to again they can just quickly
tap out they don't have to tab through
every single item in our huge list so
this is a really really really useful
technique if you're building sort of
complex components lastly you can't have
a tab index value of greater than zero
you can have a tab index value of like
five ten whatever and this is gonna take
that element actually jump it in front
of everything else that's in the natural
tab order so in general this is
considered kind of an anti-pattern
because it's very easy to tie yourself
in knots with this and end up with like
again sort of crazy focused jumping
around all around the page it's also a
little strange for someone who's using a
screen reader a screen reader users tend
to navigate the Dom in kind of a linear
fashion and you've got these elements
that sort of don't comply with that at
all and and are trying to exist in
different tab borders so I wanted to put
this here for completeness so that you
know that tabindex greater than zero is
a thing but in general it's an Annie
pattern you probably never ever want to
do it okay
so I showed that sort of complex control
a second ago that list thing and one of
the questions that comes up a lot is
like okay so I'm building this complex
can like control but what are all of the
things that I need to add to it to add
proper keyboard support right what
happens when the user presses escape or
up or down what's what's the expectation
what what what do users want from me
here and so to help with this there's
this amazing document called the aria
authoring best practices guide and I'm
going to talk about Aria more later on
in the session but this is such a useful
document I wanted to put it in here
early and what it does is basically
lists patterns like UI patterns on one
side so combo box button checkbox
whatever
and you can click on those and then it
will take you to a section which just
tells you all of the keyboard support
that that kind of control needs to have
this is what is this is what users
expect when they interact with a dialog
or something like that so this is a
super useful guy to just answer and
clear up any of those questions that you
might have when you're trying to figure
out what support do I need to add now
you might look at this and be like okay
well that's like a non-trivial amount of
work right and again as I said before
good accessibility equals good UX and so
that means that the controls that we
build need to have really robust
polished keyboard support right so it is
it can be a lot of work at times and if
I'm doing all this work then I want to
think to myself how do I get the maximum
amount of mileage out of this and what I
think is kind of a good approach is once
you've done all this work with your with
your component that you're building
consider sort of extending the platform
and then turning that widget into a web
component the nice thing here is you've
now encoded all these useful keyboard
patterns into a reusable component that
you should be able to use sort of in any
context in any sort of framework or
library or anything that can just work
normally with the Dom so this is a nice
place to just extend things and and get
something that you can take with you on
to you know future projects this is an
area where in particular the polymer
team has spent a lot of time over the
past year making sure that the
components that they build comply with
those Aria design patterns so a good
example of that is like the modal window
so the modal window in accessibility is
like the boss battle you let you reach
at the end of accessibility because
they're super super hard to program in
an accessible fashion I'll kind of walk
you through a scenario here so let's say
you have a modal window right you just
made like a little div thing and you
don't want the user to be able to click
on the background so a lot of developers
will put a little overlay behind it
right cool right problem solved well
let's look at what it looks like when
someone goes through this using a
keyboard so they press the tab key the
focus the first item tab key and they
focus the next item and press tab again
uh-oh I just went like what right behind
the overlay just focus the next
focusable element in my document because
it doesn't care that there's an overlay
there doesn't that does not affect the
tab order at all and so what you need is
kind of like a temporary focus trap
inside of that modal right
and this is you know not always a
trivial amount of code to write so this
is the the code that I wrote recently
for my modal focus trap thing right and
I don't want to write that over and over
and over again and all of my projects
okay so this is a place where I would
love if there is a pre-existing web
component that I could just take off the
shelf that did all those good behaviors
for me so the polymer team has spent a
lot of time working on this when they
created their paper dialog element so
this element if you give it just as
modal attribute just that one thing
there is a signal to say hey when the
modal is open trap the keyboard focus
okay so I don't have to deal with any of
that code anymore which is awesome also
when the modal is open move focus into
the modal so that my user knows like hey
a modal window just open because I'm
using a screen reader and a modal window
pops on screen I need some indicator I
need something to tell me that that that
thing exists now so move focus into it
that's what the autofocus attribute will
do there are attributes for you know
confirming or dismissing the modal which
are very handy and then I love this
attribute right here which is when the
modal gets closed it's going to restore
focus to whatever was the previously
focused item in the document so now the
user has that sort of continued
continuity with their experience so this
is a great example of taking all this
accessibility best practices and putting
them together into a web component you
can see that in action here so I'm just
going to open this paper dialog and as
I'm like hitting my tab key right it's
trapping focus now so I'm not escaping
to the back of the page I just hit Enter
or space on this button let's just close
it and restore it back to the document
it's awesome okay so we talked a lot
about focus I got to shift gears now and
talk about semantics so when I think
about semantics there's like two
questions that come to mind
the first is like what does it mean when
we talk about good semantics and the
second is how did good semantics benefit
our users and answer these questions it
helps to think about this idea of
affordances so affordances offer or
afford a person and opportunity to
perform some action a teapot is a really
good example so a teapot just based on
its physical design has all sorts of
affordances built into it right it has a
handle and because I've seen other
things with handles before I know that I
can pick that thing up and sort of
probably you know operate it and tilt it
based on that handle so the handle a
little
on the top the spout these are all
visual affordances to basically tell me
how this thing's gonna work I don't need
someone to explain to me how a teapot
works right now when it comes to a
graphical user interface we still have
affordances but now they're kind of more
metaphorical so a button is a good
example you might take a button and you
might try and make it look like a
real-world button something that someone
might actually click on so you give it a
drop shadow and like a border you make
it look kind of 3d right so these are
all visual affordances that you're like
adding back in so the user can infer how
to use the UI but for a user who can't
see the screen they're gonna miss out on
all these visual affordances right so we
need to make sure that the information
that we're trying to express with these
elements is expressed in a way that's
flexible enough that assistive
technology can pick up on it and create
an alternative interface for our users
and so we refer to this as expressing
the semantics of the element so do me an
example here I've got a select element
with a label and this is going to
produce a visual UI right which is full
of its own affordances but because I've
used semantically rich elements it's
also able to produce an audio UI for
someone who's using a screen reader and
generally speaking for foremostly
elements in your application you can
expect the for sort of crucial pieces of
semantic information to be there the
element should have a role so our select
element has a roll of pop-up button if
you're using a the screen reader voice
over on a Mac it has a name and when I
say that I mean sort of like the label
if you want to think that like that way
like what is sort of if a screen reader
were to land on this thing how would it
sort of like say it's its name or its
label so I'm not talking about the the
HTML name attribute but really just like
The Associated text with the control it
could optionally have a state not
everything has a state but some things
do and I could optionally have a value
so what's happening here is when we
write HTML two things get produced right
we get the DOM and then from that gets a
we get a GUI and we get an accessibility
tree which is sort of a collection of
all those semantics that accessibility
tree
I think it's hand it off to assistive
technology so something like a screen
reader which is then able to produce a
secondary interface for a user so it can
announce you know hey this is the
element that you're interact
with so under the hood this is what's
happening and this is why you know it's
really important to make sure we have
this good rich semantics in our
applications so just like we saw with
focus native elements have implicit
semantics so if you are using an input
with a type equals password and you
focus it using the the the screen reader
or voiceover on a Mac then it's just
gonna go ahead and announce that it's
secure edit text right so I didn't have
to add anything there these are just all
built into the native controls and just
like we saw the focus when we try to
bolt functionality on to non semantic
elements like a div then we're gonna end
up missing out on all of these goodies
that the browser is trying to give us
for free so here is another one of these
fancy dip buttons and I've added
tabindex right so it's focusable but to
a screen reader idea is just a generic
container right it's not there's nothing
about it that says it's interactive so
when the user lands on it if they're
using voiceover it's just gonna say
group group of what I don't know like is
this I don't know what to do with this
thing
so again this is another place where we
want to make sure we're not fighting the
platform whenever possible we want to
use native elements cuz we're gonna get
these sort of freebie semantics and by
the way just to set aside I hope at this
point you're like none of you are ever
again gonna write a div button if anyone
writes a div button after this talk I
have clearly failed yes there's no
upside to it but I get it there are
times when you have to build something
that like again there's no native analog
for it right you've got it you got to go
off-road you've got to make your own
component right and when you're doing
that just like we saw with keyboard
focus we want to make sure that we're
adding back in those proper semantics so
we can do this using the web
accessibility initiatives accessible
rich Internet application spec or Aria
there's a lot of acronyms and
accessibility so what are you does is it
lets you do surgery on the accessibility
tree right it lets you add attributes to
elements and those elements then modify
or say those attributes then modify the
semantics of those elements now
important thing to remember here is that
semantics is the only thing that Aria
changes Aria does not and cannot a
the behavior of your element so this is
for me this was one of those like Swiss
cheese moments that I referred to
earlier earlier kind of like a hole in
my understanding of the platform so I
used to think if I just added like a
roll of button and like spam some Aria
attributes on a thing like it would just
become keyboard focusable he would just
like magically like work with the
keyboard right that is not the case
all it does is update semantics which is
a really important thing to understand
so that means if you are adding Aria you
still need to go do your tabindex work
and still need to make sure you're
adding this keyboard support things as
well okay so I'm gonna walk through an
example here this is a custom element
that I was working on it was a checkbox
and you can see what it's hit renders
over there and in this little box down
here I'm gonna put what the screen
reader announces when I interact with
this thing now right now this thing is
so semantically uninteresting that if I
were to land on that checkbox element
then voice over on a Mac would literally
just say nothing give me like this is a
nothing to me I care not about this tag
okay so I got to figure out like how do
I add the right semantics to this and
you could go look at the Aria spec which
comes with this very helpful diagram or
what I would recommend is to go back to
that Aria design pattern stock that I
was showing earlier find the control
that you're building and then this will
actually take you to so since we're
building a check box we can go to
section 2.7 and it'll actually show you
here there's a whole column if we scroll
down dedicated to you these are the
right roles and States and things that
you need to add to your element and
here's when you need to add them okay so
this tells me I need a role of checkbox
I need to provide an accessible label I
need to set Aria checked to true or
false depending on our state right right
up there okay so that's what we're gonna
do so I'm gonna go back to my check box
and the first thing I'll do is I'll give
it a role of checkbox and then you can
see in my little my box down there now
my screen reader is just gonna say ah
this is a check box and it's unchecked
right it's actually inferred that it's
unchecked based on the role and in the
world of Aria the role is like the most
important attribute okay everything sort
of falls out of the role
there are many Aria attributes which
don't even work if they are not paired
with the correct role
so the first thing I'm gonna do is nail
that roll make sure you got the right
one up there now if you're looking at
the check box you can see that well it
actually is checked so I need to tell
this thing that that we're currently in
that state so an aria checked attribute
of true now here we see kind of an
interesting quirk of aria
some HTML attributes or mini HTML
attributes are boolean attributes
meaning that just putting the attribute
on the element will imply that it is
true okay with Aria you always have to
pass a text value of true or false
as a string I think it's one of the it's
one of the only places where you have to
do this so this is just sort of an
interesting quirk of Aria so you always
have to give it a literal string of true
or false now the next thing the doc told
us to do is give it a label and labeling
is super important in the world of
accessibility and there's kind of two
main ways that we can go about it
there's the Aria label attribute and
this is just a string that we can kind
of just apply right to the label itself
so a good example of when we would use
this is on something like a hamburger
button on your responsive website right
like you might not have you might not
have any text around that button so
there's nothing no no sort of label to
associate with it
but if a user lands on this button and
voiceover it's just gonna say button
okay button for what likes in my social
security number like what is this button
right so I need to give it some kind of
label and I can use Aria label to do
that so now I can say main menu button
right very easy very nice technique it's
important to note too that Aria label
will override any other label or text
that you have associated with an element
so if it's on if you got a button and
you've got some text inside of there and
you give it an aria label the only thing
that will be announced will be that Aria
label similarly we have another thing
called Aria label by and this lets us
actually associate sort of another
element as our label so it's similar to
using the the native label tag that many
of you are familiar with except for the
label element only really works with a
few things if you like inputs and other
controls
whereas Aria labeled by can be applied
to pretty much any HTML element and the
cool thing about it is it composes so we
can have multiple things that we're
referencing that we can use to sort of
build up a complex label for our element
so in this case I've got a shop now'
button and when the user lands on it I
just
says shop now button okay well shop now
for what like shop now for hats shop now
for sunglasses right I want to associate
it with that piece of text right up
right up above it so I can actually put
two IDs into my Aria label by field I
can put that labels ID in there as well
as the buttons ID itself it can like
self reference and now we've composed
together a bigger label of men's
outerwear shop now button so this is
what I want to use for my check box so
I've got this little associated span
down here and I'm just gonna use Aria
labeled by and refer to that span by its
ID and now we can see that our final
outcome is sign up check check box which
is awesome now there's a few ways to
verify that the work that we've done
here is correct you can either learn a
screenreader which I would absolutely
recommend everyone do you it takes about
20 minutes you've got a free one on the
Mac in the form of voiceover and if you
go to your system preferences there's
even a tutorial that will just walk you
through voiceover which is awesome and
on Windows you have NVDA which is also
free so pick one of those up check the
work that you're doing but you know if
you're on a big application it can be a
little frustrating to have to like tab
through or navigate through the entire
page with a screen reader every time you
want to verify your work so it also
recommend that you check out the chrome
accessibility dev tools extension so
this is available on the chrome store
this was created by my teammate Alice
Boxhall
and it's an extension is gonna let you
inspect your elements accessibility
properties the same way that you would
inspect like CSS or anything else
associated with an element so I'll give
you a little example so here's our sign
up button and I'm gonna open my elements
panel and I can actually find it in the
DOM and then I can go look where
normally there's like Styles and other
things I have this accessibility
properties tab that I can open up and
now I can see the role the element that
is providing my labeled by value I can
see down there where it says text I can
see sort of the the computed name or
label that'll be announced for this
thing right so you get all this
information for free and this way I can
just very easily go through and inspect
my app and make sure that I'm doing the
correct work now just like we saw with
with focus this can become sort of like
a non-trivial amount of effort getting
all these attributes right and so again
this is another area where you might
consider
turning this work into web components
and so the the polymer team has actually
been looking at that aria authoring
guide and they build loads of controls
right and as Laura as well as having
good keyboard support these controls
also all apply the correct Aria roles
and correct Aria states and values when
they should at the correct time and sort
of a good example of this is the site
that the team has been working on called
shop so I really like this because I
think it's sort of an it shows that you
can use kind of like bleeding edge
technology like web components without
having to sacrifice on good semantics or
anything like that so you can actually
see my screen reader running down here
in the corner I'm going to navigate
through the shop site and you'll see
that it's announcing all this
semantically rich information to the
user rights telling them you know the
control that they're wrong and and how
to work with it right it's pop-up button
right they can pick their sizes but
you're also seeing good sort of like
keyboard focus management so as I click
Add to Cart
now I moved up into that dialogue that
just opened up so the user didn't have
to like furiously search for it so this
is like again I really like this project
it's up on github today at polymer slash
shop on github go check this out please
if you find accessibility issues file
them because we want to make this like a
sort of a model showpiece of using web
components and accessibility to produce
a really great final product okay wrap
up we covered three sort of major areas
today the first is make sure that you
really understand that diverse range of
users that are out there
learn the macaque familiarize yourself
with the web aim checklist you know
figure out what your primary user
journeys are in your application and
make sure that you can really check off
the relevant checklist items that relate
to those you also want to make sure that
all of your interactive controls can be
reached with the keyboard so use native
elements whenever possible because
they're going to get implicitly inserted
in the tab order but if you need to go
off-road you need to create your own
controls make sure you add that keyboard
support back in using tabindex and
similarly we want to make sure that
we're offering good affordances so use
native elements when you can cuz you get
rich semantics for screen readers and if
you need to go off-road take a look at
the Aria design pattern stock and make
sure that you're applying the correct
Aria attributes the main takeaway that I
would like all of you to leave with
there's sort of one like
or that you can have in your head it's
not good accessibility is good UX okay
take this back to your team you know
scream this in your meetings when you
work on accessibility right through
every step of your process what you're
doing is you're making sure that the
final product that you produce is
significantly more polished and that
more users can access and enjoy your
experience
okay I'd also ask you go check out this
course if you've been interested in the
things we've been talking about today
this is a multi-week course it goes way
deeper on all the things that I've been
showing this afternoon also there are a
few more accessibility sessions here at
i/o so this evening at 5:00 p.m. in
Hercules there will be one there's one
tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. and Ursa Minor
also go check out the sandbox the the
access and empathy sandbox they always
have the coolest stuff every i/o because
they're showing off all the cool new
future assistive technology it is always
my favorite sandbox so be sure to go
find them and check that out
lastly thank you so much for joining me
this morning and I hope you enjoy the
rest of i/o</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
