build a ruler and then enhanced it to
store each individual view on the server
side the advantage is that the initial
page is smaller making the app spin up
faster the downside however is that on
slow connections each navigation can be
painfully slow let's simulate a slow
Network and make every spawns take
something between one and two seconds
the page loads and when it's done the
network is idle once we click on a link
we need to fetch the data from the
server and we have to show a spinner
because it is taking too long a solution
for this problem is resource hints
resource hints let us take advantage of
the idle time on the network to prepare
the data we need next by putting link
tags in our documents had these instruct
the browser what resources to fetch when
it has some time to spare in our case we
are going to load the other views now
the browser will load these resources
when the network is idle and the user is
busy interacting with a page even though
we still have a delay on the network the
view slowed instantly you might be
asking yourself why I'm not using heb to
push with push you're forcing the data
onto the browser ignoring if we have any
bandwidth to spare or if the resource is
maybe already in the browser's cache
with resource hints we remove all that
responsibility to the browser because it
knows best when it is idle and has some
more time to do stuff I've updated the
code in the repository for you to check
out see the link in the description
until next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
