I'm not older on Twitter and github and
Internet places and I've been on the
polymer team for about two years you may
have seen me
meowing about web components a lot but I
started right before polymer one was
shipped this was exciting because back
then I thought web components were
really cool but nobody really knew about
them I would go to conferences and be
like I work on web component so people
would be like I don't know what that is
is it an iframe no it isn't and I really
liked doing that because I sort of
became this like traveling sales woman
door to door selling web components and
be like let me tell you how web
components are right for you
and I'm glad I did that because talking
to people I sort of formed the story
about the kind of teams that web
components are good for and the kind of
people that enjoy using web components
and that story starts with like the
world around us the world around us is
built by people like you and me and
sometimes we're crafters and sometimes
we're assemblers and what I mean by that
is that if you think about your kitchen
somebody made you a table and a chair
and a bunch of cabinets and maybe you
were maybe somebody else assemble them
together in a nice-looking kitchen you
didn't go into the forest cut down a
tree sanded it down cut into slabs took
some screws made a table out of it and
we're like I crafted this out of this
chair you didn't do that even if you use
something like IKEA you didn't really
craft the table you assembled it
somebody produced a whole bunch of
instructions and pieces for you and you
assemble them together you took things
that other people did and you made them
and you glue them together and you made
a thing out of it the same thing happens
if you cook when you make a meal you you
know take all these ingredients and mix
them together you don't define your own
tomatoes and corn and sharing your own
butter and grind your own spices and
this is very good that you don't do this
because assembling is faster and it's
more efficient and more performant more
accessible I have no idea how to farm my
own Tomatoes I know that because I have
a plant it's in my patio it makes one
tomato every month I would die of
starvation if that was my only tomato
and as a society assembling is really
fast for us it was the whole point of
the industrial reserve resolution that
revolution to
from everybody crafting a lot and doing
a lot of manual work and sort of
assembling more and making it faster and
more oriented and the thing is the exact
same is true is for the web the web is
kind of like a society but on the web we
tend to be more crafting than assembling
and that's a little bit weird because
that means we're not going to progress
as a society if we don't learn from
society's you already have and the
reason why I like this craft is an
assembler scenario for is that web
components it really nicely as a bridge
in between these two if you think about
somebody who makes components or
elements they have a lot of
institutional knowledge about what makes
that element good and all the heavy
lifting that you need for that element
something like paper dialogue requires a
lot of really weird knowledge about
animations in the CSS spec and what a
stacking context is and how you can't
just you know produce one from thin air
every time you want that but on the
other hand well somebody has made you a
web component this enables people to
just pick it up and use it and form a
really nice experience with it I can use
anybody's custom element I don't need to
know how it works and that's really
great because if you take my metaphor
from before this is great it's advancing
the web society as a whole it's faster
to make things and it's more efficient
the CTO of IMG said this at last year's
polymer summit and I really loved it
into stuck with me and he said that what
he wants to see in the world is less
crafting and more assembling less people
doing things by hand
you shouldn't have to know how to build
a table from scratch to have a really
nice living room
you shouldn't have to know what a CSS
stacking context is to just have you
know a modal dialog that tells somebody
there's a sale on your website and this
is true of every other industry but it's
not exactly true for the web like in the
real world I can be a crafter if I want
to I can be an assembler if I want to I
get to choose I don't have to be both at
once but a lot of the web we have to
both craft and assemble at the same time
and that isn't really great and all of
this comes together in design systems
so before web components when I say
design system I mean like the elements
with the elements library the things
that your brand should look like like
the colors and the padding and the
margins and the visual elements at a
napkin
use before web components having a
design system was very craft oriented if
you look at something like bootstrap
which is amazing but bootstrap was like
somebody crafted you this enormous CSS
files that had all these styles and it
was great but even putting the element
in your page was a little bit handheld
for example this is a brand navbar that
you could have in your application I
took this from the woodshop site but
imagine that at some point your brand
changes maybe you need to have like that
container fluid class needs to go away
what do you do then you have to
literally go in all of this Dom you
produce and start deleting code or
adding code and that doesn't feel a lot
like assembling to me and of course we
know this web components came and they
fix this because now we have a custom
element that abstracts all of this like
garbage that we don't actually care
about that somebody else built for us
because the only thing you care about in
this element is just that image so
that's good but the thing is this story
only works if we have tools around this
the story only works if you know like
bootstrap we have a catalog of elements
we know as a developer like all of these
things that are available to me and that
I don't have to reinvent them from
scratch but somebody already made you
know the perfect kind of blue button
that I'm allowed to use so we may well
component org which you know we're very
well it's a public web public catalog of
web components and everything everybody
can upload their components and it's got
demos and it's got dogs
and the world was good and we're happy
only we weren't super happy because it
turns out that didn't work for everyone
there's a lot of companies like EA like
Comcast that are really sold into web
components and use the components a lot
but their web components are in public
they can't use web components because
they can't publish your elements they
develop them internally so as a result
every one of these companies basically
built their own catalog they could have
forked web component or but what we want
is that our solves a different problem
which is how do we let people upload
arbitrary components and that isn't the
problem that companies with private
elements have they just want to display
this fairly limited set of elements they
have and the problem here is that
there's no such thing as a one size fits
all Steve told you this is more
when he was talking about elements and
it's true for apps and solutions at best
you have something that works in the 80%
case 80% of developers probably want to
upload a you know public web component
but in the 20% case it's like old edgy
and weird a you have to do something
different and it's usually a more
simpler and like assembly or solution so
this case I build indie elements
catalogs which it's fairly ugly it's not
amazing but it's also a very specific
problem you have a JSON file and in it
you specify what kind of elements you
want to load Docs and demos for these
can be polymer 1 elements or polymer 2
elements or just video a custom elements
they can be anything you want and the
code is there for it you to do this and
if this doesn't work for you which is
fine you can fork it you can clone it
you can fix it to make the to make it
work with your workflow and then it's
good and the world was good again well
you really wasn't we--again solves
another 80% of a bigger problem and less
20% off it's really great that you know
now your developers know what elements
are available for them but they also
need to know how they fit together
because in an organization with real
workflows and real people you need to be
able to validate your prototypes against
code that you actually have not code
that you think you might have and most
of my examples when I give talks are
from the chrome from chrome the browser
because I used to work on it
and I know the developers and the
workflows and is the page from chrome
settings and the way the chrome settings
page gets designed as far as we give it
to a designer Allen bet she's a
fantastic human being and he designs all
of these workflows in sketch he calls
these sticker sheets because he
basically has stickers of all the
material elements that he would like to
use or is it allowed to use according to
material design rules and then he
assembles them together and figures out
the screens and for each particular
screen he does a whole bunch of
iterations should the bottom be on the
list should it be on the right should
the text be centered and then you know
he produces whole bunch of screenshots
and then gives them to developers but
the thing is real elements have bugs and
have problems they have implementation
limitations
and I know this because I wrote those
elements a lot of the times Ellen would
be like this
toggle button needs to be 16 pixels and
the developer will be it only works at
18 pixels because Monica doesn't make it
resizable which is annoying because this
means that the prototype that somebody
made cannot actually be implemented and
this is what I call a what you see is
what you hope you get you hope that
would be the prototype it again from the
designer you actually get to see in real
life there's no guarantee about it and
it's nobody's fault that there's no
guarantee is just not everything works
like it is on paper because instead what
you need is a common ground or tool that
is a common ground between developers
and designers so they can look at the
same elements and improve that workflow
which is what you see is what you get a
WYSIWYG and something like this has been
a longtime dream of many of the polymer
team members we had this in 0.5 it was
called designer it was really awesome
and justin is the visionary and I team
so he said this big dream of designer 2
which is going to be an app that was
going to basically build an entire out
for you was going to let you do the UI
and some of let you do the JavaScript
and all the data bindings and you know
optimize like throw a serviceworker
in there
and literally from using that out what
you would see is what you would get
but he's always dreaming up really big
ideas like the polymer CLI and lit HTML
which you'll see tomorrow so he's never
actually finished this but lucky for you
I have incredibly small ideas and very
little patience so I had two three weeks
and basically stole his milkshake and
build this other thing which is more
like a getting started tool it gives you
the ability to create something like a
prototype and not a full-blown app it
doesn't work super well all the time but
it helps you get started because what
you do is you deserve just as tool but
we don't have it yet so instead you will
get a WYSIWYG which is like a version of
that and I'm going to show it to you
maybe ok so I really really really hate
live demos and I'm really really nervous
about it
so hold all of your fingers crossed and
toes it okay so this is WYSIWYG you can
all
I just got a screen saver it's going
well
okay it's in polymer labs that github
dub is slash WYSIWYG the code should be
open source very soon it's kind of
terrible but you'll live so here's what
the app does it has a couple of panes
and one of them has it listed you is you
can select some elements and drag them
in so I can do something like a div
which is a native element I can resize
it I can move it I can change some of
its styles so I can make a background
color and if you see over here it has
properties I'm going to zoom in so it's
got like a class list hidden and title
there's also things like custom elements
so for example I can find got a good one
paper input paper input is my favorite
and when I added paper input has
different kinds of properties because we
actually crawl the product prototype
chain so that we look at what elements
Oh what properties or attributes your
custom element has so in this case you
can see that I have something like value
and labeled and disabled and the pattern
and all that goodness that comes with
paper input and you can change them you
can change styles flex is just a
collection of like the Flex attributes
that you might use and once you're
satisfied with you know the code that
you've been producing there's a code tab
where you actually get the code for this
element it's got two imports the polymer
element and paper input which makes
sense let me zoom in and then as you
scroll it basically give you gives you
an index.html that has both the limit
definition and the declaration and once
so we have our app and then the Dom
module for that app and you can see that
it's got all the Styles like I added to
do and a paper input and here they are
in my template and then it has the
element definition at the bottom you can
also see a live preview of it which is
where we actually render the code
because I don't trust that designer pane
so I give you this and
because this code isn't editable because
again they'll be very complicated up and
then I would have to like re-render
everything there's also an option to pop
this out into a jsfiddle where it's a
conference Wi-Fi is amazing there it is
and it your paper input and it does all
the things when you can from here on
start adding logic or JavaScript or
whatever you want cool so let's build a
thing let's delete all the things first
and then build a thing what I'm going to
try to build again thoughts and prayers
is a YouTube app where basically I'm
gonna bank on a paper input and then get
a whole bunch of YouTube videos related
to that input and in particular they're
going to be related to cats because why
not let me see how I'm doing for time
okay so one of the tabs that I've been
show you over here is the samples tab
and these are basically combinations of
elements that I've added because I
really don't like rebuilding the same
thing over and over again and again this
is the kind of app that you would be
able to clone and fork and take home and
you can add your own samples for
whatever team you have or your
particular workflow so in this case I'm
going to start with a header sample
which is basically an app header with a
toolbar in it and it has a div and over
here I'm going to rename my do - meow
tube and put some emoji in there you can
tell that I've practices but it's
television - sweet so that's it and now
when I save it it's there if I preview
it it's there if I look at the code I
actually have an app header with all of
its attributes a toolbar and everything
else cool so I have my thing and now I
want to render my results so in here I'm
going to add a Dom repeat because I'm
probably going to get a whole bunch of
results actually I need an iron Ajax
first because we're going to need to ask
YouTube for this so in my custom
elements
our n8x here it is and iron-ajax has a
bunch of things we need to populate a
URL for example once I'm going to paste
because nobody can remember this unless
you're dealing probably a bunch of
parameters so here is things like your
API key your query which in this case
I'm hard coding to cats
Oh what do you care about which is the
snippet handle as JSON so this basically
tells RNA checks that whatever it gets
back from the server it should be a JSON
we want to set Auto to true so that I'm
going to refresh the page it actually
fetches this these are just attributes
that you can get from the RNA Dex
documentation they're not made up or
anything and last response
I want to populate an object with this
so here I'm going to put videos and what
this means is that RNA Jack's is going
to get a JSON object from the server and
then put it in this videos object this
is just a regular polymer data binding
if you're familiar with data bindings is
just it it's exactly how you would write
it cool so now I have my RNA checks it's
set up and then I'm going to create my
Dom repeat and this is where everything
can go cells so Dom refeed here we go I
have it I'm going to drag it in it's
hanging out does it look like anything I
also have a paper card sample which
basically has an image and a link in it
and I'm going to move it around so that
it goes into my into my Dom repeat so
there's these arrows here because
sometimes dragging and dropping is
infuriating so if you want to want to do
that you can just like traverse the tree
speaking of the tree here on the left
hand side I haven't shown you this yet
it's basically all of the elements in
your app so that you can see the
hierarchy and you can click on them and
select them because again dragging and
dropping is infuriating and I know this
because I built this and it was just
rage okay we have Airen Ajax is getting
data for us we have a Dom repeat which
repeats stamps the same thing over and
over again so it's going to stamp one of
these paper cards for every result that
we have and we told we need to
don't repeat take the elements from
iron-ajax so are any checks was
populating in obstacle videos and
because I've memorized this demo I know
that videos actually has a sub object
called items that's the one I care about
so here videos odd items is what I
wanted my dumb repeat now the dollar ap
is going to take every single thing in
this object and create an item object so
to this paper card I can now give my
item so I have an image the image should
be this thing that I'm going to paste
called item that snippet off thumbnails
The Hideout you are L very memorable and
then for my link I'm going to change the
text content to be let me zoom in again
item oh hello item dot snippet dot title
and then for my href every snippet has a
video ID so it's going to be item that
ID dot video ID and now if everything
goes well if I go to the preview I get
nothing amazing something didn't go well
so let's figure it out we have our image
and we oh maybe we don't have data let's
wait for it for a little bit
no okay part of me
Oh way louder and
thank you see drag and dropping alright
so let's move this one back and move it
into the dumb repeat nailed it
but thank you
but I'm honestly kind of surprised
onward so I'll be honest so it looks a
little bit terrible because links are
you know display:inline and we don't
have an input so let's do that now there
we know our thing your words so first of
all we're going to change our link to be
display:inline-block so that it's sized
correctly and then because I don't want
it to grow so that all my things are
still aligned correctly I can also add
extra styles so the thing that I did in
here is that as a lazy developer I
didn't ask I didn't add every single CSS
style to this designer because I'd be
crazy since Ted I give you the option to
just add whatever you want if you add
garbage nothing is going to happen
because the CSS parser is smart so in
this case I want an overflow:auto and
then that'll be great so I have my down
repeat I need my input so let's add a
paper input again in here and then I'll
drag it into here and then move it
before the Dom repeat my paper input is
going to have a label and it's going to
say find your mouse and whenever you
type it into an input it has a value
property so I'm going to save that into
a query properties cool and I only have
to do is give this query to the
iron-ajax
so if we move back to our own Ajax it
used to have this parameters object that
you know about and one of the things in
here was cat or the query queue so I'm
just going to add my query here and
still keep the cat because it's a mail
tube we only look at cat why would you
ever want to look at anything else now
let's just check the code for a second
before we run it have a whole bunch of
styles a whole bunch of imports a whole
bunch of Dom that I didn't have to
create I just like dragged and dropped
in and typed into some text fields and
that was awesome and I fell to the
preview and I look for a burrito I get
burrito cat
here is a wet cat and if I open that
video it should work and it does here's
your favorite cats getting wet and
miserable ha that's it that was my demo
cool so this is live is polymer labs
github bio slash WYSIWYG if Elliot
doesn't forget about me she'll probably
switch it to open-source now so you can
actually check the code and judge me and
complain about it later at the at the
party and I think I have like one more
slide to tell you about if we can switch
back to the suite oh my god it worked
hah never doing a live demo again till
tomorrow so because we had that 8020
problem I know that this is not going to
fit all of your problems and it's not
going to fix every single workflow out
there and it's really going to enrage
you because drag and dropping is kind of
annoying but the best thing about it is
because it's open source and because of
how I try to build it you can take it
you can fork it you can clone it you can
change it and make it work for you maybe
you need a marketing site assembler
where you just build things so that your
marketing team can put together
I don't know pamphlets whatever
marketing does something awesome that
sells then give you money fork that fork
this tool and build it into that maybe
you need you know a designer where your
designers can use four of their UI
elements to build things please for kit
please build it into that and give it to
your team maybe you want designers
instead of designers instead of
designers because why not would you want
that in particular if your name is dan
Friedman and you get a bigger screen so
you can do like nine of them inside of
each other best use of designer ever
when you say this morning that her dream
was to bring web components to every
browser and every developer and I think
the way we're going to really do this is
to start thinking more about visual
tools it's not all about your CL eyes
and your web packs and your gulps and
your whatever other tools you use
sometimes the assembling is really
visual and we haven't been really good
at building visual tools for visual
people so I hope that this at least
proved that there's a value to do this
that it's kind of exciting to build this
and to use this and it takes it a little
bit closer because
we can now we're now a little bit closer
to just assembling more things in
crafting less thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
