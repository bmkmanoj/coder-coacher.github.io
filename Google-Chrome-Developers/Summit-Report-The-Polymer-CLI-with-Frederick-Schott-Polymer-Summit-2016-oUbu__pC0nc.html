back at polymer summit day two it is
lunchtime so everyone here is in the
lounge having lots of delicious snack
elects there's also people playing
foosball behind us if you hear some
crazy sounds that's what that is i'm
joined by fred shot freddie is a
software engineer on the polymer team
Fred you just got done doing part of the
tools keynote and as part of that you
were talking about polymer CLI so um for
folks who haven't heard of that before
can you maybe tell them just briefly
like like what is polymer CLI and and
kind of like how's that going to make
them a bit more productive sure sure
thing um the Palmer CLI is your gateway
into the arc tool chain so it lets you
create new projects really easily helps
you through the entire developer flow
from testing the linting to serving your
application and finally it helps you
build a web app for production so
optimize it although all that stuff so
yeah it's really your gateway into all
these tools and as as part of the
keynote you were mentioning that folks
can create their own generators for
polymers CLI so you talked a little bit
about that like if I want to you know
learn how to do that where would I kind
of go to get started yeah sure so check
out the polymer CLI on github it has a
ton of information for all these things
that it includes for new templates you
can well I definitely recommend checking
out the ones that exist already so
search palmer in it anywhere on NPM and
you'll get a whole list of everything
that exists to create your own it's
really easy it's based off the omen
which is this really common a generator
tool and so anything that works with
that its exact same process you just
build out a new template like you would
for anything now if I want to go and get
started using polymer CLI uh where's my
where's my jumping off point definitely
check out Palmer CLI and the build
library on NPM and github as well the
readme has a ton of information yeah
well awesome so for those of you who
haven't done so yet be sure to go catch
that tools kino featuring Fred Palmer
CLI and a bunch of other really cool
