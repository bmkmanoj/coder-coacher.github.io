welcome back to the alley cash show so I
know that today I promised I was gonna
do a video on NVDA and I'm still working
on that video actually uh my my PC
laptop is in the mail but before doing
that since we're we've got a little
break right here I thought it'd be cool
to talk about this idea of semantics and
really why semantics matter in
accessibility and how they affect screen
readers and so in order to understand
why semantics are important its first
good to understand this idea of
affordances so I'll be over here in my
laptop I've got some slides I want to
show you basically an affordance when we
talk about that what we're saying is an
affordance is something that offers a
person an opportunity to perform an
action with some sort of like physical
object and so a good example that we
often use is a teapot so a teapot is
kind of cool because just based on its
physical design it kind of instructs you
in the ways that you should interact
with it so a teapot has a handle and
because you've seen other things with
handles you kind of know that you could
go up to a teapot and pick it up by that
handle and then it's also got a spout
and that kind of indicates that you
would tilt it and things would come out
of the spout so both the handle and the
spout are affordances no one has to
explain to you how a teapot works right
you can just sort of Intuit it based on
its design and so when we create our own
sort of graphical user interfaces things
like like buttons and controls and
things like that we try and add back in
those affordances as well but you know
we do it visually so for instance Baiae
affordance in your website for a button
you might make it look kind of 3d right
you might give a little drop shadow you
might make it look like a real-world
button to indicate hey this is a button
this is something you should go up and
press and so the way that we do that is
through our markup and the affordances
that we're sort of expressing through
our element are often referred to as
expressing the elements semantics so
I'll give you an example here I've got a
little bit of code here I've got a label
element with a select tag inside of it
and what this is going to do is it's
going to generate a visual UI for my
user right that has
have those built-in visual affordances
for a drop-down but it's also going to
generate a sort of separate sort of more
semantic UI that's something like a
screen reader could then turn into an
audio UI for for a user who is unable to
see the screen and so generally speaking
for every element that you create in
HTML there's a few semantic properties
that it's going to have an element is
going to have a role and so in the case
of a select element its role is actually
a pop-up button and and the role kind of
defines like you know how someone might
use as control an element is also gonna
have a semantic name and and when I say
name I know there's a built in name
attribute in HTML that you use for like
submitting things to forms but we're not
quite talking about that that sort of
name instead think of the name is kind
of more like the the label for the
control if you will so in this case I
actually have an actual label element
that is associated with the select tag
so the name that it generates is
preferred seat type an element could
also have a state so a select element
for instance is going to have a state of
like expanded or collapsed not every
element has a state but some do so
that's additional semantic information
and an element can also have a value so
again not all elements have values but
again in the case of a select element
here it's got a value of no preference
for whatever is our currently selected
item you know a text input field could
also have a value for whatever text
you've typed on screen and so what
happens when you are adding all these
semantic HTML elements to your page is
the browser's going to do two things
it's going to generate a a visible
graphical user interface and it's also
going to take all that semantic
information and create what's called the
accessibility tree so from your HTML
you're really generating two things and
that accessibility tree then gets handed
off to assistive technology like a
screen reader like like voiceover or
like in vda that screen reader that
assistive technology then takes the
information that it gets from a tree and
it generates a spoken UI for the user
and then if the user takes some action
it can actually reflect that back
through assistive technology and update
the accessibility tree now some elements
have implicit semantics so for instance
when we talk about an input password
field or
or the the native button elements or a
select element these will have implicit
semantics they're actually built into
the tags themselves and the browser
knows how to understand them so an input
password field is gonna when you when
you land on it with a screen reader it
will announce itself as secure edit text
in something like voiceover so that's
the you know the the implicit semantics
that that element has but not all
elements have super useful semantics so
for instance if you have something like
like a div that you're trying to turn
into a button well a div semantically is
just a generic grouping element and you
know there's nothing about it that says
its interactive or anything like that
and so when a screen reader lands on
that element it's actually just going to
say that it's a group so it's not going
to tell somebody that's a button or
anything like that and so when people
talk about semantics and and and why
they're so important for accessibility
this is really why because you know the
semantics let us express the affordances
that the elements offer right and then
that instructs a screen reader how to
announce that to the user and say hey
this is a button that you can interact
with or you know maybe this is just a
generic grouping thing and maybe you
don't need to do anything with it so if
you're writing your own code then how do
you figure out what your semantics are
you know how do you how do you check
that you're doing things the right way
and there's there's really like two
options here the first is you can go
through and you can you can use your
site using a screen reader and that's
going to help you verify that you've
created a good semantically rich
experience but it can also be sort of
tedious inspecting everything on the
page with the screen reader and
sometimes you might want a useful tool
to help you out in that process and so
recently what we've been working along
on the chrome team my teammate Alice
Boxhall has been pioneering this work is
a set of accessibility tools that are
actually built into the chrome developer
tools in the browser itself so I want to
show those off they're still in an
experimental phase but I want to show
them off just so you can maybe start
messing around with these in some of
your own projects so follow me over here
and this is a sort of like a form that
that Alice and I built for for one of
our courses on accessibility it's sort
of a typical form something you might
use to like book a ticket for a website
or for an airplane or something like
that and what
want to do here is the first thing I
need to do because this example actually
only works with the keyboard we wanted
to make sure people couldn't cheat and
use their their mouse or anything we've
got this click stealer thing so I'm
actually gonna delete this so we can
actually use our mouse on this form and
you can see there's a bunch of native
controls here I've got radio buttons and
input fields and dropdowns etc right and
so what I want to do is inspect these
elements using the new accessibility dev
tools so because this is an experiment
I'm gonna go over to my settings for my
dev tools I'll go to the experiments
option and then right here we've got
accessibility inspection which I'm going
to check now again word of warning it
says it right here - these are
experimental right so they they might
break they might not you know be bug
free they might not perform always as
you would expect so so keep that in mind
if you're using these tools and it seems
you know quirky at times these are still
work in progress but I'm gonna turn this
on because it's pretty cool to play
around with and I got to close my dev
tools and open them again just to
restart them and now I'm going to
inspect I've got the Select field down
here I'll go inspect that and in my
elements inspector over here we're you
know you've got styles and and Dom
breakpoints now there's a new tab called
accessibility so I click on that and
check out all this information that I'm
now getting for this select element so I
can see its role for instance remember
what I went through and I said every
element has a role name value and state
well here we're gonna get all of that
information so I can see that the role
for the select element is combo box I
can see the name that would be spoken by
something like like a screen reader is
preferred seat type and so that's based
on this this current value here you can
actually see how these things are
generated you can see if they were
generated by Aria labels or if there's
an Associated label or something like
that which is really cool
you can see the state for the element so
I can see that's currently expanded
false right it's not open at the moment
and I can also see the value for it
which right now is set to just no
preference so if I go in and I switch to
aisle seat one of the one of the quirks
right now is that you've got to inspect
another element and you can go back and
inspect this one and now we'll see that
the value here has changed to aisle seat
as well so now I know that the you know
the semantics for this element are good
and I can expect that when the
accessibility tree is is gener
by the browser this is the information
that it will pass along
so again if you're if you're building an
application and you you know you're
working on some custom controls and you
just want to verify that they do the
things that you expect or you would like
for them to announce in the
accessibility tree this can be a really
really useful tool and you know again
you can you can check out some other
elements here I've got an input tag and
see its current check value right it's
true go in and Specht the elements that
are you know labeled by label elements
and see if that affects the name that
it's actually announced by a screen
reader because that's gonna be one of
those things that sort of tedius to
check yourself so a lot of really useful
stuff that you get out of this one
little accessibility inspector now I'm
going to cover this some more in some
future episodes we'll probably just
start using it as a matter of course as
where we're building you know accessible
components but I wanted you to see this
and I also wanted you to understand
semantics a little bit better as we
continue talking about screen readers so
thank you so much for watching today if
you have questions you can always leave
them for me in the comments below you
