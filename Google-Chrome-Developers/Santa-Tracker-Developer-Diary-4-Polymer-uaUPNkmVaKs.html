It's Sam here.
CHRIS JOEL: And I'm Chris.
SAM THOROGOOD: So Chris
is from the Polymer team.
And on today's Santa
Tracker, Developer Diary,
we're going to talk a little
bit about how Santa Tracker uses
Polymer to be more productive.
So what's Polymer?
CHRIS JOEL: So
Polymer is a library
that helps you take advantage
of some of the latest browser
features, such as
web components.
SAM THOROGOOD: Cool.
And so we've been using Santa
for quite a few years now.
We use it in a bunch
of different ways.
So in a broad sense, the
whole site is basically
in one custom element,
one Polymer element
called Santa App.
But actually, that
then contains things
like Santa Chrome,
which is really
our UI around the
edge of the page.
You see the kind of toolbar
and things like that.
We've also got some elements
that you never actually see.
So the Santa Tracker router
handles the changes in the URL
up here.
So whenever we click on a
scene, like this boatload scene,
this router is actually
listening to the URL
and then bonding that
route back to the Santa App
so it can change the
scene being loaded.
CHRIS JOEL: That's really cool.
So you made those
custom elements.
SAM THOROGOOD: Yeah,
and even though there's
no visual representation, I
think it's really interesting.
And then we actually
lazyload that scene,
which is really cool.
CHRIS JOEL: Very cool.
SAM THOROGOOD: So when we're
loading and running Polymer,
how do we test it?
How do we see how fast it loads?
CHRIS JOEL: Well, I always like
to use the built-in profiler
in Chrome dev tools.
SAM THOROGOOD: Cool.
CHRIS JOEL: So in order to do
that, usually what I do first
is I go to the application tab
and I clear all my site data.
SAM THOROGOOD: Great.
That's good, because we
have a lot of caching
and a lot of
offline ready stuff.
So we want to clear
all those resources
so it feels like you're
loading it for the first time.
CHRIS JOEL: Yep.
And then you go over to
your performance tab,
and you click this button--
start profiling and reload page.
SAM THOROGOOD: Sounds good.
CHRIS JOEL: So the profile
takes a few seconds.

And then when it's done, you
get a lot of nice things.
So at the top here,
I actually have
a timeline that shows
the painting of the page
as it's loading in.
Underneath that, I can see
all of my network resources.
So I can get a
sense of when they
finish loading in relative
to all the JavaScript that's
executing.
SAM THOROGOOD: And we're
scrolling the mouse wheel here
to zoom in and out,
to deep dive or not.
CHRIS JOEL: One
of the things I've
added that's a little special
is I've used the standard user
timing API, and I've
instrumented all of the custom
elements on the app.
So here you can see the Santa
App element was created.
And it took about
250 milliseconds.
SAM THOROGOOD: That's
the whole site, I guess.
CHRIS JOEL: Right.
That's the entire site's
execution lifecycle.
And then underneath that, I can
see things like, oh, iron icon.
SAM THOROGOOD: Why does the icon
take 26 milliseconds to load?
CHRIS JOEL: I don't
know, but that's probably
something we should look into.
SAM THOROGOOD:
Yeah, interesting.
CHRIS JOEL: You can see all
of the children elements
inside of Santa App
are represented here
in this Flame chart.
So I can get a sense of which
ones are most expensive.
SAM THOROGOOD: So you would
see this normally anyway,
but if you look in
the description below,
you'll see some
resources that Chris
has written to help
you actually just label
the elements properly.
Normally, you'd just see
the functions themselves
and not know which element
it's actually being called on.
So that's really great.
So this year, one
thing we're going to do
is actually upgrade Polymer.
So we're on, I think,
version 1.7 right now.
We used to be on
0.5 back in the day,
and now we're upgrading to 1.10.
And the goal of 1.10
is then to flip to 2.0.
There's a lot of
versions floating around.
What does this mean?
Why are we doing this?
CHRIS JOEL: Yeah, so the upgrade
from 1.10 to 2.0 is going
to get you in a place where
you can start building custom
elements using
standard ES6 classes.
The Polymer, as any open source
project, is evolving over time.
And now we're trying to
put our users in a place
where they can easily
start taking advantage
of some of the latest JavaScript
features in the web platform.
SAM THOROGOOD: Right.
So previously, you
wrote a Polymer function
and gave it an object.
And actually, now, you
write a regular class name
that you inherit from a
Polymer element, right?
CHRIS JOEL: Yep.
SAM THOROGOOD: Yeah, which is
much more idiomatic these days.
CHRIS JOEL: And it's very
important to migrate up to 2.0,
because it puts you
on the trajectory
to later versions of Polymer.
We have Polymer
3.0 in preview now.
And that's going to enable you
to use things like JavaScript
modules and also get onto
the NPM package manager
for distributing your--
SAM THOROGOOD: And
by the time you're
watching this we may
already be there.
So check it out and
have a look at Polymer
and see how we're using
it in Santa Tracker.
So that's pretty much all
we have to talk about today.
Thanks for watching.
Remember, you can
always go check out
the source code for Santa
Tracker and have a look at it
yourself and build
this on your own time.
And yeah, thank you, Chris,
for being here as a guest star.
CHRIS JOEL: Yep.
Yay.
SAM THOROGOOD: See you.
