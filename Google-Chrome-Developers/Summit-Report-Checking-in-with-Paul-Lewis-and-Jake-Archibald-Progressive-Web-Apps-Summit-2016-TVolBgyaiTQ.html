progressive web apps summit we are here
in Amsterdam we're joint with Paul Lewis
and Jake Archibald to members of the
chrome developer relations team a Jake
your scalp stage you're talking about
instant loading progressive web apps
yeah I think so it's I'm still in that
bit after the talk where everything's a
blur apparently we're editing out with
the real version but through my talk my
slides just disappeared there was crazy
patterns on on the screen and I just
thought well this is this is it i'm just
going to have to you know tell a story
do it that's all the screens this screen
is absolutely massive so the failure
it's like full-on epic there were lots
of pixels all displaying the wrong thing
yeah it was very i would say exciting
but it wasn't as terrifying i mean for
the audience just be nice so so you're
talking about instant loading and if i
do too progressive web apps i'm new to
the topic are you is that just
server-side rendering or is there more
to it how do you mean by instant loading
so the patent we're trying to promote is
offline first so it's this idea if they
when you get a request and rather rather
than thinking always the user online or
as user offline and we'll do something
different it's like no just treat it one
way they try and serve stuff from a
cache something you've stored in advance
get as much data on screen before you
think about going to the network and
that's where the instant part is because
they if you're on 3G or even faster
connection it's always going to be
slower to go to the network then to just
get stuff straight like this on your
phone already really okay cool and and
I'm Paul I know that you had some
opinions on this topic as well I did ya
gotta tweet not too long ago that was a
little a little viral right about the
uncanny valley yes I'm her in this yes
so what yes what I was saying was that
it kind of ties in very much before Jake
was talking about if you do server-side
rendering but you're still relying on
the JavaScript do you have this moment
where you possibly doing a good first
render but then you're kind of waiting
for your JavaScript to arrive we passed
the executed and then you're ready to go
and I
between stage people are just like I'm
clicking and nothing's happening and
tapping nothing's happening what's going
on and I think we need to be moving more
to a world with the streaming and where
we progressively bootstrap our apps and
not just feel like here's one big load
of JavaScript and CSS and at the end of
this you know you can talk to me again
so it's very much in that kind of thing
so I think it very much builds on what
games talking about and so any admission
trimming there and so we are adding new
things to the platform to just sort of
improve upon this can you tell us loaded
about streams Jake and what your
interest is there yes it's this whole
idea that like rather than just serve
stuff like from the cache and then have
your JavaScript kind of go to the
network and peace stuff together you can
do kind of what you do on the server
already and like gets some parts from
the cache some parts from Network and
create one single stream with them so
you get that sort of first fast render
straight from the cache the lens stuff
comes in from the network gradually I
got a blog post on this so it's give my
blog streams ok so here you go the link
to that down in the show notes we're
also going to be taking that right there
with the next and that's where the
description is right there so we're also
going to have both of your talks up on
the chrome developers YouTube channels
and go there you can subscribe and also
check out the progressive web app
