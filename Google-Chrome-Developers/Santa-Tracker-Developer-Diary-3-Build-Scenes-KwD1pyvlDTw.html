have watched a few episodes so far and
learned a little bit about the different
paths of Santa Tracker and how it works
but what I wanted to do today is talk
about how you actually build it yourself
and how you can you know quite literally
check out the source code and run your
own version so to start with let's have
a look at our command line we've already
checked out Santa tracker you know we've
gone to get hopping caught the repo and
let's look at what we do now start by
checking it out you can have a look
we've got some content here it's got a
bunch of stuff so what you can start
with this is by basically running yarn
install and so yarns a package manager
you can fetch that with homebrew or some
equivalent on your machine and it will
then go and do a bunch of stuff in our
case you can see here it's pretty fast
because I've actually checked it out
before and so it'll go and fetch all its
dependencies and things like that what
it's actually doing is it's internally
calling Bower which is a package
management talks a little bit older it's
still needed for polymer - I know
polymer 3 is upgrading to NPM and that
repository but for now we still need to
have Bower install to check out all the
code we then run our build tool which is
using the gulp build system so that a
fault task that we have in gulp will
build 10 a tracker it will actually let
us serve that folder so if I just run
serve here and hit enter and then load
it up and load this URL we'll see that
take a few seconds to load and Santa
tracker will load up with all its fun
exciting stuff going on this version
will be a little bit slower than the
production version for a bunch of
reasons which I'll kind of cover in a
few seconds so because we're developers
and you know we've got access to Santa's
Village whenever we like you can
actually go and click on these scenes to
see what's going on so we can you know
cut Santa's beard and things like that
one thing to think about is that these
scenes will lo dynamically so if we load
the dev tools thusly we'll see our
lovely responsive design and if we go to
network here and set the speed to say
fast 3G we can see the loading happen so
we actually loaded the Santa selfie
scene so that'll load really fast well
let's go to a scene we haven't loaded
yet so this might be the gift slingshot
and I love this scene which I call
boatload that's that's an actual ID
because it's actually pretty small it's
not too complicated yet it does most of
the things that a regular Santa scene
will do and we've got you know every
house in the village these
is what we call a scene so let's click
on that now what you can notice is that
we're actually it was a red bar at the
top here and that slowly moves across
the screen has all the resources that
are on the right here are loaded into
the page and this is a pretty small
scene so it loads pretty fast even on a
slow connection we can also play this
game so how do we get to these scenes if
we go to the code and look at Santa app
dot HTML this is a polymer element and
we've had another episode in polymer so
I won't cover this extensively in the
middle here is what we call the lazy
pages element and this element is
entirely designed to load these pages at
runtime so interestingly enough these
scenes aren't on the page when you load
Santa tracker these are essentially
unknown HTML elements that your browser
doesn't know how to render what lazy
pages does is that when the route
changes to that URL when we want to load
the boat load scene for instance it then
goes and finds okay here's the boat load
scene it goes cool the path is this HTML
path including a language field it then
loads that into the page and when that's
loaded we can then show that scene
because all the resources to do with
that element are now on the page so if
you notice we've got it open as well so
a couple of things to note here
so firstly is that we bring in the
JavaScript for the scene so when you
first build and check out that rack up
your build might still be running
because we actually compile every scenes
JavaScript with closure compiler the
reason we do this is actually because a
lot of the scenes are quite old
they typically predate the majority of
scenes predate polymer and there's a few
scenes which are very modern and there
are built a little bit differently most
of our games are written fairly
generically they don't really care about
polymer and actually there's kind of a
nice strength of polymer in that we kind
of wrap up the HTML and JavaScript in a
very neat way just within this one file
so this scene is made of a bunch of
things it's got a template which
includes the kind of inbuilt style we
care about it also has a bunch of divs
and elements like trees and elves and
stuff like this is the the cute things
you see around this the the slingshot
thing a bit down a bit further below
we've got a very interesting message
here this is a i18n message in
production we actually remove this div
completely we swap it out for
or the message that's appropriate for
your language but in dev it lives here
so we can quickly slash line switch
languages you actually see it as we go
to the site and we go to console and
type document.documentelement dot lang
equals let's say German and a few
seconds later we see all the language
stuff changes and the way we do that is
within that element but in production
we've actually got rid of that element
completely if you're curious about how
we do that you actually load up the gulp
scripts the replace script here and so
we have a look around what we do is
actually load each page into memory
which is this mutate function here and
we do regular query selectors we say so
for everything with a message ID or
everything with a of this tag name okay
this actually is the wrong oh I see
because each method has that message ID
so we catch it here first
well actually replace the content of
that message ID for that language so
that's kind of cool that's part of our
build processes as well and so finally
let's talk a little bit about gulp so I
mentioned earlier that we use gulp to
build stuff we can also use gulp to
serve things so if we type gulp serve
here or actually see it'll do the same
thing we'll do this default compile step
which yet again is happening pretty fast
for me and they'll actually run a web
server so this is the kind of the best
way to run it and test and track
yourself and this serve command as well
we'll also do auto reloading so if I
change something let's say I change this
boat load scene to have some text just
somewhere hello then what you'll see is
this page will automatically reload and
actually what you want even on that
scene but if we load it up you can sort
of see that text now appearing there oh
there we go very subtly in the corner
there's a hello so hopefully you've
learned a little bit about the way you
can build and test Santa tracker even on
your own machine so Santa tracker is a
big complicated single page application
it really has one entry point and then
it loads these individual scenes as we
need them which is super interesting in
itself if you want to learn a little bit
more about that and also build
instructions of how to run and built a
no trucker
there's some links below the article I'm
linking to is an article I wrote last
year which talks about how Santa tracker
was made into a progressive web app and
while of course that's a little bit of a
different topic it actually covers a
little bit of about
and this is important because as a PWA
we care about offline and caching and so
one thing we do that's interesting is
that we only catch scenes users have
been to before and that matches the way
we load scenes only these users need
them rather than loading the whole site
at once so thanks for watching and I'll
see you next time thanks for watching
you can subscribe to the google chrome
developer channel down here we'll check
out some other great videos along here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
