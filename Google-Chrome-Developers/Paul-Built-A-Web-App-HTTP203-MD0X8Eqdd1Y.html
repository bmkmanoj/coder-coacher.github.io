because we are going fishing Oh Jake why
exactly well you say right that fishing
is your passion
no no Carnac fish don't like fish don't
go near fish don't go near anything that
lives in water doesn't work for me let
Spotify this I mean if I show you a
picture of a fish does your head follow
you being near the Sun by okay fair
enough
yeah we all have our things me well I
bought all the stuff now so we're gonna
do it and we're gonna enjoy it you know
what I did recently I built a web app oh
well done mate quite nice to realize
that my skills haven't completely
atrophied you still got it well done
it's a it's an app that lets you record
voice memos and the whole thing I'm
actually going presents the whole thing
is 71 kilobytes ok does it work offline
yes a star that's all I care about
and that is all you actually care about
ha yeah
so so you got this you can record a
voice memo and like save it and all that
kind of stuff it's all working offline
because I'm actually in airplane mode
cos yeah roaming you don't actually
works really well okay and so the web
web is perfect then yeah I think the the
problem we have is that the browser's
themselves they're used to encoding and
decoding stuff right that's the audio
element video elements Web Audio API
yeah WebRTC also encodes to send over
the wire did cut it on the other side
true true right but none of that's
available in JavaScript I mean the
decoder is right i mean that's Web Audio
ya know it doesn't work with our gopis
which does work with the audio elements
so there's a bit of an inconsistent that
that's the must be a chrome bug right I
mean suspect so it's a bug but it's a
feature request more than it's a bug
yeah so because the these encoders are
surely already in there in the browser
for WebRTC right
they can already encode speech and
whatever to send across the wire but
there's no that's just not exposing they
did well sort of if you're in Firefox
you've got the media recorder API which
you can get OGG video
it's opus I think mm-hmm for video and
audio but it's not available in Chrome
or Safari or anywhere else today so the
net result is the only way you can get
their thing to save is to actually
create a WAV file and thankfully there
are some very skilled people who've you
know wrap the whole thing up in
libraries and so on but in any case the
only way you can actually store these
files and have it usable everywhere is a
web file oh that's gonna be that's
bonkers so this is why I think the
stream spec is so important because we
will be able to just pipe like a wave
stream or whatever type into the encoder
and get out like a UN tape array of yeah
it's a encoded data that's part one I
think though the browser shouldn't have
special magical privileges to encode
things if it's encoding things it should
in theory allowed developers to encode
well this is the extensible web right if
that technology is already in the
browser absolutely must be available to
developers the only excuse the say to
not do that is security and there's no
security issue with exposing an encoder
exactly tell all that suicide you know
there were there's Eggman script six
classes in there Fatah Rose promises
indexeddb like there's loads going on in
there
all really good fun to use yeah but for
me the nicest part was I tested on
Firefox and there were a couple of small
issues to face it was pretty minor
probably because they were adhering to
the spec yeah probably
and then somebody out of the blue
contact me and said you know what it
works really nicely on firefox or less
oh and it's a it works on Firefox OS it
works on Chrome and works on desktop and
tablet on phone it works on all these
places so how big is the app all in 71
kilobytes I think a hello world for a
native app you're gonna be hitting near
a megabyte yeah so so this is a thing
71k it works on mobile tablet desktop
Firefox OS like Chrome OS presumably 71k
no that's the benefit the web
you can get bored of this now
I figured then I got fish to catch
nothing
nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
