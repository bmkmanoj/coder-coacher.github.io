summit the Kino has just finished i'm
here with Darin Fisher VP of Chrome so
for anyone who watches your talk after
the live stream what are they going to
learn from your talk I think they're
going to see that we're really committed
to making the web very successful
there's a lot of interest in activity
excitement around progressive web apps
not only are we putting in a lot of new
improvements but you see just a lot of
other partners and developers out there
seeing success at on a large scale with
progressive web apps you see that we
were working on improving core
experiences like add to homescreen and
when you think look at features like
push notifications it's exciting to see
that there's over 50,000 domains
adopting this feature such the web is
really about the long tail the point
here is that you could be really
successful building for the web building
for the mobile web building progressive
web apps and we're really here to help
you there's a lot of great content yeah
and obviously we've got all these things
where we're finding everyone's get
better user engagement and offline
support everyone's benefiting from this
work oh yeah absolutely you mentioned
offline just now I think it's really
great i think it's almost
counterintuitive that you can build such
great experiences that work well even
under poor network conditions a lot of
times you think about the web of course
you need the internet connection to get
your experience in the first place but
the web is really well designed to allow
you to stream down your application it
you know piece at a time and thanks to
new api is like the serviceworker you
can cash that experience and as a
developer you can control how the cash
works and that just gives you a lot of
ability to create a great experience
even in the presence of poor network
connections like 2g networks 3g networks
and so on and that's going to be huge
for the web it's just lay a totally new
way of building web apps so you can
still watch the rest of the live stream
with streaming it to youtube the chrome
developers channel i believe you can
subscribe below otherwise you can check
out all the videos when you post them
after the event and thanks for watching
