they're getting settled and everything
but come on out Darin Fisher VP of
engineering for Chrome and by the way
some of these may or may not be true
probably most of them are true but
parisa Tabriz who her business card
reads security princess which I am most
jealous of by the way I always have been
grace Globa lead of the mobile browsing
team tau Tran my co-presenter from this
morning fellow cocktail aficionado and
head of global part global product
partnerships for the web we are both
looking forward to the nitro cocktail by
this point tile Oppenheim our product
manager on Chrome for Android who makes
sure Chrome and web works well around
the world Matt McNulty who leads the
developer experience team for Chrome has
had to feel complaints about me spilling
coffee on one of his reports already
today Alex komoroske who is one of my
two favorite Alex's and interchangeable
or not but Alex komoroske is the group
program our group product manager for
the web platform team in Chrome and
finally Alex Russell also one of my two
favorite Alex's this one's an engineer
and the chrome team and he and I
actually have shared this enduring
mission in making the web a first-class
platform were super excited about where
we are today we work together longer
than we both been at Google which is
actually saying something because I
think we both feel like we've been at
Google longer than average at the very
least at this point and we first met
when I worked on the Internet Explorer
team and he was working on dojo toolkit
and he kept asking me really pointed
hard questions that but he was always
like you were always so nice about you
know me asking you hard questions and I
was like so were you about asking them
in a nice way give some credit for that
so we are using slide o for the
questions
I won't promise to take all the
questions in order but if you think of
things whatever filed them there we
actually are live moderating them during
the panel and we may pick them up and
ask them so let's go to slide oh and I
like I said I won't promise to take
these in order in fact I actually want
to start with a different question which
is where can I get the Dino sweater that
barraco is wearing and so I kind of want
Marco to answer that question if you
want to knit it by yourself and also I
have I keep one extra one through one of
the chrome engineers so you should talk
to engineers and find out who has one
and be nice to them and get one okay so
you know I have to credit the number of
votes for this question so I think we're
gonna start with does Google see amp as
a long-term solution or a temporary
patch for the web's performance problems
is the goal of fast web regardless of
implementation or is the goal amp anyone
oh you know we don't have the amp team
here to speak to this but I think we can
sort of talk about how we've sort of
we've been working with the amp team a
lot on amp and for sure we share the
goal of making the web work a lot better
especially the mobile web and
performance is absolutely a big part of
the motivation for amp way I look at it
is that it you know the question the
second part of the question there is the
goal of fast web absolutely the goals of
fast web and amp is definitely an
enabler there we've seen people have a
lot of success at building fast
experiences and again I think this point
was made today a couple times at least
that amp is really a built with web
components it's built with web
technologies it's in many ways giving
people a lot of guidance
how to create a really fast experience
but there's nothing that keeps you from
creating a great experience without amp
as well and I think we've seen a lot of
content today and you'll see more
tomorrow that can help you do that yeah
and I want to weigh in here and it's the
long-term solution is a fast web that's
like that's that that's really what the
long-term solution is going to be and
when we talk to a lot of developers and
partners it's really about making sure
that your performance is great making
sure that you know you're taking care of
the overall user experience and if folks
want to use amp if they want to hand
turn you're out there on-site I think
it's really up to to them and I think we
really want to just make sure that we
provide the right set of tools and
features and give developers and
partners a lot of options cool let's go
to the next question why was there not a
PWA summit this year an interesting one
I mean Chris is that you I forget oh no
no I just asked a question I mean I
think really because I am in the
developer relations team this is a
conscious choice that it's not just
about PW A's and like we talked about in
our talk this morning this is really
just the modern web and PWA is our kind
of just a way of capturing that at a
point and the whole focus on install
ability it's super important for users
to have a quick entry but the web is
more than that - and what you need to do
I think is probably more than that I
mean I think of it the same way is the
thing of Ajax back in the day a
responsive web design at a certain at
the beginning it's like oh it's a thing
that means something and over time it
just becomes well duh all right I feel
like we're starting to get to that point
which is really cool to see ok next how
he's taking a second to update
mmm-hmm sorry new tool that we're trying
this year is it a PWA it actually it
ranks really highly in lighthouse but
not a progressive web app yet we are
gonna fix that though so it's fine all
right
missing a manifest or serviceworker not
running on HDI fast manifest we don't
need to debug it ah it's not that hard
to create a manifest I understand this
I'm not gonna create them personally for
every one tried to make it easy for
people you know I I did point out as
moderator before the panel that I don't
actually report in the same orgs these
people can get me fired and someone on
the panel said well not directly so
anyhow that's question um in August
Mozilla and Facebook submitted a
JavaScript binary AST proposal to Ahmed
tc39 reducing J's parse times by
seventeen and ninety percent is the
chrome team interested in supporting a
binary AST so I guess I'll take this one
so we work very closely with the
performance team at Facebook who have
done an incredible job telling us what
we do wrong which has been really
outstanding and helping us find places
to improve binary st is one way to maybe
cut down on the initial parse time of
loading large JavaScript applications
which of course Facebook is one of there
are other ways that we can improve the
loading times for applications and
people use it a lot like putting the
code that they're using frequently
inside the serviceworker cache we've
seen large gains from that already and
we're very excited about being more
aggressive about that the binary binary
AST proposal has a lot of long-term
consequences not all of which we think
we understand entirely and so we're
trying to figure out the right way to
think about improving first time we're
not sure that that's it but we're what
we are interested in improving our
performance in that area but yeah the
serviceworker cache your javascript do
that
sorry these are bouncing around a little
all right well let's ask another fun one
so add to homescreen in progressive web
apps has been great for creating native
like user experiences when can we expect
to have this functionality on desktop
operating systems so I think we actually
had Owen spoke earlier today about this
this is something that actually you can
do you've been able to do it for a while
you can it's kind of buried but you can
add an icon to a site on your homescreen
around your desktop I guess it's called
a desktop and to be honest it's one of
the things it's cool about PWA is that
in general if you built these things in
a responsive way they just kind of work
on desktop but it's not as clear about
like what exactly the user mental model
should be in that context on mobile it's
just it launches fullscreen it just sort
of takes over the whole app but as
announced earlier today in one of the
talks this is an area that we're
actively investing in and we're hoping
to bring something that will target the
space next n months enough look for it
in chrome flags yeah so what would you
recommend using nowadays use sorry would
you recommend nowadays using es6
directly or transpiling the es5 who are
your users I mean if you've got an
entirely es6 compatible user base please
by all means it'll save you by it's on
the wire it'll save you a lot of hassle
especially if you're using web
components because custom elements v1
does integrate with the native class
syntax and it's difficult to do that
otherwise um otherwise you know
transpile look at your user base in 2013
the chrome team forked WebKit to build
the blink engine chrome now has a ton of
nifty features not available in Safari
but developers hesitate to adopt those
features because they don't work in
Safari how would today is web developers
be better and worse off without the
blink fork wow that's a really
interesting one huh I really haven't
thought I guess about the counterfactual
what would have happened I want to hear
better and worse by the way because I
think I can think of both stickler sure
you oh one thing I will say is I'm
I'm very proud of the way the blink
community has sort of evolved over the
years we had our most recent blink on in
Tokyo just a few weeks ago and it was
huge we had ton of people there we were
maxing out the space and so it's been
really cool to see lots of other
companies come in and participate and
build off of chromium and participate in
blink as well I think ultimately we have
goals of really pushing the web as far
as we can and as quickly as we can and
working with other browser vendors and
specification bodies to decide how did
it build these things and has allowed us
I think to move differently than maybe
if it would have been had we still been
sharing a codebase per se but I'm not
sure I don't know I mean one of the
things you get out of competition is
competition that's something that we
value heavily and one of the things
that's difficult about sharing an
open-source code base is that in order
to get code landed everyone has to agree
through a single governance system what
should land having separate code bases
let's us take a different view of what's
most important and we compete on
different axes and it's easier for us to
compete with the safari team in a more
full-on way which benefits everyone so
when we may benefit when we may go
deliver features that improve
performance in one aspect they'll work
on features that improve performance in
another and then we have to go figure
out which is most important and that
that is a great outcome I think um one
extra good oh sorry let me say that what
you know one of the things that you
might think is worse is that you might
think that because there's - that
there's gonna be more incompatibilities
between the two well you know one of the
things that informed our decision to
fork in the first place was that we
realized we were actually already forked
we if def the heck out of WebKit and we
were shipping features that Apple didn't
feel comfortable shipping yet because
this very idea that we actually wanted
to like really push and try to bring
some nifty features to developers we
already were shipping things they
weren't shipping and so it's kind of
like we recognize what reality was and
we realized we should just optimize for
that reality and so that that's really
where we were at that point in time we
thought yes we should just fork one
thing that I think is worse is we talked
a lot at these kinds of events about the
big flashy new features that you can use
the developers but in your day to day
lives a lot of it is
ran little edge cases work differently
in different browsers and when we used
to be part of one codebase
one change there were work make the
behave that behavior of the sort of edge
case is similar across the different
browsers and so actually we invest quite
a bit in this we don't just invest in
the cool flashy features that we can
talk about on stage here we also have a
bunch of folks we call this a
predictability effort that focus on the
cross browser testing through web pop
web platform tests and we also have
folks that land changes to other open
source rendering engines to help fix
some of those low-level like those
issues would cause of all annoyance
day-to-day and that's one thing that
requires active effort now that didn't
Beck wouldn't have if we hadn't gone our
separate ways I think on the same vein
there's a question about if there's an
interest in having team several teams of
very smart people who work on several
rendering engines at the same time like
should we just cross pollinate between
those browsers or should we just build
one single browser that everyone ends up
using Onegin from should we have one
JavaScript engine right I mean as a
formal web developer I can say with
confidence that hellas other browsers
right like it's very much the case that
your favorite browser is your favorite
browser and compatibility with anything
else sucks right it's just always gonna
be hard to get that and that's one of
the unfortunate aspects of competition
but the benefit is that it means that
there isn't a monoculture if one browser
engine starts to get stagnant and they
don't continue to leave then it's
possible for someone else to come in and
do a better job and that's a huge and
valuable thing that we've seen play out
multiple times as long as I've been
working on the web Chris you might have
some insight into that no comment but in
seriousness I mean I have actually a
sociological background and a lot of
times we we missed this but this is one
of the few examples where you have
competitors who are also sort of
cooperating they're working together on
standards your shipping things are
mostly interoperable and they can
compete on which features to offer and
how to implement them
and that kind of competition while still
being interoperable is pretty special
about the web and I think it's pretty
fundamental I also want to add one point
is like a with multiple kind of vendors
working on it it's increasing diversity
different the like a group different
people having different opinions what is
the more important versus a single voice
and some of the work going on in in
gekko right now is really interesting a
lot of really interesting approaches and
lay out that it's just great to see
different engines in different aspects
so sorry I just lost a question so I
think there's a lot of questions that
sort of center around this topic of
Google seems to have somewhat of an
identity crisis on the one hand there's
a large push for progressive web apps in
emerging markets and on the other hand
there's things like instant apps why
does Google continue to march forward
with Android rather than doubling down
when the core business is an arrant lis
web-based and I'm totally anybody here
from the Android team I think you can
transition from just the point of
competition to some extent and
recognizing there's different needs and
and developers want different things and
that's actually not necessarily a bad
thing and you don't you know want to say
like this is the only way and we're only
gonna gonna do this I think I sympathize
with the point of hearing kind of a lot
of different options for how to create
content and that maybe not having like a
holistic narrative but I also think that
one of Google's strengths is actually
not just sticking to one thing and like
continuing to invest in and you know
what what makes sense for this
environment and seeding like new ideas I
think you know meeting developers where
they are I know how you've talked a lot
about this when you reach out to
developers you know yeah I was I was
gonna say as well the question itself
somewhat answered parts of it it
highlighted that no progressive web apps
do resonate particularly well in various
countries that have different
constraints and so the reality is is
that different technologies can work
better depending on who your users are
and who you're targeting and whether
you're really aiming to have a lot of
users from a lot of different areas or
if you're really focused in on one
particular set of users and how do you
best match
and so some technologies of progressive
web apps work really well for those and
other aspects that Android and native
provides works better father use cases
obviously we're gonna we're gonna
trumpet awesome benefits of progressive
web apps but I also think it's it's not
a bad thing for like the world to have
options yeah and I mean the users
experience is surrounded by stuff too
right like Chrome OS I've always thought
was awesome because it's really just the
web but it does have a user experience
and users get used to those consistent
ways of interacting with their system
and they're different when you change
different devices so I'm gonna have to
go with my friend Jason Greg's B's
question of why does Google highlight
amp in search results instead of
progressive web apps when will Google
search have ambient managing for PDA or
for PW and keeping in mind cuz I'm gonna
channel Darren he's sitting right next
to me
the search team isn't here so we can say
anything yes we can say anything
whatever you say I think they have to do
right right I think if you get more that
if you get 76 votes then we must legally
do it I think is what happens right 75
I'm gonna watch that no I'm pretty sure
parisa's pillow is a hoax person for the
search team right you know you don't
want a panel of co-managers to be
answering this question because we have
no idea but if you think about it so
when we talk about progressive of us we
talk about you know building
best-in-class building really great
mobile web experiences right and what is
search really great at doing is helping
you find great web experiences and so
search already points you to PWA sorry
points YouTube websites so you know and
search is very motivated to help find
help you find the best sites right and
we're motivated to help you build the
best sites so it's not like there's a
lot of alignment there and and we talked
about pwace we're not so much saying
it's a different thing it's it's it's
the mobile web it's mobile web sites
built well and that's what we're here to
try to help you accomplish okay so on a
similar
they know what's up with Google
launching so many chrome only sites
what's up with that what's up we
shouldn't be doing that are we doing
there's one last week I saw that was
bouncing around on Twitter that we
actually every time we see one of these
we dive in like oh let me chase down the
CL internally that led to it reach out
to the teams try to catch them
beforehand obviously I think this one
was actually a it was a someone using a
very old version of Firefox or was
Firefox on Linux which was incorrectly
blacklisted and ultimately we try to
make the case for a lot of the other
teams very large company about the
benefits of progressive enhancement
where possible allowing develop or users
to access the sites even if they aren't
fully sure its tested but even I'm there
yeah it's to be clear we I mean everyone
appear on this the stage generally
really really dislikes it when a Google
property does this so we're some of the
people that actually object the most -
yeah in fact the whole concept around
progressive enhancement is really
twofold one is you know there's a path
forward for a developer to create an
experience that can brace new features
when it's available and that allows them
to create an experiment with new API s
and create experiences that are better
for that set of users who happen to have
the browser with those features but it
also tells developers of the other
browsers that haven't implemented those
features that that's actually a feature
worth building because like developers
want to use it so it's all really works
well when when you kind of go down that
progressive enhancement path and you
know in general you know when it's
possible to do that that's that's where
I think with Google that's mostly where
the focus is I think there's been just a
few incidents recently where people have
that motivate discussion and like we
were saying the last one was actually
kind of a bug because it anyways should
probably stop talking but there are ways
to do this better than not so for
instance you could give users a link to
let them continue to try it anyway there
are ways to communicate that you're
expanding your browser support in the
future there ways to you know say hey
here's why um and those are things that
were advocating for internally so come
to us you know we'll advocate to the
other teams on your behalf that's
something that's a service we provide
absolutely and I will say I don't think
the chrome team has ever made any
only web services at least let's not
open a can yeah
but definitely treat the chrome cream is
your your helpers on this there's a lot
of discussion around offline
capabilities I actually chose this
question because this is one that I've
thought about too you know that's great
to have offline capabilities but how
much storage can a web page really
respectfully expect to have locally like
there's likely an expectation from the
user that you're not going to take a
huge amount of space store a bunch of
stuff on their phone how does this work
when you have media apps like the ones
we are talking about this morning so
we've changed this a lot recently for
the better
yeah well it depends on who you are we
think that because it's not a the
contractor we give web developers isn't
the same as a native app that's right a
native app gets as much storage as is
available on the disk without a lot of
limits up until the OS is your cutoff we
are the ones cutting sites off so we
imposed Hydra limits historically
they've been very very low I think the
number that's still kicking around and
some people's mine is 15 megabytes or 5
megabytes those are those are
pathologically low limits if you're
trying to build anything serious and so
instead we've shifted our implementation
to look at the amount of total free
space on the on the device and we've
expanded the amount that chrome is
allowed to take quite a lot because you
might be using Chrome as the primary
reason that you're on the device so it's
sort of comical that we would only take
15 percent of the total space we've
fixed that so now you'll see quite a bit
more space available if you use the
quota API is to interrogate it but we
also are trying to ensure that the sites
that you engage most heavily with are
the things that are kept or the things
that you have more storage space
allocated for so think of it like a big
pool and we'll throw the things out that
you don't use frequently so if your site
engagement score is high you're much
less likely to get evicted but the
amount of space that site gets is now
largely unlimited it's and this is one
of the places where the web as an
amazing ephemeral model where users
don't have to be afraid to tap any link
to go somewhere and that's huge it's
foundational but means that some of
these questions are very different like
when does it user expect to have more
storage saved and so there's things like
if the person user is added to
homescreen
we're more likely to save allow that
thing to save more content because the
user would likely expect that thing to
be able to save more things offline it
ultimately is about giving the developer
ability to understand what's going on
and and have very control over it cool
so now for another fun one fun as in
quotes here in case you're wondering why
aren't progressive web apps installable
from Google Play what's your definition
of fun I have a very twisted sense of
fun yeah I think there's a lot a lot to
this question right and so you can sort
of break it down into a couple different
axes like one thing is that it there
already are right you can put a website
in a web view and so I think the
question is probably asking something
different and so we announced a trusted
web activity today which allows you to
actually launch an activity of a
component of your application that is
powered by Chrome and what the role and
I think it was it was explained that the
reason for doing that is that you can
actually share the cookie sir cookie
cookie jar with chrome and take
advantage of Chrome's ability to help
you fill out help you just fill out
forms and so on those kinds of things
are in stark contrast to the experience
you get when you just wrap a website
with a webview as users have to go
through the you login steps and all that
kind of stuff or you have to go and do a
lot of work to plumb all that in to the
webpage so what were what we're doing
with trusted web activities is making
that work better and so we sort of see
that it's important that the developer
is using is is they're in control of the
thing that they are ultimately uploading
to the store so they generated it became
we're giving them tools that allow them
to leverage the web and particularly
their investments in pwace to help them
build a great application that a user
would find through the Play Store cool
so one final question I think and this
one I actually want each of you to
answer
so at chrome dev summit 20 27 on the
leadership panel when asked what you're
most proud of
with chrome in the last 10 years what do
you think your answer will be what do
you think the best thing that we're
gonna do in the next 10 years will be
I'm gonna start over there actually
because he's the most likely to get me
fired the thing of the thing I would be
most proud of is the way the investments
were making now have enabled the web to
survive the next form-factor change we
didn't necessarily predict mobile we
didn't we saw it coming from do some
distance off but we've now I think
started to respond adequately with
progressive web apps as a way to help
the web survive in mobile and thrive and
make a great product market fit with
users and merging markets and I think if
we do our jobs right we will have done
that for whatever the next form factor
is to I think a lot of it is
understanding the value of this
competition between rendering engines
and allowing that as sort of an engine
underlying this thing I think it's much
easier as someone was saying in here of
like waiking everyone is working the
same rendering engine together and I
think that one things I'm most proud of
is that we understand and can help
harness that competition in a way that's
really helpful and healthy for the
ecosystem long term you know having
started in a very different browser
environment during the browser Wars
b14 even before that I have to say we've
come a long way already and I agree
though I think we're will do even better
in the future
I think I'd like to be proud of that we
kept the user first that we were like a
particularly noble and good steward for
the user and yeah and kept universe yes
building off of that for me it would be
all users and not just the ones that
look like us or have the background that
we've had with the internet with
browsers etc and so making sure that it
really is for everyone so I'm gonna
expand chrome just a little bit for just
thing about the web and so it would be
amazing if we look back 10 years and I'm
able to you know publish content or sell
a pair of shoes and all I have to do is
build once and it works everywhere and I
don't have to worry about so many
different form factors
and that it will be accommodating across
whatever comes next so for me as because
I'm leading the Chrome mobile so looking
at a chrome from desktop to mobile and
about moving forward another 10 years I
imagine there's going to be another new
platform so I want to see chrome
continuum from desktop to mobile to this
new platform and always there yep yeah
I'm pretty excited about the
cross-platform Chrome story and making
that just easy access content across but
sincerity said that can't just say me
too
okay me too but also or and also yes all
right no you have to go in yeah so yeah
HTTPS was what I was gonna Hey and
because Darin took that I also afford to
a more secure and auditable PKI because
that's actually one of the dependencies
of secure HTTPS and I think we've made a
ton of progress the past couple of years
to make it easier and cheaper and and
more affordable but spending some time
on on having confidence in that piece of
it and and other cool security
primitives that are coming to the web
platform that I think we've learned a
lot in native application software
development with sandboxing and and
other defense and depths that it's cool
to see these coming from a platform and
seeing those adopted so yeah 2027 so
that means I would have if I was gonna
be yeah okay that if I was up here at
that time talking about it that would
have been 21 years working on Chrome and
I would just be damn proud of the team
that got us there and I would know that
we did something awesome even more else
all right I think that's all the time we
have so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
