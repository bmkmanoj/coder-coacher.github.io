welcome back to the alley cash show
today I want to talk about headings and
landmarks the importance that they play
in accessible navigation so headings as
you're familiar with you know whenever
you're looking at a webpage what a
sighted user is often going to do is
they're going to kind of scan the
document looking for areas of like
larger text or bold text to figure out
what kind of the important content is
sort of like the the quintessential
example is a newspaper right where
you've got the big headline that tells
you the really important story and
you've got smaller subheadings just tell
you kind of like the less important
parts of the page and so in general
headings help you form kind of like an
outline or a skeleton for a document now
for a screen reader user though they
don't get those same visual affordances
we can still convey that outline or that
structure to those users by using the
correct semantic elements so in
particular using the h1 through the h6
tags and so let me show you an example
of kind of like a before and after
experience when we do a good job using
headings so this is a little site that
I've put together it's kind of like a
like a little lifestyle consumerism site
type thing and what I want to do first
is just go through this with a screen
reader and this version does not really
have any headings whatsoever even though
I've styled things to look like I've got
some big sort of heading sections I turn
on my screen reader window
lifestyle the web content has keyboard
focus and if I open my my rotor so in
voiceover there's a little sort of menu
we can open to find all the headings and
lame are some things like that links
menu foreign controls menu items in
point we don't spot some links menu okay
I can see that they said there's no
headings whatsoever so that means the
only real way that I can navigate
through this document or the primary way
that I'm going to navigate to this
document is just kind of like go line by
line is it link lifestyle link to items
and Karka days posts food rank vintage a
pile of sit repeat fresh everyday lorem
ipsum dollar the problem is there's
nothing really telling me the hierarchy
here so you know I can't really tell if
a piece of Texas is big and important if
it's defining a section for me it all
just sort of seems like it's at the same
level of importance in the document so
it's kind of hard to tell or to
interpret what it's trying to convey to
me now let's look at the same version
but this time using proper h1 through h6
tags lifestyle web content so I'll open
the headings menu for starts links menu
heading menu alright and I can see there
is a bunch of different heading levels
inside of here so adding a little wine
lifestyle level one tells me boom this
is the page that you're on level 2 is
going to tell me the major sections
heading level click today's post there's
also no one down here called hot little
two topic right so now I can jump in
level two she helped a few different
sections of the site and then within
each of these the articles have h3
headings and in voiceover I can actually
navigate by headings event so I can say
ctrl alt command heading level 3 lovely
landscape heading level 3 inspiring
minimal workplaces right so I've
actually increased the efficiency of the
user navigation experience using a
screen reader and in fact if you look at
some screen reader surveys for the ask
folks who use assistive technology like
what's kind of your primary way of
navigating an unfamiliar page a lot of
folks say the first thing they do is
they try and navigate by heading so that
way we're helping them kind of skip any
repetitive or poorly play content and
get right to the important sections of
the page and start to form that
structure in their mind of what the
document looks like I should also
mention that with headings there's kind
of like an order that we want to follow
right so starting with h1 and working
our way down of h2 h3 h4 and so on what
I see a lot of developers do is they
will skip levels because headings have a
little bit of default styling so someone
might say oh well I've got a smaller
heading here in my design so I'll just
skip h2 and h3 and go right to h4 and
generally you don't want to do that in
general what you want to do is you want
to use the heading levels in order in
sequential order right so if you have
something that is secondary content use
an h2 for it and then use CSS to style
it down to whatever size your your
design calls for another interesting
technique that you can do with headings
which what I've actually done on this
site is sometimes you have areas where
the design does not call for a heading
like we have kind of this main content
area and then we've got this hot list
area the hottest area has a heading
right the main content area doesn't but
we've kind of indicated to the user that
it's really important by make
like big and central and so one thing we
can do is we can actually take a heading
and we can just position it off-screen
using CSS so that way our screen reader
user is still going to get that content
they're still going to get that
affordance conveyed to them that this is
an important section but that way it
doesn't have to be in our design if the
design doesn't call for it so for
instance if I go up here and I start
again at lifestyle choice over off boys
over on Chrome lifestyle winter
lifestyle
this is heading level to today's host so
you can see that even though there's not
a heading on screen that so today's post
up kind of like snuck one in there so
that way the navigate experience is a
lot more efficient now the other side to
this beyond just heading some settings
are good for performing the kind of a
skeleton of your page you can also
define major regions of the page using
landmark elements or landmark Aria roles
alright so I'll show you the section
over here in the w3c docs on landmarks
so there's a few html5 elements like a
side and footer and header and main and
nav that I think a lot of developers are
familiar with but don't always use that
frequently because they don't give you
any default styling so a lot of times
people just use dibs for everything and
then I apply CSS to them well one of the
cool things that you get from using
these landmark elements is that they
have these kind of semantic rules built
into them and users can use them to
navigate the page more effectively so
here is that same site this time I've
also added landmark elements so my main
content here is inside of a main tag
instead of just a div mine I here where
it says lifestyle and has little
shopping carts instead of a nav element
my sidebar is inside of and a side
element so now when I turn on my screen
reader voice over on Chrome lifestyle
window headings on you I can open the
rotor I've always a form control panel
items landmarks menu go to the landmark
section that explained complimentary
heading level two Hot List boom I've
gone heading level two right over to my
sidebar right onto that h2 and now I've
skipped everything else on the page that
I wasn't interested in that I didn't
want to navigate to and I know because
maybe I'm familiar with the document
that you know over in that sidebar is
the Hot List or whatever and that's what
I want to see right I want to see the
the current articles that are trending
whatnot so using proper headings and
using landmark elements you can really
really increase the efficiency of the
user navigation on your page so if
you're working on that site right now go
through look at your heading level make
sure it makes sense and forms a proper
skeleton and then look for places where
you can add landmark elements to kind of
region the page up a bit better that
about covers it for today so if you have
any questions for me you can always
leave them down below in the comments or
hit me up on a social network of your
choosing
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next if you want to
learn more about navigating hitting some
landmarks using screenreaders we get a
couple videos over in our playlist that
you can check out give them a look again
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
