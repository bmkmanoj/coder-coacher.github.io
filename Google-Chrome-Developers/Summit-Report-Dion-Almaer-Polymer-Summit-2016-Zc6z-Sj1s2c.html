the Dion almer we are here at the video
village this is where the the live
stream and all the videos from Palmer
summit are being cut and hosted up on
our youtube page at chrome developers
Dion here you just finished giving a
keynote to open day to a polymer summit
and you were talking about progressive
web apps and some of the pain points
that folks might find is they're trying
to build those experiences so for folks
who maybe haven't seen your talk yet can
you just maybe like highlight some of
those issues that developers might face
absolutely so yeah it's been really fun
being back in London with the whole crew
and there's really great to kind of kick
off day too yesterday was was really
exciting just lay all the fantastic
content and the like and you're really
going to chat with you know different
developers and the after party was
pretty fun too it was and I I kind of
felt like and I talked about this at the
beginning I kind of need it cuz now and
then I get a little bit frustrated both
with the world and what's going on right
now both you know where I grew up and
where I now live in the US and I feel
like web developers can be a little bit
frustrated with you know the paradox of
choice things are evolving so quickly
and so it can kind of feel a little bit
overwhelming but if you step back a
little bit you kind of see the macro
picture you know in the world is
actually a better time to live as a
human than it ever has been less poverty
all that kind of good stuff and as a
developer you know the web's kind of
back now with progressive web apps we're
able to really deliver mobile native
applications so talked a little bit
about that and just the real kind of
call to action is that I've kind of
heard throughout the conference to is
just about the fact that we know we need
to deliver these amazing user
experiences but how the hell do we do
that on the web in these constrained
environments where you want to get
something loaded on any tap in three
seconds on 3g how do you actually do
that and I feel like we're just now
getting to this step you know talk a bit
about how it feels like I'm Doctor Who
or the ecosystem is dr. regenerating and
kind of going from the desktop app world
to the mobile app world and
first the browsers had to like fix
themselves on mobile and now it's kind
of like the framework some web
developers that need to kind of change
the way that we do things and then all
of this kind of kicked into the fact
that you know right after me you had
this fantastic you know doll about all
of the tooling changes that happen in in
polymer and so I feel like that's a
vital part of this because the
capabilities are kind of their we're
kind of working out how to do it but
without the tooling it's incredibly
painful to actually produce that yeah
and so a Nancy mentioned a bit of a
polymer and the need for some better
tooling but how do you think something
like polymer makes it easier for
developers or improves ergonomics when
it comes to building something like a
progressive web app so I feel like with
especially with polymer too and all of
the new stuff it's thinned itself out
like a lot of the popular frameworks at
the moment were actually built for a
desktop world and I feel like they're
all kind of evolving themselves to be as
streamlined as possible both for a small
download but then that should be allowed
to evaluate and run on these devices I
feel like polymers squarely there and
then yeah I oh we got to hear about
purple and that whole world and now with
the tooling that we just talked about it
can actually be practical for developers
to kind of feel like they can work
nicely with a simple abstraction and
just like here are the different
elements and here's how I want to
structure things and the tools can take
that and bundle it all correctly so when
you go in and do a first load on
something the polymer app is going to
just send what's necessary but as a
developer I don't have to spend all of
my time doing all this crazy hacks to
make it actually work yeah and so you
mentioned devices there too and so I'm
curious if there's one thing that you
could have developers go you know one
thing you'd have developers go do and
learn more about when it comes to
building progressive web apps like what
would that be and how could they learn
more about some of these devices and how
to build for them so Alex Russell was
actually about to give a talk later on
so check out the live stream and then
the video afterwards because he's going
to hammer this point home I have a have
a feeling unlike really testing on
device going through the constraints
it's really easy as a developer to sit
there in chrome and feel like you're in
devtools and you're emulating mobile and
that that's what it's like right and
it's totally not the
at all and so I feel like we're still
working on this a little bit but like
really given you what are the actual
constraints you know for this new world
you know kind of in general and then to
the next level when you think about MBU
and the like yeah cool awesome so
definitely if you're if you're counting
down stock yet go catch that will be
putting it up on the YouTube channel
very soon and be sure to catch Alex
Russell's talk where he's gonna be
covering mobile devices and really what
developers need to know for for building
for their sort of like under powered
devices especially for next billion
users Dion thank you so much for being
with us today thank you all so much for
watching stay with us we're gonna keep
doing reports live from polymer suleman
2016 and i'm rob again Dionne thank you
so much stay with us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
