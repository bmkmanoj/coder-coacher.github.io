will solve common web problems with
standards these techniques are part of
the web platform and work with any
framework for library alright let's go
are you still creating a 5 icon echo
file that one from the 90s you can
safely stop it now today especially on
mobile you can make your site stand out
with you know colors and hi rose shiny
32-bit color icons you can specify these
modern icons in what we call a web app
manifest or bio link rel tag or use the
manifest plus a polyfill that generates
the old icon style and if you want your
site to be added to a mobile phone's
home screen make sure you give a
high-res icon something at least 20 56
pixels wide the web app manifest can
also improve your site if it's been
added to a home screen it can undo
things like choosing a background color
to show before your site is fully loaded
which is pretty cool one trick I love is
you can actually change icons at runtime
- this is actually most useful on
desktop you know you've probably seen
apps like calendars where they'll show
you the current date the rules around
which icon will be shown are actually a
bit tricky between browsers so if you
want to show a custom image you're best
off just clearing all the icons and
adding just one new dynamic one at
runtime there's at least 64 pixels wide
another cool thing for your android
client is the ability to give the top UI
a unique color this will make your site
feel part of a system my tip just take
the color of your site's header bar and
specify this in a meta theme color tag
remember use the web app manifest
specify a high-res icon from mobile and
use a theme color this was seaming the
standard way see you on the next tip
where's my warm up
is that
