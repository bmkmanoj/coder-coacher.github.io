think there are a few minor issues
notwithstanding but actually the
majority of this site is now built at
least from a static point of view so I
thought what I do is just show you
around
very briefly and so you can see what's
what's going on really
so homepage I think this was pretty much
done last I showed you but the location
wasn't and that now is has all the
information in there that's good code of
conduct that was also done but the
schedule was not done and within that
you've got um let me show you like when
you scale it down you know basically I'd
lose the the images that was less
important so one of the as it's the
images the images of the speakers that
moves me here actually one of the things
I need to do is just do a kind of
rollover state for these so you know
which one you're actually going to click
into so I have built sort of two states
I think is the way to call it so there's
the the pre talk where we just are going
to give you some information about the
session and again there's a little bit
more to it like for example there's no
back button in there and I need to
decide what I'm gonna do with the
masthead area I might just have the
picture of the the speaker or something
like that or I might move the title in
there it really depends on how I'm
feeling I'm actually what the the titles
I so I have no idea what the sessions
are going to be called yet so I've tried
to be fairly agnostic about that however
after you've after the talk has gone
live then we need to be able to embed
the talk so we've kind of got this which
is kind of borrowed I suppose from the
the live page which I'll show you in a
moment so you've got basically the video
that we that the picture of the speaker
the title the name and job title and
then a bit of a description about what
the actual talk is so that's that's all
fine and dandy basically we are pretty
much ready to go
if I show you this so we have this is
live flag in the Pythian and now we'll
probably on the on the day itself or the
days themselves I will switch this flag
from false to true and I might even make
it date specific I might not I'm not
quite sure exactly how I'm gonna do it
just yet but anyway I'll set it to true
right now and that basically adds this
extra banner to the top of the pages
which don't have a video because if
they've already got a video then I don't
really want to like if you go into the
livestream page then we don't know it's
me on screen talking about building this
site so it's hang on that's me on this
site looking at a video of me talking
about this site or so meta wonderfully
meta good so what was I saying what was
I saying
mm-hm oh yeah if you've got the video
playing we don't want to have that watch
livestream because you're already
watching the livestream so that's just a
kind of a minor thing and it's got this
little live now up next and and then
things that are coming up the rest of
the day so my next step with all this
now that this is all fully working is to
is to make it kind of a little bit more
exciting and dynamic I suppose because
we got a solid basis you could sort of
you could deploy this site and there
will be nothing wrong with that this is
a perfectly functioning site so anything
I add on now which will be to do a
proper Service Worker - I'm going to try
and do some transitions between sections
and kind of dynamically load in content
rather than like a full page refresh I'm
hoping to kind of fade content in and
out and move things around all that kind
of stuff is a progress in an enhancement
move by me so I don't have to do any of
it but it's worth doing I think okay so
there wasn't much code to show you today
I just wanted to kind of check in just
show you that we've got to a point now
where we
could deploy this site we could call
this one done but we're gonna take
further on we're gonna I'm gonna try and
make some more exciting maneuvers in and
we'll see how it all pans out thank you
so much for coming on on this journey
with me I am loving every minute of
airing all this stuff with you thank you
to everybody who's commenting who's
subscribing and checking out the code on
github as well let's make it
progressively enhanced and better er and
awesomer yes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
