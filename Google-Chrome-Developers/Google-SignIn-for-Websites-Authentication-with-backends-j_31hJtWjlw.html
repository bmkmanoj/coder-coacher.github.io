we've looked at authentication using
Google sign-in in this video let's learn
how to integrate with the backend this
will allow you to keep sessions and
store user data in a database on the
server when I wasn't caring with
backends you deal with something called
ID token it contains the issuer of this
token which app this is for an
expression date and so on you can verify
the user's identity and its integrity by
examining the ID tokens content let's
get started
you can obtain an ID token upon the
successful authentication and then send
it over to the server using a secure
HTTPS connection on the server side the
retrieved ID token will look pretty
cryptic but don't worry you can decode
verify and extract this information
without a network call by using the
Google provided client libraries like
this note that the client libraries
verify most of the information but you
still have to check if AUD which
indicates audience matches your client
ID and ISS which indicates issuer
matches either of following strings now
you can retrieve the users profile
information to be used in your app this
ID token includes the same profile
information you can get using the
JavaScript library on the client a quick
tip to remember is that if the users
email address is already verified by
Google you don't have to verify it again
in your app once the ID token is
verified use su B which indicates
subject as a user ID to store
information remember don't use the email
address as a primary key for users as it
might change in the future
okay now you are ready to integrate
Google sign-in with back-end in the next
video
I will talk about how to authorize and
access Google APs
sucks for stopping by station</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
