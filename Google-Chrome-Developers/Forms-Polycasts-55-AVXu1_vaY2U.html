edition of them me Annika show I thought
I should steal the camera from Rob for a
little bit so I can tell you about forms
that's the thing that I'm excited about
forms are really awesome because you get
to send data that a user types into a
server without doing any work or writing
any javascript and that's great but if
you've noticed forums don't really work
with custom elements that you may have
been writing because forums only care
about the native input element so in
polymer we try to fix that by making
something called an iron form iron firm
is really great if you get to control
the custom element that you're writing
because you need to do a little bit of
work so that it actually talks to an
iron form so what I want to do today is
show you how you can get a native form
to actually care about your custom
element with just doing one little trick
and that is to basically copy the value
into a hidden input element so that the
form actually sees it come to my
computer here okay
so the first thing I'm gonna do is
create a form and you'll notice here
that I'm using something called HTTP bin
HTTP man is an awesome service that
basically lets you send a request to it
and it responds with the thing that you
sent this is really awesome because I
don't really want to write a server to
make this demo nobody does
so whatever I send to HTTP Ben is gonna
tell me you know the arguments and the
header isn't the stuff they're great so
I've created a form and I have some like
form Styles here included so that it
actually looks pretty and not terrible
so you're impressed with my mad CSS
skills and in this form I'm gonna put
something called a birthday input the
thing that I'm gonna demo is basically a
custom element that gets your birthday
so that I can send you cake when it's
actually your birthday it's gonna be
amazing for everyone so put an input
over here I'm gonna put a button it's
got a class so it's pretty and if you go
over here to my demo and i refresh my
page i have a form it has a button very
exciting so that's actually implement
this custom element it's a birthday
input so it's gonna have a label to tell
you what this input does and then I'm
gonna put a date input that's really
just two tech skills together and one of
them's a month and one of them's a date
so if i refresh my form here I should
also import it so I'm gonna go ahead and
include my element in the demo and then
when i refresh it BAM there is an input
the thing is I didn't tell the form to
care about it so if I actually try to
submit a
in here HDPE doesn't see it I didn't
send any arguments with that form and
that makes sense we doesn't do any of
the magic so let's go ahead and do it so
the first thing I want to do is actually
you know assemble this birthday somehow
so I'm going to create a property called
birthday on my input which is just a
string I'm gonna get it from the thing
that you type so I'm going to add an
event listener for input so that every
time you type something in one of these
fields I get an event in this event
listener what I'm gonna do is just take
the two values and smash them together
with with a slash and they're gonna go
into this property called birthday cool
so that's still not gonna work because I
still didn't tell the forum how to use
it so let's do this I'm gonna have my
input element and it has the birthday
and I'm gonna bind it to a variable so
that I can actually pass this variable
to one of my hidden inputs I'm gonna
create this hidden element it's an input
it's hidden so that means it doesn't
show up in your form our form looks
exactly the same
and I'm gonna give it a name unless your
input has a name the form doesn't care
about it either
and then its value is gonna be the value
from the birthday input element oh
that's cool I've wired them up together
and for this to actually work in our
demo you got to put them inside a dumb
bind sweet although this should work
let's go and refresh our demo it looks
exactly the same I'm gonna put in my
birthday this is actually my birthday
please send me presents I will
appreciate them greatly and now when I
submit look at this we've sent something
to http Ben it confirms I've sent it a
birthday everything is working as
expected
amazing and that's how you trigger a
forum to care about your custom element
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you next time you have any questions put
them in the in the comments below or you
can find me on twitter i'm at not
