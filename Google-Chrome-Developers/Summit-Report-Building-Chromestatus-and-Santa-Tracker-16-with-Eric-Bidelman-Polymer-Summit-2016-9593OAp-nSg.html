been a long day so far Eric you just did
a talk on building chrome status and
turning it into a pwa for the folks at
home who like don't know anything about
chrome status or maybe in pw is can you
talk a little bit about some of the
stuff that you covered yeah so chrome
status is like the official dashboard of
the chrome team and so as a developer
you can go and you can learn about the
new features that chrome is implementing
or is thinking about implementing and
kind of learn and featured option c
metrics these samples kind of a one-stop
shop for for stuff stuff yeah cool now
where were some of the what were some of
the things that you hit as you were you
are sort of PW aying that site where
some of the outcomes of that process
yeah I mean so a lot of it was like
figuring out how to make web components
fast doing things like lazy loading and
working that into chrome status
serviceworker obviously was a was a huge
focus for us and making that work
offline using some of the libraries that
the Deverell team is produced and so
yeah just making a fast taking advantage
of server push and preload and like all
that new cool stuff yeah all the new
