welcome back to the chrome dev summit we
are here at the SF jazz center i'm
joined by emily's stark emily you just
gave a presentation on https on the web
and some of the changes that are coming
to chrome around that so for folks who
haven't caught the talk yet you just
tell them a little bit about some of the
new things that are coming in in chrome
for security and HTTPS sure so in chrome
56 which is going to stable in January
we're launching a new UI treatment for
insecure HTTP pages and this is
specifically for insecure HTTP pages
that have passwords or credit card
fields for those pages what we're going
to do is show in the omnibox a label
that says not secure and our hope is
that users will learn from this that
they're in a particularly sensitive
situation where there including where
they're sending their passwords or
credit cards and we want them to know
that they're not doing that over a
secure connection so uh you know why not
just go full-blown like scary warning
and be like yo this is like a evil
website or whatever why not why not take
a maybe a stricter or stronger approach
when doing this kind of thing so we
definitely want to do that eventually
eventually we plan to show a very
prominent real warning about the risks
of HTTP but we still need developers
help to adopt HTTPS we're not all the
way there yet we don't have HTTPS
Everywhere and in fact there are quite a
few sites still using insecure HTTP so
we think that if we were to just turn on
this really scary aggressive warning
right away tomorrow we would end up
scaring some users confusing them or
they might just learn to tune it out and
all of those are bad outcomes for us
okay and so and that makes a lot of
sense um I'm personally not a security
expert I'm imagining there's a few folks
out there watching who are also not
security experts so for developers who
know this this is important but aren't
quite sure like way to get started like
what are what are some resources that
they could check out
so one resource that we like to
recommend is the dev tools security
panel so if you move your site to HTTPS
and then you open up Chrome's developer
tools you can look there's a security
tab there that is designed to help
developers figure out if they've done it
right find and fix any problems with our
HTTPS configuration so that's a great
resource for developers who are into
turning on HTTPS but not necessarily
experts and we also have some
documentation on the web we have a web
fundamentals guide so if you search for
web fundamentals for HTTPS and there is
a whole bunch of information in there
about configuring HTTPS performance
tuning search ranking all all the
hurdles that you might run into when
setting up HTTPS ok right on those sound
like awesome resources so definitely go
check those out Emily thank you so much
for being with us today thank you all so
much for watching again we're coming at
you live from the sfjazz center chrome
dev summit stay with us we've got a
bunch more content that's going up on
our channel we've also got an entire
second day of content that'll be
happening live from this floor tomorrow
so be sure to tune in on the live stream
for that as well again I'm Rob Dodson
