developer relations team I'm here to
talk to you about progressive web apps
and how tools and libraries can make
building them easier because of the web
app so the latest buzzword craze in web
development because for web apps are
cool and they use all of latest exciting
technologies and that's probably enough
to get quite a lot of demo developers
interested but far more importantly
building progressive web apps is about
building web experiences that are useful
enjoyable and accessible for your users
and I hope that's enough to impress the
rest of you part of what makes
progressive web apps possible now is a
shift in the way that the web platform
itself is built in the old web you got
custom-designed high level features for
achieving things that the w3c thought
web developers wanted to do people want
images so you get an image tag people
want to lay things out in tables so you
get a table tag the new idea in the web
standards world is called the extensible
web and it says that instead of creating
simple API so for specific things new
features should be low-level deep and
powerful enabling a much broader range
of things so rather than a tag for
showing images we get a tag for drawing
arbitary graphics and rather than a tag
for sharing tables we get CSS properties
that allow us to lay stuff out however
we want this gives us the features we
need to upgrade our pages into apps but
we also have this gap now between the
level we want to work at and what the
platform gives us and we can fill this
gap with libraries so in the extensible
web the community is given the
responsibility of providing the simple
easy to use libraries for the specific
things that developers want to do this
is great because it's much quicker and
easier to iterate on the API of a
library than it is to iterate on the
platform itself and it also means that
even as we speak
other people are out there solving hard
problems so that you don't have to so
today I'm going to talk about some
Service Worker libraries I'm going to
talk about chrome dev tools and the
progressive web app features that are
being added there and we're also going
to look at how tooling can help you
understand is my app a progressive web
app
and is there anything else that I need
to do so the most important new
technology as far as progressive web
apps are concerned is service workers
service workers are a background thread
for your application and they open up
all sorts of new features like offline
push messaging and background 8 sync for
the offline news case your service
worker gets to act as a network proxy
right in the claim whenever your page
requests any resource be an image a
script or the HTML for the page itself
an event fires in the service worker
that you get a chance to respond to the
service worker can then use the cache
and fetch API is to do something fancy
like serving up cash content but it's
not actually just about offline even
being online doesn't mean that your
users will have a good time
you could have an incredibly slow
connection maybe you're in a place where
data is going to cost you a lot of money
maybe you're trying to use the Wi-Fi in
a Mountain View hotel room you don't
just want to work offline what you want
is connectivity independence it's about
making your app work well regardless of
the network situation but of course with
complex apps is going to come complex
service workers there'll be a lot of
code to implement some of these things
that you want to do and there are lots
of new api's to learn so we have a
library service worker toolbox this was
created by Google to abstract away some
of the common patterns for connectivity
and dependence so let's run through a
pretty simple example of a service
worker that's written with service
worker toolbox this is the full script
this is everything you'd need for this
particular example site to go offline so
first of all we import Service Worker
toolbox and then we have this line
toolbox precache now when a service
worker is installed it gets a chance to
act and service worker toolbox uses the
opportunity to download resources that
you've told it to if with this pre cache
line and stick them in a cache so that
those resources will always be available
to your application for the whole
lifetime of the service worker and you'd
use this for things like the shell of
your app the resources that are shared
across all your pages
perhaps the resources needed to show
your home page experience
or if your app is something that can
work entirely offline maybe a whole app
goes here as an important side whenever
the service worker changes the install
event happens again so this pre cache
will happen every time you update your
resources as long as you change the
service worker as well so next up
toolbox dot Rueter dot default equals
toolbox dot fastest now toolbox dot
Rooter is the part of the system that
handles matching parts of your site to
the behavior that you want to have so
here we're using setting the default
behavior and we're setting it to fastest
which I'll talk about in a moment and
then you can have different behavior for
different parts of your site so here we
set use toolbox dot rooted get to say
get requests for things beginning with
slash API slash should use the network
first behavior and we can pass in some
options and again I'll talk about what
network first is in a moment so the
methods we saw called fastest and
network first or what we call strategies
typically you need to think carefully
about which what's the best strategy for
each part of your site or for each kind
of resource on your site every tool box
comes with five built-in strategies so
fastest when a request comes in we race
both the cache and the network and
whichever one comes back first
delivers its result to the page and
obviously if you've if the resource is
already cached it will probably be the
cache that wins but this way you you
will get the network if it's not already
in the cache another useful feature is
that when the network quest succeeds if
it succeeds if you're online it will
update the version in the cache so
you're not quite up to date because if
you keep refreshing you keep getting the
last version rather than the current
version but these are good for stuff
that's allowed to be slightly out of
date that you want to be returned very
fast on the flip side though this does
always make the network request
so you are potentially costing the user
money and you're using up their data
plan so there's an alternative you could
use Network first this one we try the
network and only if that fails do we go
to the cache and return the response
again if the network succeeds this will
update the cache but because it goes to
the network first it means that when you
are online you get that latest resource
so this is good for stuff that should be
fresh if you can get it but you still
want to work offline so for example your
latest tweets or the emails in your
inbox you want to be able to reload the
app and show whatever you had before
when you're not offline this one comes
within a pretty important option that I
want to highlight so network timeout on
a mobile device can be two minutes so if
you request resource using the network
first strategy and your device thinks it
has a connection but really it's never
going to get anything your users could
be waiting two minutes for that to
timeout so we allow you to set a
different network timeout and if that
amount of time here five seconds elapses
we just give up and return from the
cache anyway any time that your users
are waiting for a resource to download
you should probably do this and your
users will thank you cache first sort of
the opposite of network first this will
go to the cache and only if that fails
will it try the network again if if it
does go to the network and it succeeds
it will update the cache but because it
always go into the cache first it means
that once it has succeeded once and put
it into the cache it will always use
that old version so this is good in some
ways you're not going to the network
you're not even try in the network if
it's something you've already go in the
cache but it will always be stale after
that first time so this is good for
resources that never change but the
aren't part of your shell so you don't
want to preach
so imagine in the case of a blog if you
have 10 years worth of articles you
don't want as soon as the any user lands
on your page to download all 10 years
worth of your articles but you do want
if someone's going backwards and
forwards to just use the version in the
cache obviously a trick here would be to
version the URL of your articles so that
if you do want to make a change in the
future and users will still get it now
cash only is slightly yes less useful
but this is handy for the stuff that
you've pre cached because a request
comes in we go to the cache and if it
fails that's it that's all we do it
never tries the network so if you if
it's something you've pre cached or
something where you perhaps you cannot
you have some other way of updating the
cache this is a good way of saying don't
even try the network I only want show
cache stuff and the network only which
is the flip I only go to the network and
if it fails it fails this is basically
like not having a behavior set for a
particular route with your router but if
you've set a default this can allow you
to override it to get back to the
original default behavior now if that
doesn't give you the control that you
want you can create your own strategies
so here I've created a function this
code is more or less lifted from this
year's i/o website so we show profile
images for speakers in the i/o website
and we don't want to download hundreds
and hundreds of small images and fill
the device straight away so what we do
is if you're offline there well when we
try and fetch the those images we try
and fetch it from the network and if it
fails we just return a fallback image
from the cache so obviously here we need
to make sure that we've pre cached the
fallback image that it's actually
actually available when we request it
and then we set up a route that actually
uses this strategy and you can also get
fine control over the cache so here
we've set up a route for posts this
could be blog articles this could be
Google+ posts something like that
and you want to be able to cache them
you want people to go to the things that
they have looked at recently and get
them again but you don't want to just
endlessly fill the device as they browse
around so we can set a maximum number of
entries in this case 500 and a maximum
number of seconds that those should be
available so I've set this to five days
but even with all this control the
pre-caching carpark can be tricky you
need to make sure that the serviceworker
changes in order to get a new one
installed and if you've got lots of
assets in your site it can be tricky to
know exactly which things need to be pre
cached whether things have changed and
do I need to actually send a new version
the other thing is that serviceworker
toolbox is pre cache method when that
install event fires it re downloads
everything it has no way of knowing what
might have changed on the server so it
redownload everything and sticks it into
the cache fresh so we have another tool
called s2 we're precache that will help
you solve these problems based on a few
options this will actually write a
serviceworker for you so you tell it
which files you want to cache it will
take a hash of each of those files and
include that data in the serviceworker
it changes and because it includes the
hashes in the serviceworker it means
that any time a file actually changes it
updates the causes and you install but
if you have to exactly the same files
and none of them have changed it won't
this also means that during the install
step you can compare the hashes of the
files that are meant to be pre cached by
the serviceworker
with the files you already have in the
cache so you only have to redownload
things that have actually changed now
this can be used as a CLI tool you
install it from NPM and you just run the
s3 your pre cache command here I pass in
an options say which which folder is the
root of my application and where to
write the service
you can also use it as a node module so
here we require in sto precache and we
use the precache dot write method we say
where the service worker should go and
which files should be cashed here it's
all of HTML and CSS in the project now
that works great for the shell of your
application but aren't we losing the
power of s3 toolbox for dynamic
resources like API requests as you see
here we can combine the two the runtime
caching option that were passing
terrestrial precache allows you to say
what your ester we toolbox rules should
be it uses the same patterns and maps
are the same handlers and sor precache
will write out the code for your ester
we toolbox service worker into its into
its service worker and if you want full
control yourself you can instead say to
set s2 a pre cache I just want you to
include some other file in the service
worker so you could write the the ester
we toolbox rules manually for your
dynamic content and just tell us to reap
recache to load that as well
now service worker isn't supported
everywhere and app cache is so shouldn't
we actually be using app cache so app
cache works but I wouldn't use it for
any new sites app cache comes with a
whole ton of problems it has security
flaws which is why it's actually
recently restrict being restricted so
secure and secure engines only and you
don't get any of the control that you
get the Service Worker there are
actually a whole bunch of things that
I've already just mentioned they're
actually hard if not impossible to do
with that cash however if you already
have an app cache we have a tool that
help you with that this will help you
transition from your app cache site to a
serviceworker so you import this library
and then you write a fetch handler
inside your serviceworker and you just
tell it that you want to use the legacy
app cache behavior what this will do is
it'll look into the page that you use to
register the serviceworker
find its app cache manifest and then it
will just try and behave exactly like
the app cache but actually gets around a
few of the more gnarly problems without
cache and a cache esta blue app cache
behavior which I failed to call out the
name for is actually just the first of
many serviceworker helpers that we're
releasing as part of our set of SW
helpers soon as an example of the sort
of thing we've been working on we have
offline analytics this was originally
developed for last year's i/o website
and is used again this year and it
provides an S to be toolbox caching
strategy function that handles failed
requests to Google Analytics queues
those requests and then the next time
the user is online it sends them off and
actually handles putting a timestamp on
those requests so that the requests are
attributed to the correct time when the
user actually made the action so you can
gather metrics from users who are flying
and we're going to be adding a whole
bunch of more tools into this repo over
the next coming months and now we move
on to other tools I just used the same
transition this one's not as exciting so
no talk about developer tools would be
for the web would be complete without
mentioning chrome dev tools and there
are some great progressive web app
features coming in the latest canary so
these features most of it's only
available in chrome 52 which is as I say
at canary stage so the resources panel
has been renamed to application to
better reflect that these are things
that web apps need rather than just the
resources for your site so here we have
the manifest panel and it the the web
app manifest gives you an gives the
system information about your app for
things that have reused outside of your
page so for example icons to use on the
home screen the colors to set the UI for
with the theme color and images to use
in a splash screen and this page gives
you a diagnostic of the manifest that it
found and the values that were in
now the manifest is an important part of
the add to homescreen process so you'll
get an add to homescreen prompt for your
app if you meet certain criteria
including having a manifest and then to
test that out we added to this manifest
screen there's a new button Add to Home
screen which doesn't actually add the
app to your home screen but it triggers
the the on before install prompt so that
you can actually show the event so you
can trigger that prompt to test how
things are working with your manifest
then we have the redesigned
serviceworker panel the serviceworker
panel that used to be here was pretty
pretty cluttered with all sorts of
things so now in the you just see a list
of the service workers along with their
current state you have the same same
controls that you had before now but
just in a simplified view but we also
get these cool new features at the top
so the offline checkbox means that it
sets the it sets it so that whenever you
make a request from your page it just
never goes to the network it just
assumes the network will fail so that
things always get handled by your
serviceworker update on reload means
that every time you refresh the page it
will run the serviceworker install event
again even if nothing has actually
changed so you can test things with the
install process for your serviceworker
and bypass for network which means sort
of the opposite of the offline case it
means that whenever a network request is
made by your page the serviceworker
won't actually be asked to get involved
so this is helpful if you're testing
something that would normally be cashed
in your serviceworker but you want your
old save refresh workflow back this is
one of my favorite little features
that's been added it's the clear storage
section so obviously in the main chrome
UI you have the ability to clear private
browsing data but the controls you get
are pretty limited first of all it will
clear things for every site that you
have bright browsing data for rather
than just the current site and you only
get to control how far back you want to
go here we have a more developer
oriented system so this allows you to
say for this current origin I want to
clear all these things we'll unregister
over-serve unregistered service workers
clear index DB and clear the cache
storage etc and the last thing that I'd
like to point out is the cache storage
viewer this has actually been in chrome
dev tools for a while but a lot of
people don't know about it and this just
lists for a given cache what's actually
in there which can be great for
debugging your apps so we've looked at a
bunch of tools that will help you
fulfill all of the progressive web app
criteria but how do you know if you're
done what would be cool is if there was
just like a button you could click that
would scan your site and tell you if you
were missing something so the chrome
team built one and it's called
lighthouse and they have a very cool
professional-looking logo engineer art
at its finest so this works as a Chrome
extension or an NPM module as a Chrome
extension you load up your page you
click the button and it will use the
remote debugging API to gather all sorts
of information about your page it will
reload your page a couple of times and
then produce a report it gives you a
score of based on the progressive web
app criteria and tell you how you're
doing and at the end it also gives you
information on some best practices
things that we're not necessarily going
to score but things that you might want
to check out so do you have Aria
elements do is your manifest setup
correctly the CLI tool does basically
the same thing you install this via NPM
again and show
missed now you just tell it a URL to go
to it will load Chrome in the background
load up the the site there do all the
the refreshing and it can output either
pretty print to the console it can
output JSON which you can parse yourself
or it can output the same HTML that you
saw in the the extension report
obviously you better and you can also
include it as a node module so you can
require lighthouse and tell it which
site to go through and then you get the
results as a bundle of JSON and using
either this or the command line is how
you can F owner is great you should all
check it out but don't use it in the
talks a previous conferences they've
used that's a signal that was the end of
your talk and I was like what I have 20
minutes left so you can use this to hook
up the results into your tests or into
your continuous integration now I want
to draw attention to the Alpha in the
corner here this is pretty early stages
the rules aren't final and it only works
in canary well it works in chrome 52
plus which is currently canary you can
check it out and github we encourage you
to file issues or to contribute if
that's your thing so we've talked about
the fact that progressive web apps are
made possible by the extensible web
they're made practical by libraries and
tools google has made a bunch of
libraries serviceworker with more coming
chrome dev tools is awesome as always
and lighthouse lets you know what you
need to fix so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
