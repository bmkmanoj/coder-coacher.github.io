the things that's kind of confused me
about Palmers data mining system is how
it binds to sub properties of objects it
seems like you should be able to just
like create a binding on an object and
its sub property and update that in
JavaScript and things would just
magically work but reality proves
otherwise so today on polycast what I
want to do is go through how the sub
property binding system works and show
you how to do bindings in your polymer
elements let's check it out so here I've
got a pretty simple element for
displaying and employees manager and the
first thing I'm gonna do is just trim
this down to the bits that we really
want to focus on so we've got just our
HTML and just our JavaScript down here
now I've got this div and inside of here
I'm binding to user dot manager right so
I'm binding to the sub property of the
user object and what I can do is to find
that user object here on my my elements
prototype and I'm just gonna have it
returned this this value object that
sets manager equal to Paul okay so so
far so good let me drop in a button so
that I can change this manager so I've
got this button and when I tap it and it
called change manager and when I
implement that function it's just gonna
set user this dot user's manager
property to Fred right so we would
expect over here on the right I've got
my my my element here we would expect
that when I click this button this
should update so let's go in there and
we'll click it and yeah nothing happens
I'm just sort of clicking it over and
over again not getting anything okay hmm
well let's try something else instead of
trying to set the sub property let's
actually just replace the user object
with a completely new object all right
let's go over here and try that hmm okay
so that does work but why you know like
what is going on here why are they
different well if you remember in the
last video I mentioned that when you
create a binding like this polymer is
going to do two things it's going to
create proper
affects and it's gonna create a setter
for that property okay so what happens
is when I just completely replace the
user object in that case the setter is
being called and it's running through
all of our property effects just like
any other property but when I change a
sub property on that object well in that
case there's no reason to call the
sitter because I haven't actually said
this you know dot user equals something
new so the setter is not firing
therefore the property effects are not
running
so what polymer is doing when it sees
this sort of binding is instead of
binding directly to that property it's
creating what it calls a path binding
and so we've got this we've got these
property effects and they know about
this path but we need to tell the system
that the path has updated and we're
going to do that polymer has actually
implemented its own method called notify
path so we can go in and we can
imperative lis change our user dot
manager property and then we can tell
the system that this path right here has
updated we can pass in that value and
what polymer is gonna go do is it's
going to look at any of its property
effects it's just gonna loop through
them it's gonna find any of those
property effects that have this path
inside of them and it's gonna update
those nodes with this particular value
and in fact since this is such a kind of
a common task that you would do polymer
actually gives you this little helper
method called this dot set which will
not only set the property for you in
JavaScript but it'll also call notify
path on your behalf
now the reason why polymer uses this
approach versus creating a setter for
all of these sub properties is that it
would just be really really expensive to
try and create a setter for every single
sub property in any object you could
imagine if you had an object with like a
thousand sub properties that trying to
replace all of those with setters if you
had multiple instances of those elements
and they all had different objects the
run time cost would be pretty massive
so instead as kind of a compromise
between ease-of-use and performance we
have these methods that allow us to work
with these path bindings now this is how
you do it imperative leap but let me
also show you how you can do it
declaratively through a data binding now
here I've got the same element but this
time user dot manager is bound to this
paper input field and it's also bound to
this div up here so when I go and I
start typing it's going to update that
binding in both places and what's
happening is under the hood when polymer
sees that our paper input is updating it
checks this this this property right
here and it's like oh I see that this is
a path binding I see that this is like
some structured data I'm just gonna go
ahead and call this dot set on the
user's behalf because I figure that's
what they wanted to do so there's two
ways that you can go about updating sub
properties you can either use polymers
helper methods or you can you know if
you happen to be in a situation where
you can do this you can also set up beta
bindings and have it update that way as
well so now you know a bit more about
binding to objects in your polymer
elements but there's a lot of really
cool meaty topics which we haven't
covered yet like binding to arrays and
change records and all that cool stuff
but I'm gonna save all that for the next
episode now for those of you are
wondering what a halfpipe has to do with
data bindings halfpipe has nothing to do
with data bindings I just found a
freaking halfpipe next to my office this
time shoot here so if you've enjoyed
this episode you've enjoyed our halfpipe

and maybe catch us on the next episode
of polycast as always thank you for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
