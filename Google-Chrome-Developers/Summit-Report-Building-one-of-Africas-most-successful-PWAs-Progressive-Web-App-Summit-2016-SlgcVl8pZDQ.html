progressive web apps summit I'm Rob
Dodson we're here in beautiful actually
sunny Amsterdam today I'm joined with
Andrew Morey he's the director of
engineering at conga conga is Nigerian
ecommerce company and just gave a talk
here at the summit and Andrew I was kind
of curious so one of the things that you
really focus on in your talk is this
cost of data in emerging markets and I
was wondering if you just just talk
through that a little bit because I know
there's a lot of folks who might be in
in Western markets they don't even think
about what it costs to use data on their
phone but how is that different if
you're in a place like like Nigeria or
India or some other market yeah sure
hello so originally as a startup we
started a responsive web a responsive
web app that was sort of work it works
well on 3G and Wi-Fi connections but as
we started paying attention to our users
we we had a good look at our at our
metrics in our CDN and we noticed a very
interesting stat which said that the
average transfer rate of data coming out
of our CDN is exiting at about 250
kilobits per second which is pretty slow
if you think about it and then we we had
to think about that and we looked at we
looked at our current approach to our
mobile web and when we notice how big
our pages were and the fact of the
matter is that if you try our home page
was 2.5 megabytes and at a specific
point in time and if you think about how
long it'll take at a rate of 250 KB per
second you'd end up waiting 40 50
seconds to load the home page and most
users in the Western world would long
drop-off but in in Africa we have a
slightly different scenario the fact
isn't there isn't that much choice there
isn't you can't just go to a brick and
mortar shop so people are pretty
persistent and you know you know respect
to our users who have pushed through
that but we owe them some sort of
improvement and I think one of the one
of the big points that came out of our
usability tests was we'd seen a user
searching for a product and as as he'd
seen that search result as he started
scrolling he said hey hey I can't
actually do this this is gonna cost me
too much data and and so we realized and
and
you know we paid attention to the market
and the fact that you know it costs
quite a bit of money to buy 10 20
megabyte bundles and we realized we
actually over to our customers to pay
attention to that and that's that's why
we chose the progressive web app sort of
system the fact that we can cache all of
this data with a serviceworker cache and
and sort of intercept that that network
request and the fact of the matter is
that in Nigeria specifically in rural
Nigeria there's relatively intermittent
Network statuses and so in terms of data
and and and bad networks we we had a
really good match with with the
progressive web app and can you tell me
a little bit about sort of the the data
saving cost that you were able to
achieve and really like the the pieces
of technology that unlock that for you
so we've done a before and after picture
and we basically recorded how much data
it took to complete it well the first
thing was to complete of the first load
and we've managed to achieve a 92%
improvement so decreasing the amount of
data it requires to load that homepage
and originally the first technology was
simple design optimization so you know
basic things like instead of serving
massive images or icons like PNG icons
or whatever we've gone with SVG's and we
paid some serious attention to 12 design
on top of the fact that we simplified it
it made it made it really and simple
that would be the first thing the second
the second way we optimized for data was
I mean that first load it's not really
the big part of it it's more the second
load and subsequent requests so on that
first load we're using our app shell
architecture to to store all of that
HTML CSS and JavaScript and then it sits
there in the serviceworker and in the
app shell and the next request to it
it's not fetching it from the network so
there is no data cost and the second
metric that that sort of screams is the
is the amount of data it requires to
perform a checkout so imagine you're
going to buy a product we've achieved an
80% reduction in in data cost up for
that first transaction and the
technology stack is quite simple it's
based on serviceworker cache and the
usage of IDB and and sort of all the
underlying technologies of progressive
web app
and there's some other interesting
things there but that is the main the
majority of it comes from that very cool
so an omission so you got you mentioned
in kind of a web technology stack there
and as we were talking an interesting
point that you raised was that the
engineering team that you worked on with
this is not exclusively web developers
it kind of cuts across all sorts of
different kind of engineering types so
you talk about that a little bit cuz I
think a lot of people when they think
about progressive web apps they see it
as sort of a mutually exclusive thing
where they're like well I'm gonna have
to just drop my need of app developers
and go with this or something and it's
it's hard for them to choose so so can
you explain a little bit about that
process they all went through there sure
so I think it was more about timing than
anything else it wasn't an active
decision to say hey let's let's have
them the native engineers builders it's
more about the fact that this wasn't
originally part of our roadmap we have a
very serious engineering undertaking at
the moment and that's all about breaking
down on monolithic application into
smaller independently deployable and
scalable micro services and that's where
our efforts are at the moment so our web
devs
were kind of focused on other projects
of rebuilding some client-side front-end
components and they had been the
resources had been booked out and the
only available resources at the time
were the native engineers who we were
struggling with our native apps and in
any case so that was the only team
available at the time and I charged them
and challenge them with you know
switching from native two to two web dev
which is it's a pretty different field
but they seem to they seem to thrive not
only did it provide some variety people
learn new skills and the new components
of the web and I think they did very
very well and the feedback I got from
them was nothing but positive everybody
seemed to kind of grasp polymer really
easily and and that sort of switched to
web development quite quite easily you
know all I can say is you know pay
attention to to some of the
documentation that that that's not
available really on polymer and
progressive Web Apps go into the
examples like inspect the code and that
was pretty much what what our team did
to build this so Andrew thank you so
much for being with me today if you want
to catch Andrews talk you can tune into
the chrome Developers YouTube channel
we've got a playlist there for
all the sessions of day 2 from the
cursive webapp summit also we're gonna
include some links down in the
description for the conga showcase on
developers.google.com down web it covers
a little bit more of the story of how
they built the site and also a few more
the sort of like stats on where they
picked up in data savings and things
like that
again Andrew thank you so much for being
with me today it's been great talking
with you and I thank you all for being
with us and stay tuned for more from day
two of the progressive web app summit
see ya
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
