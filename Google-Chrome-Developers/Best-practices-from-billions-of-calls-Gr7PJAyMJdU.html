practices from billions of calls some
lessons I learned from basically reverse
engineering some major VoIP services I
work friend yet I walk occasionally at
Weber DC hacks so you'll find a lot of
country then today for me so I'm a
mechanical engineer I like to build
things but actually I prefer
deconstructing some reverse engineering
them a lot more so back in May 2014 chat
did a article on Amazon made a on the
web RTC hacks you can read that out
there it basically looked at how Amazon
made a worked and it was pretty
important at that point that we saw that
WebRTC was ready for production and used
the weapon shield library and following
that I did these construction of
hangouts when hangout started using
WebRTC and I looked at Firefox hello and
at some point I got an email from Sarah
saying oh you're done great tear downs
and he wanted to look at this shift to
mobile we've seen with a party seat back
late 2014 early 2015 and we wanted to
identify some best practices and so I
spent a couple of weeks looking at
various services I wrote 80 pages of
reports on that a couple of blog posts
lots of nodes and some tooling for that
and basically looking at services that
have billions of calls whatsapp facetime
facebook Messenger wire viber and skype
and we learned some lessons about
adoption to the mobile platform about
codec tuning about encryption on those
heavy loss 2g and 3G networks and about
ice so I want to talk about that so Chad
used Wireshark in his deconstruction of
mayday and vert shock is one of the best
tools out there for decoding Network
packets for analyzing stuff and if you
know how to use it it's very powerful
however sometimes you don't notice
things so Amazon made a used
stun server and that information has
been in this dump we had since then and
nobody noticed that it uses this net net
OS a sing which turned out to be an acne
session border controller and also
Wireshark as good as it is it is not
very good at visualizing things so I'll
come back to this graph later and
sometimes you need better tools that can
generate nice graphs that people love so
I looked at things like FaceTime which
is from Apple it does voice chat and
video chat it works on iOS and OS X and
no surprise it's not using WebRTC
however it is rumored to be big at least
that's what people tell me and they have
a couple of years of deployment
experience so it's been around since
2010 and before that it was ichat AV so
lots of experience so they should know
what they doing well we found that they
using h.264 they support h.265 however
they don't use h.265 when being on Wi-Fi
that's something where you can see that
h.265 it is better in terms of bandwidth
however it consumes more battery so if
you have enough bandwidth don't you use
h.265 and they negotiate the image size
between devices so they send the optimal
resolution doing that with your SD p and
of course they use turn service run by
ahmed distributed a bump around the
globe for low latency and we found that
they're using a very fast mechanism for
the candidate a location which skips
some round trip times and that reduces
the call set-up time and as we've heard
earlier this call set-up time the time
it takes to establish the call is very
important for user experience so I also
looked at whatsapp which does voice
calls and it is pretty big as well so
they're not using WebRTC they're using
an old library called pj sip they don't
do this modern ice stuff it don't use
detailers instead to use the older
security description
encryption scheme and looking at the
binaries we found that they might use
some WebRTC components like the echo
canceller however they don't tell us if
they do in those license would require
them so the audio codec has been a
mystery for quite some while so he said
oh it's opus but I showed him this graph
and basically shows how the packet
lengths are distributed and you can see
on in black is chrome on our party sees
sending opus and what's up is definitely
looking different so recently is someone
commented on where / DC hacks and said
oh yes i did a man-in-the-middle attack
on the signal link traffic and it's
using opus at a different sampling rate
which explains why this looks different
and one of the most interesting things I
found was that the call is always relate
for the first few seconds Emil told me
about that that this will be a great
idea and I found it to be true for
whatsapp and if they can switch to
peer-to-peer they go to peer-to-peer to
take the load off see turn of the
service they have so they're using
service they call a conference bridge
50-something in ireland and again this
reduces a call set-up time so I also
looked at viber which is doing voice and
video chat it's not using repartee it
might be using the older mobile IP
solution stuff and it's not using this
RTP protocol so it's completely
encrypted so when sash asks about it I
asked him do you really want me to look
at that because I wasn't sure what I
could find in that and it turns out that
you can still see all those traffic
patterns like this graph which shows
that basically is a switch from relay
service to peer-to-peer which we've seen
with what's up before I also looked at
skype encrypted as well however at least
they show some debug information so we
can see it's using silk white band as an
audio codec it uses h.264 video
and it was summer in Sweden such had
lots of time we did some calls and we
were testing on simulated 2g 3G and 4G
networks and we found that skype really
dynamically adapt sings like the
sampling rate the packet frequency and
the bitrate to those network conditions
that's very impressive what we also
found that despite those of us being in
Europe it used relay service in redland
which doesn't make sense to optimize one
thing and not the other we also looked
at wire which does voice calls text chat
and picture sharing 11 Android app an
iOS app and they work in chrome and
firefox and they use opus and we were
interested in how they adapt opus to the
mobile platform so the browser interop
is using WebRTC they're using details
for encryption with very strong
encryption mechanisms and they really
partially using WebRTC dork but not for
networking like Firefox doesn't use it
for networking easy you're using the
media engine and their own fixed version
of lib opus and you can see that they
have killed the audio codec massively so
the bitrate in chrome black and put the
app in blue so that you can see the
bitrate is a lot lower in the app also
you see that in this packet distribution
saying so it's shifted to the left and
when testing going to simulate the 3g
network we saw a drop from the usual 50
kilobit per second traffic to 25 and
going to 2g it dropped again to like 18
kilo bits per second so this is heavily
tuned for a good audio experience and
this is very hard to do however they
know what they're doing they were
involved with the I said coded with opus
oh these are people who know what
they're doing really so I also looked at
facebook Messenger which is audience
video chat ten percent of mobile voice
over IP and it is
pretty apparent that it uses with WebRTC
ugh libraries they have a nice notice
file showing that they use it works on
android iOS Chrome Firefox Opera and in
the browser chat asked me to look at
that back in January and I told him it's
boring what do you want me to look at
that it's pretty common however on
mobile it was completely different
that's heavily tune their app from well
usage and you can see that in the
distribution you can see that they send
lots of small packets and lots of large
packets so adapting to those network
conditions they see and they use a lot
of different audio codecs and negotiate
that through SDP for example they use
the Isaac low-complexity codec which is
virtually unknown outside google see I
said codec when talking to chrome and
opus tuned for monal when talking to
Firefox all handle through ftp and for
encryption this is a complicated story
so when talking to browsers which must
implement DTLS they used ET les but
between their apps a used the older
security description mechanism and that
allows retroactively decryption which is
a bad thing however it is faster than
detail s in some conditions so in
summary we learned quite a lot of best
practices from those services and also
things that are not so good if we are
really interested in all the gory
details although 60 80 pages go to where
/ DC hacks so we saw a lot of adoption
to the mobile platform which is networks
with high packet loss and delay devices
with constraints on cpu and battery
usage and we found that audio is way
more important than video and that 11
sessions are more important than
multi-party and encryption on heavy lost
networks is a problem because if there
is packet loss the Detailers handshake
takes a lot of time however while you
can work around that using Esther's
please don't do that we've also seen a
lot of codec tuning that is using
different codecs
lowering the bitrate increase the frame
size of the frame sent using motor
instead of stereo and we've seen some
hardware acceleration for example with
facetime however facebook Messenger uses
vp8 on iOS and software one of the
interesting things we saw was that with
ice a lot of people go for the relay
first so the turn server is not the last
resort that's the first thing you go to
that reduces the call set-up time then
they switch to peer-to-peer if they have
successful that way you could also hide
this dtls latency in the ring latency
that is the time until the user picks up
the call so thank you if you want to
follow me on twitter i'm home speak on
flower or you go to WebRTC hacks to read
about stuff right there thanks at all do
we have any questions yes I think you
mentioned the beginning that you need
better tools than a wire shark for
looking at the stuff did you write
something all yourself for year it was I
was writing staff based on note pcap
then generating those graphs with the
highcharts library it is a small set of
tools but it is very useful other
questions
search any suggestions on the next tool
ripple and I should test well we can
compare browsers ah that should be
internet go I have a quick question of
all the things that you found what was
the most surprising to you well I think
cee at the what's up went for this relay
service first I mean Emil had told me
about that quite a while ago and when I
found it I immediately thought oh yes he
said that and it was good to see this
use in practice well FaceTime is
different they use a very complicated
architecture combination of SIP and XMPP
and they establish a data Channel and
then do a sip session over that and it
must be some very Akane reasons to do
that right very old architecture you
probably know more about that but you
don't want to talk about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
