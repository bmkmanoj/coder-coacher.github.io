to think of as boilerplate code because
I've been working on the site and I've
been building custom controls for the
video player and so firstly it's awesome
that you can totally get like there's
loads of events that fire off a media
element whether it's seeking its seeked
whether it's ended whether it's playing
and all these things are really really
handy when you're making custom controls
because you want to kind of handle that
I just want it because I've spent some
time doing I just wanted to kind of show
you very briefly around some of the code
I'm and you can find it all on github
just check the link in the description
below if you want to actually like spend
ages looking over the source code but I
will explain broadly speaking how I've
decided to divide and conquer the code
for this let's have a look that's what's
on my screen so the first thing to note
is that there is there are two things
there's actually the two classes that
are interesting there we go that's how I
should say it there's a video player and
the video controls the video player is
what is going to decide whether the
videos playing or whether it's actually
paused it actually controls the shakka
player and it controls the video element
it's stuff that's there is kind of the
wrapper around why is it a wrapper
around a wrapper around a video because
it's a wrapper around shacket around a
video this feels like it's going to
quickly descend into some kind of tongue
twister it's a wrapper around shack
around video yes I got it yes
anyway that's not what you came for
let's talk about the the code bits so in
the constructor for one of these video
players you can see I pull a lot of
stuff from the video element because I
actually put a video element in the page
using just Jas template size look
there's a video element and I pop in in
the HTML the all the data that I think
I'm going to need and the reason I do
that is because I think the server-side
rendering makes a lot of sense here even
though this is all JavaScript based I
don't want to make a request off for the
JSON and then bring it back in but I can
encode this all inside
the Dom if I absolutely need to and it's
working just fine so I pick up all the
things that I need from the Dom like the
title of the video the link to the
manifest as in where do I get the
manifest for this particular video post
frames all that kind of stuff and I keep
a bunch of things around that I need to
just you know for housekeeping this here
with all these binds you'll recognize if
you have watched a supercharged I'll
explain it that now just very very
briefly these thing these things like on
key down on click they are class methods
but that sugar over a prototype method
in es5 terminology and so if I call if I
add an event listener that's like Dhokla
is like a click event handle to play on
a button and I say this dot on click by
default the on click will be bound to
the button for example so if I say this
dot something or other it will refer to
the button typically what I actually
wanted to refer to is my instance of
myclass
the other thing the other reason I do it
like this and take a copy of it off the
prototype and onto the instance is just
simply so that I can do add event
listeners and remove event listeners and
I can still refer to it by name so this
unclick or is refers by name to the
instance copy so I do it for two reasons
it looks slightly odd and it is slightly
odd and it's just one of those things I
would like it if we had a different way
to do this but we don't at the moment
Sonia so I set them all up at the start
okay here's actually yet the event
listeners are things like key down click
play pause back thirty forward so these
these are custom specific to my app
these aren't the standard-issue events
these come from the video controls so
I'll have to show you that in a moment
but there are some specific ones that I
do which go in the other direction so
when we play we pause and video has
ended all the duration changes I
actually notify the control so there's a
two there is some coupling going on here
I either call in to the video controls
and give the video controls a bit of
updated state about the video so that
controls can be updated and reflect
what's going on and the video controls
will dispatch events back out so they
video player the video controls are
inside something so I can basically do
event
humbling and call in but I do events out
it's it I think actually when you do V
down stuff they often say that you want
to do props down and events up and it's
not a dissimilar thing here I'm sort of
calling in an event bubble back up and
it seems to work just great so these are
the custom events essentially that I get
from the controls
then there's a few bits and pieces about
whether it we've gone full screen I was
surprised to discover things like full
screen still require WebKit prefixing on
the way through interesting so most of
the WebKit stuff had disappeared in fact
for all the vendor prefixes heard mostly
dissipate but there are a few that are
hanging around there are a couple of
other bits and pieces like whether we
support the newer orientation locks
which I have a quick test for which is
like if orientation in a string is in
window dot screen these are convenience
things here whether whether we support
these various things I will show you the
media session API at some other point
not in this one because it's worth
seeing all by itself it's very exciting
so we got all this going on as I say
most of this is boilerplate like for
example if you go on back thirty all we
do is we grab the video we just say
current time take off 30 seconds and
then update the video controls so as I
say loads of boilerplate on the video
control side however it's again actually
not dissimilar in terms of a lot of
boilerplate about sort of click handlers
and so on in fact there's actually one
global click handler which I so I
delegate control of the click handling
out to the the video controls let me
show you the where's the on click when
you need it no no come on Paul I look on
the button itself or I look on that
whatever was actually clicked and if
it's got a type in its data set so if
it's got data - type as an attribute I
fire a customer's out with that name
which is why in the video player we get
things like
we get like backs 30 and forward 30
because if we were to look in the player
I hope you all sing when you're
was doing your luck around your codes
because I definitely do makes me a joy
to work alongside that's what you came
here for now we see that Delia
so like data type equals toggle volume
or data type equals toggle chromecast
I've yet to build up it mostly so that
data type is what's used to as the event
name we just fire that from the video
controls pick it up in the video player
and then do the appropriate thing or
hopefully all makes sense
so there you go that is a quick look
around the video controls of the video
player that's kind of where have been
roughly spending nearly all of my time I
expected a lot of boilerplate I got a
lot of boilerplate but on the upside I
mean let me show you now let me show you
what we've got this is the video player
as it is and how would you look at that
it's me and summer and a few other
people decide we've got you know the
pause play controls we can skip forward
30 and there's the buffering go back 30
as well you know we can also drag along
like that which will also work there's
Rob Dodson looking very Rob Dodson yeah
full screen bingo full screen Shaboom
come out that's great so that all works
all these things you can do and more
besides I've got some code that will
switch on things like the chromecast
button if there's a chromecast on the
network although you can find all that
in the source code now we'll spend a bit
more time talking about that kind stuff
in a future entry but for now I will
wish you a very good day and thank you
very much for watching hey folks thanks
for watching don't forget that there is
more content that you can find kind of
over here ish and if you want to
subscribe is probably a button oh maybe
there may be somewhere around there
click that if you've not done that
