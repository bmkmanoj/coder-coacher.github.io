manager the polymer team here at Google
and I'm going to talk a little bit about
Palmer so it's become a bit of a
tradition now at chrome dev summit to
give a polymer State of the Union so
this is that talk so polymer is for
those who don't know the web developer
library that we build on the chrome open
web platform team here at Google it's a
lightweight wrapper on top of the web
components api's the library is and we
also build a whole bunch of components
on top of that library so I'll talk a
little bit about where polymer has come
since one year ago at chrome dev summit
last year kind of the general state of
web components which are these really
fundamental api's that polymer leverages
heavily and then where we're headed
where the polymer library where the
broader polymer project overall is
headed in the near future so let's roll
back the clock a little bit one year ago
this very conference chrome dev summit
Matt McNulty who's the polymer
engineering lead got up and announced
kind of a major new evolution in the
polymer library so up until that point
polymer was very much kind of an
experimental library it was all about
experimenting with these new web
components api's seeing what worked
seeing what didn't work trying to build
a developer wrapper around web
components to make sure that it was
something that you know both worked in
the browser and also something that
developers could use and that we're
actually useful for building
applications and so what what Matt
announced a year ago at crowe at chrome
dev summit with polymer 0.8 and palmer
0.8 was a shift away from this
experimental mode because we had
realized that this we were actually on
to something here web components were
pretty stable and solid and great and
this library was something that could
actually be useful so we shifted away
from experimenting and towards building
something that you could actually use in
production so the goal was to kind of
balance and make trade-offs in keeping
some of the great ergonomics and the
great productivity gains that we had
achieved with the experimental 0.5
version of polymer but also make it fast
enough and you know radically less
complex to be something that you could
actually ship in production so 0.8
released around this time of year ago
major step forward still needed some
time to bake and at Google i/o this past
May we
announced polymer 1 dot 0 and this was
the big production ready release of the
polymer library so polymer wand otto was
essentially a ground-up rewrite of
polymer again trying to maintain the
same great ergonomics that polymer had
evolved over time but wonder the hood
kind of radically redesigning and
simplifying everything to make it fast
so we redesigned the data binding system
rebuilt it from the ground up to be much
more direct introduced a whole new
styling system to be able to pierce
through shadow roots when you're
building these components based on web
components that was much more idiomatic
and kind of the right the right
trade-off of in terms of developer
handles but also encapsulation and we
also included a lightweight shadow Dom
shim called shady Dom rather than
relying on the full heavyweight but a
little over over heavyweight shadow Dom
polyfill so all of these things together
made for a much kind of faster
production ready library and at that
time a number of products at Google
launched with using polymer knew these
ain't using this library in production
so how much faster was polymer one point
out from 0.5 quite a bit it was three
times faster on Chrome four times faster
on Safari it was also smaller so it also
thirty-six percent smaller and the 0.5
so this is a major step forward for the
polymer library it was also a major step
forward for everything that we build on
top of the polymer library so the
polymer team in addition to working on
this library build sets of components
and traditionally we had just had to
kind of component sets with polymer 10
we dramatically expanded the scope of
that to include five element product
lines as we call them the iron elements
and these are elements that are built on
top of the polymer library to make it
easier for developers to build
applications on the web leveraging web
components so iron elements were kind of
the basic building blocks for what you
might need to build an application the
paper elements were the reference
implementation for material design so
these are all the components the buttons
and the ripples and the drop downs and
the menus that you use to implement
Google's material design language on a
web application and I want to take the
opportunity to make totally clear
polymer is a web components library but
building with polymer we've created
these paper elements which these
represent material design so polymer is
not material design polymer is a web
upper library but we do ship these paper
elements to help developers as one of
many of our element product lines for
material design we also ship the gold
elements so these were a small set of
elements for building good ecommerce
check out flows on the web so things
like auto completing credit card fields
with the right mark up under the hood
auto validating zip codes and locations
and phone number fields to make it
really easy to build a great check out
form or a great ecommerce type form we
also ship the google web components so
these are wrappers around some of the AP
is that Google various Google projects
provide things like Google Maps and
Google Drive and YouTube and instead of
we take the imperative JavaScript AP is
that these products provide and wrap
them in a component so that you can use
these declaratively on your page just
like any other element so this includes
the Google Maps element for example
which you can just put on your page and
it renders a Google map and finally we
announced the platinum elements so these
were wrappers around service worker and
you've heard a lot about service work of
the day and all the amazing things that
you can do so the Platinum elements are
wrappers around a lot of these service
worker features to make it easier to
leverage those in your application again
declaratively using the typical element
syntax you're used to and these lets you
develop a progressive web app you know
using declarative components so really
exciting stuff with the polymer 10
announcement huge step forward for the
library hued step forward for the
element product lines but what about web
components so Palmer 10 was
production-ready a number of Google
products and products that other
companies were building or using it in
production but it could be even awesomer
it could be faster and with that true
encapsulation to really get true
encapsulation tree use of true
reusability of these components you need
web components shipped broadly across
browsers to really realize the potential
that web components have so where are we
with web components and I'm very happy
to say if you take nothing away from
this talk please take this away web
components are happening incredibly
exciting they've been in the works for a
long time but in just the last six
months we've seen incredible movement
across all the different browser vendors
towards shipping web components so a
little bit of a highlight reel here what
we've seen this was a blog post from the
edge team we are happy to announce that
we are starting development to add
HTML template element support to
Microsoft edge today today this is just
the beginning of our web components
journey following template support and
after completing the Dom reread the next
goal is to implement shouted on and i'm
very happy to say that edge actually
shipped template just a week ago so this
is a they are already shipping web
components super exciting great progress
being made on the edge team they're
doing some great work Firefox Mozilla
had this blog post not that long ago web
components have been in planning for
over three years but we're optimistic
the end is near all major browser
vendors are on board enthusiastic and
investing significant time to help
resolve the remaining issues let's get
ready two component eyes the web and
then finally WebKit so WebKit just
recently announced they are shipping the
new shadow Dom slot based v1 API in
WebKit nightly so you can actually play
with this today in Safari it's out there
in the nightly build of this incredibly
exciting work that the WebKit team has
done with the shadow Dom v1 API on the
polymer team we will soon be shipping an
experimental version of this v1 slot
based API in our shady Dom polyfill so
you can start playing with it and
getting a feel the ergonomics before it
actually the shadow Dom view one slot
based rolls out broadly so we want to
give lots of time to prepare but
incredibly exciting work being done
across all these different browser
vendors web components are actually here
it's going to be not too long and we'll
be able to have polyfills be the
exception and not the norm so incredibly
excited by all this progress so web
components have come a long way polymers
come a long way we've seen a really
great adoption of the polymer library
just since the Wando release you know
three or four months ago so polymer in
the wild over a million web pages are
now using polymer on the current web we
had polytechnics are all around the
world run by our incredible Polytechnic
organizers these are events to learn all
about polymer and build with polymer
literally every single continent except
Antarctica that we had a polytechnic
event on so incredibly exciting and
we've also seen some major companies
really adopting and leveraging polymer
web components in super interesting ways
so I want to talk a little about a few
specific limitations that I think
reflect the diversity of application
that you can have with polymer or web
components so the first I want talk
about is GE so geez
platform and it's a it's a cloud
platform that you can kind of think of
as the operating system for the
industrial Internet of Things so imagine
that you have a wind farm of wind
turbines and they're all generating data
and all that data is getting piped back
in to the pretext engine on the cloud
and you need a way to visualize all of
this data that's coming in and so what G
is built is a set of components using
polymer to be able to easily put
together dashboards to be able to
understand and visualize the data that's
coming in so awesome applications so a
whole bunch of different components that
can be pieced together to create a
variety of different interfaces on these
dashboards and you get all this
information about your industrial
Internet of Things just at a glance so
really perfect use case for these
components in a great application of an
industrial level scale that's deploying
polymer the second company that I want
to talk about is net a port a so they
are a major e-commerce company and
they've done some awesome work using
polymer on their product pages so a
company like net aparte where you have a
whole bunch of different products and a
whole bunch of different product pages
and all the product pages are going to
be slightly different some are going to
have color swatches so we're going to
have to have size dropdowns so we're
going to have additional information so
we're going to have also goes with
sections and they built each of these as
a component as a polymer component and
so they can just put together these
product pages out of these components
and all of these components are also
naturally responsive so this same site
works great on desktop it works great on
mobile it's a really great deployment of
polymer at scale and to really leverage
building and sharing and using these
components across all the different
product pages on this site and then
finally a sumo so sumo we've talked
about a little bit a Japanese real
estate company that's really on the
cutting edge in terms of the web
platform they build some awesome stuff
they are just releasing today a mortgage
interest simulator that's built in
polymer so this is just a great example
of a really immersive just app that
feels great that works on the web you
can put in all the different variables
around your mortgage and get get kind of
what your payments would look like so
it's just a great material design app
that uses all the polymer components and
has a great interface and works great on
mobile so really awesome work there so
kind of the broad spectrum from shared
components to build dashboards to
actually deployments on an e-commerce
site to just building a really great end
to end with app with polymer we're
excited to see all of this up take X
in the ecosystem we're also really
excited to see uptake internally here at
Google so here at Google over 320
projects are using polymer internally
and that number is just growing every
single day we've seen some major Google
products launched with polymer 10 just
in the last few know for months that
it's been out that are leveraging it at
scale in production these include
products like YouTube gaming so this is
a major launch not that long ago this is
built polymer end-to-end every single
component that you can see on that
screen is a polymer component just about
and they use this to structure their
application to get these really nice
effects and really nice transitions
similarly google play music so this uses
a lot of the paper elements to get that
nice material design application feel
you can see the ripples and the draw
panels and this uses polymer to
structure the application as well google
patents a really snappy application of
polymer just to be able to search
patents and read information about each
patent of course the google i/o website
which was kind of a progressive web at
before that term came about it was it
was at the Google i/o conference this
last year built in polymer and this
chrome dev summit website for the
conference we got right now also built
in polymer and there's so many major
Google products that are also using
polymer that haven't launched just quite
yet that I can't talk about today but
we're incredibly excited for those to
launch as well they also had we had the
first ever polymer developer summit that
in Amsterdam that video of the building
with the big polymer logo on the front
was not photoshopped that was real it's
a major a major building on the river in
Amsterdam just an incredible venue an
awesome event we had eight hundred
engineers there from all over the world
who are interested in polymer and
learning about polymer day to day a
whole full day of talks a night of code
labs all of those talks we recorded and
they're all up on YouTube it's a great
resource we kind of go end-to-end from
start to finish how you might build a
component how you might assemble
components into an application so if
you're interested to learn more about
polymer and how you can use polymer and
build applications with polymer the
videos from the polymer summit are a
really great resource so of course the
core polymer team did not just give up
and declare victory at 10 and leave and
quit no very far from that so we've been
working really really hard to
continually improve the library and
the elements that we're building and
kind of the two pillars are two like
core values that we think about when
we're building polymer and we're
building components everything that
we're building on the team are
ergonomically performance so organ aam
Ock's how easy is it to build a
component using polymer how easy is it
to build a good component that you can
compose with other components that you
can compose into an application using
polymer and then performance how fast
can you build something with polymer how
fast is your end resulting app when
you've built it in an idiomatic way with
polymer and so these things seem like
they're a little bit of a trade-off and
they certainly are we're always
balancing we want to improve both organ
Amish and performance we're thinking
about new things we want to build and
ways to improve the library and
components on the ergonomics side since
polymer 10 we tripped a number of new
features with the library some of these
very major features things like compound
binding things like distributed children
changes for an element ways to share
style sheets between components a whole
set of features to make it easier to
build components using polymer but we
have this mantra on the team which is
that every feature has a cost whenever
you had a feature you're adding some
level of abstraction away from the
platform just naturally and so there's
always going to be a cost to adding that
feature so whenever we're thinking about
implementing a new feature adding it to
the library we're thinking what cost are
we transferring onto our developers when
we add this feature so this is the
constant trade-off so I'm really proud
to say even with all those features that
we added since 1 dot 0 1 dot to the most
recent release is actually twenty
percent faster than 100 s so this is
great and this is actually a
conservative estimate depending on your
use case it can be even faster we've
also worked hard to improve all the
elements that we build with polymer
we've made all our elements faster and
slimmer and more robust we also worked
hard to improve the accessibility across
all the elements that's really really
important to us so we want to be leading
from the front in terms of both web
component performance and web component
accessibility and so the entire
engineering team is skilled up in terms
of making accessible web components so
we've kind of achieved at least did this
release a nice having our cake and
eating it too we've improved performance
by adding features to the library we've
improved ergonomics and we've also
improved performance and I think that
the
we've been able to achieve that is
because we're building the library the
polymer library up from the platform
we're relying on native platform
features with web components and
building up from there just as sugaring
so we're able to make really inform
trade-offs in terms of just small kind
of sugaring layers away from the
platform and very targeted improve and
add features while maintaining really
good performance I think that's a
powerful direction so I want to I want
to take a little time to think about
that about the web platform polymers
come really far web components have come
really far the web platforms come really
far I think that's the theme that you're
hearing again and again today and the
the platform has come so far we now have
this concept of progressive web apps
with serviceworker you're able to build
applications that are resilient to flaky
networks that can send you push
notifications that can launch from the
home screen without the alphabet chrome
around it it's just an immersive
application that you built it this is
the amazing platform that we have and
and features like service worker and web
app manifest really truly make the web
finally a first-class application
platform really truly for ninety percent
ninety-nine percent of use cases out
there you can get everything you need
building on the web with service worker
at web at manifests and similar new
features in the web platform and these
are largely developer facing features
these are feature I mean sorry these are
largely consumer-facing feasted features
features your users will see your user
will see an app working offline that's
new your user will see an application a
web application sending you a push
notification these are very truly
user-facing features and that makes it
this first-class application platform
and it's changing the way that we can
think about building applications on the
web things we've never been able to do
before as web developers could only
dream of we're now finally able to
actually do in our web applications
that's really powerful but the web is
not only become in just recent years and
months even a first-class application
platform I think with web components
with web coments being a developer
facing feature a feature that make our
lives easier as developers in terms of
structuring our apps giving us
fundamentally new primitives in the web
platform for building components that
are isolated and reusable the web is
really become a first-class developer
platform and this is huge for so long
the history of web development kind of
follows this arc of doing lots of crazy
things to try to avoid the web platform
to try to smooth over its edge kids
rough cases but I think we're at a
really significant turning point now I
think the web can be a really elegant
platform and with features like web
components and features like
serviceworker we're now able to build
applications on the web platform in ways
that the platform intended us to build
them and that's really powerful and by
sticking to the platform now we can
build applications the platform can help
us out the platform can improve these
features and improve performance and we
can gain from those features and
performance improvements in the platform
as long as we're building to the way
that the platform intended and so I
think web components are just the seed
that's going to really really spread
across kind of all of our norms that
we've had taken for granted as web
developers in terms of how we structure
applications how we build applications
on the web platform just in the same way
that service worker is going to change
the way we think about what our
applications can do for our users so
what's next polymers come a really long
way but we it's constantly growing there
are over 20 people working directly on
polymer project currently and that
number seems to be growing every week so
where do we where do we kind of see this
library going right now the polymer
library it very much is a scalpel so
it's a very powerful tool when used in
the right hands but it's certainly still
easy to make mistakes and we want it to
be easy just to build applications
generally so polymer is great for
building web components but we think it
should be easy to use components it
should be used to build components it
should be easy to share components
should be easy to optimize components
and it should be easy to assemble entire
applications out of these components so
there are a few kind of products that
we're working on right now to make this
all easier to make this a reality into
the polymer library is just kind of the
first seed to be able to make it easier
to build and share these components so
I'll talk about a few of the things that
we have in progress right now the first
is it can be easy to make a mistake when
you're building a polymer element so
very purposefully we want to keep
polymer lean and light and so we don't
include a bunch of error checking code
just to make sure you're not slipping up
as a developer we keep that out of the
library so make sure that you're
shipping only what you need
to your users and so we still want to
make it easy to find these catch these
mistakes before you have to get a
refresher page and come across your bug
yourself and so we're really happy to
announce a poly lint which is a project
we've been working on for a little while
now to be able to limp your polymer code
in line in your text editor so it is a
node module that you can also it has
plugins to comment text editors like
Adam and sublime it will find common
mistakes that you make you might make
when developing a Pollard component
things like missing an HTML import it'll
notify you when you're missing this and
it will show you what line what
component you're using that you haven't
imported things like if you're binding
to a property that you haven't declared
it will notify you that as well even
more subtle things when you're building
polymer things like binding the
incorrect way to a native attribute like
class so a whole slew of different
linting errors it will find as you
develop so we think it'll be a really
powerful tool we're really curious to
see what developers with lebra's like
and what more things we could find with
this linter so please do check it out
it's in our polymer labs organization
everything we keep in the Palmer lives
we like to develop everything out in the
open so this has been out in the open
for a while now instead of polymer labs
that's our kind of breeding ground for
new products that we want to get
feedback on and learn more about before
we graduate them into the Palmer
organization the second new thing I want
to talk about is poly dev so web
components are really really powerful
primitive but you have to be cautious
about you know where you apply that
really powerful feature with great power
you know comes great responsibility and
so Polly dev we want to give you better
insight into how you're using web
components effectively in your
application to build a performant
application so a poly dev is is a chrome
plugin that goes into your dev tools
pain and it shows you the amount of time
spent in various custom elements that
you're using your page so in this
example this is the polymer summit site
and it spends a lot of time if you're
reloading between schedule and speakers
in the schedule grid and speakers grid
as you would expect but it's really
great for picking out particular
examples where you might be spending
more time than you think creating
certain types of elements and so it
gives you a nice visibility into what
you might spend time optimizing in your
application so this is in kind of a vein
of products that we want to help
ship to help better measure the
performance of individual components and
better see how those performance of
those components contributes to the
overall performance of your application
and so this is also available up on the
polymer labs organization / poly death
so finally a lot of the questions that
we get about building applications with
polymer revolve around these kind of
ideas you know how do i structure my
application how do I lazy load sections
of my app how do I handle how learn
handle routing how do I handle
internationalization and for so long in
web development the answer to all these
questions has been used a framework this
is what frameworks were built for to
make to provide this entire suite of
solutions for this kind of class of
problems around application structure
and you really needed to use a web
framework to be able to easily get these
things spelled out for you into in terms
of building application so for so long
you know we've been building these very
towering constructs in Java Script above
the platform really to give us any sense
of coherent organization of an
application but this can be kind of
brittle you can be like building you
know Jenga tower on top of Legos it
requires you to buy into an overarching
framework with you know all of the
things that cost that might come with
that you're adding layers of abstraction
between you and the platform in fact
you're not really building a web
application anymore you're building an
application on the platform that is this
other framework and then that framework
has to communicate with the web platform
so there's this huge urban direction
source of bug source of performance
overhead and also if a new platform
comes along as they tend to do or a new
framework comes along as they tend to do
you tend to have to throw out all the
components you've built for this
framework the framework components don't
interoperate the way web components do
and so web components as a new kind of
fundamental primitive that is in the web
platform give us an opportunity to
rethink a lot of the best practices that
we've taken for granted for so long in
terms of building applications in terms
of structuring applications so on the
polymer project we've been thinking
about this a lot we've been thinking
about how how do web components change
the way we can think about how to
structure an application top to bottom
they give us these really powerful new
primitives how can we apply them to
problems that you usually solve with a
framework so how might you solve a lot
of these problems how might you solve
routing how much
solve internationalisation how might you
solve application structure using
components that you can swap in and swap
out when a new one comes along that you
can only pay as you go only pay for the
features that you're actually using in
your application so we talked about the
carbon elements project a little bit at
the polymer summit it's still a work in
progress but this is our solution it's
what we're naming our solution for
structuring top-to-bottom applications
using components and leveraging
components and we want these to be our
goal with the polymer alloy with the
carbon elements is they should be as
close to the platform as possible they
should be again as thin sugaring layer
to be able to give you this coherent
structure without making you buy in to
entire framework mate without making you
buy in to all this overhead in
JavaScript and we want them to leverage
the best of the platform we want them to
be kind of the best most elegant pieces
that the web platform has we want them
to really use those to their fullest so
that it's easy to build these things
with carbon islands but we also want you
to be able to swap out a different
element to solve a different problem if
you want to use a different router we
want that to be easy and we want we
don't want to lock you in you want these
components to really be a plug and play
and so these are still very much a work
in progress obviously building a whole
set of components these are big wide
swath of problems to solve which are
very challenging problems to solve but
I'm really happy to announce our first
kind of piece of this that we're opening
up today which are the apt layout
elements so the app layout elements try
to solve the problem of you know how do
i structure the layout of my application
how do I get this responsive layout and
so we've had a few of these types of
components in previous element sets that
we've had paper elements had paper
header panel drawer panel those were
very much targeted toward material
design type layouts the app layout
elements are meant to be much more
general solutions for structuring
application so these are things like you
know a responsive drawer panel a
scrolling header panel that you can
compose together but we want them to be
way more flexible we want them we want
you to be able to not just use them for
material design language but to be able
to extend them and compose them together
to create just about any kind of app
layout design that you could possibly
want and so one example of a pattern
that the app layout elements allow if
you wanted a responsive layout but you
wanted tabs across the top on desktop
and you wanted those same menu items to
go into a
i Nev on mobile and this is something
that you couldn't do with the paper
layout elements with the app layout
elements you can do this it's
specifically meant for flexible types of
adaptive UI in this sense so really
really would love to get feedback from
everybody on the app layout elements
there also under polymer labs there's a
nice splash page with some documentation
about how you can get started using them
and Rob who's talking next we'll get
give a little bit more about these a
playout elements so the other features I
talked about are very much a work in
progress we will open these up as soon
as there's something to play with in
terms of routing internationalization
and lazy loading and last but finally
not least I definitely want to give a
big thank you to our incredible
community these were some of the most
active contributors to the polymer
library and the polymer project overall
in terms of pull requests in terms of
great issues with great repros in terms
of just support in our community on our
mailing lists on our slack channel so
thank you so much the project would not
be anywhere near where it is without
this group of people and this is by no
means a comprehensive list there are
many more that have dedicated a huge
amount of time and really really help
the project grow we also hope that this
list continues to grow as more people
get involved so thank you again so much
everyone
and yeah thank you yeah so I'm excited
to see where the polymer project goes
please keep up with us on the polymer
blog and follow us on twitter at polymer
and thank you so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
