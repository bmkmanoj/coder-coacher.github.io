back to ask polymer the show where you
send in your hashtag questions and we do
our best to answer them on air so today
we're gonna lead off with a question
that a lot of people have asked which is
how do you get your hand to show up in
the screencasts that you record so it's
a really great question we've actually
got a pretty elaborate rig that we've
built that allows us to do this we've
got a camera mounted above a Wacom
Cintiq tablet and then we use a free
program called Omni dazzle that lets us
draw on the screen we do all of our
screencasting in Camtasia and we take
all of that and we throw it into a big
keynote deck we just walk through that
and record the whole thing mash it
together in post so it's a it's a pretty
cool setup and it allows us to do that
really awesome effect all right our next
question comes from Jay who asks does
polymer play nice with typescript and
are their official type definitions for
polymer so a great question Jay there
are not official definitions that have
been created by the polymer team however
they definitely typed repo on github
does have polymer definitions which you
can use to get up and running with
typescript and polymer in your project
I've used them a little bit in a kind of
an angular 2 experiment that I did so
you can use those through they're not
fully featured if you will but they will
get you started rolling with typescript
and polymers so thank you Jay for
sending in that question all right our
next question comes from Thomas who asks
how do I go about including a
third-party library in my polymer
elements so good question there Thomas
what I would recommend is creating an
HTML import that contains the script tag
for that third-party library and then
your elements can depend on that import
so you can see an example of this right
over ah from this chart jeaious element
set that I created there's an import for
charge is everybody else depends on that
so hopefully in the future authors just
Bend those imports for us but today
that's the workaround that we recommend
and and I should add the reason we do
that is so you can have multiple
elements depending on that thing and
HTML imports we'll just D duplicate it
for you so great question
Thomas thank you for sending that in all
right our next question comes from
Wheatley who asks what would be the
suggested way to do routing in Nepal
application excellent question Wheatley
what I would recommend is you go check
out a previous episode on using page J s
that is actually how I've been doing it
in my applications we also did an
episode on an element called more
routing but it's a little not so well
maintained these days so I'd recommend
sticking with page J s also if you're
interested you can check out over here
this thing that we've been working on on
github called web component shards so
that actually allows you to take your
your element bundles and break them up
into pieces and maybe lazy load them
this is still very experimental but this
might be our long-term solution to
allowing you to lazy load stuff with
your router so thank you so much
Wheatley for sending in that awesome
awesome question alright our last
question comes from Paul who asks are
there plans to add paper elements for
date and time Pickers great question
Paul we want to make sure that before we
go and create new elements that we've
got our current paper elements as
buttoned up as possible so that means
you know fixing bugs on them making sure
that they're really polished the API is
do everything everybody wants so there's
no near-term plans to add those extra
elements because we want to focus on the
set that we currently have however
having said that there are community
members who have created their own
implementations to play with these so
you can check out a date picker here and
a time picker over here those are also
available on custom elements io so you
can browse through some of the elements
on that site so yeah maybe go try those
out and they might meet your needs thank
you so much for that really awesome
question Paul so that's it for today
thanks to everyone who sent in questions
if you out there have questions you want
us to answer you can ping us on a social
network of your choosing at hashtag ask
polymer as always thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you next time
