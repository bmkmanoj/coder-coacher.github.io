welcome back to the allagash show today
we're going to be talking about color
contrast so in a nutshell contrast is
really the difference between two colors
you know if you imagine a color wheel
you have two colors that are kind of
like far apart on the color wheel are
like polar opposites on the color wheel
those colors are going to have like a
lot of contrast because they're really
really different whereas if you take two
colors that are very close together on a
color wheel it's going to be harder to
tell the two apart
now the reason why this is important in
web design is because oftentimes our
whole goal is to convey some information
to the user usually through your like
text and images but if the contrast of
our text is a little too subtle and too
mixed in with a background it might be
difficult for the user to read the page
and that might sort of degrade the user
experience so what I wanted to do today
is walk through some of the process I
use to just sort of like check the page
and figure out if it has appropriate
contrast and how to tune it up if I find
some issues but to start all we over
here in my laptop and I've got a little
presentation I want to show you like I
walked through sort of how we measure
contrast on the web so here I've got a
set of text boxes on a white background
and up above you can see I've got these
numbers up here for some contrast ratios
right so I'm measuring sort of in terms
of luminance the difference between this
foreground color and this background
color now on the web we actually have
guidelines which try to instruct us what
are sort of contrast minimums should be
so the web content accessibility
guidelines in section 1 dot 4.3 they say
that for like body text you want to aim
for a contrast ratio of around 4.5 to
1/4 like smaller text or sort of your
general body copy for larger text
something that is 14-point bold or 18
point you can kind of ratchet that
contrast ratio down just a little bit
two to three to one so if we go back and
we look at our image here of contrast
we've got kind of these first two
examples would meet that minimum
contrast requirement right so this one
it's just pure black on white so it's
fifteen point nine to one that's that's
really high contrast this one's a little
bit more of a subtle gray but we still
have five
seven to one which is pretty nice these
last two though are just a little too
little contrast there wouldn't quite
meet that requirement we can also
actually bump this up though there is a
enhanced contrast recommendation in the
web content accessibility guidelines as
well so this is for situations where you
might have you sort of know that you
might have either in older audience or a
low vision audience and in that case we
can bump back on stress ratio up to
seven to one or four point five to one
for just a regular body text so if we go
back and we look at this example here
really only this first one would meet
that kind of like enhanced contrast
ratio requirement so consider who your
audience is going to be when you're
building your site or application and
then that can help you decide sort of
where you want to aim on the contrast
ratio a scale I use a number of
different tools try and figure out you
know if I'm nailing those contrast ratio
minimums and actually my friend Louise
has done this really cool thing where he
has put together a accessibility testing
for the web handbook called oatmeal
which stands for open accessibility
testing methods for experts and lay folk
and he actually has a whole guide in
here on how he measures color contrast
and the folks on his team do that and so
we're going to kind of follow this guide
a little bit we're not going to use all
the exact same tools so this is a really
cool methodology that you can check out
and use in some of your own apps to
maybe figure out your process so what
I've got here is I've got a website
called the accessibility blog and we're
going to follow two of the steps in that
oatmeal guide doing sort of a
semi-automated check using a tool like
axe and then we'll do a more sort of
manual spot-check using a wicked color
contrast analyzer so starting on this
site the first thing I do is pop up on
my dev tools and I've already installed
the axe extension for Chrome if you
actually check out our previous episode
on alley casts and I'll leave a link to
this down of the show notes we covered
all the different ways that you can
install axe on your system so I'm just
using the the extension for chrome here
and I'm just going to open it up check
out this page and hit the analyze button
and you'll see that it tells me over
here on the left that I have a few
elements that do not have sufficient
color contrast I got about seven issues
here it'll try and give me a CSS
selector to the to the elements that
needs some work
but there's an inspect button that I
often use we'll just inspect the element
in the Dom and I can kind of scroll up
and say okay who exactly is this alright
so we're starting off with these little
anchors up here in our in our navigation
and you know this is one of those areas
that I see a lot where it looks like
we're actually pretty close to having
good contrast here but we're sort of
like on the bubble it's a little unclear
you know I'm sorry are we hitting that
or not and so it all all I can do is
I'll take this foreground color and I'll
take this background color right and I
can use another tool this one that I
often use is called leav aru's color
contrast checker so I will also include
a link to this down in the show notes
and we can just drop in our foreground
and that background color and we can see
that the contrast ratio of these two is
3.6 so it's not quite where we want to
be for smaller text again we want to
bump that up to about 4.5 so you know
this is an area where I know I need to
go back and since I also have some of
these elements right here that are even
lighter and since I know that this is
pure white text I can't make it any
brighter my only real option here would
be to make this this header bar a darker
blue so that all three of those those
links can pop a bit more another thing
that we might notice in our tool if we
sort of like step through some of the
options is that we also have areas down
here like this little subheading which
we got kind of like a subtle gray on
white thing going on and again we can
take that into Leah bruise color checker
we can figure out you know are we on the
bubble one option is we can you know if
we if we want we can make the text
bigger so we can maybe hit 3.0 contrast
ratio that's one option we just make the
text sort of larger if we're on the
bubble or we darken the foreground text
because the background is pure white so
we can't really like make the background
any lighter so we can go through and we
can work through our CSS and tune those
colors up and that's really what what a
tool like axe is doing it's actually
looking at the CSS values for background
and foreground but there are some
situations where a tool like the axe
inspector is not going to be able to
tell us if we have contrast issues and
that's in situations where we don't have
clearly defined
around background colors so for instance
over here on the right I've also got
this advertisement and you know these
are pretty common where you've got some
some text over an image background and
the text itself might even be an image
right so for a tool like ax it can't
pick out two distinct foreground
background colors so we need to use
another tool to figure out if we have
some contrast issues over here the tool
that I like to use is the what tag to
add a color contrast analyzer it's
another Chrome extension and I'm gonna
warn you it's a little bit buggy but I'm
going to kind of like walk you through
how I use it and maybe point out some of
the issues so you can work around those
but basically what we do here is is
after we've installed the extension
we've got this extension up here on the
top right click on that what I found to
be kind of an issue is on retina
monitors if you try and tell it to
analyze just a region and you select a
region it'll be sort of off like it sort
of zooms in and it just can't seem to
handle retina that well so instead I'll
tell it to capture visible content and
what it's going to do you can see it's
already sort of zoomed in but what it's
going to do it's going to try and scan
all the pixels on the page and it will
highlight sort of the contrast between
that pixel and sort of the the ones next
to it and pick out those areas where
you've got low contrast while it's
scanning it will take a while right so
it's only up to like 27% so far I can
walk through some of these settings for
you though so the first one here is
asking us what sort of level we're
measuring at so again I mentioned that
we have kind of the minimum contrast
ratio of 4.5 to 1 or you could take it
all the way up to like enhanced contrast
ratio 7 to 1 right so again you can
choose your target there then there's
also this pixel radius option and at
first I wasn't quite sure what this was
for
by default it's set to 1 meaning you
know it's going to sort of just compare
the two pixels right next to each other
but it goes all the way up to 3
oftentimes when we're working with text
on the page it's not a clearly defined
like you know the text ends here and the
page starts here instead it'll do sort
of like an anti-aliasing thing so if we
go and we look at our image of our text
this D here it's actually kind of three
colors right so we've got a couple of
Gray's and then the solid white and
that's what forms the body of that
character when it's asking us what pixel
radius we want to use it's basically
asking us you know what sort of like
anti-aliasing range
do you want to accommodate for so what I
do is I tend to set it to two and that
way I can analyze you know a couple
pixels sort of next to each other
all right cool so it looks like it just
finished and what it's doing here is
it's drawing these white outlines to
show us areas of high contrast and any
place where it gets a little noisy like
kind of like right in here we can tell
that we have slightly lower contrast if
we go over when we look at that ad you
can see okay yeah we definitely have
some issues here so up at the top where
it says developer friendly it seems like
it's doing okay I'm gonna kind of toggle
this mask on and off so if we hide it
we're going to see that when we get to
the body text inside of this ad it
actually is even more translucent than
the header and as we get down to the
bottom and it mixes with that background
it's really really tough to see so this
is an area where we know we might have
to go back to the designer and say hey
you know like I can show you this I can
kind of definitively prove that there is
kind of a contrast issue here and this
is a place where we need to maybe tune
it up either make the you know give the
text like a backing so it pops a bit
more or figure out if we can use a
different background image something
that doesn't interfere with the text as
much so yeah using these tools and using
a guide like oatmeal you can go through
you can analyze the contrast for your
site or application maybe look for
problem areas tune it up make sure your
users have a better experience that
about covers it for today so if you have
any questions for me as always going to
leave them down below in the comments or
hit me up on a social network of your
choosing
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time if you want
to learn more about color contrast we've
got some additional videos you can check
out in our playlist again thanks for
