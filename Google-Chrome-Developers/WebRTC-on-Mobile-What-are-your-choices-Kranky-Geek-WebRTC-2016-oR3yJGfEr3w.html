I really love coming here specifically
to San Francisco to this event to this
room or the room downstairs in the last
two times it's always a joy to be with
you all and what I want to talk to you
about is a bit on WebRTC on mobile I'm
not going to do a lot of that because
you know we've got better speakers for
that than me and the first thing I want
to talk about is our expectation when we
say web RTC and we think about you know
where it should run and how it should
execute this is what we have in mind it
needs to run everywhere it needs to run
on the desktop on browsers on mobile on
tablets everywhere but reality is
slightly different today reality is that
if you want to run WebRTC out of the box
the only place you can do that is inside
the browser and in specific browsers not
all of them supported today we're not
going to worry about it we're not going
to check why that's life that's how it
is what we're going to do today is speak
again how we end up getting Robert is
into mobile because mobile for us is the
most important platform today and the
reason it's so hard to get over to see
to mobile is the second part mobile is
also the most complex platform that we
have these days it's a smaller device
less CPU
we've got battery issues but then we've
got a lot more accelerators a lot more
sensors and information that we can get
in so we can get more context out of it
and we now we need to fit Robert T C
into that environment and we have two of
them we've got today iOS and Android ok
so the question that we asked is how do
you get to a party scene to mobile and
we wanted to make an event that would
answer that question in the best
possible way and the thing is that in
order to answer that question the first
thing that we need to do is to decide
well what mobile exactly is for us
because mobile comes in different shapes
and sizes there is the web application
part I can just run web applications in
the browsers or can develop applications
for the mobile device and these I can do
either
hybrid ones or native ones when you talk
about web applications we have two
platforms to think about okay iOS and
Android what we want to do is to get to
a party see to work inside the browser
now iOS doesn't work today with WebRTC
no matter what you try to do inside the
browser
you can't really go install a browser
and develop RTC work on it chrome
doesn't work with Robert II Siana on iOS
today and if in if even if it would do
you actually go on that a person to
install a browser on his device in order
to be able to run such a thing on it
doesn't make sense
on Android oh we have Firefox and Chrome
today that support WebRTC we have more
browser support WebRTC on Android
doesn't really matter one thing to
remember when you get here by the way is
that on many of the Android devices out
there Chrome isn't the default browser
that comes with the phone okay any of
you have an eye on LG or Samsung phone
okay have you noticed the fact that when
you open a URL it doesn't really go into
Chrome directly it goes to some other
browser instead that one doesn't support
WebRTC okay so you need to take these
things also into consideration and what
do you do then in the flow of your
application there are ways to do that
but not today the next thing that we are
going to look at is hybrid hybrid meets
a cross-platform applications we're
trying to build so we're not going to
build an application for a West and a
separate application for Android and
when you fix the bug in iOS you go and
fix the bug in Android and we need a new
feature where it here and we are it
there we want to use the framework or
some kind of a mechanism that would
allow us to develop ones and run many
and there are two alternatives when we
do that the first one is to use webview
for those of you who don't know webview
is simply getting an HTML page inside
the browser
that can render HTML pages and
JavaScript code okay the other
alternative is to use compiled code
so I write something in scripting
language one type or another even
JavaScript the codes get compiled for my
target device and then I can write all
of my application ones that application
logic ones and just the UI write it wise
to fit with different nuances and
modalities of iOS and Android okay but I
can now look at development and do it in
a different way now if you talk about
web views the way we do it is we take
JavaScript code because you know transit
HTML we need to run it in a webview we
they need to get that code to run on our
device one of the most popular ways to
do that is using Cordova or PhoneGap
there are others but this is the most
popular one and to get the J's code into
the device we just pass it through
PhoneGap and that does the magic of
getting that to run properly now to get
to a party C to run as well we just add
you know WebRTC plugin to PhoneGap you
go online you search you'll find two or
three of such plugins you can try them
out some of them work better some worse
but our alternatives out there the
second type is compiled code I need to
compile the code and Ronnie take a new
summer in and then use c-sharp react
native titanium accelerate up cell rate
or other such frameworks and platform
some open source some proprietary in
commercial today we're going to look at
react native later on in one of the
talks now when we talk about native
development what you want to do is to
run on the you know run natively on the
device and for that you need to take
WebRTC and split it for your application
and split it into three different parts
there's the application part which you
you know the code that's right today and
do very well how to achieve and then
there is a web RTC core engine and that
part is written in C or sibling C C++
and on top of it there is a kind of a
glue that will get the WebRTC
functionality that you need into your
application and when you talk about iOS
that glue is going to be up
active see in your application will be
either an objective-c or Swift or both
when we move to Android then that clue
is going to be j'ni your application
will be written in Java and there's this
minor complexity complication or detail
that all of the low-level media stuff
you need to access through Java and you
can't access through C code so you get
these libraries as well from the WebRTC
code but you need to know of these
different changes and architectures that
are there and then the question is which
one should we use should you go for a
web application a native one a hybrid
which framework do we need to take well
I I just have no clue I don't know it is
going to depend on you on your company
on how you work on the structure of the
team that you have in place on the
know-how that you have in the company on
the requirements that you have and on
what you want to achieve so what I
wanted to do today is to listen up to
the rest of the presentations that we
have we've got a lot of content for you
and to be more informed in what you're
going to do and to make better decisions
when you go to mobile so what we did was
collected the best speakers that we
could find really we found very good
speakers I'm very happy with the
speakers that we have and are going to
talk to you and to give you a lot of
information things that I haven't known
until yesterday when we did a lot of the
dry runs okay the first part of the day
we're going to look into the actual
operating system we will start by talkin
Android and then we'll move to iOS in
the details of what you need to do when
you go and pick the code from webrtc.org
and compile it and run it all the things
that you need to do the ugly stuff the
black work that needs to be done to get
things in place after that part we're
going to go out on a break then you'll
be able to mingle ask questions talk to
each other refreshments you know at the
cafeteria on the other side after the
break we're going to be back and then
we're going to talk about I'd say the
part of
somewhere between hybrid and native
development and we're going to have
sessions around using C++ as your core
cross-platform development which was for
me was very new to see someone does that
with Robert is he on mobile it was like
okay you know someone is really brave
and that's a very interesting talk then
we're going to listen for the react
native one how to get that done and what
happened there from there we're going to
segue a bit something that is really
necessary in mobile is to look at the
areas of quality and what we have is a
session around video quality on mobile
Mobile is a very hard environment to do
video on in real time over live networks
usually rawness okay and we'll have a
talk about how to do that well last but
not least in this part of the day we're
going to look at reverse engineering duo
people with is with us almost every year
and he is going to tinker it into Google
duo and is going to look at it and say
how it is built inside how Google
decided to build their mobile
application using WebRTC and what we can
learn from that afterwards we're going
to have additional an additional break
then a quick session by a girl develop
it and why we're doing these things with
them by the way it's hard to find women
that are willing to speak in these
events a cranky geek if you know someone
or you are someone please come to us so
that next year we will be able to put
here a woman that will speak I really
would love to see that happen then we
have the WebRTC team from Google that
will talk to us and share with us what
they have seen in the last year on the
market statistics what they are doing
the roadmap and last but not least again
we're having every year in San Francisco
and I'm very happy that we have you here
today again we have Tim he's our
magician usually does a demo on stage of
something very interesting he's also the
only guy in the room that is allowed not
to go through our drills before so he
didn't do a dry run via TAS which means
that for me it's going to also be a
surprise and as usual I'm sure that this
is going to be a very good surprise so
so thank you all and enjoy the day with
us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
