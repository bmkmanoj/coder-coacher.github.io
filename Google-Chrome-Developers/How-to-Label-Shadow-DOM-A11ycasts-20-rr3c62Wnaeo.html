welcome back to the alley cashew today I
want to talk about how we label elements
inside of the shadow Dom so this is a
topic that is kind of near and dear to
my heart so I do a lot of web components
work on my other show polycast and
recently I had a Googler reach out to me
who is trying to build some interactive
controls wasn't quite sure how to
associate them with a label element so
follow me over here to my laptop you can
see that I've got a head and I've set up
a little example so I've got a label
element here that just says first name
that's text content then inside I've got
a custom element that I've been working
on called element without label so this
is a custom element of it of shadow DOM
and if we go and look at the browser you
can see that what it actually renders is
just like a regular old input control so
if I go in my inspector I can see that
label layer and see that element there
and if I pop that open there's a shadow
root and then inside all I've done is
I've dropped a little input tag inside
of there right we can go and look at the
actual implementation for that control
even so element without label right here
yeah so we can see we're calling the
constructor we are attaching a shadow
Dom or shadow root and then just popping
an input in there so this I mean
visually like this works right we've got
a label and a control next to it and
someone you know just you know looking
at the screen could click on that
control but let's see what happens when
we try and interact with this control
using something like screen reader so
I'll turn on voiceover voiceover on
troll language shadow Dom fillet that
attacks blank so you see it just says
edit text blank there's nothing
associating it with that label even
though if you look at my illness
inspector I've used the for attribute
and I've pointed that this the ID for
this custom element well the problem is
what we're trying to label is this input
it's actually sort of like hidden inside
of the shadow boundary there and one of
the features of shadow Dom is that it's
scopes IDs to the shadow roots and this
is really useful for things like you
know CFS scoping your Styles making sure
they don't leak out on to the rest of
the page so if you're styling with
shadow Dom it's an awesome feature
you're trying to associate accessible
control some across the shadow boundary
this becomes a bit of an impediment
because our IDs our scope everything
with labeling work so on IDs so we're
kinda luck there right so there's two
approaches that you can use to work
around this issue the first is you can
sneak your own label into the shadow
route along with the rest of your
implementation the other approach is
that you can apply an aria-label inside
of the shadow route and you can just
kind of like pipe through your label
text so I will show you how to do both
of those starting with the first one
we're going to sneak a label into our
shadow route so back over in my code
editor I've got another element that
I've been working on so this one is
called element with label and the
implementation is pretty similar to that
that previous element I want to start
here talking about the constructor and
I'm going through of doing all the same
stuff I'm calling super I'm attaching a
shadow route this time I'm creating a
label element along with an input
element and then I'm giving my input and
ID so I'm just going to call it internal
input and then from my label element
that I've created I'm going to use its
HTML for property this is the same as
setting the for attribute so that's sort
of like the the mirror there so I'm
using its HTML for property to associate
it with my inputs ID I'm just going to
put both of those inside of my shadow
root now the the trick that I'm doing
here is I'm also creating a label
attribute I'm sort of exposing that to
the outside world and I'm using this
feature of custom elements called the
observed attributes callback here I'm
using this feature to say hey I observe
any attribute called label what that
does that tells the system if someone
you know mutates or modifies the label
attribute on my control it should run
the attribute change callback for that
control so I've got this little function
down here that I've implemented called s
where you change callback
and whenever label changes what it's
going to do is it's going to pass me the
name of the attribute to change the old
value and the new value so the little
trick I can do then is say all right
cool so someone set some label text on
me I can go to my little secret label
element here and just set its text
content equal to that new value and
because I've already created this
association between my little input and
that little label these things should
just play nicely let's go back to our
index file we will
drop this element in there as well as a
div this will be element with label
right and we're going to give it a label
attribute and let's see so the previous
wants the first name we'll have this one
say last name
save that and go back over to our app
cool that reload is they've got first
name and last name here now let's try
these in our screen reader and compare
the difference so turn on voiceover
voiceover on Chrome language in lenguin
shadow go ahead attacks
black black black name better text
voiceover off there we go so the first
one just said edit text white because we
didn't have anything associated with it
the other one says last name edit text
because we have that label Association
in the shadow Dom there now sometimes
you might be in a situation where you're
building an interactive control and
having like on-screen text doesn't
necessarily kind of like work with what
you're trying to do there so an example
would be like the classic hamburger menu
icon button thing that you see on a lot
of responsive websites so oftentimes we
don't have any like text so we wouldn't
necessarily want to use a label element
per se but we could use something like
Aria label to label that control so I'm
going to do that as sort of a second
example and show you how that works very
similar to what I did with the element
with the label and so I'm going to say
element with Aria label
cool all right this this implementation
is actually even a little bit simpler
than the last one because we don't have
to create that secret label element so
you check out the constructor here I'm
calling super I'm setting up my shadow
Dom and this time I'm just going to
create a button and we're going to
pretend like this is like a like a like
a fave button or you know favorite
button or something like that so my
buttons text content is just this little
emoji heart for lack of like a better
icon and I'm going to drop that into my
shadow root I'm still observing this
label attribute and observe attributes
and whenever that changes the trick this
time is I'm going to say all right cool
take that button set its Aria label
equal to the the new value text content
that came in from that attribute so over
in my index file and see how that works
so drop that in there so we'll say
element with Aria label this time the
label we will say like favorite
something like that so we go back and
look at our app cool I've got my little
Save button here
and let's try these with a screen reader
again
voiceover on drone any tax blank last
name edit tax favorite button voiceover
all right there we go
so you've got two approaches now to how
you can build accessible web components
you can sneak labeling into the shadow
Dom either with a little label element
or by piping through an aria-label I
also want to include a link down in the
show notes to some new standards that
we're exploring called the accessibility
object model which should hopefully make
this a little bit easier in the future
so you don't have to do these
workarounds but today these are the the
best practices that I use to make sure
if I'm building accessible controls with
shadow Dom but they have proper labeling
then mat covers it for today if you have
any questions as always you can leave
them for me down below in the comments
or hit me up on a social network of your
choosing at all ways thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
