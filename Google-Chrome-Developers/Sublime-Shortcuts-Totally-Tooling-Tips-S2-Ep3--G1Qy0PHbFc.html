for the most is in my editor like
sublime this is one of the nice things
that I've been realizing between sublime
and Adam and I think one of the nice one
of the main reason I keep on switching
between the two is some of the shortcuts
are exactly the same like the the
shortcut we just command or control you
click on a few different lines and then
you get the multiple cursors and then
anything you do or type is just
duplicated across all of those lines
it's super simple super nice and it's
exactly same in both did you know that
because so a lot of in browser developer
tools use code mirror for further editor
and because it now supports like sublime
text shortcuts are in a lot of cases you
can use command click and like I believe
it's chrome dev tools Firefox dev tools
and haven't checked out yet but yeah
maybe hopefully nice something someone
can file a bug for if it doesn't spring
so the bugs a shortcut that I use quite
a lot is command R and that basically
lets me go and look up a symbol so let's
say I'm working on a little utility
library and I want to search through the
methods command or would just like list
them out and a nice pretty list for me I
can easily just jump to any method nice
that's really cool it'd be really really
good if you'd get to a point where like
with es6 classes if it could point to
other files that you're importing in
this one yes I used to love that from
like all the ideas from what native
development yeah I think I want to say
that webstorm supports something like
that then I could be wrong I think
they're like some of their intellisense
stuff is intelligent enough to figure
that out no accent yeah I could be wrong
on top of top of command click another
thing you sometimes need is the ability
to smart replace do you do you do that
in Adam on don't know what it is ok so
smart replace is useful for like let's
say you've got the variable name or
namespace where you want to replace all
the instances of it very quickly and
you're working with a ton of different
variables
you just like select one instance of it
use a shortcut and you can just type in
whatever you want now replace it no I'm
just kind of nice so is that just a bit
more intelligent than some and I just
command F or whatever just for like find
and yes it's in case you need a little
bit more flexibility okay cool so one
thing so I love to do apps to do MVC
just casually drop that in then just
casually dropping it in you know if you
if you if you created to-do lists gallic
if the first to do is make it to do us
in the second is like check out the
first thing on the list you've already
done two things you can you can go off
and have tacos accomplished a lot so I
use I use a sublime shortcut I think
it's a shift mad l to select a line of
text and then I use another shortcut
that lets me like wrap that text inside
HTML tags and I can go and customize
what type of tag is actually in there
just kind of neat I've played around
this before but only through Emmet I
don't think Adam has that command but
it's super nice Suzy you just you hit
that one command at P tags to the like
the ends those lines and the next thing
you type is just you're going to replace
the P yeah and that tag is really really
simple that's pretty neat so I've used
I've used the Emmet plug-in for sublime
as well and it is pretty neat it's
actually a little bit more advanced than
the wrapping stuff I was showing before
like you've got I think with them it you
can actually supply complex class names
and tell it you know I want it to add a
variable that includes the current index
for each item in the list which can be
nice if you're working on a markup list
of some sort okay Emmett's entire thing
seems to be around trying to make you
spit out boilerplate code in the short
as possible film you can't yeah the
biggest woman I had with it and
generally with all these keyboard
shortcuts is like how do you remember
what the shortcut is to then use it
because the minute you've got it in your
head and you understand it it's fine
because at that point it's like it comes
down to muscle memory yeah but it's
getting to that point like how do you
remember the shortcuts do you think part
of
is just using them on a daily basis like
but the the stuff I was showing before
another circuit I got commonly is like a
line bubbling thing lets me move items
up and down and it's just the fact that
I use the lists a lot and my daily
workflow that makes me that forces me to
remember these things something that a
lot of my friends do is they actually
you're you are my friend colleague so
one thing that my friends do is they
like prints out a cheat sheet of the
shortcuts they use pretty commonly and
it looks like have it sitting right next
to their keyboard and they'll be looking
at it everyday and eventually you'll
remember it thanks colleague so that
actually kind of makes sense it kind of
sounds like one of those old blocks so
it's like this is the word of the day
and then you learned a new word every
day except you could just have a
keyboard shortcut yeah just on your
dessaline I said I'll put it out on some
paper it's great yeah I mean you're kind
of killing trees and what-have-you but
it's fine we'll just pretend that
doesn't exist trees trees can't give you
