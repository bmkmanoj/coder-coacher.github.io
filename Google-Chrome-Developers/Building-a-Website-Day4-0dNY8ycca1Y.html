with the images for the for the chrome
dev summit site the master images if you
look at what I've got on screen it's the
these mastheads images have the kind of
angular kind of cut off at the bottom
and I was thinking about this there's
kind of a couple of ways you could do it
one would be you actually just have the
image as a rectangle and then you can
overlay something on the top like a
triangle like say using SVG or something
and that's actually what I did in the
holding page the the kind of
announcement page here they're these
this is a slight angle on it which you
probably see if I make it a bit smaller
has a slight angle on it upwards but the
thing is when you've got that triangle
when it butts up to the this sort of
rectangular white rectangle above it in
this case and sometimes it's like a
hairline crack and I've filed a bug
against chrome saying are there's a
hairline crack on phones because of I
assume some kind of rounding issue to do
with you know not exactly lining up
anyway so I was like okay I need to find
a different way and I've been messing
around with SVG and it's been no it's
one of these things I just I could not
get it right here's what I actually had
right so I've got got the image and see
that kind of roughly works if you look
at it actually let me switch across to
vias code right what we've got is
there's an image which is a pattern so
there's there's a rectangle here which
uses the image as a pattern and it could
have been I think it could have been an
i could have used an image element
actually a square image and because this
was like kind of where I got to and then
the there's a clip path of this clip and
the clip is that they're kind of it's a
rectangle with a triangular bit at the
bottom and because of the view box
that's set it's sort of it's all kind of
kept broad in proportion I don't mind
the the angle of the triangle kind of
squishing in and out I it just kind of
has to look okayish for the for the
screen size it's on the problem is like
the the effect isn't what I
because the image is kind of getting
smaller and shrinking to the bottom and
that's because it's X mid WiMAX on the
on the preserve aspect ratio so I was
like okay why don't we do preserve
aspect ratio nan but then you get you
get that which is like ya nuts can't so
now the clip is kind of doing what I
want right it's always clipping there
but the obviously the photos getting
squashed yeah so and the and it's also
the case that if I do like X made Y mid
which is kind of what I want from the
photo as then I want the photo to run
the screens really widen you can't
really see it here and if i zoom if i
zoom out like it doesn't it doesn't
spread whereas with the anyway it this
isn't working for me right so but Chris
Koya thanks Chris yes has a post on CSS
tricks which I guess will make sure it
goes into the description which talks
about using SVG as a clip for non SVG
content which is pretty much what I've
got here and in fact that's what I've
got gone ahead and done over here in
index page now you can see I've got the
image doing what the image does and
that's just basically it's just a div
with the background and it's set to
background size cover and if I don't
have the clip on it there we go if you
don't have the clip on it you can see
just kind of that kind of pretty much
there's what I wanted to do and then I
can use media queries to make sure that
you know if I need a small image
whatever but you know I switch on the
clip path and the clip path is just
basically this SVG with a clip path
that's defined by the objects bounding
box so it basically maps to the the a
normalized version of those previous
like view box values where one is the
height maximum height and one one one
zero zero anyway that all now works
so it's just more than dove cracked that
particular problem for now which is kind
of a weight off the only thing that
really caught me out when I was looking
around was like I couldn't get clip path
to work it doesn't throw any kind of
warning or error in Chrome it just
doesn't do anything it's still WebKit
prefixed but yet it's got a line through
it saying it's being overridden by this
so I think I'm going to file a bug that
says it should be one of the other we
should kind of put something against
clip path it says actually I don't
support clip path or if we do we should
actually support clip path rather than
WebKit get WebKit clip path Wow didn't
realize that was going to be a hard word
to say today so there you go
clip in with SVG on non SVG elements
that should mean that I can do this kind
of effect and then have you know other
stuff behind it peeking through and all
the rest of it which is exactly the
effect that I want and I didn't know
exactly how I was going to achieve it oh
wait off don't forget to subscribe if
you want to catch more of these videos
and you can check out the code on github
I've been pushing stuff there
