encapsulates a chunk of web history so
nicely but this one does I found this
while was prepping for this presentation
this is Vlad Buki Javitch who helped to
create WebGL Mozilla saying in April 6
2014
I've been hacking with this new oculus
virtual reality thingy and then Brandon
Jones of Google says like ok interesting
maybe I can get that working in chrome 2
and that tweet triggered three and a
half years now of what is called web VR
virtual reality on the web and over
those three and a half years we've seen
this explosion of developers using a new
breed of tools to create experiences
that don't look like the classic web but
they are the web all built on WebGL on
frameworks such as three Jas running in
the browser with all the things that we
love about the web loading instantly you
know for cable from github repo
something anyone can publish and we've
seen in the last three and a half years
all these new tools emerge tools like
a-frame 3GS which we already mentioned
Babel and Jas adding web VR supports and
then WYSIWYG tools such as visor play
canvas hologram there's a whole new
generation of tools making it fun to
create virtual reality content on the
web and we now stand on the cusp of 2018
and one of the messages as I was
thinking about what to talk about today
was really to hammer home this message
it's been three and a half years of
gestation but this is the year that Web
VR goes mainstream and this is what I
mean
virtual reality is a pre fragmented
landscape but the one constant across
all of it will be web VR running from
cardboard to daydream to gear VR oculus
vive and Windows mixed reality web VR
will run in some cases on multiple
browsers and not just desktop mobile
browsers but a new generation of
browsers
designed to be used inside a virtual
reality so you can put on a headset and
view any website ever made including new
fixed e360 experiences without taking
your headset off so what we want to do
today is tell you a little bit about
what's coming next in 2018 first we're
going to hear from Steve's gonna talk us
to us about what it's like to make web
BR content today and to build a business
around that and then from Brandon Jones
who is working to define and implement
the next version of the web via our API
so first up Steve hey everyone I'm Steve
Thompson I'm the founder and CEO pastor
and we're a creative studio based in Los
Angeles and London and we work with the
movie studios creating ticketing
destinations and showtimes and we also
have a labs component which has lots of
experimental stuff going on and web VR
started out in labs and we're really
excited to turn it into a viable product
that we actually sell to the industry
cool so here's a example of video of
what we're up to and we create these
immersive experiences designed for the
web where you can watch the trailer in
3d which is a unique case for web VR and
you can also see the show times and
tickets directly in front of you in 3d
space and the cinemas actually geolocate
and space themselves out really nicely
based on how far away they are and so
it's quite a quite compelling experience
quite fun and it's quite immersive and
so we built these with the studios and
the reason why is because we get amazing
data back we get amazing information on
the consumer but more importantly these
actually perform more successfully than
our general ticketing pages so users are
more engaged they're checking out more
cinemas they're looking at more show
times and that makes a really great
business case I think wherever you can
find a really unique thing that only web
VR can do that's where you can build a
business off of it so we've identified
that you can watch the trailer in 3d
which normally you'd have to
to the cinema to do that and only when
you're watching a 3d movie so that's
like you really convert it at that point
so you it will help with a 3d upsell but
it also allows for the studio to really
sell the movie in an immersive
environment and which is pretty nice and
so how did we do this it's obviously a
little bit different to your usual
prototyping and building phases usually
you're designing on 2d paper for then 2d
wireframes to go onto a 2d website where
as we did initially have a look at
different methods of like prototyping
web VR and sketches and wireframes are
actually really important still and it's
amazing for the UX and UI designer to
dive into them and our UX designer Rob
he you know sketches are all out and
those awesome things but then when he
wants to communicate that to other
people like how do you jump from those
wireframes those t 2d illustrations and
actually convey VR and it's definitely a
challenge and this was working on our
website trailered comm which displays
all the movies and cinemas around you
and actually one of the great ways to
show your colleagues how it all works
and how it looks is to jump into VR so
you know actually drawing inside tilt
brush or and yeah it's like an amazing
way to communicate it just jump in
sketch it out put the headset on and you
can see it in 3d space it was kind of a
bit of a hard moment for us where we
discovered how to actually do it
and it's something you can add to your
toolkit just jumping in and trying it in
web in real VR and then taking it to
your production afterwards and nothing
beats previewing VR then doing VR sake
that's why we've done it and so yeah
that's a really quick intro to what past
has been up to in Webb VR
hopefully you can identify a vert in
your vertical a unique business case for
it and then be able to present it and
pitch it to your clients and make a
business out of it and now I'm gonna
hand over to Brandon that's gonna take
you through some coding stuff
so I'm Brandon Jones and I'm the spec
editor and one of the primary engineers
for the web view our API on Chrome and I
wanted to catch everybody up on where
that API is at where we hope to go and
then talk through some best practices to
tie into the type of content the state
and his team were building so first off
we've been running with VR an origin
trial for a little while and this has
proven to be a massively helpful thing
for us as the developers of the API
because we've gotten incredible feedback
from the community both individual
developers and you know larger Studios
about what's working what's not we also
kind of get some feedback on the side
about seeing where developers are doing
things that we'd rather not have them be
doing and designing ways to then go and
discourage that kind of behavior and so
we've been able to collect all of this
information together and we've been
using it to build what we refer to
internally as the web vr 2.0 API now
eventually when this does come out it's
not going to be 2.0 product it will be
just web VR but that's how we
disambiguated it internally and the big
focus here is that we're going to try
and enshrine some of the best practices
that we found through all of the origin
trials that we've been running and just
baked them into the API and make it
wherever possible impossible to do the
wrong thing we're going to be hopefully
starting the origin trials for that
version of the API in early 2018 and
while there will be a little bit of
overlap to allow for developers to
transition their titles from one to the
other or their pages will be retiring
the current version of the API sometime
after that it's available if you want to
see what the API looks like it's
available as an explainer today and we
have a spec in progress and the nice
thing is that every browser vendor who
is shipped a one web vr1 one
implementation the current version has
committed to transitioning to the new
version at some point
now when I talked about enshrining some
of the best practices into there I
wanted to go through over a couple of
examples of what we mean by that the
first of which being what we call magic
window now magic window is kind of the
staple of content like stays team was
doing where it allows people who don't
have the VR hardware or simply don't
want to use it right now - still peek
into that virtual world and see what
kind of content they could see if they
bothered to get their headset out or you
know had the hardware available but in
the first version of the API this was
kind of just a side-effect it didn't it
wasn't really something that we designed
for specifically and as a result it was
kind of easy to get wrong so in the new
version of the API we're making this
first-class citizen allowing it to use
the same render loop as the normal VR
content and really trying to drive home
the fact that you can build the content
once it will work in VR and in magic
window and we really want to encourage
people to do this tying in to that in
order to allow us to use a single render
loop for both VR content and that magic
window style content we're switching
over to what we call a prescriptive
rendering model whereas in the old API
you would generally draw a WebGL frame
and then tell the browser how you drew
it in the new version of the API we're
going to have it tell you what's
required for drawing frame and then you
do it this down sounds more restricting
but in the end it will actually allow
the browser to make much more
intelligent choices about how your
content is shown and you know
automatically increase the number of
devices that you're included on if you
have a stereo display that comes out in
the future that's not necessarily VR but
could still show 3d imagery we have the
potential under this model to
automatically upgrade your content to
support it
and then finally one of the things that
we've heard a lot of feedback from was
input we were previously exposing
everything through the gamepad API and
found that a lot of developers were
reinventing the same wheels around that
API to try and make their the input a
little bit more palatable one of the
most common things that we would see is
people doing what we refer to as ray
based input where depending on if you've
had a actual controller or gaze based
input or something like that everybody
was having the system where you would
have a pic ray and then some basic
button to actually select the thing at
the end so we're taking the models like
that that we saw everybody doing and
actually enshrining them into the API
and making it something that just works
by default here's a quick example of how
that particular item would look where we
have a single select event that then
would come in and you'll be able to get
some information about the Ray that is
actually projecting off into the scene
and use that to pick geometry out of
your scene and this would work across
both high-end and low-end VR hardware
and magic window now anytime we change
ap eyes it's a difficult thing to get
people to migrate so we're doing
whatever we can to help that migration
be easier there's going to be a period
of overlap as I said before between the
two AP eyes so you can test both
versions at the same time and make sure
that you're getting content parody's you
go across we're working with Mozilla to
develop a polyfill that will not only
allow content to work on devices with no
support for the API they'll be able to
use your phone's accelerometer to create
kind of a fake best effort
implementation on devices like iOS but
will also help map from the old API to
the new and vice versa
so you can use it as a method of easily
porting over content and then we're
going to be working directly with
libraries such as
a frame three j/s to ensure that they
have support right out-of-the-box now
there's a couple of best practices that
we found that we can't really encode
into the API itself but we do want to
encourage developers to continue using
one of those is splash screens now this
is something that chrome is actually
going to
sort of force people to do because what
we don't want to have happen is for
people to say hey I want to view this VR
content put on the headset and then just
stare at the black void for multiple
seconds so we're going to have a
requirement that says once you go into
VR you have to show the user something
anything within about five seconds and
the best way to do that is to have a
static splash screen as is shown in this
animation here now the splash screen
itself doesn't have to be anything fancy
it can just be a single image that you
draw one time and then just let the
system automatically reproject it if you
draw the frame once the the
head-tracking within most VR systems
will allow it to stay stable in spaces
as users looking around and this gives
you a little bit of leeway where the
user can actually see something while
you're doing heavier weight loading in
the background
next we really really want to encourage
people to design your experiences around
the idea of or around the limitations of
the mobile platform certainly with Web
VR we're going to have access to both
the highest of the high end the oculus
rifts and the HTC vibes of the world and
then the low end with cardboard and and
everything else in between but if you
want that right once run everywhere
magic that the web promises you really
do need to focus on developing a great
experience for mobile first and then
ensure that you can spiffy it up a
little bit for the high end this seems
kind of obvious but we do see developers
who build something on desktop and then
despair when they've only left a week
behind to actually optimize for mobile
so we want to encourage people to get
away from that and then finally we want
to really encourage people to think of
VR not as the main course for any given
webpage but as kind of the dessert the
the thing that you really want people to
go the extra mile to see but most people
will not see it that way the fact is
that there may be a few million VR
devices in the world but billions of
people can still reach your page
standard web browsers and we don't want
to hang a sign on the store on the door
that says no VR no service
so by relying on the magic window
modality and allowing people to see and
interact with these virtual scenes
through their normal screen you get to
invite that much larger audience in and
then for the lucky few who actually have
the appropriate hardware you can give
them the best experience possible few
other updates for web VR as far as the
ecosystem goes one thing that I know a
lot of people are going to be excited
about is we are bringing desktops or to
Chrome not the little experimental
versions that have been floating around
on the web for a while but actual stable
chrome that will be coming in origin
trial form in early part of 2018
probably roughly in coinciding with the
2.0 API being available and then the
other thing is that we're making web the
art of it excuse me web VR experiences
accessible on the daydream homescreen
through what are called discovery tiles
and they just transitioned off there but
those are large tiles that if you're
familiar with a daydream those ones you
can see you can swipe through them and
and it highlights new experiences and
interesting experiences that are
available on the platform we're enabling
developers web VR content to highlight
their experiences there and link
directly into them a couple of other
things I want to highlight really
quickly is that we also have some great
support libraries from Google such as
songbird which is a high-quality
spatialized audio library does Amba it
boils down your spatialized audio into
an ambisonics audio stream that takes
into account room modeling and all sorts
of other cool audio buzzwords and Drako
which is a 3d geometry pression library
that does a spectacular job of shrinking
down the amount of data that you
actually need to send over to the user
system I've heard the number 20 percent
or 20x smaller meshes being thrown
around in relation to that so it's
definitely something worth checking out
now
VR is great but we also don't want to
ignore the upcoming trends in augmented
reality and so to talk to you about that
I'm going to pass it over to Josh
carpenter again because why when one
thing hits the mainstream you get bored
and start working on the next thing and
we've talked mostly about virtual
reality and virtual reality is about
transporting you to a different world
feeling like you're 10,000 feet up and
getting sweaty palms so then what's
automated reality about well augmented
reality is about bringing the digital
into the real world so you have a
seamless blend of the two and and right
now if you've been paying attention to
anything in technology you know that you
can talk to anybody and get a different
opinion on when we're gonna get walking
down the street with a pair of glasses
and the inability to distinguish the
real from the virtual but I think it's
safe to say a couple things as you're
walking down that Street sometime in the
future I you're gonna be seeing a sea of
information all around you tons and tons
and tons of information billions of
nodes of a content and as you walk down
that Street I that contents gonna come
from a ton of sources tons of very
different origins I walk by the subway
you want to get the information for the
subway just in time not by pre
installing an application you just want
to get it
serendipitously and instantly and and
with all those different origins you
want that to be safe and secure and you
want your privacy to be maintained if
you're driving down the street you don't
want someone to put a billboard in the
middle of the freeway in front of you
and cause an accident for example it
sounds silly but I don't think it will
be and lastly not everyone's gonna have
these fancy glasses and this information
is important if it's the subway or the
airport of the hospital that information
has to be accessible by anybody who
walks through the front doors whether
they have fancy glasses or they have an
old iPhone right now call me crazy
this sounds a lot to me like the web and
if you're sitting in this room I'm going
to assume that you probably wish the web
had been a little bit stronger in mobile
I mean we've done a lot of work as a
community all different browser vendors
everyone who builds tools since 2007 and
before to make the web amazing on mobile
but now I've been there
felt like trench warfare at times you
know wouldn't it be nice to get ahead of
the next big thing we believe that that
is our imperative if we care about the
web and if we think the web is going to
be an amazing fit maybe the fit for the
future of augmented reality computing so
we have to start now and in August over
the summer smartphone AR had a moment
we've been waiting for glasses and it
turns out the beachhead was in our
pockets and by this time next year it
seems like we're gonna have hundreds of
millions of devices in our pockets small
supercomputers that can do entry-level
augmented reality so motion tracking
compositing the virtual and the real
world exposing basic features of the
world such as like horizontal planes and
and when we saw that we wanted to make
sure that what was there from day one
and so in August google announces a our
core AR core is designed to bring
smartphone augmented reality to Android
all those Android devices out there and
the team that I work with inside of
daydream worked to create prototype
browsers that are built on experimental
three standards api's to expose the
power of AR core but not just a our core
also a our kit on iOS to web developers
so we can begin to explore what the use
case is what the prototypes are of this
new competing computing platform to
inform future standards to inform future
api's and we release these open source
and you can get them at the URL at the
bottom there release them with a 3GS
library so a lot of the experimental
bits are abstracted away from you and
hopefully you can continue to use at 3GS
library in the future once real
standards emerge and they expose
that stuff I mentioned before like six
degrees of freedom positional tracking
of the device in space additional
interracial tracking rendering the
camera exposing horizontal plans and
what's really cool I think about where
they are and I'm a UX engineer for
background and so I'm not a software
engineer by any means I kind of packed
my way through 3GS but I've done a lot
of what they are now and I was able to
pick up the web a our tools made by my
colleagues and begin to start creating
content same day because web AR is built
in large part on web VR including a lot
of the same tools so these are some
things you've been creating in-house the
hello world of a-all right now seems to
be $6 fede playing around with 2d 2 VR 2
AR controls
playing around with seamless transitions
between states and also CSS 3d
transforms you don't need to use WebGL
which I'm really excited about we've
also seen the developer community
respond to this again taking tools like
react VR and then putting them into
these AR browsers or a friends at
archaeological you may have seen demoing
today exploring what it looks like to
purchase furniture by drawing a space
and then telling it what style you want
and having that space fill up with that
furniture alright so there's just one
rub right now which is that these are an
experimental browsers web Arna our kit
which is a great name it requires you to
build from source using Xcode we're not
going to see a lot of uptake so long as
it's true so we need to get the real
standards so the next step for that is
we're going to publish an explainer we
being not just Google but Google and the
other key browser vendors publishing
explainers soon talking about what is AR
what is intersection of AR on the web
and how can we move forward together I
want to call out some really amazing
collaboration between the browser
vendors to make this happen it's really
really exciting to me having been there
for the duration of web VR the degree to
which web AR is getting traction from
the get-go is pretty mind-boggling it's
very exciting
and then second tier and this is I think
where we all come in more experiments
because to make those eventual standards
better we need to build things try
things learn from each other and so it
encouraged you
to start creating and experimenting with
the tools that are out there hit us up
on Twitter Brandon and I are very
available we'd love to talk to have to
see what you're making and you know
let's build the next generation of the
web starting now
so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
