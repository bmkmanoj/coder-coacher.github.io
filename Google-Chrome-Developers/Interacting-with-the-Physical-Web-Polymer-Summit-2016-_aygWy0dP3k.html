spoken at now Google i/o and at chrome
dev summit about the physical web I
don't want to redo this too often how
many folks here I've heard of the
physical web can I get a show of hands
so about half of you so what I'm good do
is do a quick overview of what it is and
then talk about how it can be used and
have a little demo using polymer at the
end the idea about the physical web is
that we've been working really hard to
make the web work on mobile phones and
we're getting really good at responsive
websites or quicks websites to get it
smaller and faster and to kind of work
on pages but we're not really tackling
the issue of making them useful in a
mobile context so let's say for example
that you're touring an area you want to
find information about where you are or
in a sense that you want to get some
transit information from the bus that
you're currently on just having URLs
like paint it up on the wall isn't
necessarily the most useful way to get
people out of your website or even
events like this when we want to be able
to like get information like right now
we have physical web beacons in this
room and you can pull down and see them
in your notification manager to actually
get the schedule of the event and so
many people want to use QR codes
occasionally but QR codes haven't always
really taken off as best as they had
been they've they have a certain issues
like if you have them in this room you'd
have to like stand up and go over to
take a picture the QR code now I don't
make too much fun of the polymer demo
with the polymn on because they're
actually showing off a really cool web
media the queries within the app so I'll
give them a pass but there's this
basically this really lovely flowchart
but says should I use a QR code you
maybe you've seen this on the web it's
should i use you know QR code no
but what if oh my god no because let's
be you know if you happen to have the
app the QR code installer yes you can
make it work but so many companies have
tried this and it doesn't work and
engineers seem to be completely
convinced that it works have you guys
seen the tumblr that has pictures of
people taking QR codes it has like no
posts yet so QR codes are a fine idea
they just are very very limited in what
they can do in places like this with
large spaces being able to play with
stuff we need something else and so the
whole idea of the physical web is the
web needs a discovery service and that's
something bolted onto the side something
that's like the web itself so if you
were to have say something like a
vending machine and a bus stop and maybe
a parking meter and they're all
broadcasting URLs what's the experience
like when you walk into that space
because what you want things to do is to
wirelessly broadcast a URL and then
basically be able to provide a list of
things and the URL is a really good
start that's a good human readable thing
but you also would like to say have a
fav icon and a title and maybe a snippet
so that people could actually see what
it is and then if they tapped on it you
just take them to the website it's kind
of like a QR QR code but it's awesome
it's a big difference between them so
here's an example of how this would work
here's a parking meter demo I do we've
made this fake parking meter and you get
the little notification and off it goes
you pick the actual parking meter and
then you're done is the physical web
part is over now you're on a web page
that's using WebSockets so when you go
up up you just in an event and
increments and you hit pay and then it
just starts to go every time I show this
video in San Francisco people just cry a
little bit inside
because we actually have in a sense this
kind of system with a nap but nobody
ever uses it now I will admit to one
little cheat here I didn't show the pay
up signup flow right which an issue
people always ask well are going to use
google pay like i don't care it's the
web use bitcoin the idea is that it's
anything that you want to use now with
the first pass through yes you'll sign
up but then you get a cookie and the
next time you go through it it'll be
exactly like that and that's what we're
trying to do so to a certain extent the
physical web is trying to bridge the
physical world and the web type of idea
so it's open like the web we are open
source we're actually on github so
please go to physical desh web org you
can see all the videos i'm going to show
you and all the source code we've got an
android app a mac ios app a nodejs app
that's the lovely thing about open
source people are really kind of adding
enough a lot to it and it's really meant
to be a simple open way for people to
find discover URLs it's also just a web
page we're so used to thinking of the
web as this place to get effectively a
big giant portal so you go to coke come
and you drill your way down well what
we're trying to do is to flip it around
and we go to this particular vending
machine or this particular bus stop a
completely inverts the whole process and
gets these are right to what they need
at that point it's kind of different way
of looking at it the other thing is it's
about this idea of walking up and using
there's so much app fatigued today that
if you're walking through like a mall
and there's some type of vending machine
it's like just install an app that's no
one's going to do that so we're trying
to make this as like literally a tap and
you're in and the other thing that's
really important I get this question all
the time it cannot interrupt the user so
what happens is that we send a silent
notification that will be in the
notification bar but if you walk into a
really busy place with like 15 or 30 you
know beacons you get one silent
notification and when you tap on it
gives you that list now some people
early adopters are frustrated with us
because they really want to vibrate and
get people to kind of know about it but
we really want to be on the right side
of history here we really want people to
not feel that this is intrusive they
want and we want them to be part of it
so i have to say hey let me go see
what's around they pull it around and
they can tap on it and this is going to
slow down adoption a little bit but it's
going to be on the right terms people
are going to feel like they're part of
it we feel that's a really good way to
start I often get a lot of questions
about security as well and there's lots
of things that we're doing and of course
more we could do but let's just start
with the fact that the beacons send out
an advertising packet if you want to get
into the real details we're not using a
scan response packet because we want the
beacon to broadcast it and have no idea
if you've received it this keeps the
beacon from tracking you the user next
we're using a scanner proxy so that
effectively when you let's just try that
again use a scanner proxy so that when
we get all these URLs on the phone we go
through our proxy so then get all this
information so the website can't track
you and be able to do all of that now
the scanner by the way is open source so
if you want to do another scanner are
you something else you can do that
that's just what we're doing on our side
in addition there's of course the
browser sandbox we've been for 25 years
the browser's been working really hard
to make a safe place to execute code and
of course the last thing can do is just
simply best practices because in the
case of that parking meter money was
taking place you want to protect against
someone putting a malicious beacon in
there so clever things like you x two
factor authentication so that when you
walk up to the meter it might say hey
Scott if you want to be really careful
the website could say type in what's
showing on the meter so that you could
really make sure that you're talking to
the right meter so there's lots of
things we can do in addition to make
this really easy to do and safer to do
the other issue is about too many
results right now I'm thrilled before I
find one or two beacons there's right
now there's like seven or eight in this
room is kind of cool but we're starting
off with a pretty simple model of a
simple list ranked by distance coming up
next month and so that handles quite a
few things so that if you have a large
number of things the things that are
closest to you will be at the top but we
can easily add a few more things like
for example ranking by usage in that
sense that if you are in a mall and you
see the mall map but it's a very weak
distant
thing but everybody clicks on it will
raise that to the top if we really want
to get more fun we could do things like
using folders and organizing things a
bit more but again because this is all
open there's already two or three
Android browsers for the physical web in
addition to Chrome and there's like four
of them on iOS and they're all trying
different things using different
mechanisms of displaying and they're
just keeping us honest and we think
that's awesome that's how it should be
so let me give you a couple examples
because again people think of this is
just a URL what's the big deal I mean
come on just a page right so let's hear
some of the examples of we've built
here's a restaurant buzzer you pull it
down you're in Bob's Delhi it kind of
goes hey Bob's Delhi click on it
physical web is now done we're not going
to a page that says hey there's eight
people in front of you do you want to
push notification when it's your turn
when you push on it you're opting into a
push notification in which case then 15
minutes later when it's your turn you
now get a vibrating alert in your pocket
but the difference is that you asked for
it now keep in mind this isn't the
physical web this is the web of being
awesome we just got you to the web page
a little bit faster right here's another
one here which is a little toy called an
ally it's popular in the States it's a
Bluetooth controlled toy that has its
its app you can do but they've
publicized their commands so we had a
little beacon that broadcast it here it
shows up physical web and then we call
it little bro you click on little bro
and now you're on a web page that
downloads web bluetooth JavaScript and
now you can say oh I'm going to connect
to it we pick this and you're not
connected to little bro and once you
pair to it you can now control this toy
here's a little joystick and you're
driving across the floor now keep in
mind this device has no internet
connectivity at all you're just studying
bluetooth to commands to it so it means
you could do some very cheap little toys
and use everything for your phone this
is an example of a well to be safe it's
a fake pill bottle with a fake
prescription buy put my name on it um
just so that we kind of demo what it'd
be like because in about a year or two
we're going to start getting beacons
that cost about 75 cents that's still
way too much for most retail packaging
but for very high compliance drugs this
could be very useful broadcast a URL you
can get information and you know a lot
of times you get these draw
payment things in this big u-shaped
piece of paper they've unfolded 18 times
as the 17 different languages the web
gives you your language in default so
because the language that you need right
in front and guess what it can do a
YouTube video or other things it's just
a web page it's just information but
it's so much better than you had before
so this is a tiny tiny example how we
could use this here's one that we built
which is kind of a little voting booth
idea and the intention here is that you
can pull down and get the beacon for a
little voting booth this is kind of like
a high-end version to what Paul and Sam
just showed which is to say you get a
little web page that shows a thumb up
and a thumb down and when you press on
it it gives you a little voting and
whichever one is winning gets a little
hot dog background shape but we had a
little bit of fun as you slide around
the you can actually slide it back and
forth because we wanted people to be
obnoxious on purpose what up and down
and left and right and people have a lot
of fun with this and it makes for a much
more entertaining kind of really simple
lightweight thing to do again just web
sockets nothing fancy there and here's
the last one is this photo wall which is
people like to do selfies and so we have
this up in our office in Mountain View
and so it's a little URL that lets
people put up selfies and then browse
them we wanted to have both sides of it
we wanted have a browsing experience and
then by the way leave something so it
has a little page that lets you scrub
through and see all the selfies that
people have left all by browsing around
in your phone your phone is like a
trackpad but if you want to you can then
turn on the camera and then take a
picture then on your phone and again
just using a web socket it's going to
take a picture come on hurry up I only
have 20 minutes okay take the picture
and then once the photo gets taken it
shows up on the page and it's been
really fun having this up and running in
our office because people come by and
take pictures all the time and again
it's a lightweight interactive type of
idea again just using the web so when I
talk to people about this I get all
sorts of ideas because people kind of
conflate the physical web and the
Internet of Things now I like the
internet things a lot but it's a lot
more complicated and doesn't awful lot
of background processing and magic stuff
that has a lot more work to do we
just trying to get people started on a
simple web page so the first guideline I
give to people and doing the physical
wave is start with a web page what is
the web page you want to write the
physical web just gets you there faster
so then once you've figured out what
your web pages you just stick up a
beacon and you're done makes it much
much easier second thing please don't
build a scanner and what I mean by this
is I'm not kidding three people in
various workshops have said I don't
we're going to do we're going to put
beacons and every student so teacher
never has to take attendance again
that's a weird idea first of all
students are going to lose the beacons
but that's a whole other issue entirely
but the idea is that you want everybody
wants to do some kind of weird
background scanning notification magical
thing and you know we can actually start
to do that eventually with a physical
web and I think we have roadmap ideas
for that but let's just walk before we
run right now and right now the idea is
let's just get to a web page and open it
up just deal with interaction on demand
kind of cases the other one is a real
simple point but it saved my butt so
many times don't take your URL and just
stick it into the beacon use a URL
shortener especially one that can be
reset so all the beacons we have here at
this conference are going through a URL
shortener and if for some reason I don't
find them all and they kind of get left
around I'll redirect them to null so
we'll 303 and they'll keep broadcasting
but the scanner will no longer find them
because there's no web page to show so
it allows you to cloud manage your
beacons there's even a company right now
that actually has this built into their
beacon so in the morning it shows you
the morning menu and then at lunch time
menu the afternoon so like during the
day it actually dynamically changes it
even though it's the exact same URL
every single time so there's a couple of
patterns that have emerged from this
that helps people think about how to
build this so the first one is what i'm
calling flooding we did this at Google
i/o back in May we basically just took
to beacons not not to 820 beacons and we
just plaster them all over the area and
they just did the schedule a little bit
like what we're doing here
I have a very active remote here so
effectively by flooding the whole area
you just get people simple information
on demand this whole conference is
served by four beacons for the schedule
that if you turn up the power they cover
a wide area so it's really not that hard
to do the next one is one calling single
point it's another pattern and this is
what was done in buses in London
Transport for London do this with a 100
buses where they basically had a beacon
on these buses and you'd pull it down
and goes hey you're on bus 53 this is
the stop that you're at right now here's
the next 15 bus stops where you getting
off and you pick one and then I do a
push notification put it your pocket and
then when you got close it vibrate and
you could take off so that helps that's
a really that's the opposite pattern
point-to-point and of course the pill
bottle was another example of that bread
crumbs is another one where you can kind
of have something like National Trust
where you have a whole bunch of those
placards for the signs or a tourist
thing where you set a bunch of beacons
out so people can experience it as you
go another pattern people want to play
with and the one that I find more
interesting is this concierge idea so
you can actually go to the website and
then it takes care of you after the fact
the example here of course was the Bob's
Delhi example so that you kind of
interact with the website and then five
minutes or five days later it could send
you a message to say oh you're your
order is ready or whatever and the one
that everyone likes to play with is the
web bluetooth is the remote control and
that's the one that lets you kind of
take all of the efforts on your phone
and kind of make a fairly cheap device
in front of you so the bottom line is I
have kind of learned something that's
kind of obvious but it really has been
it's kind of really reinforced why the
web is so awesome because people are
doing such creative things with URLs and
shorteners and the web pages we've been
kind of blow away blown away because we
know it but we don't really appreciate
that URLs plus the Weber just so damn
flexible you can just do so many things
with it and so by kind of betting on
URLs as the way we're broadcasting we've
enabled lots of innovation happened that
we didn't even think was going to happen
that's been kind of kind of fun now I'm
not trying to get into this web versus
native debate about four years ago I I
wrote a blog post called mobile apps
must die I really regret that
it got a lot of traction a lot of press
and it kind of set up a false dichotomy
apps are fine we don't know that but the
point we're trying to say is there's a
certain case when physical web enables
interaction what apps just aren't
practical we're trying to catch the
low-hanging lightweight fruit so demo
time what I want to do is now power my
little gizmo this is an RF do we know
that's just running and when I power it
up it basically now broadcasts a URL and
what I'll do here is I have 10 y Twitter
interactions that's cool so here we're
going to do is I pulled on the
notification manager and here's
effectively nearby and here's candy bot
nine thousand pretty appropriate name
and then we open it back up this is just
going to open up web bluetooth and then
I'm going to connect to the device and
pair to it and now that I've paired to
it I'm going to do a real simple command
that basically drops candy
I'm trying why do this simply just
interesting this worked the 95 times I
tried it before hand okay connects the
only thing I can think of and this is
what often happens with demos is that in
a room full of people it wouldn't
surprise me that some of you guys are
trying to do this the same time
and I don't know if you guys can see it
but like this is like the world's
cheapest hunkajunk ever writes an RF do
we know with a USB device and a little
servo on it it's really really an
expensive and it's like this much line
of code in there it just has a single
gat service intent they just responds to
the image and so then when I push the
button it just simply just push it pulls
the one thing up and just drops it so
well I wonder something to show you the
code right now how to do this so in a
sense because I was kind of expecting
that to happen so
you know boys will be boys the issue
here is that this is really really
simple code right and so all we're doing
is basically including effectively the
Platinum Bluetooth element right here
and then all we're specifying is the
name and the gas service and that just
basically creates this Bluetooth object
using this polymer element so this is
your declaration of the entire object
and then the code becomes as simple as
just creating to query selectors to get
the actual Bluetooth device and the
actual command to actually do it and
then when you get the cliq you just
simply request the item which will then
bring up that prompt and then use this
to a right of a one which then writes
the single value to it and then you can
pull it out so it's really polymer makes
this exceptionally easy for you guys to
do this code and we think it's really a
helpful simple way because with this
much code you can control a device and
it's really really fast and easy so the
bottom line is we are an open source
project we aren't we're trying very much
for this to be of the web and i'm on the
i do these speaking agents things just
so that people can try it out and play
with it's not a Google product and if we
pushed it really hard i think we'd scare
people away this has got to be although
it only succeed if we as a community
wanted to succeed so please go to our
github check it out we've got the
beacons all around and i'll be sticking
on afterwards at the after party so
please come after come talk to me
afterwards and thanks very much
