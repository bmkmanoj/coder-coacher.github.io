SURMA: One of the
common issues we
see when looking
at people's sites
is that they don't
cache resources
as well as they could.
For example, they
set resources are
unlikely to change to
expire after a few minutes,
and sometimes irregularly
changing files
are set to cache
for several weeks.
And then you get into
cache-busting and fighting
with the browser's cache.
What you probably
want to do instead
is to categorize your
resources in one of two ways--
things that need to be validated
with a server and things
that don't and can come
straight from the HTTP cache.
Something that does normally
need to be revalidated
is HTML, since that's the
primary resource and the source
of truth for your app.
Here you want a cache note
like this-- private, no-cache.
That tells the browser that
the resource is intended
for just that user and that it
should check with the server
before serving it.
Things that don't
need to be validated
would be things like
JavaScript, CSS, or images.
Here, you'll want to tell the
browser that it should cache
the resource for like a year.
But what do you do if you
need to change that resource?
You include a hash or
a [? version ?] name
in the resources path.
There are plenty
of build tools that
can help you achieve just that.
Bear in mind that you shouldn't
be caching your HTML, which
means that when you change
the far future cache resource,
you can update the reference to
it in the HTML and everything
should just work out.
If you want to see what
your caching headers are,
head to Dev Tools, Network
Panel, click on a resource,
and choose the Headers tab.
Laters.
For more on this topic, you
can watch the Supercharged
livestream I did on server-side
rendering over there,
or read Jake's blog post, which
we link to in the description.
But more importantly--
you actually know.
