morning it actually means butt ugly so
but I had it as buggy and ugly but what
I want to do is just share a hard truth
with you oh is that fundamentally we
built extremely bug ly web applications
and we as in you and there's many
reasons for it there's many reasons for
it one is logging is so complicated so
we build a big fortress and put
applications behind it and features
behind it and because it provides some
sort of sense of security we go from
building apps really to building really
large fortresses you know you go through
this gate this Moot the security gate
and then all of a sudden you've got
access to everything that creates a
extremely slow archaic large wannabe web
application which is really a website
with a whole bunch of proprietary
gallatin inside it they're expensive
extremely expensive and as an architect
at ING we have this discussion all the
time we want to refactor but refactoring
comes in extreme costs we want to move
from one framework to another and it
requires such a big move that we end up
having really a Frankenstein of
frameworks many of them it's not really
this one it's not really that also it's
extremely slow because it's so large and
if you take a look at the websites that
are being built today and even the ones
that already exist
they're extremely large and disruptive
so it's not good news actually it's so
bad that there are people in the
community that actually have websites
that track your websites one for example
is Aussie outages calm this is a
community where they monitoring the
availability of websites
the essentially the bad experience of
websites in the finance industry and the
top four banks in Australia collectively
only offer 91% availability
that's 33 days where they're out in a
certain year 33 days you can't bank in
the country that's scary right 33 days
it's huge and the best part of it all is
that they tell their customers on
Twitter I guess what we're knocked out
for the weekend so plan ahead god help
you if you get a date or something like
that you're in trouble because sorry
baby I just saw for $40 so this is part
of the problem and and it's almost like
it's okay it's almost like it's alright
we're using jQuery it's fine it's okay
because with with way of using Redux or
whatever we're using embers on fire and
what I'm trying to highlight is that all
of that largely is fundamentally from a
business point of view irrelevant but if
you take a look at the growth in the
transfer size you'll see that most of
our applications in essentially our
pages are growing dramatically there's a
organization called HTTP archive
actually transia stuff believe it or not
there are people that actually find this
stuff fascinating and the size of a page
now a total transfer for a page because
these aren't single page applications is
the same size as through the game who
played doom oh I know you will play Doom
all right ships with its own 3d
rendering engine believe it or not has
its own weapons and a whole bunch of
them and there's some really good
nuggets and Easter eggs inside it all of
that is actually 2.4 Meg that's the size
of a page that we're downloading today
every time a customer goes to a banking
application or any application to be
honest with you because if you take a
look at these guys that's what they're
saying it's a room every time strange
but that's ok guess what there's Moore's
law if we can't fix it
CPUs will
it's okay the customer will get a new
phone that will go faster on their phone
and actually there is some science to it
there is some truth behind it because as
you can see here some organizations have
been publishing benchmarks for for the
new iPhone 7 and it does perform
extremely well but for every law there's
an anti law and worth law I think some
people say this page is lower in Gates's
law I don't will ever know fundamentally
saying that the software efficiency drew
to code craft feature itis a whole bunch
of other stuff haves every 18 months
anyway actually there's another reason
it's fundamentally because we built
applications to build their resumes what
we do is like bubblegum we go and we say
okay here's a new framework I'll chew on
that for a while and when the taste goes
I need a new one I'll get a new job with
someone else and leave this big
application here yes yes
and so what happens is we end up with
this big fat monolithic monster in an
organization that the new developer
looks at in guys only the framework note
the loop and obviously ends up having
excessive refactoring we have a
Frankenstein a proprietary opinionated
implementations it's extremely not
sharable it's solid it's a it's a mess
and fundamentally the let's be honest as
front-end developers there's a law
called Conway's law and you I'm sure you
all know it we all read it all the time
but basically says the communication
channels of the organization will
fundamentally reflect in your
application yes we try to solve
everything in the front end it's at the
front end gets bigger more frameworks
and blah blah blah but when we talk
about architecture fundamentally we're
talking about code organization whether
it's MVC or something else we're always
talking about code organization but the
unit of change is still the application
mergers are experienced if they're
difficult to share it's extremely
complex composition is difficult and we
end up with the mess so let me give you
a real example let's take four scenarios
banking scenarios account opening move
money bills and transactions the company
says okay we want to do a project on
with money that's ok so we do an
assessment we take a look at the
channels the front ends we take a look
at some of our services we take a look
at the core at the back end then
possibly we take a look at some
platforms and some some operating
systems and we come up with yeah this is
an approach we're going to do it this
way but what we discover in which we all
knew is that the core makes assumptions
about platforms the services make
assumptions about the core and then the
channels make assumptions about services
and fundamentally we have a really big
big project that's ok if you're doing
one the problem is when they want to do
the bills project and when they want to
do the dues project there's a lot of
contention bottlenecks and ultimatums
that have to be made then essentially
one plus one ends up equaling three
that's why it's not just fundamentally
an estimation problem because we also
hear you can't estimate development okay
you can't estimate but also accept the
fact that we have crap
and because of crap crap on crap makes a
very big and difficult way a way to
estimate so the last part of this tragic
story fundamentally is an event happens
whatever it is it could be a new
framework such as such and then a hero
pops up and says great idea let's adopt
another framework I'm gonna build it a
modular framework which dr. Carlos Brown
in the book called design rules actually
did one of the biggest assessments on
modularity and fundamentally came to the
conclusion that we all intend modularity
but with really a monolith and then we
end up going with different opinions
because as time progresses we end up
adopting different opinions it becomes
buggy and then we wait for the new event
and that new event typically is when the
developer leaves or a new framework
comes out and then it comes really
really fast so is the problem that the
languages or is the problem the platform
and as Alex Russell says the problem is
fundamentally about the platform and I'd
like to add this or set of people so the
web needs you the web needs you to get
serious about being a web developer and
a front eleven theme one of the words I
mean what is web Main this actually
means that you're a standards-based
developer so you need to take a look at
new use cases and once you find new use
cases work with those new use cases and
basically converge on certain agreements
on what those primitives could look like
and also abstract them out so that we
can start using them with polyfills or
something like that and then when the
industry body sees and understands the
value we create them move them into
primitives and inter standards but we
have to let go and go to the next one
not continually to fight over and over
again and the things like the
extensibility web manifesto is actually
starting to do that and permit that type
of language and that type of thinking so
what does it mean it means that true
beauty is on the inside it's not just
about how it looks but also about deep
inside how it works it has to be
performant
so at ING we take Google Rails seriously
so serious it's actually become the
criteria for our non-functional
requirements yeah
we now have very specific criteria that
the responses have to happen within 100
milliseconds applications have to be
less than 1 Meg they need to be secure I
won't go through the security standards
but what I will do is this because
security head is not I'll scan your
websites and take a look if you don't
get an F you'd be surprised
seriously banking sites most of them and
I've scanned most of them get score and
F then F couldn't mean a few things
depending on how you take it also build
your applications to be immortal and
what we mean by immortal is that it's
not just that it's bulletproof in the
sense that it never dies but it's also
long living so adopting and very
standards use the platform for what it
is push the state to the client not in
the server because the ultimate state is
the user build offline first unplug your
tables turn off your Wi-Fi and build
like that and try to make sure it works
offline first handle failures and be an
go with the progressive applications but
also when you're going with modularity
understand that we wanted what does
modularity mean it means that we have to
make it design time independent that I
can work on this thing independently of
the of the whole but at runtime it's got
to work interoperable so it frees me a
design time but at run time it works
really well as a member of the wider
community of components so now the unit
of change is the component it's not the
application it's the component and when
the component is the unit of change we
assemble applications based on
components we don't develop applications
anymore we develop components and from
those components we can assemble very
different business functions for example
at ING we say that the customer service
team that answer phone calls need to see
the same experience that the customer
sees on their mobile or on the web to me
it sounds like sharing components yeah
the only difference is one
component is embedded with the telephony
so that with telephony features so that
they could answer phones the other is
not so our definition of done this is
what we put down as a quality criteria
for a component every component in the
bank must have its own repo it must have
its own life cycle and it has its own
repository it's built with
internationalization out of the box it's
built with accessibility out of the box
we no longer debate whether those who
have partial vision or vision impaired
are some sort of subclass customer we
expect it to be accessibility compliant
day one also the tests are baked in day
one the thing works it is even a demo
and I would go so far as to say that we
need to move towards some sort of
demonstration driven development not
just test-driven development
get the demo in the hands of the
developers as quickly as possible show
your stuff works we've done so far is
using blueprints to mark the api's at
the back so that custom elements now
have a one-to-one relationship with
api's and we've actually produced the
documentation and this is Cle criteria
for what we call ready based components
for consumption by the next developer so
when we take a look at the architecture
most banks and organizations were or are
still unfortunately in the big blue box
and some are having discussions about
moving towards a client server based
mainframe still back-end database
scenario and the rest of the world is
stuck in this hole now where they're
taking a look at the middle the middle
way and API is and so on and having
discussions about marklar services etc
but we see an opportunity we see that
the opportunity is potentially we see
the micro service movement better ing
we've gone one step further we've
predicted that the world will fragment
even further and our architecture needs
to look like that we want to have custom
elements with the main based services at
the back and as the main based services
can
be part of that customer element that
custom elements scope and now it means
when you ship a custom element to
another team it also comes with this API
it's not only the API is full component
interaction but also api for back-end
interaction it goes a little bit further
we also have to take a look at the way
we do api's because we want to minimize
the number of chattiness between
components and backends so our responses
are now rich responses and it means that
when I move money I also get the balance
back and the list of accounts so I don't
have to do subsequent calls to get hey
what's the new balance and what is the
latest accounts of the customer now with
the response I can do some data binding
and then publish the the new balance to
all the components that need it and
fundamentally means 50 plates 50% less
higher but also means I now get to use
data binding the way it should be used
so how does it look it's the technical
summit so let's talk about it
fundamentally we produce the API is
automatically because we have mops and
and and and interfaces we have them very
clean we know what they are and we now
have an outside-in model where we work
with our business and say what do you
want the API is not driving the
application or the component the
requirements of the business and the
user is driving the API and we generate
the api's because let's be honest it
takes forever to wait for a back-end
person to give you an API yeah so stuff
it we just build it ourselves Conway's
law and when we get the API is the
response when the API is very simple we
update the the variables in our store
and you can see they're all custom
elements and the data binding then
becomes available to all the components
that are listening and the process
repeats itself over and over again and
if you notice the actual system is
extremely simple it's so simple that
when you think about it it's actually an
intro and working system of a collection
of components our entire digital
front-end particularly in it in ING if
we take a look at the Australian
scenario it's completely web components
and custom elements there's nothing else
there's no frameworks there's
additional libraries etc etc it's
fundamentally just a whole bunch of
custom elements and we use BFF which is
backends for front ends in order to to
abstract those there's AP eyes and make
them down to the to the custom elements
but what's important is that our AP eyes
are not Carol we're not stressed about
the AP eyes themselves that way you have
interface and contract based experiences
the API is fundamentally reflect what
the customer requirement is so they're
not paid sorry they're Carol a ps4 fill
the demand the experience and we come to
the understanding and the agreement that
poor backends also equal poor friends so
you have to fix you back in is as well
you can put a nice custom element in
front of an a system and give it in the
hands of the customer but if your back
ends are cracked and your friends are
crap so believe it or not I've heard
Taylor and Matt say over and over again
there's an element for that doesn't
element for that well ing there is
there's 350 of them that are being used
and our friends all over the world
including the Netherlands in Germany and
Belgium etc are building custom elements
for the group to use over and over again
the number of api's we have that are
being used honestly i've lost count and
to be honest i really don't care so long
as it returns the data that I need and
it's bound to the custom element we're
fine if you take a look at it the every
application that you build at the front
end needs some visual components some
rich visuals some navigation utilities
and customer features most of those we
want the source from the market we don't
want to build everything ourselves
whether it's a telephony component with
Tullio or it's a charting component with
Vardon it doesn't matter if it's
available in the market go get it ship
it as a custom element and we will build
the pieces that are that are in the gaps
the stuff that's specific to us banking
so we're assemblers first and that's the
key message we are assemble as first
being an assembler means go into the box
of Lego find the Lego piece you need and
then put it together
don't go build your own and most
developers love file new and we need to
move away from file new and go into the
box and go to the repos and find one
that makes sense read the math counts
there's a reason why
we've written them and we're
craftspeople second if they're not there
then we craft so what does it look like
at runtime well fundamentally we have
single page application that's html5 and
we have two files our entire application
is two files index dot HTML and ing
dodge is only data every trellis is the
network so all you ever see when you
look up the network you see the xhr just
going across state essentially managed
and into the client and all the business
logic what constitutes business logic is
in the back in the data center and
there's a reason because data centers
have 40 gigabits per second networks so
we push all the service aggregation and
service composition into the data center
where it's faster so the front end is
extremely light and extremely thin so
you need to break Conway's law a little
bit and have a conversation with the
people in the back and if they don't
want to respond and do it yourself what
does that ranch our matrix look like
we've been running we've been working
with polymer since point 5 and we love
it and when 1.0 came out we were
ecstatic and now in its current state
this is what it looks like running
around time the industry average if you
look at GT metrics for Page Speed is 81
percent ing is at 98 our page load the
industry averages at 5.8 we're at 2.3
and that's not good enough as you can as
you know from the Google rail discussion
our page size the industry average you
heard earlier is the size of doom ours
is 538 kilobytes that's the whole lot
that's everything and the request
industry average for requests believe it
or not is 69 and with HTTP want HTTP 1
it's actually at 2 so it becomes even
worse there was a serial request and ing
its nine so now what does that mean
let's go back to this scenario when we
do move money and we do the transactions
project they're not coinciding and
they're not contending for resources
bills can also go in parallel as well
and have more concurrent development in
fact we can have a lot of concurrent
development because the architecture is
broken up we don't have a monolithic per
se a monolith per se
but the real advantage of all this is
that we have a culture of motivation
people are autonomous because they can
do it inside their component they have
purpose because they know they're
working to a business end in a business
goal and there are also masters of their
domain because they can use the right
technology for the right function but
while web components I get this question
a lot
ing bit on web components really early
Apple said something with along the
lines that they are the web standards
are the web yes this lifespan benefits
as parallel delivery as I said earlier
time avoided there's also the value of
business options the fact that you can
mix and match and imagine what scenarios
you could do if you can take one
component into another business stream
but really from my side I actually want
to talk about the facts that again the
polymer team has been saying over and
over again that use the platform use the
platform use the platform so we went to
github and countered the lines of code
thankfully they actually offer a
function that does it and I think the
chart speaks for itself
there's four times more markup with
polymer than any of the other frameworks
that are available and there's ten times
this javascript this is over three years
or three years since the inception of
polymer that tells you volumes if you
want to be a JavaScript developer and
you want to solve platform problems with
JavaScript you will have a problem with
polymer but if you want to solve true
customer problems with the web then
polymer is your choice so final slides
learning and unlearning what we found is
more people our framework developers
than they are actually web developers so
we had to teach them html5 again sorry
but it's the truth they don't know what
a media queries we don't know what
sections are and so on and so forth
also you need to build a lot of
automation with your tool chains to make
their lives a little bit easier you need
to offer samples and guides but probably
the most important thing is get them to
assemble something first not craft
something assemble build their first
component second and then finally evolve
it if you can't solve it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
