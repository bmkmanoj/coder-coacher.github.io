progressive web apps summit we are here
in the speaker sort of green room area
where everyone's chillin I'm here with
the caltrain tell you just gave a talk
here at the summit about soar like the
the business impact of progressive web
apps I'm sort of wondering um can you
just maybe maybe for the folks out there
who are new to the concepts around pwas
like what are some interesting reasons
why a business would would want to focus
on this architecture approach so in the
talk I covered a lot about kind of reach
and acquisition and converting users and
in particular we talked about a nap core
web app called Sileo and when they what
they did was when they were trying to
bring in new users to their newly built
progressive web app they found that
bringing users to the web app was
actually 10 times cheaper than bringing
users into the native app so if you have
a huge reach and it costs you a lot less
to bring in new users and you're able to
convert them I think the math starts
working out really well and and so maybe
uh you know businesses come in all sorts
of different shapes and sizes maybe if
I'm a small scrappy startup it might be
easy for me to move in this direction
but you know or me if I already have an
existing product or I'm a larger
business like it is it is it going to be
easy for me to transition to being a
progressive web up or is there some
strategies that I can employ to get to
that place so I think one of the things
that we really wanted to emphasize today
and then going forward is that there's a
different path for building a
progressive web app for everybody there
are big companies who want to start from
the ground up so they have the luxury of
building from scratch but if you need to
kind of start you can focus on a single
feature like push notifications or build
a simple prototype version of your site
to see how you know what it feels like
and how you can start kind of playing
around with service workers I think we
don't want to say okay unless you're
able to you know go from go from the
ground up or build from scratch it's not
worth doing progressive web app that's
absolutely not the case and so for those
businesses that maybe want to want to
learn more about this where's like a
good resource like one place I can go to
just start seeing you know how to get on
this
this approach so I think most folks will
probably go to a lot of different videos
and and hear the talks again but I
highly recommend especially if you're
trying to make the case to like
management or folks on your team the
showcase section of developers at google
com / web is a great place to start
there's tons of case studies and stats
and metrics that are shareable cool so
we can we can link to that down in the
the show notes Tala thank you so much
for being with us today and chatting
with us if you want to catch taos talk
