SURMA: With the
upcoming Edge 16,
all major browsers have
full support for CSS Grid.
In its most basic form, it's
like Flexbox in two dimensions
instead of one.
But Grid packs a lot
more capabilities
and will probably become one
of the core tools every web
developer should know.
CSS Grid allows you to
lay out your elements
in a grid, similar to tables,
but without the annoying table
markup and all the weird
special cases around tables.
And it's inherently
responsive too.
Grid is very powerful, too
powerful to cover everything
in a micro tip.
But in its most basic form,
you start with display grid.
You set up your grid by
defining rows and columns
using grid template rows
and grid template columns.
In this example, I only used
fixed width and the special fr
unit that distributes
free space.
But Grid offers many tools
to make the layout even more
flexible.
Once the grid is defined, the
children of the grid container
will be laid out to
occupy exactly one cell.
If that's not what
you want, you can
assign areas that can
span multiple rows
and columns to some elements.
The elements you
don't place manually
will be placed in
the available cells.
Isn't that handy?
If you want to know
more about Grid, how
to do responsive designs,
and what else you can do,
take a look at Rachel
Andrew's gridbyexample.com.
And that's great for you.
It's like the web of the
'90s done right, kind of.
I don't know, whatever.
See you next time.
This is a subscribe button.
And this is more Supercharged.
While you consider
clicking those buttons,
let me tell you a joke.
So a man goes into a bar,
and the bartender says,
what can I get you?
And the man says, well,
I would like a whiskey.
And then-- no wait, it's
the other way around.
