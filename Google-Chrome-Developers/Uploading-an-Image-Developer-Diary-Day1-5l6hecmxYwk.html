talk a little bit more about the app
that I've been building we'd already
know about the app you can watch an
introduction in the previous video and
there's a link in the description now
this is a camera app and direct access
to the camera is a pretty new feature
that's available in modern browsers but
not so much in older browsers and not
for people who don't even have a camera
for example people they're on desktops
so how do we progressively enhance
capturing an image or one of the easiest
things we could do is take a URL of an
image that it's actually hosted
elsewhere on the web and just fetch that
so if we're taking an image from a URL
the code for that is dead simple we just
need some input to take the URL and then
some sort of action in this case a
button say that we'd like to actually go
for the URL and then we just set the
source of an image to be whatever the
user typed in so I have a test image URL
here I base it in like they go and my
image is in the page this is a very very
simple way of doing this it does have a
couple of problems though the big one
being that if the server that the image
is hosted on doesn't support cause
headers or doesn't send the right cause
headers then you won't actually be able
to edit this image you're still be able
to display it in the page but we're
making a photo editing app essentially
so we need to be able to get at those
pixels and transform them in some way
and without cause that's just not going
to happen you can get around that by
using a proxy server so you run your own
server and you fetch all URLs through
that so you make your request to your
server with the URL and then the server
goes away and makes the request to the
real server and in the the and then the
image comes back through that chain but
that's a little there's a little bit
excessive for what we want to do here
you have to run your own server which
can handle the traffic of all of your
users for something you really only want
to be doing inside the browser so how
can we improve on using
URL provided by the user well we could
use a file input and let the user just
upload the photo directly to us so it's
an input of type file which tells the
browser that it should prompt the user
to give us a file and traditionally this
was so that that file could be uploaded
to your server as part of a form but in
modern browsers we can take the file
from the input and use it in the client
without actually sending it to the
server now we can enhance this again
first enhancement is to say that we
accept images so here we use the accept
attribute and we pass in a mime type or
in this case a wild-card mime type we
say image slash start say we want the
user to give us an image so the browser
can then prompt the user with a file
input that only gives them images so if
we see here when we open this up this is
showing me only the images that are on
my desktop now the file input has a
change event which we can listen to and
anytime that the user changes what is
selected in that file input this event
will get triggered and here I'm just
login to the console what the output of
that is the the the files object of our
input so here in our handler I'm taking
a target which is the target of the
event which is actually going to be the
file input and we're looking at this
files property and for a moment I'm just
cutting that out at the console and you
can see that it is a file list and we'll
learn more all about file lists later on
you're the good thing about the accept
attribute is that it lets mobile browser
browsers know that they could send us a
photo straight from the camera if they
wanted to so when they pop up the
chooser as well as offering the ability
to upload a file they also give the
opportunity to say would you like to
take a photo from the camera this will
go straight to the native camera app and
allow the user to take photo there and
then which can then get passed into your
app which is brilliant this is almost
what we want for our own app there is a
final possibility for this which is we
can add an
we can add in a natural record capture
so we add in capture here and by default
the if you just put in capture that says
that I'd like to go to the camera
directly so on a mobile browser this
will pop up the native camera app
without offering the chooser first which
if you really only want photos straight
from a camera is perfect you skip a step
but there's a little bit of a problem
here
you can't feature detect where the
capture is going to do this and this
means that on desktop browsers you only
going to prompt for a file because
that's what the file input does whereas
on mobile browsers you're only going to
prompt for images from the camera it's
not an equal thing between the two and
what if a user on mobile wants to upload
a file that's on their SD card for
example if you are going to use the
capture attribute there is actually a
couple of extra things you can do is
that you can set it to one of two values
to say which camera you'd prefer so you
can set it to be a user which says that
you want the camera that is facing the
user so this is your selfie camera or
you can set it to be capture equals
environment which says you want the
camera that faces the environment ie the
normal camera that faces away from the
user if the device happens to only have
one camera it will still give you the
camera that it does have and this just
sets a preference so the accept header
and the capture attribute give us a
couple of ways to enhance the experience
for mobile users so let's look at some
ways we can enhance things for desktop
users as well one thing that's fairly
common to do on desktop that you
wouldn't do a mobile is drag and drop
and that's supported by the web as well
so here we set up a target to be dropped
onto the target is just a development it
could be pretty much any element you
like and we set up this drop event
listener so that when something is
dropped onto the element what should we
do well we should stop propagation
because we're actually handling it in
our element here and we should prevent
the default - if I drag this image just
into the browser not onto the element it
just loads the
image into the tab and is no longer on
our page and we don't want that to
happen so that as soon as we drop it
onto our element we get the event fired
but then it navigates the image so we
prevent the default behavior as well
here again just logging out the results
of this the event here is a drag event
which has a data transfer object game
we'll talk about that and that has a
files property which is again a files
file list so if I drag this onto the
element we can see down here that we get
the file list object now I have another
event listener down here for drag over
and this says what should happen as
you're dragging as you're dragging this
over the element what should the
behavior be and here we're saying that
we want the effect to be a copy so that
when the drag finishes when that drop
happens we are copying the information
from the image into the event and again
we need stop propagation and prevent the
default to stop the normal browser
things happening when we drag that over
and it is the setting the drug draw a
perfect copy which gives us this plus
icon on the mouse lastly another desktop
feature is the clipboard API that allows
us to copy an image from somewhere from
the file system or from another
application and just paste it straight
into the app now in chrome you can paste
an image or any file into any element on
the page you could set the event
listener for the pasted event on the
document and that would work fine but
not all browsers support this the same
way and Microsoft edge for example
requires that the element be is both
selectable and editable so here I've got
a text area which I can paste into and
you can see immediately there's a slight
UX problem here we're not asking the
user to type anything in but we've given
them a text input so this makes it
slightly awkward to
let users know what they should be doing
in your app you can if you want take an
editable element put it off screen and
then when someone clicks onto an element
there is on screen but not editable you
actually set the focus manually in your
code to be the editable element when the
user pastes it goes to the element that
you want but then you run into some
accessibility issues and it's just
slightly awkward for that reason I'm not
going to add paste into my own camera
app but I just wanted to let you know
the option was there so how do we
actually handle the paste event very
easy we take whatever element that we're
going to use in this case it's our text
area and we add an event listener for
the paste event and when that event gets
handled we get the event has a clipboard
data property with a files property
inside it and that files property as we
can see is yet again another file list
and it's just sure that this really
works and copy the image and I paste it
in and after ammo because this is a big
file and it is doing a copy we get a new
entry in a console with the filing and
you can see that we get the the name and
modify day and things like that so that
brings us to the question of what is a
file list object what is this thing that
we've been getting we've been getting it
from the file input we got it from drag
and drop and then we got it from the
clipboard API so a file list is kind of
like an array it's an object with
numeric keys which with each property
being a file object as I say it's array
like you doesn't have any of the array
methods like for each or map but you can
create an array by using a raid art from
so I could I could say my array is a
raid up from file list
in this case though because it's numeric
keys I can still use a normal for loop
every so that's what I'm going to do
here as I say the entries in this in
this file list our file objects now file
object is actually exactly the same as a
blob so if you've used a blob before you
know exactly how to use this the only
difference is that a file object if we
look over here has a couple of extra
properties has the last modified and it
has the name things that are file type
information that you wouldn't have on
the blob and this means you can use it
however you would use a blob blobs can
be stored in index DB you can get a URL
from them which means that you can use
that URL as the source of an image you
can pass them around to workers and
things because they are stripped
cloneable you can do a lot of things
with the blob in this case I'm going to
take the very first file that matches
whose type is an image and I will and
I'll just set the source of my output
image to be whatever their images so
this is a drag-and-drop and you can see
it sets the source image to a URL has
been created from that blob so that's
how we're getting an image when we don't
have direct access to the camera which
gives us a great progressive enhancement
story some good places to fall back to
but for accessing the camera directly
we'll talk about that next time so join
me then and thank you for watching
