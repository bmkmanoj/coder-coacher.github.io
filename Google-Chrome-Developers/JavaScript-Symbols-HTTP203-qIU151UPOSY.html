you have to explain to me what is it
it is JavaScript symbols go so
javascript symbols bake this way so so
this is a kind of a new primitive type
in yes it is because they're not objects
right yes so and it's it's a new thing
where if you do type of one of these
things it comes up with symbols rather
than objects the goods in primitive
right what what why what do I use them
for well so it's a way to because you
can use them as object keys so you can
have you can create a symbol and all you
do is just simple it's going object my
property I go object open brackets open
put a symbol in there and you can assign
stuff to it all right well it's kind of
hidden it's not super hidden but it's
kind of hidden yes it's not so it's not
this is not enumerable xrk so if I go
like object keys or whatever they're the
function is it won't be listed yeah and
it means so we've got things like to
Jason right sort of standard function
where it will that's how it will convert
your object to Jason yeah that's a pain
because it's gone that function can
clash with other stuff yeah I'm happen
so the idea is that they'll be just be
this unique symbol created and that's
where you would expose that sort of
stuff if we did it again now oh so
basically we are using that to allow you
to hook into things yes at forum and
that's how Israelis work its out right I
actually saw that I never knew what it
was so he can make your own object or
even your own class I guess iterable by
using symbols by using symbols and then
the most unique thing on the platform
because if you call symbol twice they're
both unique across anything even if you
give them the same but every symbol you
can never recreate the same symbol
unless you have the right exact
reference to it and except if you do
symbol dot four and you give it a name
then now that is a symbol for that name
and that is the least unique thing in
JavaScript because that is the same
value across iframes as well and that's
how it arete is work across iframes to
interesting I wonder if I wrote a blog
post about this that symbols
you can't dance along to this one no as
well as the way we need more rhythm yeah
I mean we can do the robot if you I feel
like we've dropped the ball on on trying
to think of the the names of things that
are going to draw people to be part of
these videos what is called it symbol
web Java so it's number wang-jae yeah
JavaScript symbol work that's that's
what that section was about will edit
back into the video that's fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
