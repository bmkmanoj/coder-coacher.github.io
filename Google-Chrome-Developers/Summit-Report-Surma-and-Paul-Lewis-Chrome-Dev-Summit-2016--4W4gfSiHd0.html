bidelman here at chrome dev summit we're
starting the second half of the show i'm
here with Paul and Surma who's gonna be
live coding day tell us a little bit of
what you guys are doing uh so we are
going to try to build a service worker
in life we have built an app for that
it's like a Rueter where you have
Conan's being xhr tin and swapped out
and animations are happening then we
rolled back end for which just sounds
like rendering so templating on the
server side get a good first paint all
these kind of things and now it's time
to make it work offline so is that easy
is it easy to make an appt go offline
he's gonna make it look easy but the
idea is that rather than is just kind of
showing up going tonight all finished
like his the like here's a service
working you can use the idea of it is
always to show how we think about the
problem so summers it's not easy when
he's been doing a lot of practice to
make sure that we can fit in the time
window that we have with these things
but you still get to sort of see the
thought process which is the kind of
main thing rather than just as I say
delivering this finished thing that's
what I love about you guys a show is
like you actually get to follow the
process of building something and it's
actually fun to watch two and live
coding I gotta hand it to you that's
tough that's really tough challenging
the demo gods but I'm hoping so what's
next what's next for the what are you
guys get excited about it why do you
wake up in the morning sir mile stare
with you um so as as I'm working on
Houdini I'm obviously excited about
Houdini so so what's your dating now we
got new performance primitives on the
web in terms of CSS so we can probably
do more complex more polished animations
we have more control when certain paints
are happening and what to paint all
these kind of things it's it's very
expert level but let's go get into when
you want to do very high performance and
I'm real excited that so I'm looking
forward when that sudden when that
starts slowly landing in all the
browsers Paul I would say for me the
moment I'm actually really excited about
the es2015 stuff and beyond this landing
like classes being pretty much
everywhere and fassero function type
stuff and async await this just arriving
in this that is a game changer
absolutely love as async await I think
which I'm also gonna be using you get so
he's gonna be using async await so that
kinda stuff for me it just improves the
productivity the readability of the code
just makes so much more fun when you go
back to es5 you like really oh cool do I
have to feel so icky now right
yeah I mean I accepted it at the time
but I I'm god it's going I know it's
just like i like i look forward to the
day when you have to transfer all or use
any tools and just run stuff in browsers
so with that I'll leave you guys and you
have to get running thanks for coming to
us today from chrome dev summit be sure
to hit us up on twitter hashtag chrome
