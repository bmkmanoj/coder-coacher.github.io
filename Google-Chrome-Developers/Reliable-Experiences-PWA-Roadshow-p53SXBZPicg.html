instantly and reliably never showing the
downer saw even under uncertain Network
conditions let's take a look at how
service workers allow you to do that
hello I'm Mary Coe I want to start with
a user scenario for a typical app let's
say I'm sitting at a park and I'm
humming to myself and suddenly thinks
that's a great lift I could totally use
that in the song so I open up my voice
memo app to decode myself
unfortunately my phone doesn't work in
this park and my web-based app fails to
load users have learned not to expect
the same reliability from the web
platform as they to others users expect
it to work instantly regardless of where
they are what they're doing or what the
local connectivity is like and
unfortunately this isn't just about no
connection slow and intermittent
connection affects users just as much
because of the way web pages are
typically constructed a slow connection
can increase the time that a page takes
to load on top of that mobile phones
sometimes are not online even when your
phone says you have four bars they might
not have a live connection in order to
become reliable we need instant loading
and offline to be part of the web
platform experience because remember as
we said in previous video after three
seconds 53% of users abundant sites
users are not willing to wait globally
over 60% of mobile connections use 2g we
need to do something we need to be able
to build a reliable sites and apps for
users when connectivity doesn't exist or
when it's low it's clear that we need to
stop relying on the network the key to
building instant loading an offline
capable web app is a literally new
technology called service workers
in an earlier video we talked about how
a service worker is a programmable proxy
sitting between the network and the
browser but it's more than that when the
page register a service worker it as a
set of event handler to respond to
things like Network requests push
messages and updates to the service
worker because it's event based it
doesn't have to be written in memory
unless it's handling one of those events
I'll say it again because I think it's
important it's not consuming any system
resources until it's been woken up to
handle one of those events in fact even
if the browser is closed the OS can wake
up a service worker we are no longer
limited to the model where web app must
be loaded in an active tab to be useful
this is important because it introduced
an app like lifecycle for websites and
web apps when a service worker is first
registered it fires an install event
which we can then use to prefetch the
resources we need for our app and catch
them locally this is like install as you
go in effect we are learning a fully
scriptable install much like native app
no bulky zip files we have file level
control over what is fetched how it's
cached and how it's updated once the
serviceworker has been activated we now
have a full control over how the system
serve your apps resources we can inspect
network requests rewrite them get a
response from the network or respond
with something from the cache we can
even synthesize our own response all of
this is completely transparent to the
user in fact well-constructed service
worker can act as a very smart caching
system and be transparent to the last of
your app it is just a progressive
enhancement of the network and cache
choosing smarter ways to respond to the
requests it gives us the appeal
need to make our app reliable even when
the network isn't because we have full
control over the response service
workers our progressive enhancement it's
important to understand that the first
time you load the page it's still going
to load from the network the initial
page has already been retrieved from the
network and the page resources will be
loaded normally the service worker will
come into play
only on the second request though there
is one caveat to that I'll cover that in
the moment let's dive in and take a look
at lifecycle of a service worker when
the page is first loaded it latest as a
service worker for a specific scope for
now sync of the scope as the set of page
that service worker will handle an
install event is then fired and the code
in your install handler is executed then
the service worker goes to idle
essentially sitting there quietly when
the page is Li loaded or you hit another
page covered by the service worker the
service worker is activated they need to
handle all of its events at the same
time the browser also makes an
asynchronous request to the server to
see if the service worker has changed
since it was last retrieved once the
service worker has handled all of the
events it goes to idle and eventually
it's terminated they need to spin up
again when any new events come in let's
keep going with our previous example and
see how a service worker gets updated
since we've already been to the page the
service worker is already installed and
immediately activated then just like
before the browser checks with the
server to see if the service worker has
changed and this time it has the new
service worker is downloaded and
installed but goes to idle and the
little service worker is activated and
still handling requests in fact our
little service worker will remain active
until all the clients using it has been
closed or
until you skip waiting and clients claim
will dive into those more in a second
this is important to the member as you
are working on your own service workers
this isn't a problem for users but as a
developer you may find yourself with
multiple service workers installed and
waiting because the original one hasn't
been terminated yet enough Siri let's
take a look at how to implement our own
Service Worker the first step is
littering a service worker in the web
page in now HTML page we will place a
small piece of glottic first we check if
the service worker API is available in
the browser then if it is we call
navigator the service worker the
register to register the service worker
with the llevaron Stu the location of
the service worker javascript file next
we need to handle the install event
which is fired after the service worker
javascript file has been downloaded and
parsed let's start with something basic
remember earlier I mentioned that when a
service worker is installed the first
time it doesn't take immediate control
of the page you have to wait for the
page to be reloaded well there is a way
around that calling self dot skip
waiting
tells the service worker you want it to
skip waiting and go right to work we'll
use the install event to prefetch the
resources we need and catch them in the
local cache ensuring that the files can
be loaded instantly and literally in
effect this install event handler is
your opportunity to have a fully
scriptable
install process just like native app you
have absolute control over what
resources are pre fetched and how they
are cached first let's open up a cache
object reference by cache name then
we'll use cache thought at all to
retrieve the Lea sources we've listed
and filed to cache and store them in a
browser cache in a Leo implementation
you
to make sure that you take care of any
exceptions here if one of the files were
to fail while downloading the entire
event fails and the Service Worker
wouldn't be activated and finally once
everything has been added we want to
call self dot skip waiting so that our
service worker takes control immediately
there's one other thing I want to point
out we wrap that whole code block in
event dot wait until this makes sure
that the service worker isn't terminated
or go to idle while we were waiting for
the embedded promise to complete once
everything has been cashed and our
service worker has been activated it's a
good idea to clean up the cache for
example remove any outdated resources
from the cache
there are plenty of ways to do this but
in this case we it'll aid over the list
of keys from the cache then delete any
casts that don't match the current cache
name and there is one more thing we need
to do by calling self clients don't
claim we tell the browser that we want
this service worker to take control of
all the clients that means we don't have
to wait until other service workers are
terminated we are ready to go
immediately but at this point if you
were to go find them you still get that
dreaded offline dinosaur but why we
haven't added a fetch event handler yet
which allows us to the spawn to the
network requests that are made by our
page let's assume that all of the
required resources for our app are
already in the cache but if it's not
we'll just go out to the network to
fetch it when a network request is made
from our web page our service worker
wakes up and the fetch event gets
triggered next we check to see if the
requested resources is in the cache if
it is we return the version from the
cache otherwise we'll request it from
the network and return that we now have
a reliable experience that loads almost
instantly our app will work whether we
are online offline and it will load
extremely quickly because we've
eliminated any potential Network latency
our last step is to let the page know
that the service worker is now lizard
and ready to go this is helpful if you
want to indicate to the user that the
pages offline capable earlier I
mentioned the Scopes one of the cool
thing about serviceworker is that you
don't need to register it on every page
you want to use it you only need to
register it once and any page within the
scope will be handled by the
serviceworker
the easiest way to define a scope it's
simply based on where the serviceworker
is served
from I recommend that you serve your
serviceworker from the server loot that
means every resource requested will be
handled by the serviceworker if you put
it in your script directly only resource
is served from there will be handled by
the serviceworker in this case unless
the page registering the serviceworker
is also in script likely it won't be
handled by the serviceworker putting the
serviceworker in your server loot gives
you the first chance at responding to
any network requests and helps to ensure
your app is reliable and loes almost
instantly the magic a serviceworker
provide is that you are in control you
get to decide what gets cached how its
cached and how it should be returned to
the user
I've shown you the cache first with
Network fallback strategy it provides a
fast reliable experience for users there
are several different caching strategies
and depending on your app scenario you
might want to use different one or even
multiple strategies for different kinds
of requests let's take a look at some of
the different strategies the cache first
with Network fallback strategy we laid
out it's pretty straightforward always
go to the cache first and if the request
matches the cache entry response with
that otherwise try to fetch the
resources from the network this option
is good for resources that don't change
often it will give you a very fast
response since response came out of the
cache directly but it doesn't update on
the negative side if an item is not in
the cache it is not added after its
retrieved from the network network first
and falling back to cache means you give
online users most up-to-date content but
all find users get an older cached
version if the network request succeeds
you're most likely you want to update
the cache and
however this Meza has flaws if the user
has an intermittent or slow connection
they'll have to wait for the networks to
fail before they get the content that is
already on their device this can take an
extremely long time and it's frustrating
user experience cache first then network
requires the page to make two requests
one to the cache and one to the network
the idea is to show the cache to data
first then update a page when or if
network data are lives sometimes you can
just replace the current data when new
data lives things like game leaderboard
but that can be destructive with larger
piece of content don't make something
that user may be leading or interacting
with disappear with the generic fallback
strategy le quest is made first to the
cache then the network and if both of
them fail a second request is made to
the cache for a generic page this is
ideal for secondary imagery such as
avatars failed post quest and
unavailable while flying page one of my
favorite use for this is a newspaper
that gives you a close word puzzle to
play while you are frying and of course
there are more cache only network only
serviceworker templating just to name a
few but the core point here is that when
it comes to caching strategies you are
in complete control over how to respond
to the quests you can manage the network
and the cache so that you can build a
consistently reliable and performant
solution because you have so much
control over the network it can seem
quite daunting to get started and to
debug experience luckily there are a
number of tools that can help you the
chrome dev tools have added new set of
tools to help you work with service
workers in the
tools you will find application tab in
application tab you can inspect the
service worker and latest or it force it
to update simulate offline behavior and
more we'll talk more about these in the
tooling video and of course Firefox
Opera and other browsers have similar
tools for debugging service workers dev
tools let you inspect not only
application storage like indexdb but
also inspect cache storage in the past
we used to recommend people use
incognito windows when developing
service workers because it made it easy
to start fresh when you need to but the
nuclear storage pane simplifies things
tremendously I use this one a lot next
we have a tool that can speed up your
serviceworker development walk box is a
collection of libraries to help you
develop PWA
if you remember the code for a cache
first service worker from earlier it was
a bit cumbersome to write with work box
SW this turns into simple decorations
for caching strategies on multiple
resources but you are still in control
of your site it's just a set of package
loadings and strategies so I hope this
has given you a good understanding of
service workers and how they provide the
core of instant and reliable experience
