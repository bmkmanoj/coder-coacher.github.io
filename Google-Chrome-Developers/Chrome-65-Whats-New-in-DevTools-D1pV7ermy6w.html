features coming in chrome 65 including
local overrides new accessibility tools
the changes tab new performance audits a
whole new category of SEO audits
multiple recordings in the performance
panel and reliable code stepping for
workers and async code if you've ever
changed some CSS and dev tools you
probably learn the hard way that your
changes get erased when you reload the
page local overrides provides a
lightweight solution for saving your
changes across reloads before I start up
overrides let's see the old behavior
when I change this link to purple then
reload the page the change is gone now
I'll set up overrides and try it again
go to the sources panel open the
overrides tab click select folder for
overrides choose a location then click
allow to give dev tools access to that
folder now when I edit the links color
and reload the page the change is still
there
the way it works is that when the page
requests this file dev tools serves the
modified file on my computer instead
this purple dot next to the file name
means that overrides is set up for this
file overrides has two limitations first
changes to the Dom tree don't work for
example when I edit some text and reload
the page the change is gone editing HTML
from the sources panel does work though
second changes here on element style
don't work either I can explain why that
is in the comments in terms of
accessibility contrast ratio affects how
readable text is for example if some
text is light gray and the background
behind that text is white that text will
be hard to read the color picker now
warns you when the contrast ratio of a
text element follows below recommended
accessibility levels to open the color
picker select a text element then click
the preview icon next to the elements
color property one checkmark means that
the element meets the minimum
commended contrast ratio to checkmarks
means that it meets the enhanced
recommendation click the contrast ratio
section to show the contrast ratio line
up here in the spectrum since this
element meets recommendations it means
that anything below this line also meets
recommendations anything above the line
doesn't the second new accessibility
feature coming in chrome 65 is the
accessibility tab select an element in
the Dom tree then open the accessibility
tab and you can see its position in the
accessibility tree as well as its Aria
properties and computed accessibility
properties
the artist panel has a whole new
category of SEO audits which may help
you improve your search rankings as well
as many new performance audits by the
way the Google Webmaster blog recently
mentioned that PageSpeed will be a
factor in mobile rankings starting in
July so if you've been meaning to
improve your load performance but didn't
know where to start the oddest panel is
definitely the best place to begin to
run audits against whatever page you've
got open just go to the artist panel
then click perform an audit we've also
got audits for best practices
accessibility and progressive web apps
after 20 seconds or so dev tools gives
you a report like this on how you can
improve the page in chrome 65 there's
some subtle changes to how dev tool
steps through code that passes messages
to workers first let me show you the old
behavior I click this button and I pause
in the click listener when I step into
the next function call it goes to the
next line of the click listener when I
step again we jump to the on message
listener in other words we can't see
what's going on in the worker now here's
the new behavior I click the button and
pause in the click listener again now
when I step into the next call it takes
me to the worker cut this worker code
happens to just post this message in
Reverse back to the main thread so let's
see what happens when I step into that
call it brings me back to the main
threads on message listener as you'd
expect we've also made some changes
around how dev tool steps through async
code here's the old behavior when I
click this button I pause in the click
listener when I step in to set timeout
it jumps to the next line of code that
chronologically executes eventually if I
keep stepping I'll pause in the set
timeout call back now let's see the new
behavior this time when I stepped in to
set timeout dev tools runs all of the
other code behind the scenes and now I'm
paused at the first line of the callback
if you want the old behavior you can use
the new step button over here
in the performance panel you can now
temporarily save up to five recordings
over on the dev tools home page I'll
start a recording and scroll a bit then
stop the recording and we can see the
recording here in the performance panel
now I'll start another recording and
open search box and close it then stop
the recording and now we can see that
second recording to go back to the first
recording I just use this drop down menu
here
alright that's all for Chrome 65 the
bonus tip for this week is a nodejs
library built by the dev tools team
called puppeteer puppeteer is
essentially a browser automation tool
that has access to dev tools features
here I've got a little puppeteer script
to take a screenshot it opens headless
Chrome then loads a page then takes a
screenshot of that page I run it like
any other node script and then after a
few seconds I've got a screenshot of
that page on my desktop
thanks for watching if you've got any
questions drop me a line in the comments
and I'll see you in six weeks for Chrome
