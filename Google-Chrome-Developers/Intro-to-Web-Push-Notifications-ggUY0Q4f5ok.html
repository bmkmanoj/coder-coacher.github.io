api's the notification API to display
notifications and the push API to handle
messages that have pushed your client
from your server via the push service
used by the browser
this diagram gives an overview on the
client side your webpage interacts with
service workers which in turn receive
push events via the user agent also
known as the browser and on the backend
you send messages from your application
server to the push service which then
delivers them to the correct client
let's look at the notification API first
this allows developers to display
notifications to the user before we can
create a notification we need to get
permission from the user this code will
prompt the user permissions to show
notifications you can try this out from
the browser console as you'll see later
permission is requested automatically
when subscribing to a push service so
there's no need to call this function
when using just push notifications let's
take a look at some examples for
configuring and displaying a
notification from a service worker we
first check that permission has been
granted then we call show notification
on the service worker registration
object and pass in the notification
title you can also try this out from the
browser console try it on the new tab
page now for push notifications you call
show notification in the service worker
in response to a push event when a
message arrives we can specify an
optional options object to configure the
notification this is passed in as the
second argument in the show notification
function the body property is the body
text displayed below the title icon is
the image displayed at the top of
notification vibrate is the vibration
pattern for phones in this case 100
milliseconds on 15 milliseconds off 130
seconds on so on data is the arbitrary
data we can retrieve in the service
worker when the user interacts with the
modification in this example primarykey
allows us to identify which notification
was clicked when handling the
interaction in the serviceworker let's
try that out we can add action buttons
to the notification that we can then
handle each in a different way here's
what that looks like
notification interaction events are
handled in the service worker tapping
clicking or closing the notification
there are two notification interactions
you can listen for in the service worker
notification close the notification
close event only triggers when the
notification is dismissed via a direct
action on the notification if the user
dismisses all notifications the event
will not trigger and this is done to
save resources notification click if the
user clicks the notification or an
action button in the notification the
notification click event is triggered if
the user clicked on an action the action
is attached to the event object of the
notification click handler we can check
which action was triggered and handle it
separately now let's see how the two
handlers work in a service worker first
notification close we access the
notification object from the event
object and we can get the data from the
notification object we might use the
primary key property from the data to
identify which notification was clicked
in a notification click handler we can
determine what action button the user
pressed by inspecting the action
property on the event object
note that each browser displays
notification actions differently and
some don't display them at all to
compensate we put a default experience
in this example in an else block after
checking which action was clicked so
that something will happen on a simple
click of the notification now let's see
how you send push messages from your
server and handle incoming messages on
your client web app each browser manages
push notifications through its own
system called a push service when a user
grants permission for push on your site
you subscribe them to the brow
push service this creates a subscription
object that includes a public key to
enable messages to be encrypted and an
endpoint URL for the browser's push
service which is unique for each user
from your server send your push messages
to this URL encrypted with the public
key the push service sends the message
to the right client now the service
worker will be woken up to handle
incoming push messages when a push event
is fired and this allows your app to
react to push messages for example by
displaying a notification using service
worker registration show notification
your app doesn't need to listen to or
Pole for messages and the browser
doesn't even need to be open all the
work is done under the hood as
efficiently as possible by the browser
and the operating system and this is
great for saving battery and CPU usage
let's go through that step by step in
the apps main JavaScript call push
manager subscribe on the serviceworker
registration object get the subscription
object and convert it to jason get the
endpoint URL and public key and save
this to your server for example by using
a fetch request send the message payload
from your server to the endpoint URL
encrypted with the public key the push
message raises a push event in a
serviceworker which we can handle in a
push event handler in push event handler
we get the data from the message and
display a notification the push API
allows users to subscribe to messages
sent from your app server that are sent
via the push service used by the browser
and subscribing of course is done in the
JavaScript for the page responding to
push events for example by displaying a
notification is done in the
serviceworker
just to repeat subscribing to the push
service and getting the subscription
object happen in the JavaScript for the
page first we check if the user is
already subscribed and update the page
UI accordingly if they are not
subscribed prompt them to subscribe if
they are already subscribed update the
server with the latest
since that may have changed by the push
service since it was last used when the
user grants permission for push on your
site you subscribe them to the browsers
push service as I said before this
creates a special subscription object
that contains the endpoint URL for the
push service which is different for each
browser along with a public key we send
the subscription object for this user to
the server and save it now before you
subscribe a user check if you already
have a subscription object if you don't
have the object again update the UI to
prompt the user to enable push
notifications and if you do have the
subscription object update your server
database with the latest subscription
object the ready property of the service
worker defines whether a service worker
is ready to control the page or not it
returns a promise which resolves to a
serviceworker registration object when
the service worker becomes active the
get subscription function returns the
subscription object or undefined if it
doesn't exist we need to perform this
check every time the user accesses our
app because it is possible for
subscription objects to change during
their lifetime this is the process of
subscribing to the push service register
the service worker from the main page
main jeaious this request goes to the
user agent the user agent returns the
service worker registration object use
the service worker at registration
object to access the push manager API
and from that requests are subscribed to
the push service this request is passed
on to the push service the push service
returns the subscription object which
includes the endpoint URL and the public
key save the subscription object data to
your server and send push messages from
your server to the endpoint URL
encrypted with the public key like I
said now before sending notifications we
must subscribe to a push service we call
push manager subscribe on the service
worker registration object to subscribe
and the resulting push subscription
object includes all the information the
application needs to send a push me
such an endpoint and encryption key
needed for sending data each
subscription is unique to a service
worker the end point for the
subscription is a unique capability URL
knowledge of the endpoint is all that is
necessary to send a message to your
application the endpoint URL therefore
needs to be kept secret or other
applications might be able to send push
messages to your application here's an
example of the subscription object this
is the object returned from the push
service when we call reg push manage add
subscribe the subscription object has
two parts the first part is an endpoint
URL the address on the push service to
send messages to this includes an ID
that enables the push service to send a
message to the correct client and
service worker the second part of the
subscription object is the keys property
the p25 6d H key is an elliptic curve
diffie-hellman ECD H public key for
message encryption the earth key is an
authentication secret that your
application server uses in
authentication of its messages these
keys are used by your application server
to encrypt and authenticate messages for
the push subscription and let's see how
the process of sending a message is done
the server generates a message encrypted
with the public key and then sends it to
the endpoint URL in the subscription
object the URL contains the address of
the push service along with subscription
ID which allows the push service to
identify the client to receive the
message the message is received in the
push service which routed to the right
client and the process of sending a push
message from the server works like this
a back-end service on your server sends
a push message to the push service using
the endpoint URL from the subscription
object the message must be encrypted
with the public key from the
subscription object the push service
uses subscription IDs encoded in the
endpoint URL to send the message to the
right user agent the push event is
picked up by the service worker the
service worker gets the data from the
message and displays a notification
in this example we're using Google's web
push library for nodejs
to send a push message from a node.js
server the TTL value in the options
specifies the time in seconds that the
push service should keep trying to
deliver the message now this is
important to set correctly some messages
have a short life some may be valid for
several hours or more we then pass in
the subscription object payload and
options object to send notification you
need a way to ensure secure
communication between the user and your
server and between your server and the
push service and between the push
service and the user in other words the
user needs to be sure that messages are
from the domain they claim to be from
and have not been tampered with by the
push service you need to make sure the
user is who they claim to be valid was
created to solve this problem this vapid
identification information can be used
by the push service to attribute
requests that are made by the same
application server to a single entity
this can be used to reduce the secrecy
for push subscription URLs by being able
to restrict subscriptions to a specific
application server an application server
is further able to include additional
information the operator of a push
service can use to contact the operator
of the application server in order to
use vapid we need to generate a
public/private key pair and subscribe to
the push service using the public key
the public key must be first converted
from URL base64 to a you in 8 array this
is then passed into the application
server key parameter in the subscribed
method the web push library provides a
method generate vapid keys which
generates the keys this should be used
once in the command line when push
generate vapid keys - Jason and the keys
stored somewhere safe we can use the web
push library to send a message with the
required vapid details we add a vapid
details object in the options parameter
that includes the parameter
required for the request signing now
let's look at messages from the
receiving end in the web app on the
client handling push events happens in
the surface worker the service worker
will be woken up to handle incoming push
messages and a push event is fired this
allows your app to react to push
messages for example by displaying a
notification using service worker
registration show notification to
display a push notification you listen
for the push event in the service worker
you get the push message data from the
push event object in this example we
simply convert the message data to text
The Wrap show notification in a wait
until to extend the lifetime of the push
event until the show notification
promise resolves the push event will not
be reported as successfully completed
until the notification has displayed you
can practice working with the
notification and the push API by
following the lab that accompanies this
video
one small gotcha don't use private or
incognito mode for this lab for security
reasons push notifications are not
supported in private or incognito mode
