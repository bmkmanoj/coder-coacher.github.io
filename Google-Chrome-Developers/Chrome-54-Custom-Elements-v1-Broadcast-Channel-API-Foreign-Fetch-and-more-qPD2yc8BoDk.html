tags and make reusable web components
with custom elements v1 it's easier to
send messages between open windows or
tabs on the same origin with the
broadcast channel API media experiences
get better on Android and foreign fetch
is now available as an origin trial I'm
Pete LePage let's dive in and see what's
new for developers and chrome 50 for
complex user interfaces often require a
large amount of HTML most languages
allow developers to create their own
component built on top of language
primitives to mitigate some of this
verbosity but until now creating
reusable components on the web has been
difficult custom elements allow you to
create your own custom HTML tags and
define the new element API and behavior
in JavaScript the result a browser
native way to build reusable
interoperable web components chrome 54
provides support for the latest custom
elements v1 spec and will continue to
support the v-0 spec until enough of you
have moved to v1 check out our primer on
custom elements to see how you can use
it to create reusable web components for
your site or application it's not
uncommon for desktop users to have
multiple windows or tabs open
simultaneously and some sites even
encourage this behavior such as web
editors the open documents in their own
tab communicating between these tabs can
be difficult the broadcast channel is a
new one-to-many messaging API between
windows tabs iframes web workers and
service workers it allows scripts to
create established named channels to
send messages between browsing context
of the same origin
media is an increasingly important part
of the browsing experience in addition
to a user gesture you can now use
element requests fullscreen to
your full-screen mode after a screen
orientation change and it allows you to
create richer media experiences that
include rotate to full screen imagine if
a commonly used origin like an API
provider web font service or other
service had its ability to deploy its
own Service Worker instead of always
going to the network the provider could
implement their own custom networking
logic and take advantage of a single
authoritative cache instance for storing
its responses now thanks to foreign FETs
which is available in chrome 54 as an
origin trial it's a reality check out
Jeffrey's post linked in the description
below these are just a few of the
changes in chrome 54 for developers
check the description for more details
and linked to documentation and
specifications and don't forget to check
out the chrome dev summit we'll be
streaming it on YouTube on November 11th
and 10th if you want to stay up to date
with chrome and know what's coming click
that subscribe button up there somewhere
anyways I'm Pete LePage and as soon as
chrome 55 is released I'll be right here
to tell you what's new in Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
