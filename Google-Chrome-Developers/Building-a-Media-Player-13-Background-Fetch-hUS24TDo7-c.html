out that I've been doing other bits and
pieces in between working on the media
app small clue Google i/o is coming up
so that's probably what it is
anyway what I wanted to do is at least
talk about one feature that has been
very experimental always fun to be on
the cutting edge of stuff and no
different in this particular situation
I've been working very closely with one
of the chrome engineers piece of evolu
and his team as well to try and get some
background fetch into the app so what is
background fetch background fetch is
imagine you're doing a normal foreground
fetch the one you call fetch in your
code okay that works but if you close
the tab or you go to a different URL or
whatever the fetch stops that's how all
the networking stuff normally works
background fetch is different insofar as
you trigger it from inside your
serviceworker it goes off makes a load
of requests that you asked it to make
and then you get an event that fires in
your serviceworker to say hey that that
download is finished what do you want to
do with it and you can do whatever you
want with it you can put them in the
cache you could put them in the
responses in index dB
it's really up to you what you do
epidemics is a much more robust download
experience and especially for something
like this a media app is probably one of
the the perfect vehicles for trying
background fetch out because hey we've
got big videos and what if you want to
kind of go off and do something else
well obviously it makes sense for you to
kind of keep that downloads going in the
background so it's very early days this
is the kind of the very first
implementation of background fetch that
wandered in chrome so you know it's it
doesn't I'm sure there's more to do I
know there's more to do but I just
wanted to really show you around this
the code as it is today just so you've
seen it alright so let me show you what
I see is different on the front end so I
have on on the browser I or in the
browser on the browser what is the
correct thing in on by with from I don't
know what
those with the browser involved I have
been able experimental web platform
features in about flags which you should
do if you want to test this and that
means that we then get background for
let me show you in the console if I say
background fetch do you see background
fetch fetch
I love the naming of these background
fetch manager that's a thing that won't
exist in window otherwise so if you
actually wanted to feature detect it
you'd say or just so you'd say
background fetch manager in window up to
or in chrome stable or whatever it'll be
false so yeah so the background fetch
manager background fetch and all those
other things are available in the window
they're also available in serviceworker
so when I said before the serviceworker
does a background download probably
partly true you can make the foreground
to it built duck we'll get to that
anyway let me show you around the code a
little bit so if you've had a look at
the code itself you'll have seen there's
an offline cache JavaScript file which
is sort of grown over time and I think
it's generally true of this app now that
if you remember what way back at the
start I said I know the thing about
media and this has been a journey of
exploration for me knowing now what I
know I think I would have structured the
app a little differently but that's the
nature of these things sometimes you
kind of get to the ending go okay I
learned a lot it's not that as bad it's
just that I just sort of grown
organically over time and I think I
would love to kind of take a step back
and go okay that's how these pieces
would normally interact if all these
features have been available at the
start oh yeah right background fetch so
here is the thing here I have it some
code that says if you support background
fetch which is pretty much what I just
showed you it's a background fetch major
England Oh that'll be true
or it'll be false if it's true then I do
have download in the background
otherwise I fall back to what I had
before which if you recall is the the
download where we sort of see the pie
chart and every
else and it's a foreground fetch it
happens in the page if you close the
page yeah nothing I can do for you
so download background what happens in
there well what I do is I by this point
when I call download but download the
background I know which files I need
which is like the video file the artwork
all the stuff that I wanted what I would
be fetching to make sure this thing is
available like the HTML as well so I
wait till the service worker is ready
this is a promise that resolves whenever
the service worker is available so if
there's no service worker available then
background fetch won't be available so
that's just how it is and and I fire off
an event just for the UI but I also post
a message over to the service worker the
active service worker with an action
which happens to be offline the name
that I want it to to use and the asset
so the name is an important thing you
tag a particular background fetch so
that if you have multiple background
fetch is going on they have different
names
in there so that you can differentiate
so you can actually have multiple
downloads going off at the same time so
on the service worker side let me fire
that up service worker yes there we are
on message perfect in the case of the
offline I just pull out those values and
I call into this separate class that I
made called background fetch helper and
I add yeah I asked it to the fetch so
that leads is very neatly onto the
background fetch helper in which we can
look in here and the background fetch
helper the fetch call here so the first
thing I do is I'm using Jake's ID B key
Val library because two reasons one is a
ID B is the only store that's available
inside a service worker because that's
where this code is running local storage
isn't available and two I don't like
working with ID be directly if I can
avoid it and jake has written this very
small very helpful key value store
that works with IDB so well done Jake
but what I do is if you bear in mind
that when you start a background fetch
you may also then close the tab or any
number of things could happen but what
because what's happening is the fetch is
being handled by some other machinery
somewhere and so we need to kind of
between states if you close the tab and
you brought the tab back we need to know
hang on a minute there should be a
background fetch in progress or or what
have you and also when we get all the
various responses in from the background
fetch we cannot have to tie it back to
the original request and that's exactly
what I'm doing here so you can see what
I do is I set based on the tag name I
store in a to be the assets that we were
requesting okay and then I set up this
background fetch which you can see is
that the actual background fetch API
here on the registration now our
background fetch property which i think
is the background fetch manager and or
an instance of that and then you call it
doc fetch and you give it the stuff that
it needs it goes off does its thing
at the end of which you can see we have
I've got currently registered background
fetch fail which would be if one of the
responses for a Ford 500 they did they
did did did or something else and then
background fetches if all the things
that I've requested come back as 200 and
or just generally a okay then we can
call on background fetched so in the
background fetch now what we have to do
is we kind of have to consolidate
because we say get we made a request for
say 10 files and the background fetch
let's say it succeeded we get back 10
responses what we have to do is we have
to kind of go through and say well what
do I do with these now if you recall
from previous times the videos get
chunked up into various pieces and so
we'll need to do the same here we
basically have to go through each of our
the responses figure out which response
was it we know which asset was I
actually requesting and that's we look
at the response URL we look at the asset
URL the one that we were requested week
ago all that must be that response for
that thing what do I do with it does
that want to get chunked does that one
just go into the caches
it is what am I supposed to do with that
so that's what the the consolidation
step that's that I'm doing that's well
that's designed to do here you see I've
got like for example if it's not
chunking just put it straight into the
cache if it is being chunked and being
split up into various blocks then we
call cashing chunks after we're done
with handling that risk that filtered
that array of responses then we can call
this notify all clients which is
basically a post back to all available
clients so if you're new to
serviceworker stuff there's the idea
that you've got one serviceworker which
is shared amongst possibly multiple tabs
and so rather than kind of trying to
figure out exactly which one of the tabs
requested the background fetch i just
notify them all and just say by the way
this background fetch happened here's
the the tag name and then I have some
front-end code that consolidates that
and goes oh yes that was that was far
yes I should I should throw a toast and
say that that was downloaded and then
there's a bit of tear down here which is
to remove that IDB times actually let me
go down here that we delete their ID B
key Val there so that if we were to
delete the downloaded videos and then
hit download again then it would all
work as expected rather than kind of
going oh I've already got something in
flight there with that key value pair
inside ID B okay so with all that kind
of code in place this is let me just get
rid of that this is what it actually
does
so for argument sake so I'm doing the
background fetch and I can go off to
home and as I say in normals land there
you do a notification and I think the
the that this back or at least the
explain if about graphics suggests that
there might be some UI work to do there
about showing a notification but
nonetheless when we come back in here
you can see I was on a completely
different page but you can see that
we've actually now got the offline copy
and in fact I can show you inside of the
application here inside of the cache
storage we have
the chrome channel trailer and though
these are all the the chunks of video
and so on so the background fetch
happened we populated the cache and then
when I came back into the page I did the
check that I would have done anyway
which is do I have you know something in
the cache for this video if yes I'll
assume that we have an offline video
available too so the the machinery that
stores and chunks and everything else is
kind of agnostic to the the front end
check to see whether it exists and
that's actually been extremely useful it
means I don't really mind whether
background fetch populates the cache or
a foreground pet fetch populates the
cache or anything populates the cache so
long as it's there when I load this page
I will assume that all is good because
there's only so many ways it could have
been populated and hopefully one of them
was me in my code so there you go that's
a very very speedy tour around
background fetch have a look at the code
have a look at the explainer will pop
that in the notes below that's written
by Jake and turns out he's quite useful
who knew hmm shock of the day anyway
also don't forget in comment subscribe
all that good stuff and let me know how
you get on and I'll see you in the
roundup video for the media PWA hey
folks thanks for watching don't forget
that there is more content that you can
find kind of over here ish and if you
want to subscribe there's probably a
button oh maybe there maybe somewhere
around there click that if you've not
done that brilliant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
