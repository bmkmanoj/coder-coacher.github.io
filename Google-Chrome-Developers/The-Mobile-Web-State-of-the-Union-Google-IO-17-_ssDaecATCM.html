product lead on Chrome and I'm excited
to be back up here again this year to
tell you about all the amazing progress
we've made over the last 12 months the
theme of today and something you're
going to hear again and again is that
the modern mobile web is now mainstream
and this is really an amazing shift so
I'm going to tell you all about what's
been happening and what it all means for
you it's the mobile web State of the
Union so let's dive right in the web has
incredible reach just Chrome alone runs
on over 2 billion devices from phones to
tablets to pcs and the web is much
bigger than just Chrome there are over
five billion devices out there that can
access web content 5 billion that is a
large number and this didn't happen
because of luck this wide reach is a
direct consequence of how the web
operates it is an open decentralized
platform it has no gatekeepers
developers get wide reach users get low
friction and on the chrome team our
mission has always been to move the web
platform forward we spent a lot of time
working on making the web platform
better lots of things on the foundations
things that what just happened under the
hood that you may not even recognize but
with every such change the web platform
just gets better to take one example
over the last year we focused our
JavaScript performance on real-world web
usage it's sort of like what kind of car
would you
Drive a car that's been road-tested in
real-world driving conditions or a car
that's been tested in an artificial lab
setting we want our car and our
JavaScript engine is literally called v8
we want our car to be great on the roads
that people actually drive on and
currently we think the speedometer
benchmark best captures this real-world
usage so I'm pleased to announce that
chrome on Android is now 35 percent
faster on the speedometer benchmark
compared to a year ago and we've seen
similar gains and we've seen similar
gains and other OSS as well to take
another example I'm sure all of us have
experienced the annoyance of loading a
web page and starting to read some
content only to have it jump to a
different location and this usually
happens because some off-screen content
is loaded in and pushed down the visible
content now to improve this user
experience we launched a new feature
called scroll anchoring and scroll
anchoring works by locking the scroll
position to an element that is visible
on the page so the user stays in the
same position
even as off-screen content gets loaded
in so to show you what this looks like
in action on the left is Chrome without
scroll anchoring and on the right is
Chrome with scroll anchoring enabled and
this is a long page and as we scroll
down the bottom of this page you see on
the right the page stays locked in
position while on the left the page is
jumping all over the place as off-screen
content gets loaded in now this is a bit
of a contrived demo just to show you
exactly what's going on but since we
launched this feature what we have seen
is that on average scroll anchoring
prevents three jumps per page loads so
this has had a huge impact on the
quality of the user experience and then
many more such changes things that don't
need any action from developers or use
but that just make the web platform
better so that's the foundation next
come all of the features and API is that
enable you all to do great things to
build great experiences on top of that
foundation and today I'm going to talk
about the amazing momentum we've seen
across the core pillars of the modern
mobile web I'm going to talk about what
we are doing to make web apps more
polished and feel more integrated into
the device and I'm going to talk about
all the ways we're working on to make
building web apps easier than ever
before so let's start with momentum one
of the core pillars of the modern mobile
web is accelerated mobile pages or amp'd
for content focused experiences now we
all know that content experiences on the
web can sometimes be quite painful and
we spearheaded the amp project last year
the open-source amp project last year to
improve this experience and the benefits
that amp brings a stark on average an
amp page loads in less than a second and
it uses 10 times less data and as a
result of the growth of amp has been
phenomenal
last year at this time there were 125
million amp documents out there and
today there are over 2 billion
amp pages from over 900 thousand
different domains amazing momentum and
more and more platforms are now linking
out to amps and they're doing this
because they find that the users are
more engaged when they can get to their
content faster for example LinkedIn is
found that people who spend 10 percent
more time reading an article when it's
an amp page versus when it's not and
today I'm excited to announce that
several new partners are going to be
supporting the amp project in the coming
weeks
Twitter was begin linking out to amps
across all of their mobile web and
native app properties
tumblr will begin using amp for 300
million of their blogs wave war will
begin supporting amp in the coming weeks
and 10 cents Qzone will also begin out
begin linking out to amped in the next
few weeks as well and finally amp is
seeing success in new verticals like
e-commerce with components such as AMP
binds merchants can build interactive
and engaging user experiences and many
merchants are doing just that
so that's an a great way to build
content focused experiences for the
modern mobile web the second pillar of
the modern mobile web is progressive web
apps or pwace progressive web apps are a
way to build app focused experiences
that are reliable fast and engaging and
we were inspired to start this journey
based on our belief that web experiences
can and should be radically better and
users of these experiences which means
that they're more engaged which means
conversions are higher which means
business metrics are better so this is
just a good thing all around but rather
than me tell you about how awesome will
forget the web apps are let's take a
look at one that just launched recently
is my pleasure to invite up on stage
Patrick throbber and Katie Siebert from
Twitter Thank You row hello Google i/o
my name is Patrick robber and I'm the
product manager for Twitter light and
I'm Katie Sivir an engineer on the
Twitter light team just five weeks ago
we launched Twitter light for the goal
of delivering a great user experience at
scale
sorry sorry one second we set out to
build a twitter client that one loads
quickly on slow networks to uses less
mobile data and three works on all
smartphones each month more than 300
million users come to Twitter to find
out what's happening in the world and
over 80% of our users are on mobile
devices we were seeing healthy growth in
mobile web usage at Twitter so we wanted
to make sure that this experience was
top-notch but rather than just telling
you about Twitter light why don't we
give you a live demo Katie can you walk
us through Twitter light sure pull it up
when users visit Twitter light on
Android they're prompted to add it's
their home screen
in fact Twitter light receives a million
visits each day via the home screen icon
go ahead and launch it as you can see it
initially launches us in full screen
modes just like a native app and sort of
light is optimized for speed taking
advantage of the purple pattern to
improve loading times by 30% and with
serviceworker caching reloading the app
is near instant and consumes no
additional data as you scroll through
the timeline at fast and smooth like a
native app and since many users come to
twitter to get the latest news and often
tap on publishing link we've been big
fans of amp on that note let's go take a
look at what owen with a google team is
doing he usually tweet interesting
articles let's check out this one
we're excited today to announce that
Twitter light links now links out to amp
pages so that content loads almost
instantly and uses less mobile data for
example you can see here that when Katy
tapped the link to the Guardian post on
Owens profile page it loaded instantly
in a new tab now it show up a couple of
engagement features one of the key
pieces of a polished experience is
making sure users send capture media and
tweeted so make things a little more
interesting / exciting what do you say
about doing a live photo tweet from on
stage all right like you knew I was
already gonna do it anyway alright the
disclaimer that I'm not a professional
photographer although you don't need to
use Twitter everyone strike a pose
alright and or that so let's tie Twitter
light live demo at hashtag io7
tweet
ah success so we see the tweet right
there now half the fun is receiving
retweets so thank you yes successful
demos are always applause already now
half the fun is receiving you know
that's like that retweet after you
tweeted something and one feature that's
had a huge impact on this has been push
notifications so pull up an entirely not
free can tweet notification all right so
Mari it's like one of our tweets you can
see Moe without Twitter calm at the top
click on it takes us right to that tweet
now notifying users about recent
activities he did bring them back in the
app so this has been very important for
us and since recently adding it we have
been sending more than 10 million push
notifications a day but I could keep
going for a pretty long time but in the
interest of time keeping things light
let's send it back to Patrick Thank You
Katie
it was important for us to deliver a
fast engaging experience while consuming
less mobile data Twitter light already
consumes less data as compared to our
native apps but on top of that we
launched a new feature called data saver
when a user is in data saver mode they
can save up to an additional 70% on
their mobile data everyone benefits from
lower data usage but this is especially
compelling for users in emerging markets
now Twitter light delivers all the key
features at a fraction of the size
compared to any of the native apps here
you can see the size difference of
Twitter light compared to our Android
and iOS apps and of course the mobile
web is more than just a landing page
we're excited to provide a fast
feature-rich experience and our users
from around the world from Nigeria to
Japan to Ecuador the Philippines they
love it as well and we see it in our
metrics too we're seeing increases in
pages per session and tweets sent from
Twitter light in like Katie said we're
seeing more than 1 million launches from
the home screen
every day most importantly our users are
happy Twitter light is our new standard
mobile web experience available to all
users globally on Android and iOS and we
hope you check it out thank you Thank
You Patrick and giddy twitter.com is the
PWA folks the modern mobile web is truly
mainstream and it's not just Twitter
last year we talked about some early
adopters of progressive web apps and
since then the momentum and growth has
been phenomenal these launches are
happening all over the world and they're
happening across all industry segments
large travel companies like Expedia and
travel and we go have all launched
progressive web apps publishers like
info Bay and Forbes have launched
progressive web apps Forbes has seen
their user engagement doubled since the
launch of their progressive web apps
ecommerce sites like Fandango Rakuten
and Alibaba are all investing in pwace
and even new services that we don't
think office app only like ride-sharing
services have gotten in on the action
lyft launched their progressive web app
last fall and Ola cabs India's largest
ride-sharing service just recently
launched their PWA and in fact Ola will
be up on stage in just a bit to show it
off to you now one reason progressive
web apps are so successful is that
multiple browsers are committed to them
so while developer adoption is growing
so is browser supports and if a browser
you care about isn't on this list yet
progressive web apps are designed to
work well everywhere so you can always
count on reaching the users that are
important to you
take the example of luxury cosmetics
brand Lancome Lancome recently launched
to progress the web app and it works
great on all browsers and they seen
great stats but what I want to call out
here is that iOS is particularly
important for Lancome because 65% of
their mobile web users are on iPhones
and what Lancome observed was that those
iOS users have a session length that is
now 53% higher than it was before their
launch and this is despite the fact that
some PDA features are not supported on
that platform now the progressive and
progressive web apps really refers to
progressive enhancements but what it
really means is that you can count on
reaching the user that are important to
you no matter what browser mix you care
about so the momentum and growth across
the four pillars of the modern mobile
web across amp and progressive Web Apps
has been truly incredible over the last
12 months the modern mobile web is now
truly mainstream now while all of this
momentum is happening all around us we
have been heads down working on making
progressive web apps even better our
goal is to make web apps feel more
integrated into the overall device so
users get a robust no compromises
experience how are we doing this they're
adding a lot of new API eyes to the web
platform in fact we added 250 new AP
eyes just since Google i/o last year but
what's really important is not the
number of AP eyes we shipped
what's really important is what use
cases can these API is unlock for you
and I want to talk about three use cases
today
installing web apps to your device
paying for things on the web and
polished media experiences let's start
with install ability
we already have a way to add web apps to
your home screen but we've made it a lot
better now first of all we've heard from
many of you that you would like the
installed prompts to be more reliable
and predictable and we've heard your
feedback loud and clear
so I'm happy to report that now you can
show the installed prompt to your users
when you want and once a user has
installed your web app to their device
it shows up everywhere you expect an app
to show up they show up in the app
launcher not just the home screen
they're integrated into Android settings
they participate in the Android intents
system like alongside any other native
app they can handle notifications
natively rather than through Chrome and
web apps can launch in full-screen mode
just like any native Android app can as
well so it's easier than ever before to
install web applications to your device
so from installing web apps to your
device let's look at our second use case
paying for things on the web mobile
payments are a big deal mobile commerce
was worth 123 billion dollars last year
just in the US alone and to make payment
flows on the web better we launched a
one tap payments API called payment
request and it works with credit cards
and it works with google forms of
payments such as Android pay and many
merchants are actively using this API
today but we know that credit cards are
just part of the puzzle here people have
lots of different ways to pay for things
and we want to make sure that a user on
the web can pay for things using the
payment apps they already use so I'm
very pleased to announce that now your
website
can integrate with any supported payment
app using payment requests so if a user
has a native payment app installed you
can integrate that right into your
payment flow on the web we are already
working with Samsung pay and Ali pay and
many other native payment apps will be
integrated very soon it's not just
native payment apps you want web apps to
be integrated as well and we're actively
partnering with PayPal to bring their
web app right in the payment request so
we want to make sure that the entire
third-party payment ecosystem is
available for you in your checkout flow
on the web so from installing web apps
to your device and payments let's look
at our third use case media experiences
media is important over 70% of Internet
traffic is video and so it's important
to us that we deliver a complete
solution for media on the mobile web now
we've been working on adding many new
api's things like the media sessions API
background fetch full screen orientation
and many others and we put together a
sample app to show you the kind of media
experiences that are possible using
these API s so let me walk you through
some of the highlights first as you can
see I've installed the app to my device
and when I tap on it it launches in
full-screen mode with a splash screen an
app branding is front and center there's
no chrome UI anywhere here and when I
tap on a video to play it or actually
when I when I scroll up and down you can
see that the app feels smooth and fluid
and just works really just works in a
very polished way and when I tap on a
video to play it it plays back instantly
and this is not because the Wi-Fi is
really good it's because we prefetch the
first few seconds of video so that we
could enable instant playback
and if I just flip my phone over it'll
instantly enter full screen mode and you
can see this video has custom controls
so I can go backwards and forwards 30
seconds and as I use the scroll bar you
see thumbnails start to appear and if I
lock the device you can see the
background poster image and you can see
media controls appeared right on the
lock screen and this could be really
useful for example if I'm listening to
audio on my morning commute and finally
this all works really well offline as
well so if I go into airplane mode I can
view videos that I've previously saved
for offline viewing and I can tap on it
and I can play the video while I'm
offline all of this goodness
is available on the mobile web today so
from installing web apps to your device
to paying for things on the web to
polish media experiences we're working
hard to make using web apps a great
experience we're also working hard to
make building web apps a great
experience so here's a question how good
is your current web app and how would
you even find out to help you answer
that question we launched a tool called
lighthouse lighthouse guides you along
your PWA journey
and runs over a hundred audits against
your web app checking everything from
page performance to bite efficiency to
accessibility and even gives you a score
from 0 to 100 so if you want to brag
about your great lighthouse score on
Twitter you can it really does seem to
get the competitive juices flowing and
you want to take all of the goodness of
lighthouse and make it as easy for
everyone to use as possible and so we're
integrating lighthouse right into chrome
developer tools so you can just open it
up and you see a lighthouse audit right
there whether you want to treat your
score or not I'll leave up to you
so how do you get a great lighthouse
score well one thing your app will need
to work well when you're offline or in a
flaky Network and there's a powerful
technology built into browsers called
serviceworker that enables this but
serviceworker is quite a low-level api
and can be hard to work with directly so
to help you take full advantage of the
power of serviceworker I'd like to
introduce work box work box is a tool
that we have built that enables you to
take to get the most out of
serviceworker it builds upon existing
tools and it simplifies a number of
common patterns and best practices
things like flexible caching a managing
background sync or even collecting usage
stats when the user is offline and work
box is completely modular and flexible
so that you can just take work box
integrate it into your existing tools
and start using it right away but to
really max out that lighthouse core your
app will need to do more than just work
offline it'll need to be fast and this
means that you need to be able to build
and wrote load your rich complex
application with as little extra
overhead as possible web components are
a way to build lightweight reusable
pieces of your app with very little
overhead you can create your own
components so you can reuse one of the
thousands of components that already
exists remember those amazing amp
performance numbers amp is based on web
components and just like we built work
box to help you get the most out of
serviceworker we built polymer to help
you get the most out of web components
and I'm happy to announce today the
launch of polymer 2.0 the next major
evolution of the polymer library
it is a ground-up rethink that is built
to take full advantage of the best new
features of the modern web platform it
uses the new web component API set of
ships in Chrome and Safari it embraces
es6 classes
it is completely modular and best of all
it's ten percent faster and eighty
percent smaller so to take a look at
someone who has used polymer to build a
great progressive web app with a great
lighthouse core let me invite up on
stage typical Kapadia and Russell Roy
from Ola cabs Hank Brown
hi everyone I'm the picker Kapadia head
of consumer web products and I'm not -
Roy's principal engineer you hear all
the way from Bangalore and really
excited to tell you about Ola and our
PWA Oh live India's largest ride-hailing
service with a vision to provide
mobility for a billion Indians we
started six years ago out of a little
apartment in Mumbai and in those days
our co-founders would actually drive
customers around when they right then
show up today we do over a million daily
ride but even that's not enough when
your mission is to move a billion
Indians around in order to do that we
needed to reach tier 2 tier 3 cities
smaller cities with flaky networks where
users have low-end smartphones with slow
processors and low memory it's the rich
to reach this audience that we build our
PWA we'd love to show you what we built
so let's go to demo with Russell driving
battle let's assume we're back in
Bangalore after an awesome IO experience
and need to get a ride from the airport
back to the office will you book us an
SUV sure the bigger I'm launching the
ole opry w from the home screen it's
fast isn't it it's asking for the
browser location permission but I'm
going to go ahead and choose all the
locations from my cell favorites so I
will be taking cab from the airport to
work the reason I could do it so fast
because I said all the locations have my
favorites but if you haven't still you
can go ahead and either search in the
address bar for the location or you can
load it in the map and navigate through
if we have noticed in order to save data
we load the map only when you need to
shells right zip it off we haven't had
to be available in five minutes cool but
what kind of a ride are we going to get
sure have a look a sweet I think extra
legroom up this long slide back fits the
bill sure but I so far you've seen that
our PWA is an immersive full-page
experience that's responsive to the
touch loads really fast and supports
back button navigation much like a
native app what do you say guys shall we
book a real-life cab in Bangalore it's
about 5:00 a.m. there awesome Russell do
the honor Joyce let me try I'm
confirming the booking typical go for it
oops there you have it guys this is a
real live booking in Bangalore that we
just made
thank you so much Russell sure nothing
big here you better cancel that booking
before he gets mad and shows up about
this visit except someone is awesome
okay so the Ola PWA is only a half Meg
of which the application code is just
200 Kb
so how did we build this really
performant app with such a small size
let's look at that first we use the
polymer framework which leverages Chrome
or other browser resources and gives us
blazing fast web components DOM and CSS
encapsulation using shadow DOM and HTML
import for a very efficient for dkb next
let's talk about those past load times
what you saw right now in the demo was
the repeat cached experience of the home
screen but we have a really enviable
first load time of 1 to 3 seconds
depending on the network including low
3G which is where our target audience
lives let me show you how as you can see
on the left side here we load our web
components very strategically using a
waterfall model so that we're only
fetching those components that the user
needs to see for his first interaction
with our PWA we are fetching in the
background the other resources he needs
to ensure that the experience stays
snappy going forward once we've loaded
all the components using work box we pre
cache all of these so that the repeat
load time stays under a second from this
point on the only server calls that we
are making is to fetch data such as real
time have availabilities making a
booking etc all of this stays under
about 5 Kb
we also leverage lighthouse and
webpagetest and we're planning to
integrate lighthouse in our bills
because obviously we'll add more
features to the app so here you can see
our lighthouse for your very very proud
of this core and we optimized for a
perfect score and we can totally relate
to developers wanting to tweet and brag
about this so how's our PWA doing for us
well we've been out for about a month
now
and we're seeing that our conversion all
right booked into your two cities is
comparable to our native app what's
great to see is that in tier 3 cities
smaller cities our conversion is
actually 30% higher than our native apps
which shows that clearly you're solving
for network issues and the need for low
data usage which is inherent in these
geographies we've also seen mobile
traffic increased by 68% of these cities
since we launched which shows that we
are expanding our reach but what
surprised even us is that 20% of our PWA
bookings comes from users who have
previously uninstalled our native apps
so this shows that our PWA can even be a
great reengagement tool so there you
have it guys
rpw has been a win-win for our customers
and for Ola I hope sharing our journey
inspires many of you to build your own
progressive web app and the next time
you're in India
remember to book your ride on Ola
thank you thank you there you go ah
great thank you typical and rattle and
congratulations to the team at Ola so
folks there you have it amazing momentum
on the core pillars of the modern mobile
web amp and PW is new API is unlocking
new experiences and new use cases
everything from installing Web Apps to
your device to paying for things on the
web to polish media experiences and
looking ahead computing continues to
evolve at a fast clip and we at Google
want to make sure that we can help
developers take advantage of these
changes whether they're building native
apps or building for the web and just
like we do with native apps we want the
web to be a great platform for future
technologies as they evolve
one such future technology is VR virtual
reality enables the creation of richly
imagined worlds that you can fully
immerse yourself in and through the web
VR API all of this expressive power is
available on the web web VR enables
companies like within to showcase these
amazing VR explorations from creators
around the world right in your browser
web viewer enables companies like
sketchpad to bring you these amazing
stunning VR themes to explore they have
over one-and-a-half million of these now
these would be truly mind-blowing if you
all had VR headsets on but you get a
sense of what is possible web PR is now
fully supported in Chrome and most major
browser vendors have announced their
support as well and looking even further
ahead you see the advent of a our
augmented reality way to connect
information to the physical world so no
matter how computing evolves and changes
in the future the web will always be
here
as a way for you to reach your users at
scale if you want to dig in more we have
a lot of great sessions on the mobile
web at i/o this year and even after IO
is done come and talk to us tell us what
you're working on tell us what your
challenges are we are here to help you
be successful on the web it's amazing to
see how far we've come over the last 12
months the modern mobile web is now
mainstream and I can't wait to see what
happens in the next 12 months thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
