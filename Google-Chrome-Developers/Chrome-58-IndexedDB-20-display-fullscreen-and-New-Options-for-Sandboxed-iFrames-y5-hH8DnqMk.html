supported in Chrome and features new
schema management bulk action methods
and more standardized handling of
failures progressive web apps become
more immersive with display fullscreen
allow top navigation by user activation
gives sandboxed iframes new powers and
there's plenty more I'm Pete LePage
let's dive in and see what's new for
developers in chrome 58 the structure of
your site's database has large
performance impacts and can be difficult
to change indexdb 2.0 changes that
update object stores and indexes can now
be renamed in place after refactoring
binary keys allow for more natural Keys
without worrying about performance
penalties data retrieval is easier with
get key open key cursor and continue
primary key methods and bulk recovery of
entire data sets no longer needs a
cursor with get all and get all key when
progressive web apps are launched from
the Android home screen they launch in a
standalone app like mode that hides the
omnibox this helps create an engaging
user experience and frees up screen
space for content however for even more
immersive experiences like games video
players and other rich content mobile UI
elements such as the system bar can
still be a distraction and take up
valuable pixels that you may want now
you can make your progressive web app
feel more immersive by setting display
fullscreen in your web app manifest when
your app is launched from the home
screen all non app mobile UI elements
will be hidden chrome 58 now supports
the new iframe sandbox keyword allow top
navigation by user activation when
triggered by a user interaction this
keyword gives sandbox iframes the
ability to navigate the top-level page
while still blocking auto redirect and
of course there's plenty more say
goodbye to the clear fix hack instead of
manually resetting multiple layout
properties like float and clear you can
now add a new block formating context
using display flow root pointer events
get coalesced events allows you to
access all input events since the last
time a pointer event was delivered
perfect for when you need a precise
history of points for things like
drawing apps and workers and shared
workers can be created using data URLs
making development with workers more
secure like giving them an opaque origin
these are just a few of the changes in
chrome 58 for developers check the
