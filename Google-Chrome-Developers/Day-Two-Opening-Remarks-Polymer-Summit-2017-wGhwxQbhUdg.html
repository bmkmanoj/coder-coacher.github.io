you this morning to kick off day two of
the polymer summit
he's been gone brave and he's down there
so to start out with I do have a bit of
bad news we have actually been
practicing our dance number for quite a
long time now yeah and we would just
informed that we didn't get the rights
for the music oh man it's a it's a shame
because we had tailored this number to
this own particular song and without it
we're just going to have to move on to
our backup talk which we prepared just
in case there's one little bit of good
news though which is Rob Dodson snuck in
and did a little video of us practicing
so maybe we'll get something for next
year maybe maybe so we've both been
working on the web for a really long
time initially as developers building
things on top of the platform back in
the mid-90s and we've worked in various
capacities at places like Google Palm
like Matt was just talking about a
Mozilla pushing the web platform forward
and now we're at Google this is Deion
second time my first where Dionne leads
developer relations and Ben's product
lead on Chrome and in our new roles or
in positions again to help steer the web
and so we've been thinking a lot about
its future and this morning we want to
share some of our thoughts with you just
to sort of get a conversation started
both here and afterwards and hear your
feedback about where the web platform
should go and as we got to riff on this
again I really kind of go deep we can't
wait to share just how excited we are
about the future of the web which may
not be obvious to some of you because
the web's actually been through some
tough years lately
which is kind of a shame because the web
in its early years was such an amazing
wonder can sort of personified by Marc
Andreessen on the slide it's amazing
when you sort of sit back and ponder all
that the web was able to accomplish in
such a short time
and I think one of the first
accomplishment that comes to mind is the
global disruption of basically every
industry that the web kicked off that's
transformed the world we live in and
that disruption is still reverberating
today
and before the web do you remember this
remember using things like gopher or
fdpir see ya I was at the University of
Minnesota there we go I was at the
University of Minnesota where we gave
birth to gopher and it was really you
know useful in the computer lab but not
so much for kind of the average Joe and
so really the web to me kind of packaged
up the Internet and made it the first
consumer friendly and really develop a
friendly platform and its aim a little
upset about all the applause because I'm
gonna have to listen to stories about
gopher now in the next few weeks
it was a busy you know the iPhone we
sort of forget about that I an iPhone
sometimes and that goes back to the iMac
or it explicitly stood for the Internet
Mac because back when Steve Jobs came to
Apple a second time and sort of figured
out how to bring the the Mac to market
he felt like he needed to do something
different to compete with the Windows
app ecosystem he had to change the game
and so he marketed the iMac as the best
way to get to the Internet and position
the Internet is really the thing that
mattered not apps and he kind of had a
point back then because the internet was
where all the cool new content was that
people wanted to engage with and so the
Internet in addition to his other
accomplishments it also opened up the
marketplace again for a platform like
the Mac to come in and it wasn't just
the Mac he imagined using Linux without
being able to use a browser so at this
point in time the web was a truly
unprecedented success but then what
happened the way I've had a little
younger brother come along will call him
mobile and we know when you're first
younger sibling comes along got this
cute little baby does a lot a little
baby runs longer look how cute it is and
even a cute little toys but they could
play with these were so fun you could do
some fun cute little things with them
and like a lot of younger brothers you
try and kind of emulate and act like the
older brother so it tried to do cute
little web like things you know back
then in mobile and then before you know
it that little brother Mobile's grew up
and turned it to something that was
maybe something that someone might think
is a little bit stronger a little bit
more capable a little bit more talented
than its older sibling
and people suddenly noticed and before
you know it mobile app's became the new
thing and at this point we started to
question were the web's best days
actually behind us and you know the
web's been through lots of difficult
moments before if you remember things
like Java applets flash and Silverlight
all tried to go over the top of the web
and replace the web with a different UI
layer and the web's constantly been able
to reinvent itself in pivotal moments
like Firefox coming to market and
restoring browser diversity at a time
when people openly questioned whether
there was even a need for browser
innovation or Ajax barring a reinvention
of web apps
resetting what was even possible to
build on the web or chrome bringing
speed stability and security to a whole
new level and enabling the landscape we
have of really sophisticated high
performance web applications today so
the web has this history of reinventing
itself to adapt to the changing
landscape and new opportunities and then
mobile suddenly became another one of
these opportunities right at this point
in time the web is the vendor Caen
became maybe a little bit bloated maybe
a little bit out of shape compared to
mobile apps and it was time to kind of
get back to the gym to get fit again and
we did that and that resulted in things
like AB PWA all of these capabilities
we've been talking about the last few
years making the web truly awesome on
mobile and that continues as we come
with new technologies like WebGL
webassembly Houdini etc etc the web's
working out hard to enable these new
class of applications and so now the
web's kind of catching up to that
younger brother but what about the
future as we look forward to what's on
the horizon we actually think the future
of the web is set up to be really
exciting and to explain that we want to
talk about three trends that are just
around the corner and how the web is
situated to meet these opportunities
first the proliferation of even more
devices and we want to talk about
augmented reality for a minute and
finally we want to talk about assistive
interfaces
to start out with let's consider today's
smartphone desktop world there are so
many devices it's really hard as a
native developer to keep up with
compatibility across all these different
devices in all the worldwide markets and
it explains why things like watches and
and smartphones
sorry watches and tablets aren't
universally supported because of the
effort required to extend today's and
then consider Smart TVs which are pretty
ubiquitous and other smart devices that
are now hitting the market and new ones
that are just around the corner
how are going to manage developing for
all these different devices and it sort
of helps you realize that native is
really fun when you're targeting a
relatively homogenous device surface but
it can be a nightmare when you're
tackling all this complexity and so it
really makes you appreciate that native
makes the most sense when you're
creating an experience that's tailored
to a particular device or device sort of
profile and that's really why you sort
of use the word native because it sort
of indicates that you're targeting
something that's really specific and
also explain why one of the world's most
popular vertically integrated hardware
software companies has their own native
SDK split into different flavors for
watches and TVs and tablet smartphones
and laptops it's sort of like house
coming to Copenhagen for the best
experience we'd love to like fully
understand and learn Danish but hey
that's kind of hard be we're only here
for a week and that doesn't really scale
like we're going to Poland in a couple
of weeks to speak at a Google developer
day fortunately for us there's a
cross-platform anguish called
English there's kind of a fantastic
alternative thanks very much by the way
and so the web's always been about this
trade-off of sacrificing sort of tight
native coupling for the ability to adapt
to a wide variety of devices and
platforms and the idea of the web
adapting itself to these wildly
different device types has been back to
the web in the very beginning even the
original version of CSS contemplated the
feature to enable a web page to adapt to
text-to-speech devices for example and
these mechanisms of the web were largely
ahead of their time you could use them
for theming and you can see this in
sites like CSS Zen garden but now in the
multi-device world we're in
we're finding new use for these
mechanisms and things like media queries
bring them to a new level of maturity
and usefulness so as we enter this
multi-device world we think the web is
actually ideally situated to help us
cope with its challenges and it's ready
for this fundamental trade-off that will
be required to scale to this world we're
entering up new platforms form factors
and modalities let's talk about
augmented reality for a second you know
with AR we've seen a lot of these
different scenarios pop out that are
pretty compelling
you know we're merging digital and
physical objects for shopping gaming and
much much more and seeing it through a
phone is neat it's already useful it's
nice to be able to kind of go zoom in
and play around with things but what's
going to happen when this explodes in
the future we get full field of vision
through glasses or whatever technology
is that you're going to bring this to
you we think this is actually going to
be pretty fantastic and when you think
of this future you look at the heart of
AR to us it looks kind of like a browser
it's about mapping physical addresses to
virtual content and this is what the web
does every day through URLs and what do
you want to hear you want to link to
third-party content to seamlessly browse
around and explore different things that
are out there in the world you don't
want to install apps for every
experience as you go around so to ask
when we look at AR it seems like a
natural extension to the model of the
web itself last thing we want to talk
about our assistive interfaces because
now the computers can understand you
when you speak to them and they can
speak to you it's a fantastic way to get
things done I mean really why use the
linked list of native app launchers and
bespoke app interfaces when you can use
the voice hash table to get right to the
functionality bucket that you're looking
for
I was pretty fantastic if you can say
set a timer for 30 minutes instead of
having to open up the app and navigate
through it it's really effective but not
always
anyone remember calling into phone
hotline something like a movie phone
listing where you're sitting there on
the phone while this voice comes back
with like their own 10 movies close to
you
anyone remember me is everybody going in
was that a thing here there's like a
hand in the back of one hand we like it
my painful voice trees everyone's gone
through that little bit it was a very
frustrating experience and it really
shows that assistive you eyes to be
effective they have to span all of the
screens in our life because you want to
be able to start a session and have that
session seamlessly go to whatever screen
is around you in the movie for example
you want to be able to use your voice to
say what movies are playing then you
want to see the listings on a tablet or
a TV that's close by and communicate
which one you want to see and so this
means that the assistive ecosystem that
we're running into also is coupled to
the device problem we mentioned earlier
but it introduces another problem
because now the assistant has to act as
an agent for the user and in order to do
that it has to understand the content of
the experience where if we have the time
user agent before so in order for this
to work we have to introduce a semantic
layer into our content which again takes
us back to the future of the web as a
recent article by Zach Bloom on the
history of CSS sort of reminded us it
included this awesome quote from Marc
Andreessen where he talks about having
to explain to developers that it's a
feature of the web that you don't
actually get to control the presentation
of your content that the web is just
about content that actually eventually
failed as browsers bowed to pressure to
hack in presentation tags into HTML and
the web tried again with CSS the
original vision of CSS was to enforce
this separation and also there was a
failed pivot to XML and XSL do you guys
remember that anyone again no no we got
a few more than Moviefone actually so
we've tried and I think these attempts
really ultimately failed because they
were just too far ahead of their time
ultimately everyone was just trying to
display pixels on the screen and the
sort of multi-device multi-modality
future was science fiction and if
there's one thing we're really good at
is developers it's finding the easiest
path to solutions but with the need for
intelligent agents to broker these
experiences and for those agents to
understand what's happening we think
it's time for us as a community to
revisit these ideas and evolve them for
the future that we're running into and
now we have web components where we get
to separate semantic markup from the
actual implementation we've barely
scratched the surface on how we can
separate those things at the moment
and so in review when we look at these
trends when we look at the devices that
are coming in augmented reality and and
intelligent agents we think they
actually play to the web strengths and
it's one of the reasons why we're so
bullish and excited about the future of
the web and it also paints for us a
potential roadmap of where the web needs
to go from here so coming back to the
brothers again you know they each had
their kind of time in the Sun at this
point they've kind of matured we've got
mature platforms on both native and on
the web and we believe both that you
have a long future ahead of them we go
interesting things to come
unless of course another little brother
or sister comes along and gets the use
of them thank you thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
