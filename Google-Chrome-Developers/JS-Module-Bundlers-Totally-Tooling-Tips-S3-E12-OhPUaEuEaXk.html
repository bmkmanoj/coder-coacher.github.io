tunnel
we're not in a coffee shop in a tavern
well you know empty tavern completely
okay we're in a pub it's an organic it's
an empty space it's a pub it's a pub so
module bundling is a thing yes one of
those other things that make us cry on a
daily basis to be honest but it's a
necessary evil because then we get all
the years 2015 goodness today you know
you've been dealing with a lot of the
tools and and if I what if he browserify
babe laughs I wear all upper thigh as my
current if I set because I tried Babel
and roll up without the iffy bits and it
didn't work
somewhere someone envies you it's not me
someone is yeah you tell me how to fix
it and that'd be great happening so
browserify browserify well start off
with browserify um it's a tool for
compiling your node flavor comment yes
modules into the browser
it's basically stuff you grab off NPM um
it'll analyze your require calls build a
bundle that you can serve up to the
browser using a script tag it's pretty
yes basically when you do like require
brackets whatever you put inside what it
does it looks at that file and then just
basically in lines it into one single
javascript file so then you create a
JavaScript bundle yeah so basically
packages publish to NPM originally
intended for node will just work in the
browser it's kind of nice for little
utilities and stuff like that yeah using
it's pretty straightforward so you go
and require something like I don't know
a module called magic they're probably
easy I don't even want to look it up
you've made it I haven't made it yeah
carry on okay so let's say that you've
required in a module called unicorn you
can then go and start using it like do
unicorn dance you go and run browserify
against it to generate a bundle and when
you try it out in the browser log
message dance like nobody is watching
because they're not I'll always watch
you dance Annie and that's where the
lawyers come in
so talked about browserify yep we'll
come back to that we also have to
mention web pack so web pack where pack
is like the new hotness and I've not
looked at it because last time I spoke
to you using this you seem like you're
in severe pain I had a bucket next to my
desk for my tears just came from my pack
so what pack it's great it's useful it's
just it's not the nicest thing to use so
web pack is another module bundle over
practicum and gs modules your AMD
modules in the browser it has a few
other features it's got like things like
loaders for transforming resources in
you know into JavaScript so you could
take something like JSX
just to load it in do all the
transformations for you
loaders are sort of like tasks in other
build tools so you'd use it as a way to
get you sort of front-end build steps
ish mmm like this is the things like I'm
struggling to figure out what it does
over browserify and everything else okay
let's so let's ignore anything that I've
said there that the the main thing that
I like web pack for is a feature called
code splitting rights okay koats pudding
lets you basically split your codebase
into chunks and you can then go and load
them on demands it's kind of nice so
this is just have a cross-browser way of
loading in these extra chunks of
JavaScript basically you can say you can
configure what you know what you want
how does it you want to split your
codebase up they will just figure out
the rest it's kind of nice okay
it also has a saw the feature called hot
module replacement have you have you
heard of that before
no it sounds great hater more um so
that's used to inject updated modules
into your active runtime so let's say
that we had like I don't know a chat
widget with some sort yeah arm that
relied on a bunch of different modules
and some of those modules in the getting
updated you could inject like the
updates into your active running runtime
and just get it working fair enough it's
kind of cool it's like live reload for
every module so that on live it's extra
live production yeah live live I'm using
webpack is pretty straightforward going
install it globally run it against your
app to go and generate a bundle and then
just include it using some script tags
it's pretty pretty straightforward going
to config file as well everything's
gotta have its own config yeah these
days yeah you're probably wondering what
the difference between web pack and you
you don't you don't care anymore you're
just you just dead on the inside no III
can kind of see there being some avanti
at the same time I don't think I'd ever
used the web pack features what's wrong
what's wrong with you well probably the
photos make sense if I can get away with
not using browserify then I would but I
can't so picking picking you know it's a
choice between my pack and browsers
requires a little bit more nuance than
just you know saying they both do the
same thing if you only care about
features it depends on the features like
if you want the code splitting or the
hot module replacement go and use
webpack yep browserify is a little bit
smaller and more modular lets you go and
you know select plugins and compose them
with transforms it's nice web pack I
would say brings more features to the
table and it puts those in core but
they're both pretty extensible so try
them both out use whatever makes sense
yeah moving on
Sam ciccone recently put together this
repo called the cost of transporting yes
2015 CS 2016 and he tried out a whole
range of different module bundling
strategies he found out that they were
like some some very small differences
you know once you start paring like
browserify and babel fi your web configs
and other bits and pieces the numbers
you know they they vary slightly yeah
you don't start releasing huge wins
until you try out like closure or roll
up you try to roll up before I've added
it now like his I think we have this
discussion of why would you need roll up
in a browser 5 babe laughs i weld and it
was the tree shaking yeah so roll up
assumes in some cases that you're going
to be probably working with es2015
modules and it's got this nice feature
called tree shaking that excludes your
unused exports from bundles web pack 2
beta I want to say has got support for
tree shaking as well okay if people want
to stick with web pack but it's a useful
feature a good for eliminating
sort of dead code that you don't really
need I believe Richard Harris got
a good blog post on medium that explains
the differences between tree shaking and
dead code elimination and how all that
stuff plays out mm-hmm it's worth
checking out but roll-ups pretty
straightforward to use just go install
it globally specify what format you want
your output bundle to take whether it's
commonjs
will have you and it just does its thing
as it turns out roll-ups output was a
few kilobytes smaller I think I read
somewhere that a few people trying the
stuff out have found like on average
they were getting 20 or 30 percent wins
nice roll-up that's again assuming
you're playing around with these 2015
modules but presumably is use it more
and more the wins might actually grow as
well if more libraries are using yeah
it's 2015 yeah but also this is this is
a nice little visual from Sam basically
the TLDR is closure actually ends up
giving you the smallest size if you are
looking at module bonding stuff we
didn't even talk about closure yeah at
all but people should check out this
repo a good helper for roughly guessing
what's gonna be useful and running
through its runtime yeah and it's nice
seeing all the options I think the thing
is is it comes down to a point of what
works for your project and is the
easiest for you to work with I I like
there's no clear winner on there to the
point where it's like oh if you clearly
do all this pain you're gonna get to a
nice clear like reduction in file size
is gonna be minimal yes so if you're not
using an if I tool in your current
workflow well what pack doesn't have an
affine it where pack affine see the
saddest thing is I can see it happening
next week now web web pack F oh that's
our job slowly making JavaScript worse
on a week to week basis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
