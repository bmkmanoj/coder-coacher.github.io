gonna perform a perfon it of your
polymer app a lot of words let's turn
that up when it's more like performing a
PA of yo PA or you know we can go
shorter anyways let's get into it
there's a word that I want to just bring
up slow it's just like it's this word I
don't love it because the challenge with
the word slow is that it's just kind of
ambiguous and slowness is can be a lot
of things you know it's like I heard
that like animating things with jQuery
is slow and a script in the head is slow
but like how do you compare these things
unlike what actually matters more it's
really hard to kind of like pull it
apart some so like is 10 milliseconds
slow mmm 10 milliseconds in the page
load of like an e-commerce site yeah 10
milliseconds delay is really not going
to show up at page load but like 10
milliseconds in a WebGL 60 FPS
experience adding 10 10 milliseconds to
every frame is gonna completely decimate
the experience it's going to be terrible
so now like certainly 10 millisecond
makes a big difference here so it's like
it's contextual right but that's not it
like it's not just when it happens but I
has to do with like what the user is
thinking right so we've been thinking
about this on Chrome trying to come to a
better understanding of like how to
think about performance and slowness and
fastness and we're like we need to like
you know constructed a nice model for
this we went back to the the 10 things i
think it's like the 10 principles of
google and like number one is this its
focus on the user and all else will
follow like okay I like it let's like
think about how we can be extremely user
centric when we talk about performance
cool all right so how do we do that I
don't know like first step the way that
we all think about performance is
basically that faster is
better and just like mega faster and it
gets way better and such as like this
linear kind of relationship between the
two but along this line there's like a
few kind of important points that happen
at the very bottom when performance is
really poor like it's bad I mean you'd
like you load up some experience and
either it's taking too long to start or
like as you're using it it's just really
having a hard time and like you quit
right you're just like nope not I got
things to do it's a little bit faster
you at some point you're just like yeah
like that's not great but I can deal
with it and it's like bearable faster
than that and you use like you know
everything's good like I'm very happy it
looks great this is awesome and then
even faster than that I i mean i could
get faster but it was also like it's
harder to actually see the difference
sometimes right so maybe the the
relationship here is not so linear maybe
it's a little bit more like this where
we have kind of this trough in front of
everything we're basically in between
this really bad performance and bad
performance like it's just not good
enough and and and your users are going
to bail but at some point it's good
enough and then like you know and
they're happy and delighted even so
there's this area right here kind of in
the middle we're like that's gonna where
you want to be but you're like what what
are the numbers like how do we quantify
this area all right so like let's let's
take another look at this these are the
kind of numbers you have seen these
before this is the result of kind of
decades of research into humans and
perception and response times basically
trying to get a gauge of like people
don't need things to be truly instant
for it to feel instant there can
actually be a fair amount of delay and
they still think it was actually instant
but there's all these sorts of things
that we're between our brain and the
computer there's kind of like some
wiggle room sometimes but there are
definite points at which you change your
decision you're like
nope I'm impatient now I'm not going to
wait for this you know I just happens so
what if we kind of take these ideas and
apply them to this model so instead of
thinking about kind of just what is slow
we think about what is the user feel and
that's how we even thinking about kind
of all performance so let's take a look
at what I user might feel so I'm going
to load up this is just kind of like a
typical journey I'm clicking through in
a search result loading up this is the
this year's i/o site it animates in I
click on the hamburger icon and that
kind of opens up I tap on that guy right
there loading animation that's cool yeah
nice scrolling good and tap on that
little icon and then it's loads in cool
all right so a bunch of stuff right but
this actually you know here we are this
entire user journey was comprised of
these more atomic interactions you know
like I was we were loading and then we
are like waiting and then there's an
animation and then tapping on the icon
and then loading waiting for the page
and then there's another animation like
there's these individual unique things
that kind of happen along this entire
journey and breaking apart into these
atomic components makes it a lot easier
to understand the whole thing so we
could think about these in kind of these
little sections if we kind of break them
apart just like four of them four
categories here as page load there's
idle we're like you know you're not
really doing anything just yet there's
responding to input what you know
tapping clicking something's happening
and then there's scrolling in animation
and for each of these things we as users
bring different expectations to them and
and certainly have different you know
the amount of time that we're willing to
put up with for each of these things is
different so um the way that we think
about this is we kind of embody in a
achren and we call it rail so you might
have heard this this is kind of the
of the performance model that I've been
talking about and this is a very fast
introduction to it so I apologize but
but it basically ends up if we take all
these numbers from from research and
apply them to these components we end up
with something like this now there's a
lot on the screen but the ones that I'll
really highlight at this point is load
where the goal is really to have it
ready to use in a thousand milliseconds
or a second it's its aggressive but it's
also doable overrun response the goal is
from any sort of tap and you click going
from the tap to the paint where you
actually see a difference having that in
under 100 milliseconds hitting that
means it is instantaneous to the user so
those are our primary goals and so I
want to look at how we can I kind of
apply these goals in the real world and
and evaluate the performance of things
using this as a framework all right so
we're going to look at a few sites and
the first one that we're going to look
at is reddit all right this is some cool
stuff so recently read it a redid their
mobile site and so it's really nice kind
of like mobile web app and I I'm inai
use reddit sometimes and I was like I
was on it and i was looking at this and
like the image hasn't loaded yet and I
mean none of the images have loaded yet
but i was looking at this for like a
long time and i was like what is going
on and so I like had to plug in my phone
and start remote debugging and see like
what is happening right now so it did
that and when I recorded it look like
this which is there's a lot going on but
like one thing that I'm going to point
out is the end up here this is 50
seconds this is almost a minute and this
is there the page load experience and I
was like wow and usually with it with a
lot with a page that takes a long time
to load it's because they're like have a
million you know files and network
activity but in this case they really
didn't have a lot of networking activity
they just had a lot of JavaScript to run
just a lot and I was like okay um you
know what is all this stuff
and so you know start digging start
looking so we're going to zoom in a
little bit and I found you know we can
kind of piece this together and and for
big acts and so basically we start off
react one and there's kind of the
booting up and initialization of some
things that we really get into like the
components and then when we do some
other stuff anyway so we're I'm not
going to get too deep into this but it
was really helpful to kind of break this
apart into like the primary phases here
but um I still had like a lot of
questions as to what what the work was
that was going on in here and one thing
that you can do I ready to not do this
but one trick this is kind of a pro tip
in your code you can just drop in
console time and time end and it'll spit
into the console but in addition to what
it adds to the console it'll add these
actual measurements into the timeline
and dev tools and so you'll be able to
see those kind of measurements added
into the flame chart so you can kind of
coordinate what is happening in the in
the JavaScript engine along with what
you've actually defined well this is
this thing so that helps helps a lot but
they didn't have that so we're looking
at all this activity and I'm like I I
don't I it's this site is actually the
app is made with react we're seeing a
lot of this mount component so it seems
like that's why I call it component
party a lot of stuff going on right um
and I'm just like I don't know but I
needed a way to pick it apart the size
of the total JavaScript bundle they
browserify it I send it down in one big
chunk it's a Meg 1.1 Meg's gzipped
witches and 3 3.3 Meg's not gzipped
that's like a lot you know and so I took
it to this tool this is a tool called
disk and you know I'll just bring it up
it's like it's really cool so basically
you can take a browserify bundle let's
see if I can zoom this guy take a
browserify bundle
give it to disk and it will kind of
visualize things so this is it takes up
space where there's file size kind of
like you know when you tryna find what's
consuming disk space on your hard drive
like the same kind of same kind of deal
so actually over here this this little
quadrant this is their app this is the
reddit the reddit mobile app and then
here's their node modules lot of stuff
Babel the Babel polyfills some Dom
serializer is green sock for animation
100 kilobytes and actually while they
tried to do some animation it was
happening in 40 seconds worth of
JavaScript and you never actually see
anything so that was one opportunity
here's lodash as a react down here and
actually there's another load ash inside
of here yeah so it's just like
interesting you know the fact that it's
so much javascript is not necessarily a
bad thing like you can still things can
be fast even with a megabyte of
javascript but it was helpful to
identify you know that some of these
things so this gave some insights but we
still needed to like pull it apart a
little bit more and so what I did is
took some of the react perf tools and
kind of injects it and the nice thing
that it does is instead of seeing Mount
component mount component and just
having no idea what it is it actually
tells you you know these are the actual
components and this is the mount time
for each and an individual one I like
yes awesome so here we actually see you
let you know like look at the top snoo
icon is our number one guy like by a lot
and you're like I icon and icon is like
the number one most expensive thing and
this like six seconds for an icon and
you look and you like what is this new
icon and it turns out it's this little
dude right
is smiling so smug you Leia six seconds
for me bro and okay it gets better um
all the mountain time you're like why do
why do we have a mountain time for this
so he's SVG which like you know is a
little bit more complex than like a ping
but like sounds cool he's SVG so that
when you mouse over him he can animate
and like smile and wink and do like I
like it's really kind of cute it's
awesome um but that animation like I
said is on mouseover and this is a
mobile site so turns out it doesn't
really happen ever at all and so the
most expensive thing is spent doing an
effect that is completely wasted so that
was interesting um yeah there's a lot of
like pretty interesting things that
happened digging into this and so it's
all actually documented in a big issue
thread on github and it was fantastic
because the developers from reddit were
involved and they've already started in
fruit like they fix this icon really
fast um they've they've improved a lot
of things already on and some of the
react team also was like engaging and
helping people understand what was going
on good stuff school all right let's
let's take kind of the same ideas but
like apply it to polymer we're gonna
start off with a google patents which
was recently redone with polymer and so
we're just gonna kind of like do you
know some demo nice stuff and we're just
going to load this up okay here's a new
book patents and I'm just going to type
for polymer seems like a good thing true
story my dad actually has a patent
relating to polymers which is just I
mean that's random but that's also cool
all right where to come back
all right open up devtools where are you
buddy come on come on yeah that's my guy
all right so we got dev tools and what I
want to capture they like the key
interaction anytime you do profiling
you're like identify an interaction that
really matters for me it's just clicking
on the search result and seeing the page
come up so I'm gonna capture that here
we go and yep I'm on timeline I'm just
going to hit record and we'll click on
the second guy to do spinner and there
we go e okay cool we're seeing than that
and there we go I'm just going to pop
this guy out to make them full screen
because we don't really need to look at
the page right now ok so the flame chart
uh this might be where you like hmm and
I'm not really sure where to go it next
um which is a reasonable response so but
let's well you know get uncomfortable
and try and like figure out what's going
on alright so there's two like we see
these two big stacks right and height
doesn't really matter so much height is
just the stack depth what really matters
it was width we see two and and the
reason why is because here we have the
cliq and then here we have the xhr
coming back but that's kind of
interesting right like like just
clicking on on that guy was about 600
milliseconds which seems like a like a
fairly long amount of time just for the
click handler the xhr is another one and
a half seconds so in total we're looking
at about three seconds so this is
certainly beyond our budget of of load
which is one second um but I mean this
is a web app i would even expect you
know a sub one second for this little
state change okay
so we want to kind of understand what
work is happening here so we can find
out why it's so silly so I just zoom in
a bit and we're just like reading the
call stacks to see what they tell us so
what I actually see here is like we have
pushed state coming in and then we have
a pop state event so looks like
basically unmik click we update the URL
with push data API and then as a result
pop state fires and then when pops 8
fires there's like a bunch of stuff that
happens it's just a bunch of stuff yep
yep is that it yeah yeah everything is
hooked on to pop state okay cool this
this kind of immediately stands out to
me write that these are style recog
they're happening via JavaScript and so
this is like like a reflow commonly
called the reflow any style recalculate
that's forced by javascript is is
usually not great I we could dig into
this now but we're going to get to this
bit a little bit later I want to come
over to the xhr okay a bunch of stuff it
looks like a lot but again like we want
to break this up into phases and
understand what is happening so I'm just
going to zoom in a bunch and start
reading it okay okay so we have result
response coming in and then load HTML so
basically you know the xhr it's being
handled here and then it looks this is
interesting so object at time probably
sit setting the innerhtml and then as a
result of that we are it looks like
we're clearing the DOM and so we're
moving a bunch of stuff from the DOM and
so that's that's this whole section in
fact one thing one nice thing that you
can know is the coloring of all these
little rectangles for all the JavaScript
stuff the colors are based on the file
so it's a unique color profile so it's
kind of nice because this stuff here
this like yellow is coming from the
actual search like the patent search app
this is polymer mini and then this is
polymer but it gives you a nice kind of
indication of where the code is okay so
we got all that stuff we're clearing the
dom and then this next section which
looks a little bit different we are
still in the result response load HTML a
national set but this time what do we
have there's some stuff running here
that we're not ready to talk about I
don't know add features yeah I was like
yeah I'm not sure but it's it seems to
be like initializing some new components
based on the fact that oh yeah like over
here we see we're stamping out a
template this is all happening as a
result of the inner HTML okay okay okay
okay this section over here and this is
what this is what this is all about it's
just the zooming and they're watching
and the because you're reading the
narrative it's like a bedtime story only
it's just like really deep inside a
JavaScript engine just like your best
friends and you just give them names and
put funny hats on them all right this
time we're adding nodes adding nodes
when we're setting new Chanel seems
really good and we get through all that
we distribute some content um to our
shadow Dom oh yeah render okay I think
we're done we're done rendering yep we
render a bunch of stuff that makes sense
okay cool so that is basically the story
of these one thirteen hundred
milliseconds all right cool but there's
something that was like uh a bunch of
this work had in common right something
I feel like that the kind of stood out
anything anyone yes it was the no just
take credit it was the the inner HTML
okay so that's like kind of interesting
right like all this work is happening
because of the scenery shamone so like
you get a little curious and you're like
well what is this and so you want to
like click through and so I'm just going
to click in to search up and then you're
like oh obviously know okay let's click
the button in the bottom left and there
we go cool um yeah all right I will zoom
in a bit here yeah okay cool here's our
result response and then here's load
HTML nice and then check this out
polymer Dom this we're just doing or
wrapping around our guy with the polymer
dumb stuff down in HTML so we're using
polymers innerhtml kind of rapper to set
basically the payload coming in from the
xhr so the xhr is returning a bunch of
jump a bunch of HTML and we're just
enriched emailing it in which like is
certainly one way to do it um but it's
not dumping an entire like page worth of
HTML add a web app that's initialized
and has bindings everywhere its kind of
self-destructive which is basically why
we have to destruct like the entire
world and then reconstruct it in order
to show the page so basically in HTML in
like we're essentially removing all the
content and then like pulling it all
apart removing it gracefully and then
dropping in new stuff and initializing
all that and doing that every single
time not the best idea and so a better
approach is just like returning Jason in
the in the response and just data
binding like normal so there was some
opportunities certainly here to adjust
that if this was done not through inner
HTML but through proper data binding we
certainly wouldn't be doing all this
work and I imagine that most of our
rendering work also we would not be
doing because the components would
already be built and so I imagine that
we would essentially end up with about
ten percent of this work like to the
left with just you know that small
change returning something different
okay one more thing I want to show here
which is like you know there's a lot of
information in here and sometimes it's a
little hard to pull it apart right like
we're just going millisecond by
millisecond so this is fairly new we can
also view this data similar to how you
might have viewed things in the CPU
profile over here but it's down here in
aggregated details and so what we
basically have let's see yeah cool is um
by function so all about all of our
functions sorted by self cost the nice
thing is we also have things like
recalculating style garbage collection
layout things like that all kind of
merged in so you get the full picture of
all the work that's happening sorted by
where the time is being spent so this is
really kind of a nice you can also group
it by URL so here we can like see the
distribution between polymer mini
polymer and and their code but another
thing that I really like and I'm just
going to reload the page to get this
capture here do you done yep is in
addition to grouping all the work by URL
perhaps better unlike large sites
publisher sites where you have like
third party content other scripts coming
in is understanding like where all the
scripts are coming from and so grouping
all the work by domain and subdomain so
here we basically have like we see the
work coming from patents Google here is
like API is google this is actually part
of google plus down here is Google
Analytics here's some of the Google+
integration so you get a nice view of
like all the third party content how
much cost that is adding to the page the
other thing you notice like a bunch of
Chrome extensions like see the actual
impact of the chrome extensions that
you're running and what they're actually
doing to the page so yeah this is a kind
of a pretty enjoyable way to understand
who is spending time on page okay that
seems good for the patent site now we
should check out one more and do want to
point out actually the patent site we
just just recently found this this inner
HTML kind of faux pas and we'll be
working with them to fix it so but it
had yeah there's areas to improve always
the polymer summer summit site is a very
nice site but it is my responsibility to
also find areas where it can improve so
we're gonna do that alright cool good
luck in sight we could watch this and
see if we could get like the drew drew
drew drew drew drew have a dope alright
but we won't scheduled speakers I like
this okay so what I want to dick she do
I'm a profile just clicking just
navigating across these guys because
like you know it feels pretty good as
far as a response time is concerned and
this one I like get a better view and so
yeah alright that check that for the
moment see what happens all right
do-do-do-do-do-do yeah alright so before
I kind of skipped like what the very top
of top of everything was showing us so
quickly the green is frames per second
so when it's when it's tall that's great
elements short that's not great and then
here is the main thread activity just
kind of like a visualization of what's
happening beneath when it's tall that's
bad and what's short that's good and
then on the top is just kind of like a
responsiveness indicators wear red is
bad and red is bad so that's easy enough
but underneath you see these new guys
and I really like this because we
basically took screen shots during that
entire recording a screen shot every
single time we put up frames and that
means that we can actually just kind of
like playback the activity as
and so just like understand kind of what
happened in this animation which I
really really like yeah so this is cool
so nice thing here is like you can walk
through it this way or you can even like
click in to a specific frame let's say
like in here and just like use your
arrow keys and just see the specific
things then the bottom and then be like
oh that one's very interesting and try
and find out what exactly happened in
that specific frame kind of coordinate
it with what was on screen there's cool
stuff all right the moment going to turn
that back off we're going to look at
what the profile actually showed us we
got zoo mountain all right so we got
these three big humps which makes sense
because those were mine navigations all
right there's a bunch of stuff oops oops
I look down here yeah it's like my time
it's actually split between script and
and rendering which is weird so if you
want to move this up and down you grab
it and drag it or pro tip shift and then
drag will scroll it I actually only
learn this this one like like three
weeks ago and I was like seriously never
told me this
ah that's really useful oh my god okay
we're gonna make this better so that I
don't okay all right um so yeah these
call stacks are very tall like I said
tall is not necessarily a problem we
just read things function call we going
on yep yeah so here is our rendering
costs we're doing a recalc so this is a
forestry calc um and it's being you
wanted to like figure out why you know
why is it happening it's being called by
new underlying animation for keyframe FX
which you like I don't know I have no
idea so this is deep in that in the guts
of of polymer and turns out instance
pointing to this line right here turns
out that we're actually just calling the
animate method on a function and it's
actually currently forcing a recalc
which is unexpected and it's actually we
think it's a chrome bug so we'll
probably just be fixing that in chrome
so that the the developer the site
doesn't have to worry about it I'll be
good let's go over here to this this
handsome stack where are you buddy hey
hey what am i doing oh yeah scrolled up
okay cool cool because i was looking at
this one before and it's a little
different this is when we clicked back
to the the homepage and we're just going
to scroll down and ok again a forced
layout and inspire and if i look at the
the little pie chart for this guy yeah
like the going back to the homepage
there was like 10 milliseconds worth of
JavaScript but pretty much all of our
time was spent in this force recalc
which you really don't want so why did
this one happen a little different of a
reason so polymer select change what are
you we click in and
yes okay see this right here so here we
basically asked for the page X offset
asking for this is bait the reasons why
you get forced layout is you are usually
requesting dimensions like you want to
know the metrics of the width of this
the height of this and in this case
asking for the page the pages dimensions
requires a layout of the things inside
the page for a big ugly explanation that
I don't love but the short version is
scroll bars it's rough anyways so the
key is like you certainly don't we don't
want to be spending all that time here
figuring out what these numbers are so
the fix is basically if we need those
numbers and we need it you know
somewhere around this time what you want
to do is request it at the beginning of
all this work basically you want to
request it before you change anything
about the Dom because that makes sure
that we already know the metrics from
the last time we like painted everything
and figured everything out so we could
just reuse those numbers instead of
recomputing the world to give you the
new ones so if I would just just if we
just ask for the paychecks offset like
up in this first part would be good all
right all right I think I think that's
it for a polymer project the summit site
it is actually a very well-put-together
site so not much to complain about okay
so this stuff is like pretty fun for you
and you want some more like I showed a
number of things from the devtools some
of the new things that are our have
landed in canary I went through some of
these but not some of the later ones so
there's more stuff coming soon so keep
your eyes out for that there's a kind of
a journey of going through an audit of
in like detail of what happened in this
100 milliseconds we've done this a
number of times with a number of
different sites and you're very welcome
to just like learn learn from them click
through them there's a lot of really
good stuff in here especially some of
the more recent ones like
ESPN and the verge it's good stuff but
even more useful than you know then
reading about some of these is going and
doing it on your own this is actually a
picture of the the Wikipedia engineering
team and what they did is they took the
the timeline they just printed it out on
paper which is dope uh they so cool like
paper yeah um I just like markers and
sticky notes and just like being like
this is this and this isn't what is this
and you know just like trying to figure
that out um and it was like fantastic
because not only was it like a good
exercise to go through but like just
recently they're like this is the time
to first paint for Wikipedia and they
made it it's now twenty percent faster
than it was um and this is as a direct
result of the performance auditing that
they were doing beforehand so Wikipedia
is faster now so that's really good but
anyways I encourage you all to kind of
like take that same initiative and and
take a same kind of look at the work
that you're doing and figure out you
know how you can match it up against
user expectations and dig into it and
make it even faster do some good stuff
anyways thank you guys very much
