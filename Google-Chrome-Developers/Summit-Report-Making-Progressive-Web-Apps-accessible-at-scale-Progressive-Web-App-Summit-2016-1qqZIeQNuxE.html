to you live from Amsterdam and I have
with me Bob dad aka the doddle max as I
call him you can call him Rob Dodson
whatever you like Rob you did a talk
today on accessibility which i SAT with
you while SAT there watching and I was
sort of thinking you know be great to
kind of summarize for people who are
watching this just kind of the one thing
or the one group of things you'd have
them do if they're completely new to
accessibility yeah so I think if you're
if you're totally new to accessibility
the one thing that for me was was really
useful it felt like kind of a transition
point for me was actually sitting down
and learning to use a screen reader so
if you're on a Mac voiceover is just
there it's free if you're on Windows you
can use NVDA it's also free you just
download it's open source and the reason
why is because I feel like it's one
thing to to be adding you know
attributes and semantic elements and
sort of thinking maybe you're doing the
right thing it's another thing entirely
to actually fire up that screen reader
and then navigate the page and verify
like cool i'm doing i'm using the tool
and i can see that it's working properly
with my code so that is that is a huge
thing so even then so let's say you do
that and you're like wow I've got
accessibility issues like do we have any
kind of cheat sheet or wave for somebody
to kind of go hey you know what what
things are expected from me if I'm
making a checkbox or I'm making my own
magical whatever thing yeah so for that
we have the web content accessibility
guidelines or what KAG which is I know
it's very very fancy sounding yeah and
uh the which is this it's amazingly huge
document i should say it's an amazing
and huge document that covers really
like what it is for something to be
accessible and it's built almost in like
a like a checklist fashion but it's very
very very detailed covers a lot of
things and so what's what's useful is
there's a group called webbing which has
taken that and just stilled it down to a
much sort of easier to follow checklist
specifically for web developers the nice
thing about learning this is that a lot
of governments actually mandate what KAG
compliance for for applications and
things like that so this is like the
definitive source like if you want to
know
what a check box should do this is the
thing i'll tell you the keyboard support
that it should have it also tell you all
the Arias stuff that it needs to have so
that's definitely the resource to go to
the web aim checklist and when you need
to you can drop into the WIC AG to get
those super super meaty details and then
I guess last but not least there's
obviously there's lots of tools there's
lots of resources there's lots of things
that you could read besides that
checklist that could actually help you
out on a day to day with your workflow
kind of where would you point people
towards if they completely need to this
where would you actually send them to
actually learn more yeah so conveniently
enough Alice vauxhall yes my teammate a
fellow engineer on Chrome and I have
just finished a Udacity course it is a
completely free course a multi-week
course to teach you so the fundamentals
of web accessibility so you can go there
you can you can do that course you can
if you know nothing about accessibility
you're going to finish that you're going
to be you know a much more along your
path to being an accessibility wizard or
badass or whatever so definitely go
check that out and then the other thing
too is is we're gonna actually start
putting more accessibility content on
developers.google.com / web so that's a
that's a plan for us to start writing
more about it and making sure that that
you know when we're talking about
progressive web apps we're talking about
performance we're also talking about
accessibility making sure that that is a
part of everybody's process brilliant
well that's all we got time for we're
gonna took some links down into the
description below and we shall include I
guess the Udacity course and all the
other things we've talked about here
thank you so much for taking a bit of
time out and I've been poor catch you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
