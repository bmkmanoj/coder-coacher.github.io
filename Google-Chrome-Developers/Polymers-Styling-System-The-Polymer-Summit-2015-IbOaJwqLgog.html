everybody else so I think it's only fair
that we find out some things about Rob
when he was a baby he actually cameo it
as baby number two in an episode of The
Fresh Prince of bel-air
one of his cousins is world-renowned
Award winner Matthew McConaughey the
actor and in high school he was on a
wrestling team and his team name was the
Velveteen Rabbit and one of those is
actually true so good luck finding out
which one hi everyone I'm Monica I'm not
Waldorf on Twitter and github and all
sorts of internet places and I make
polymer elements and one of the the few
people who makes elements for for
polymer and before I used to work on
polymer I used to work on Chrome so I
wrote a lot of UI in C++ and there's
nothing that a grumpy compiler won't
make you appreciate more than CSS
because in CSS we figured out how to
separate what a thing does from how a
thing looks like and this is really
great because you can have your markup
and you can have your HTML and figure
out what a thing does and then spend all
your the time that you want on CSS and
make it a pretty my favorite thing about
CSS is that it's super open source and
super available so you get to copy/paste
a lot of CSS because I still don't know
how to vertically align things but
thankfully somebody out there has
figured it out I don't want to what ends
up happening whenever you write apps is
that you start with let's say an HTML
button national buttons are ugly as sin
and they've looked the same for last 20
years you want to make them all shiny
and pretty you're gonna go and find a
library it could be bootstrap it could
be material design you're gonna find
something that makes your button pretty
and then the only way we know how to use
CSS libraries is that in order for us to
make this button pretty we put a we swap
a class on it in this case let's say
it's fancy so we're super happy now
our app looks great everything's shiny
it's great but our app keeps growing and
later on we're gonna have a different
button and it's super good we've figured
this one out we're gonna find the
library it's gonna make really
pretty but unfortunately it's a library
that we're using also wants us to use a
fantasy class on this button and now we
have a little bit of a problem because
we have two buttons that are supposed to
look different but are actually using
the same class name so you have no idea
what they act
going to look like this is pretty tragic
and the root problem is that CSS really
has no opinion about scoping
everything's global everything's
everywhere classes is everybody can have
a class and the only opinion it sort of
has that you should name things really
well and names aren't really computery
as like computer science people there's
nothing really like we have to trust
these library owners to name their
things really well so that we can use
them that's kind of sketchy so
thankfully the shadow Dom came around
and the shadow Dom was really great
because what it does is it builds and
lets us actually have encapsulation for
styles and style encapsulation is super
good because now your Styles don't leak
so the way I like to think about the
shadow Dom is that it's actually a tiny
little castle so you take the Dom you've
got this giant pile of markup and in one
particular place you carve a little hole
into that DOM and you put your markup
and you put your Styles and you close it
down with with with walls around it so
now I've got a castle and that castle is
basically your web component everything
that it does and all its style is just
live inside and they don't leak out and
nothing gets in and this is super great
so if you go back to my terrible example
where we're trying to make this button
fancy we can actually make this button
into a web component and things get much
better so this is how you would define a
web component in polymer you may have
seen this and then somewhere in there it
has a fancy class and it has a whole
bunch of CSS but that fancy CSS just
lives inside of this button it lives
inside of this castle it doesn't go
outside because you can see like I could
style all the a links in this element
and imagine this actually styled all the
a links in your application though you
bananas right so this is really great it
just stays inside this in this
particular element so in our original
button instead of using these CSS
libraries which are great these
libraries should in fact use web
components and then you can just drop
this magical web component is gonna be a
super nice button and it's super fancy
button and everything is great because
the promise of web components is that
you can start with you can you guys just
drop in any elements and they're just
going to work magically and you're not
gonna have to do any effort about it
look how simple that mark that markup is
is just about them and it does a whole
bunch of things it looks really great
and this is actually not very new so
the platform has been using web
components behind your back for a very
long time we just haven't been able to
you do the same as developers which i
think is cheating if you'll get input
type equals date which is my favorite
example for this input type equals date
is an input selector that has a giant
date picker associated with it and you
can do all sorts of things to style the
input itself you can change its color
you can change its font it's gonna turn
red and giant but there's really nothing
that you can do to actually style that
drop-down there's there's a couple like
sketchy WebKit pseudo selectors that
started with like WebKit and weird
Collins which kind of make you lately
they have just use like the font size
but not the entire thing itself and the
reason is if you actually look at the
markdown oh the markup I keep seeing
markdown his own markdown if you
actually look at the HTML for input type
equals date you don't see anything about
a picker you don't see anything about a
drop down you just see him for type
equals date and that's because that
entire square is in the shadow Dom it
actually lives inside the inputs Castle
and that's why you can't get to it so
this is kind of glorious because on one
hand you've never had to worry about
creating an idea called picker or using
a classical date picker and it's
magically having the side effect of
making your drop-down less hideous on
the other hand your drop-down is always
really hideous and you can't really fix
it and it doesn't match any of the other
styles in your application so how do we
do this
we're polymer we've given you web
components surely we can do this right
how do we get inside the castle how do
you style these shadow Dom components
and in polymer 0.5 we thought that the
answer that this was dragons so we gave
every developer a dragon we're like
carry on have fun and if we've ever
watched Game of Thrones once you get a
dragon it grows really big doesn't speak
English and eats all of your goats so
that's kind of what happened and these
dragons were shadowing deep and the
problem with shadow and deep is that
they kind of break this promise that I
told you that I'm gonna give you a web
component and you don't have to care
about what it does you just like put in
your application and run and
everything's great because if you
actually try to use shadow deep let's
say that we're changing the background
of this button what you end up doing is
opening the web tools where the
developer tools start inspecting
figure out which CSS classes the one is
pissing you off you find it you selected
with some deep sin some shadow it was
possibly both and then you get to change
the background and this is terrible like
you should you shouldn't need to do this
we can do better
sadface um so so how do I get inside the
castle how do we actually style these
things
guys dragons aren't actually real you
should have yelled in me the first time
I said dragons there are not things that
we can use in real life if you know what
are things that get to Britain to
castles bridges or in Amsterdam you've
seen a lot of bridges that's their only
purpose to get you from like point A to
point B preferably over water and how do
we style things in HTML we've been
styling that for decades it's with CSS
the way you make things pretty with HTML
is with CSS so surely we should be able
to use CSS for web components as well
and McKinnon and these are custom
properties and they're part of the spec
and polymer has been using them and this
has always been styling polymer 1.0
elements so if we look at our element
from before and it has a style in there
let's say that this is the class that's
giving the background of the button what
if inside instead of me hard coding the
color of the button what if I give it a
variable like a custom property I'll
call it fancy button background fancy
buttons the element that I'm styling
this I was pretty legit I can even give
it a default value so if you the user of
this element don't provide me with a
color I'll just use red and then I can
do this anywhere in this cup of my
button because maybe my question is
actually really complicated has a lot of
like nested divs and very far down is
the class that's actually giving the
background of the button so I can do
that I can put any soldier that I want
and create this custom property and then
when you the user of the fancy button
get to style this button all you have to
do is use the name of the property and
give it a value cornflower blue that's
the legal CSS color name great and now
I've made all the fancy buttons blue but
uh but I also can make a particular
button a particular submit button this
one's going to be cornflower blue all
the other ones are gonna be red and this
might look a little bit scary but it's
actually exactly how we've been doing
normal CSS
see if I take away the gibberish at the
beginning it's just background
cornflower blue this
the thing we know the gibberish at the
beginning is actually because you have
to somehow tell the CSS parser did you
know what you're doing and you're not
just typing things I don't have any
meeting and that's what the two dashes
are the dashes are like listen I promise
you this thing may exist you go look for
it is not just junk and it's it's really
powerful so we've created the CSS
property and you might be tempted to
think that you know oh good sass and
lots have had variables forever good for
you but it's not like a sass and less
variable because in sass and less Styles
and variables are still global like I
can define background to be blue but
everything that uses background is gonna
have blue so we're not actually scoped
it at all but in this case it's this
particular submit button this particular
Castle that's going to have the
background of blue all the other ones
are not so this is really great the
other little gimmick here is that we
have this like weird-looking style tag
and this is because CSS properties are
part of the spec there are things that
we're all getting around you but they
haven't actually been implemented in all
the browsers so Firefox nightly I
believe has it and if you look in the
audience Levi works on on the chrome
blink team and he's right now actually
implementing CSS properties in chrome
but they're not there yet so so polymer
has to polyfill it for a while and
that's how we polyfill it the super
awesome part that now we have these CSS
properties available we get to do themes
and they're so easy and so amazing so
imagine that I create a file let's call
it light material design theme and I
define a whole bunch of CSS properties
and I give them really nice names like
primary color primary background color
disabled color and I give them values
now when I start building my application
I can just use these CSS property names
inside of colors so instead of saying
color : gray I can use call it very dark
primary color and then that's that's
what your element would look like and
then in your demo or in your main page
you can just decide which team you're
going to use maybe you want the light
theme maybe you want the dark theme and
all of them are just gonna work by magic
because once you import the right theme
these values are gonna get substituted
correctly so that's pretty awesome the
thing however is that there's a lot of
CSS and you're not gonna expose a
property for everything out there
because that's really annoying so in our
style
from before we had a things are
overlapping there that's great so he had
a fancy button and it had a background
and that was super good but then you as
a user you're like great backgrounds
amazing but you know what else I need I
need padding and I'm like yeah here you
go
you have padding and you're like great I
have padding what do you know what I
need I need to pass City and if you
think this isn't a real scenario I've
been working on elements for like six
months and this is exactly what you guys
do you send me like issues is that some
property isn't there and could I
possibly add it so we have an answer for
that too because if you can define one
CSS property well you can define a bag
of properties and this is what we call a
mixin and this has also been inspected
by table Atkins he recently proposed it
so we have super hopes it's gonna make
it into the spec as well but here
basically were saying listen I've given
you the background property which I'm
pretty sure 90% of the time that's the
one that you want to use but in case
there's anything that I missed
here's a fancy Watson mixin so you can
define a whole bag of properties and
we're just gonna teleport them and apply
them in here it's gonna be great
so if you go back to my button where it
had it was a nice calming cornflower
blue background
I can now define also defined a mixin
and say okay it's gonna also have a
padding of 30 and it's great and this
might look a little bit scary because
you're like oh no selector instead of
selector what's going on
but it's actually a lot like a regular
CSS property it has a name it's followed
by a colon it has a value and then it
has a semicolon and that value is
between squiggles because you can put a
whole bunch of things in there so we
want to keep track of them at the same
time we're sort of scoping them together
and it works in the same way so this
mixin only applies to the submit button
only applies to this particular castle
and it stays there and just gets
inherited downwards like a normal CSS
property would so styling in polymer 1.0
is way more powerful because we get to
use things that we've been using for
ever we've always styled HTML with CSS
so there's no reason why we shouldn't be
styling web components with CSS and now
that we have custom properties that's
exactly what we're gonna do so stop
using shadow and deep also they're
getting deprecated and we're gonna start
ripping them out of all the code so if
you're using them very sorry about to
get broken soon and get on the custom
properties boat because it's great thank
you
