it takes to build a super fast mobile
web experience and to do that well it's
gonna require us to plan for our
performance here's my pitch to you
you've all been in that meeting room
when your manager or boss has asked you
well does this site work on mobile and
you think well sure it's worked on a
small screen size on my desktop and I
wrote some CSS so things scale so
definitely this works on mobile but that
mentality has a flaw and the flaw is the
mobile web is no longer just this subset
of the web that you think about at the
end of your development the mobile web
is just simply the web and we see this
through the numbers mobile traffic is
actually outpaced desktop traffic now
since 2014 and it's only continued to
grow since then so whether or not you
like it the users that are visiting your
web app or website or on a mobile phone
they are not on a desktop computer they
are not on the laptop that you're
developing on in your office but you as
a developer you're like okay that's fine
Sam because I have a mobile phone in my
pocket yeah just right here well I'm
just gonna test my website on this and
it's gonna be great and I will have
accomplished everything that you told me
to do but that's not completely complete
that's not the right approach because
that phone that you have in your pocket
is a $600 phone it's the brand-new phone
because you're a developer and you want
the best thing so you have the best
thing but the phone that your users have
well they look like this as Alex touched
on these are the low end phones these
are the phones that you get for free
when you sign up for a cellular plan
these are the free phones these phones
have a gigabyte of RAM these phones have
a single
or and we see the numbers that back this
up on the average Android device that
checks in they have on average a
gigabyte or less of RAM so not great and
this has some real performance
implications on mobile websites believe
it or not the average load time for
mobile sites is 19 seconds so from going
to the URL in your browser to that
actually loading in your phone and being
interactive that's 19 seconds 19 seconds
that your users have to wait now you've
seen this graphic before I'm sure but
it's really important to think about
because the web that we're shipping
today has a 19 second average load time
and the users expect when you just ask
them casually they expect a page to load
in two seconds and most users if that
site takes longer than three seconds
they'll just leave the page so that web
app that you're delivering right now if
it takes longer than three seconds
you're just throwing away half your
traffic okay we have 19 second load
times we are shipping experiences that
don't match what users want so how do we
align the web that we're building today
with what users want to do that I think
it's important that we we take a look at
what it takes to load a web page from
when you issue the request to win that
page loads in your browser and when you
can interact with it what exactly
happens between when you hit go and it
shows up so I've taken the network stack
and everything that happens in between
and simplified it down because it's a
lot to talk about in two three phases
and the first phase here is requesting
the page and the server getting that
page and then shipping back an HTML
document to you as I've so beautifully
illustrated here for you all this is
what it looks like you go to the web
site on your phone it hits the server
the server then generates a document and
has to do some processing work to figure
out what exactly we're gonna send to you
and then it ships that document back to
the browser and don't forget that
request has to go across cellular towers
and then find its way through the
internet to the compute
that's responding and then when it gets
it it has to send it back instead
round-trip cost on mobile phones it's
real all right so we have the document
the server has responded so the browser
has to do some work now we have to parse
the HTML and we have to figure out what
exactly is required on this page for us
to actually show it so we have to find
these critical assets and once we found
these critical assets the browser says
okay I need this javascript file
I need this stylesheet I need these two
images and when I have that I'll be able
to draw something that you actually care
about but we have to issue requests for
those and those requests go over the
over the wire through the cellular
towers onto the server the server
figures out what exactly we're sending
to you server then responds back and all
this takes some time so all right we
have our high priority resources we've
made that initial connection to get the
document and here we are in my favorite
phase the parson execute phase we have
the assets the browser isn't showing you
anything yet because it actually has to
compute what all of these individual
pieces look like when they're combined
together so we have our HTML our
javascript our CSS the JavaScript parses
and compiles so it can actually be
evaluated by v8 in chrome it runs some
JavaScript maybe it adds sabda onto the
page the browser then tries to render
takes your styles it calculates where
all the positions of all your elements
it lays them out and then it composites
any layers and then you end up with a
beautiful page but this is just the
loading phase this isn't interactive yet
this is just getting something on the
screen
all right given all that I think it's
important that we take a look at this
network phase if we're gonna optimize
one layer to start the network seems
like a good opportunity because we're
issuing a request to the server that had
a server has to respond then we issue
more requests and there's the real cost
here so what I did was I took the
polymer shop site like you've seen today
and I cloned this down locally and I
started making
changes to it I started out with a
pretty simple baseline
I didn't bundle any of my assets so I've
individual assets for everything not one
big blob I then set up an HTTP to server
and I simulated a 3G network and by
simulate I mean I actually had a 3G
network that I tested this on so we got
some real-world sort of metrics so let's
take a look in dev tools how we can get
a feel for what this is like all right
so here's shop on the left and uh here's
our recording that I've done before and
save this off so you'll notice I have
this pane up here which you might not be
familiar with and this is the network
view network news usually hidden away
until you check this box and then you
see this beautiful waterfall of all the
things that are getting downloaded and
you might be saying what is this what is
this grey line I've never seen that
before
well of course you've never seen it
before because the patch landed
yesterday and I have it right here so
what this means is this grey part is
we're just waiting for content we
haven't gotten anything the request went
out but we haven't taken any action yet
so you can see that in this case it
takes fifteen hundred milliseconds until
we actually get a response from the
server and then we're downloading the
content okay and then it looks like we
issue a request for this other file this
shop app which is for this site it's
sort of their app wrapper which then has
a bunch of dependencies which all need
to download which then have a bunch of
dependencies which all need to download
which then have a bunch of okay so Sonia
okay and so all of this results in a
paint that takes around 5500 or
milliseconds
okay so five seconds five point five
seconds for this on each or on a 3G
network it's not terrible it's nowhere
near that nineteen second average so
we're starting off from somewhere that's
not horrible however as a developer we
can see like clearly there's some room
here for improvements yeah so again I'm
just holding down shift here in the
timeline as I drag I can actually
measure how long so right so a fifty
five hundred milliseconds roughly
between when we got our first flight
from our server to when we rendered a
screen now shop paint something pretty
quick we have this frame up here it's a
shop but really that's not useful to the
user until we actually have content so
this is the first content full frame or
the first meaningful paint and this is
what I like to measure too so we see we
get these network resources the browser
then executes some JavaScript here just
for a tiny bit and then we decide to
paint all right so HTTP to know bundling
3G fifty five hundred milliseconds until
first payment okay let's look at some
techniques that we can apply here to
drive that number down now I don't know
if you've heard of this really cool
feature that's in Chrome called link rel
preload but what this does is it allows
you as a developer to basically say I
know exactly the things that my page is
going to need before it's displayed and
loaded and so what I'm gonna do is tell
the browser what those are and the
browser's are going to see this and say
ok I'm going to download these I know
you haven't requested them yet but like
I know something as a developer you're
like something is going to request these
so to start so the browser will download
these they will sit there and so when
your brows are finally issues a request
for them it's like oh hey I already have
this so you don't have to hit the server
again so I took the site working off of
our base with no bundling going on and I
looked at all the assets that were
required before we actually issued a
paint and so I did link rel preload put
it all in the head tag and let's see
what effective this is
all right
oh so this looks quite different it's
now very flat we no longer have this
sort of stepping effect of dependent
resources on dependent resources that
eventually resolved into a painted page
instead we just have a flat line of
things it's like a network just just
grab all these thank you and then when
we have them we end up with the pain so
from our first bite tear to when our
first content full-frame was we're down
to 30 300 milliseconds so we've cut out
2 seconds roughly just by avoiding that
network work of having to download
discover download discover download
discover and flattening it that out now
you might be thinking okay but like why
would I ever have a site that was daisy
chained like that and have all these
dependent resources and this is totally
contrived fair point but on your site I
guarantee that you're downloading fonts
I guarantee that you're downloading Java
Script if you're taking advantage of
some of the new modules splitting
features of build tools you probably
have lazily loaded JavaScript files and
those are all late discovery documents
so what you can do is you can use link
rel preload to sort of say hey start
downloading these cuz I'm going to need
them which can be a really real win and
in this case a massive win all right
we're down to three point three
milliseconds on a on a mobile network
which is good we're getting closer to
that two-second time that people want
but we quite we aren't quite there and
we still like if we look here we have
this cost that's kind of crazy like we
have this initial connection cost which
is five seconds which is insane but then
once we finally get a bite we're
spending you know essentially 1.6
seconds just downloading this document
and we're not taking advantage of the
network during this time we're saying
give me this HTML document please give
it to me thank you I'm receiving it and
then once I have it I download more
stuff it seems like a wasted opportunity
like it'd be nice if we could jam some
Weston here as well turns out there is a
solution for this as solution is called
h2 server push how does this work what
is this well it's the basic idea that
your page when requested from from your
browser it hits the server it opens this
connection the server as like while it's
responding with HTML the server says I
know you're gonna need these assets so
I'm gonna go ahead and push them to you
you didn't ask for them the browser has
no idea that they're coming but I as the
server know the world so here to take
them and when you finally need them on
the client-side well they're already
there this compared to the previous
approach that we were doing which was
two round-trips which was get the
document scan the document request all
of the critical assets and then we can
paint so in this case the server is
pushing the assets to us it changes
who's responsible for what now
you're probably like I read a blog post
about h2 push and that blog post told me
lots of things that were not so great
about HT to push and I probably read
that same blog post so let's talk about
them cuz it's important to h2 server
push it's not cache aware what does this
mean well this means that the server
doesn't have an idea about the state of
your client so if you've visited the
page before and you have these assets
cached the server it can just say hey
I'm gonna push mange is again because I
don't know if you have it and by pushing
it the clients unable to cancel that
right now and so it causes this network
contention and can cause a real cost to
your users because you can basically
push push everything that you want and
the browser's just going to take it so
not great and can actually slow down
your page quite a bit the second is that
H to push doesn't have resource
prioritization all right what does this
mean well it means that the browser
natively is pretty smart about what
things that requests because it's able
to determine that like this is critical
this is not critical I can defer this
work and so it tries to optimize for its
network activity
each to server push is like a bully it
just pushes it to you you know it's like
here just take all of it and the browser
like okay I'll take it so it's not so
great but there's a solution for this
which is kind of the first P and purple
it all revolves around this one idea
it's that h2 server push plus a
serviceworker is like this nirvana it's
a magical thing because it avoids the
big downfall in my opinion of h2 server
push so let's let's step through this so
we can understand it on our first load
the browser requests to our server the
server then pushes the critical assets
and at the same time delivers our
document our document is then scanned by
the browser the browser says okay I need
these files go out and make the requests
but oh you already push them to me so I
don't have to hit the network great now
on your next load you have installed
your serviceworker
as represented by this beautiful green
square with the letters SW the page you
go to your page but it doesn't even hit
the server it hits your serviceworker
the serviceworker intercepts this
request and it says hey i have index
that HTML so here you are and oh you
want these assets to well I have them
cached as well and what this is voids is
you are not even opening a connection to
your server so because you have not
opened a connection to your server the
server can't push you things that you
don't need so by combining h2 server
push + serviceworker
you can get all of the benefits of that
first load with h2 server push and avoid
the majority of the downfalls of getting
pushed assets that you already have
cached so this is really good so let's
take a look at what shop looks like if
we actually used h2 push and this is the
default thing that the shop site
actually uses which is really awesome so
here we are we have the site this
timeline looks really different
really really different so it looks like
we're still paying that really high cost
here to get our initial page and we're
still spending you know 800 milliseconds
or more inside of that initial request
and then we see this very interesting
sort of representation of what's going
on and what you're seeing here is
actually the files being pushed to you
from the server now these in reality are
probably being pushed out here but right
now it's shown just right here which is
fine so we look we see we get all these
assets that are sort of sticking around
they're all marked as lowest priority
all right then we scroll down and here's
our that wrapper element that root
element that shop app HTML we see the
moment that this is finished right here
being downloaded we then fire off all
these requests but you'll notice that
these requests are really fast
63 milliseconds 78 milliseconds 62
milliseconds how are we doing that well
it just so happens that these are those
assets right here and when we request
them the network says hey do I have this
go into the network stack of Chrome
Network stack of Chrome says why yes you
do here they are in my cache please take
them which ends up making for a super
super fast experience and we can see
from from first bite here so when our
page actually renders we are under two
seconds which is amazing so we went from
5.5 seconds to 1.7 seconds on a 3G
network for our initial load with no
serviceworker installed so that's pretty
impressive all right what did we learn
Network takeaways link rail preload what
is this good for and when should you use
it well it's good for moving the start
of downloads earlier during that page
parse so the browser parser can't
instantiate those requests before the
browser knows that it really needs it as
a dependency H to push H to push when
you boil it down it's good for cutting
out one full
round trip to your server so the most
optimal delivery of h2 pushes you're
going to save at max one full round-trip
and that's important because when you're
measuring your site and figuring out
where to optimize you want to optimize
you know your biggest cost and so if
your latency that exists for a
round-trip is your biggest cost
well congratulations because you are in
a minority for because that is amazing
and each to push is probably your
solution
all right we've talked about the network
cool we know how to get our assets to
our browser quickly and how to get that
first paint the first meaningful paint
pretty quick but paint and that first
frame is only part of the story the real
interesting bit in my opinion is getting
to interactive and the costs for modern
websites to get to interactive well it's
our friend JavaScript just sitting there
okay you need to execute me and parse me
and on our phones that tends to be kind
of slow to understand that just how slow
this is well we need to look at what
JavaScript deliveries have been like and
these are gzip size in November 2010 we
were shipping on average 100 kilobytes
of JavaScript pretty good today we're
shipping four times up on average four
hundred eight kilobytes of JavaScript on
every page load okay so what well
there's a cost there there's a cost to
shipping this parsed code if we look at
some older devices like an iPhone 4
Nexus One our parse time for 300
kilobytes of JavaScript is anywhere from
300 milliseconds to 500 milliseconds
half a second remember users want that
page to load in two seconds but you're
looking at this as Sam these are ancient
phones this is a terrible graph not
applicable to me well remember the
phones that your users are actually on
are those older devices which are very
very similar to these phones listed here
but it's fine I understand your concerns
because I have a chart for new
phones alright for a megabyte of
JavaScript because you're shipping all
the frameworks all at once on a nexus 5
it's a pretty new phone I like that
phone we're at like eighteen hundred
milliseconds the first time iPhone 6
with the latest operating system we're
at a full second first time s7 about a
second alright there's a cost here users
want it in two seconds you're sifting a
megabyte of JavaScript all that time is
gone sorry
it was try again all right so let's
measure this because I can talk about
numbers and we can talk about goals but
I find it really helpful to take a look
at something that represents the real
world so I found a cool little app at
the budget app that uses some
technologies that you're probably
familiar with webpack react Redux
awesome sounds fun so let's load it up
here all right here's our app that's
clear so this is you know really good
budget app I'm gonna say I don't want to
buy cat food great let's spend a hundred
no it's been a hundred dollars I can
have food I got the fancy kind so great
okay I'm really struggling with my
guitar and the Trader Joe's food all
right so let's record let's record a
profile here and as you've heard today
we can enable the CPU throttling which
is not a real device but it helps kind
of get slower so this is on a MacBook
Air yeah sure and we're just gonna do a
5x slowdown which should make things
slower not quite a mobile phone and
we're gonna look at the JavaScript cost
just for this simple site so we'll do a
reload command shift are we record the
timeline it comes in here we are my
friend all of our friends really just
this chart okay well what does this mean
well right here we see that we have this
bulk of a yellow what's goldenrod color
that's a great sign actually it's a bad
sign it's JavaScript executing and we're
spending this frame 421 milliseconds
just handling this
so where what's our cost here why is
this taking so long
so I click on this frame here which
gives me a bottom up view of the
JavaScript here and we zoom in here and
we can see a hundred and forty of the
milliseconds to spend T obviously it's T
of course T P o T I can't why did I I'm
not really sure what that is but we can
find out what T is and looking at this
code really isn't useful so I can pretty
print it okay great
oh there's T hello T oh I don't really
know what this is but I kind of know
what it is online it's actually the sort
of module loader that web pack uses but
what's strange is this doesn't look like
a very expensive piece of code it's not
doing anything that's explicitly slow so
it feels like the numbers that are
reported to me in dev tools are lying to
me or not completely accurate this cost
is being associated here but I don't
think it's actually here yeah so I
really think that it's probably parse
time it's parsing that javascript is
from just some experience that I've had
so we start here we have this t function
okay but I want to see the parse cost
and I know that I could step down into
about tracing and click those checkboxes
and reload it and then find it but it's
hard and it always confuses me so
wouldn't it be nice if there was a way
that we could see those v8 metrics
inside a dev tools I agree well I'm
happy to say that in canary we have an
experiment v8 internal metrics are now
in timeline just exciting
screenshots are great but demos are
better so here we are let's have a demo
great enable our cpu throttling again
awesome let's just reload the page
command shift our weight our three
seconds okay here we go four great well
good
739 milliseconds that time all right
where's our cost oh that's different
parse function that's what I thought
parse function compiled code lazy
compile full code compile stripped
function call back the is sound like
native v8 runtime things excellent
alright and we could go into exactly why
this cost is there but there's a lot of
blog posts that describe how to optimize
and this at least gives you a starting
point so you can understand the real
parse cost of your website okay but
first time that's part of it but you
have parse time because you're shipping
JavaScript and so when you're shipping
JavaScript it's really easy with and Kim
just to require everything and then say
okay great it works so it's never been
more important to actually understand
what you ship web pack recently had a
plug-in released it's called the web
pack bundle analyzer and this actually
shows you what's in your bundle your web
pack bundle and you can explore this
tree map and see the gzip size the
bundle size everything great about it
you can find out why you have three
versions of jQuery on the page to
improve things and then for those of you
using browserify there's a similar tool
called disk which has a sunburst
chart which is beautiful I always I'm
always so happy when I see this I'm able
to define this size etc same information
so okay you understand what you're
shipping you're shipping less code
ideally but you're still having that
parse cost and you have to think well
the only way to shrink parse time is the
ship less parse code okay well how do I
shift less parse code because I'm
shipping JavaScript I wanted to be
parsed that's a good question
oh there's there's two techniques that I
like
simple - do you know the script tag it
always has that type on that you set
source well you can change that type to
be whatever and if it's invalid the
browser doesn't know how to handle it it
will download the script file for you
but it won't do anything go to sit there
and so you can put type inert type poo
emoji it all works
you'll get that script tag and then what
you can do as a developer to say oh I
have some idle time here let me go ahead
and evaluate this javascript take the
contents put it in a script tag this
gives you control over when the parse
time happens so ideally not at that
initial boot up experience now you can
also have another script tag where you
wrap your code in comments okay so you
ship down JavaScript that's commented
out but then when you want to evaluate
it you just strip those comments out and
then the code is now evaluated so some
techniques for manual shipping of inert
code which can help you to avoid that
parse cost which is non-trivial alright
that seems pretty manual it is wouldn't
be nice if there were ways to do this
automatically in my framework of choice
and there are the community has been
listening and solving these problems for
you so it's much easier to do these
things angular to actually ships with
lazy module loading by default and ahead
of time compilation so you can do per
route JavaScript bundle downloads which
is pretty remarkable polymer CLI which
built the shop site has per route
fragment charting so it's aware of your
page and all of your routes and it's
able to say I know that this bundle is
gonna be for this route and this one is
for this other route and so here are
these independent bundles that you can
download when you feel like you need to
the other way is a little more manual
but still really amazing web pack has a
plug-in called aggressive splitting
plug-in and it redefines the semantics
around require to add required ensure
and what this does is essentially builds
a dependency graph of your requires so
that web pack can say okay I'm going to
split this javascript bundle this one
this one this one this one this one and
you get like a lot of JavaScript files
but they're great cuz they're really
and you can manually control when you
download them which is so alright so we
looked at Network we looked at
JavaScript we looked at dev tools and
visualizing it and measuring our cost so
what I want to leave you with well as
you've heard time and time again today
it is a mobile world it has never been
more important to test on real devices
not the one on your pocket the one that
your users are experiencing your website
with and it's not just testing on a
mobile phone it's also testing on a
mobile network not the Wi-Fi in your
office you need to go and you need to go
get a 3G network and say ok here I am on
my phone on a 3G network what is my web
app feel like is it slow we should
probably fix that now given what your
users visit your site on it's critical
that you optimize for network
utilization by using techniques like
serviceworker link rel preload HTTP to
push these things can help you get super
fast first loads in under two seconds
and on reload it's instant because you
have that serviceworker just sitting
there and finally my favorite said
javascript parsed javascript that you
ship has a cost because it has to get
evaluated it has to get parsed so when
you ship more JavaScript parse time goes
up there's no way you can really avoid
this so the trick is you ship less
JavaScript you ship less parsed
JavaScript the end result of all three
