stage we have at outran who is the
partner development manager d on Alma
engineering director yeah come on yeah
go and take a seat yes adian Alma
engineering direct I've got parisa
Tabriz who is well town as browser boss
in her work by also i'm gonna go with
that Darin Fisher VP of engineering who
you met earlier Greg Simon engineering
director Alex Komorowski a product
manager Dimitri glazkov engineering lead
and grace clover principal engineer so
let's uh let's see what question I
haven't really looked at these yet so I
hope they're good right so question one
how many HTML tags are in the HTML spec
likens the wrong question list once been
really know me you figure this out too
many maybe okay i should say we have
some microphones set up we've got um got
one here and we've got one over here if
you want to ask a question live for our
panelists here that is something you can
do I mean we've got someone being very
brave so I'm yeah I'm not gonna ignore
that should we take a question from the
audience straight away can we get that
microphone on so you can hear the
question it was a special oh yeah this
is gonna be a very specific one for such
a big panel but it hits close to home as
to do with messaging across Google as a
whole in particular how it affects
chrome hangouts I use it personally I
use it in business and the app versus
extensions been shifting and flexing and
recently the extension has broken
entirely we were pulling it off of
github because of a feature that was
pulled out of chrome the docking feature
it seems like a decision that had to
have come from a lot of different places
that would have affected a lot of users
and doesn't seem like it needed to
happen as a breaking change and I'm
wondering
can tell me anything about the process
and how something like that comes to be
you know in the Chrome ecosystem so I
mean it there's no one here on the panel
who works specifically on hangouts but
as I don't want to take a stab and can
talk about the API in question a bit
anyone else feel free to jump in too but
in this particular case there was an API
developed specifically for hangouts and
oftentimes when you build an API like
that that specifically only for a one
first party application it's a lot
harder to build an out an API that's
going to stand the test of time and
really hold up and in fact be
implemented well in all platforms and in
this particular case we were left with
the question of do we try to try to
really make this thing work well even
though we have well it was really only
built for a specific application or do
we move beyond it and decision was to
sort of move beyond it because it wasn't
something we felt like we could actually
build in a solid fashion so I want to
lead them from from my question a little
bit more so the things we promote hear
things like you know being progressive
you know accessibility working in all
browsers I mean that is something that
we don't see happening across the web
sites that Google actually produces is
there something that we can do there are
there are there efforts there is that's
something we can change Dimitri to unsay
it's one is that from a polymer
standards that's something that we can
go I would love to see that changed I
think Google does need to play a larger
role in the progressive web apps
ecosystem and it does need to kind of
get on this train this train is moving
tab was telling us all about it I'm
doing all I can to make that happen and
y'all can help me with that too so
that's a you know that's also call for
help so if anyone has any oh god will do
the live ones cuz you know so we don't
have many of these this question is
about promises I know you have been very
happy about promises but personally I
find it horrible
I in the next few sentences are you
going to say the word observables just
just the prediction actually I think
it's kind of stuck between two different
promises one being trying to become
simpler like not having nested callbacks
and the other one trying to have like
parallel execution like promise all and
ended up being neither it's kind of
really really complex this given point
in them why is it why is it this two
different objectives taken in one single
thing and complicated I mean is it is it
my personal experience I don't know but
I think it's kind of it has two
objectives and it does not make met both
well I mean I how have you have you used
async await like the way you're sort of
you feel like you're writing a
synchronous function but you're you're
using promises that have you found that
help the problem at all i'm saying you
know you're saying from nested callbacks
because you have then it makes it easier
it doesn't necessarily right i think the
problem seems to be that if you if you
really try and build that you are having
a sequential execution right but you
really don't have the if-then kind of
structure that you normally do in the
unity in the sequential execution and
also you know most of the time when you
are having multiple execution you
suggest doing like promise all like
building that structure and anyway you
have lost the whole structure anyway you
have to rethink the whole thing right I
think so tomorrow we have Seth Thompson
speaking from v8 but we also have alex
russell who's on tc39 i think speaking
to him about that was probably be better
than anyone here if anyone's got
anything to say about that yeah alex
russell who spoke earlier he's around
this evening he's a good one to talk
about that I I think personally if I
said developer if I don't find it useful
it is easy I think that is what you
should look at it as an end result maybe
it's still easier for you guys because
you're designing the system
but it's a really great feeling so only
questions I haven I've here which is
which i think is popped up on every time
we've done this panel thing is is that
are there plans or discussions taking
place around making progressive web apps
discoverable in the Play Store alongside
native apps and it's interesting that
that gets the round of applause because
I always think like if only there was
some kind of discovery platform on the
web the things if only one company you
would step forward and make such a thing
but that's like a place those by the way
there was not enough clapping right
don't pity me in all seriousness I think
to some extent is you can look at app
stores to some extent as almost a
failure that the web already had that
piece like we app stores were necessary
because there was no other way to get
these things and yes it has become
something on mobile too i think some
users expect it to be there but what
users also expect is that when you tap a
link in anything it will load up that
experience and so i think it is an
interesting other source i would like to
see how as we evolve these things what
we can do in that space but ultimately i
think it kind of under plays the
strength of urls on the web that are
like it's super power at the same time I
could totally see the point that if you
are in an applica system today it is
important for you to you know quack like
a duck right you know you're you need to
behave like other players in that a
piker system so i can totally see it i
think especially as we like the improved
add to homescreen that we're talking the
darren talking about earlier today I
think as these things become more and
more as they fit in we're more like apps
i think users might bring over more and
more of those conceptions yeah i was
talking to someone it had like a gains
portal that was their app so to speak
and then they wanted to mint other app
so you're in their thing and you want to
grab a nap well wouldn't be nice to have
the flexibility for use cases like that
that makes sense we have to do that has
a meta app that come into other apps and
the like when we have these nice things
with being able to put paths and scopes
and URLs and subdomains so we could
actually look at you know going out to
deliver those types of things
pwa then like the livers on the set of
other pwas and then you can like go to
them and then you can pull this to your
home screen yeah that sounds like a
pretty good idea maybe it's our yahoo to
build one yeah um how did you hear this
a lot from partners wanting wanting this
feature what do you think makes people r
you want to be in the storm um I think
it's more about just discovery over all
right so why not have both platforms be
be at your disposal your disposal in
terms of discovery right so I don't
think I think for most people they
understand like the web you know it's
great and has a superpower of reach but
at the same time having another place to
have your you know progressive web app
be available it's just additive in terms
of in in terms of discovery and
especially if people are in a mindset
that the first thing they do is you know
click on you know they place or icon or
they are in order to discover content
right it's just about giving people as
many opportunities to actually find your
stuff and so on mobile device it's the
place for the apps or I think to
something sent to you like what what we
ship for the add to homescreen first
that wasn't the final thing we've been
evolving that as kind of it in a journey
and I think we aren't done yet I guess
so we're take another question from you
it's friendly face hello yeah seeing
Jake sure they talk about streams are
say I have my question is a two part of
one I've been seeing throughout the day
that Google is not just building for a
single browser but but building for the
web what's stopping it from influencing
Chrome on iOS to have service worker or
Safari to have service worker and the
second part is extending to the Act
homescreen part would it be possible to
have a direct link saying at the home
screen when we search for say some web
apps and we know that we have a manifest
wyd already so it would be nicer to say
like at home screen directly from the
link but it would is it technically
challenging and why's that not happening
or I guess the first part of that is
like what what can we do about chrome on
i also want more can we do that grace
you wanna take this one I think for the
iOS
is for the service worker we very
liberal but yeah so yeah things like we
don't we have to like a using the public
a webview right so we don't really have
a lot of choices and what we can do is
try to influence ipod to put a service
workers into the web into the WK wipe
you so which is amiss old abs like
browser interface the app on iOS can
enjoy it and part of things I think for
us to demonstrate how it works well in
android and then I mean we need the you
guys to building the app using the
service worker and the user can see the
difference benefit and the Hopa doc I
improves ipod to changing I'd in the
surface for you go make your web
experience is much much faster on
Android because you're using the service
worker and so you figure iphone use for
the web is slow and if you're an Android
user the web is fast yeah and there's
actually yes Apple representatives here
it's been really great for them to show
up at the event as well as Mozilla and
opera and all these other phone so I
feel like you know if you I don't know
if we have a poly Mon for them so you
can't catch them if you can find them
like talk about you know what what you
want from Safari yeah this actually came
up that last year's chrome dev summit I
ought to talk about benchmarks and
really that's the ultimate benchmark
right is like well my website runs much
faster for users on this plat this
browser versus another that beats ever
any synthetic benchmark out there so I'm
gonna do one more question from here
before coming back to people are
microphones how my uses a boss yeah it
was about at home screen from the search
space directly because we know that
these apps would have manifested JSON in
them yes grenade search result page
right so yeah we actually definitely
look into that where's the search team
yeah hoping to see it it soon thank you
thank you so how might uses expectation
of the security model change when a web
app is launched from the home screen
Teresa did you wanna take this one so it
feels like a native app so should it be
able to do all of the stuff a native app
can do
feels like a native app I worry about
this actually there's a different
security model for native applications
or whether it's on the phone or any
computer and the web and there's great I
think that you know we have an
opportunity to merge that experience and
actually make it more immersive between
native applications and websites
especially on the phone but most users
don't understand the security model
differences most you shouldn't need to
most developers don't necessarily need
to and now we have kind of native app to
asking for permissions and websites
asking for permissions and users don't
necessarily know which is which
especially as we kind of evolve the UI
between these two things the was a
question specifically asking yes is
there any things we would grant if the
appetite it's a home screen that we
wouldn't if it was a website is there
anything that we would infer well one
thing we do is full screen sri darbar
that is already happening together that
you do get me durable storage for
example and things like this so there is
there's a lot of things that are already
happening that you know add to
homescreen is such a strong signal from
the user that they want to engage with
the site that we sort of do have some
affordances but there is like you
pointed out a really interesting line to
walk and yeah this is less secure but I
mean you're getting more capabilities
and with those capabilities come you
know risk of abuse so I think I
mentioned earlier today they were
looking at auto granting the
notification permission when the user
posted Adam ScreenFlow and part of that
too is as these with the improved add to
homescreen it feels much more like a nap
many other ways and so on Android for
example you native apps get that
permission to push notifications by
default yeah I don't think you always
want to ask I think there's there's a
tendency to say well we should you know
always ask for permissions but people
get desensitized to constantly being
asked to grant permissions and then
you've lost any you know security
benefit but that question was gonna be
asked so I think there's a lot of work
we're doing into finding out the balance
for you know any any capability and the
more powerful it is I think the more you
know thought we put into where that
balance is but I think there's a non
security aspect to of just like when you
tap on this what should show up should
it feel like a web page and it feel like
a nap and someone actually in the in the
audience I was definitely earlier in the
audience show me they're taken a native
app and Android app and they'd pulled it
to a pwa and they were going through how
like it was basically you know perfect
fidelity other than the fact that they
couldn't affect the screen brightness
for this one scanner piece and as I sit
in there's like what I remember like a
couple of years ago we began our the web
can't do this I can't do this until I be
talking about like the screen brightness
is like the one thing left that I
founded it was kind of like inch may
venture and so thank you guys so much
for building these great experiences
that they actually really do feel like
and when my kid goes up and taps on this
icon he really doesn't know what
technology and definitely you shouldn't
care I mean yeah a lot of people don't
know and I think that's awesome right
like you just want to enjoy I mean you
know yeah you shouldn't need to Karen I
think well I think what you said before
about the people not understanding the
security model I think that's true one
of the things that so it terrifies me
about native apps is is the power they
have just over making web requests I
mean I think it's developers we
complained about cause quite a lot it's
it's a bit of a pain but it also
terrifies me that native app so if
you've got anything in your house or in
your company that you kind of think well
I don't need to put this behind a
password because its internal only any
native apps on people's phones on the
same network or just able to read and
write from that yes I the web's security
model is somewhat paranoid almost but
that paranoia is a strong word but is
what allows us to have that really low
friction you know it's no accidentally
tap a link it goes right to it even if
it's a different domain that's part and
parcel of the 25 years of the security
mullet we've been developing and
maintaining and strengthening we start
to feel like security model is it
trigger word for the Spanish
let's take a couple more questions in
the audience so most of it so you guys
touched on it a little bit already but
it seems like you guys are kind of
encouraging developers to go more
towards obviously pwas versus something
like chrome packaged apps which is what
my company has been developing for
several years now kind of jumped on it
right when you introduce that so the
question was I see that there's like
this migration strategy and all the AP
is that we need are there yet and so I
was actually talking Darren sounds like
there's definitely hope for that but
there's still something in the education
area which is that these are usually
Chromebooks or some kind of device that
is managed so how do what is it what is
the strategy for let's say a school
district be able to push these
applications to a set of devices that
are strictly managed why are we going
with chrome apps then he wants to take
that one so I think I think as we as we
look through this like this was not an
easy decision obviously and ultimately
we care a lot about the open web and
what we call a linkable web the ability
for people to be exposed lots of
different diverse experiences relatively
easily I think they're we definitely
there's a number of gaps between what
was possible in chrome apps was a quite
different security model in professor
web apps for that particular case I mean
I can imagine how that would work about
how we could push an icon and then maybe
icon is pushed we fetch and boot up the
service worker in an off-screen tab to
give it a chance to sort of fetch the
things that needs and we really want to
hear feedback from people like you about
the gaps like that they're in place that
we can work to address them and make
sure that we offer the best solutions we
can for that for what it's worth it does
not seem like a thing but a technical
problem that will probably should tackle
this problem is probably also relevant
in many other applications for example
for next billion users where you might
have offline a lot and you actually
might have to resort to some
peer-to-peer swapping of progressive web
applications I can imagine a world like
this and what is that how is that
different from
what you're described except yours is
you know a slightly different
application of the same type of
technology so I totally see this this is
a possible thing at the end of the day
progressive web apps work really great
on desktop as well and there's there's
really nothing stopping us from flushing
out those details so that the enterprise
management features of Chrome OS and so
on work work well for pushing pwas is
there it okay I just want one more thing
tonight where's how can we give feedback
to chrome team for things like this
because for a lot of like shopping sites
and stuff like that seems like there's a
lot of you know people who are in that
space that you can be off of but for
education it's a very different market
and it's very narrow so we love getting
feedback from all developers I we almost
everything we do is fully an open source
and there's a reason for that we love
when people come on various mailing
lists to give us feedback it's very
specifically on this issue when we
announced this change on the chromium
blog there's a link to either a feedback
form or a mailing list and we really
heard you to engage there because like
that's that this is a great example the
thing that we should just do right thank
you good evening as the modern web
applications goal is to make the user
experience better and make the web
applications native right so in that
case if the user uses the application
for the most of the time the memory
consumption of the web application is
also matters so I'm glad that we have
debugging tools to identify where the
memory leakages are in the chrome like
but what are the suggestions do you give
to the developers to prevent the memory
leakages or what are the areas that
developers should concentrate to prevent
the memory consumption one of the things
I found the most difficult thing to
debug on web pages despite the dev tools
we've got who's gonna fix it we are
going to fix it yeah this is this is
actually a huge pain point for us we've
invested a bunch of effort into trying
to understand memory usage ourselves in
side of chrome this year and I think I
don't know if you you are feeling it but
we definitely know our graphs are old
you know going down in terms of memory
consumption and I think the actual
developer experience is next it's very
hard to do you're right Greg is actually
one of the pioneers of this back in the
day where he went and engaged with the
Gmail team and built them a little bot
that runs gmail for what 72 hours gmail
for many many days right and in the
quarterly so he fled in a red right and
it's it's hard I agree it's hard and we
are sorry that this is not working today
but we will get there and this is one of
our focus areas a lot of a lot of effort
being put onto the low-end devices to do
you know past year we did a lot of work
in the dev tools and then we actually
can't capture some of the memory you can
like using the tab to today when run
your website and then try to capture the
memory snapshot and to see where the
memory well part at least they're like
relative the two kome mean i'll be
relative to exactly what part of your
cold but you can see where the memory
goes you should also mean also just like
any good program but you know you know
pay attention to how many references
that you're keeping you know it's easy
to understand in the code that you write
yourself but if you bring in a bunch of
frameworks that you don't understand how
they work you can tell it takes us one
reference right to pull the whole world
with you or you know keep it around and
that's hard well I way that's can
definitely it better sorry I where we
tackle a lot of this on the server side
is to you run a pool of like five
workers and once memory gets so high on
one of them you just kill it and restart
it and I'm kind of pushing my own agenda
a bit here but like I can we have I
really want us to look at navigation
transitions again and I think we're
starting to do that because in something
like Gmail if you're clicking on emails
you know we could do full page reloads
and if we could do that fast and we do
that in a way that's you know you can
still have a fancy transition then
you've got that sort of tear down
because you're already telling it
constantly yeah exactly can we get
agreement on that nap
this next question is is it really this
is a good one it's quite spiky I've got
some unease about polymer it seems weird
to have browser folks advocating a
specific framework is it you know it's
the idea that it should just shimmy
api's and so eventually become redundant
or does it make sense for a browser to
push your frame like I don't think of
polymers a framework I think of it more
like a mixing records the platform I
mean that's a trendy thing to do now is
to claim your frameworks not a framework
so I'm glad we're on board with that in
all seriousness I think tomorrow at his
money i think is gonna give a talk about
how to build progressive web apps and
many of the popular frameworks and
ultimately like there's a million
different ways to build progressive web
apps well we're excited to see a lot of
stuff the rack he's doing in the Ember
community and other communities the way
I think of polymer actually is then
there's there's this gulf between
browser vendors and web developers
browser engineers and web developers and
it's kind of weird actually when I first
joined the team it was kind of
surprising to me because I came plus
plus coders yes yeah it's very different
right and and so actually one of the
reasons that we we think the polymer
team is part of chrome is it helps us
test out all these new features in H you
know HT to push and web components and a
number these new features and give some
a feeling of what it would look like to
do something that's idiomatically as
close to the platform as possible and so
to me it almost feels a little bit like
a well it's just like a way for us to
explore what what you could do if you
try to keep this thinner layer as
possible but of course frameworks add a
ton of value right i mean frameworks are
in user land they're able to explore
concepts way way way faster than we can
in browsers and then standards and they
absolutely have an important place in
this whole ecosystem i think so i'm
gonna take a couple of a question from
the audience right after this one
because this one's been the font size
has been made very big on this one so i
think maybe a lot of people have been
asking it a lot of people use chrome on
desktop we released chrome on desktop as
well
what plans are there for installing pwas
on desktop Chrome like add to homescreen
I mean already works right ozz in all
seriousness this is actually we request
a lot it's on mobile it's actually
easier to imagine exactly what it what
it operates like because on mobile you
tap an icon on the home screen and then
it goes full screen that's just how it
works like that's what users expect
there's not really that many sort of
weird edge cases on desktop we have
multiple operating systems we have tasks
task bars and desktop launchers we have
full screen things we have tabs within
existing windows does this thing pretend
to be a totally separate application or
within chrome there's a lot of other
interesting questions a reason through
and we definitely want to do it but it's
it's a lot more stuff interesting
questions I'm really excited that
Microsoft a few months ago announced in
a blog post that they're going to be
exploring progressive web apps on
desktop I think it's really awesome it's
gonna be really cool to see but how far
can we get done like a electron like how
how how can we get down that we're
launching about tabs not for example of
the day you can go and you can say like
you're on a Chromebook and say add the
shelf and your website now is on the
shelf and it launches in some window on
Windows you can say add to desktop and
so on this this doesn't work quite as
well and i was 10 i mean that was even
true when we're doing chrome packaged
apps because the OS doesn't quite give
us the flexibility to present these
experiences as distinct from the browser
but on windows it works really well and
so and so to on Chromebooks and I think
the other thing is I wrote an ode to the
desktop because i think you know we
talked about mobile all the time and
that's great but one of the great things
about the web is that it can stretch and
you know do this responsive design and
give us access to all of these different
things and I've seen certain
productivity type companies that goal in
on mobile and then they leave behind
their desktop applications yeah this is
what I live in all day I use this for
work like it may make sense to actually
fix up the desktop side so I'm excited
to see as we kind of grow out I think
the pw story actually works really well
much beyond my
play on the it's definitely want to do
so let's take some questions from the
audience okay we spoke a minute ago
about the the gap between what was
available in chrome packaged apps and
you specifically addressed sort of the
distribution model but there was also
other api's of course and some of them
were very important in the educational
space so my company as well as others
have built things for education using
some of those api's those api's are not
likely to have web standards implemented
before the end of life of the of the
Chrome Web Store what do you guys think
about a compromise of getting some of
those api's into just standard Chrome
extensions that we can message as
opposed to you know they were only ever
in chrome packaged apps chrome serial
chrome net things like that so there are
a lot of things that are difficult to
bring the web platform given its
paranoid security model but that seems
like an approach that could work for
some of those from some of those kinds
of api's is again with this it's really
we love this feedback and they get
thoughts and the api's and use cases are
really important to you yeah i would
just +1 that and i work with the
extensions team who build the chrome
extensions platform and they expect that
there's you know probably going to be
increasing needs for extension API is to
solve some of these okay I mean if they
just the existing ones removed over with
that same security model would be
awesome so don't you send security model
um will be helpful is it's a small team
we've you know we so will be helpful is
to know what the most important things
are and that's I can't remember who give
a talk on it but yeah be a feedback is
so we can know how to prioritize things
okay thank you have some of the product
managers from that worked on that stuff
walking around so yeah I mean I'm are
you bringing up yes we would like to
ship as API over wed up as fast as we
can right but we have to be very careful
like we can difficult to unship things
from browser serve you guys it's really
that gap functionality means that
there's gonna be hold of no
functionality until they when the Chrome
Web Store goes away and the api's don't
show up a standard way via API is right
and we're with the times those are
different that's one of the reasons we
want to hear this feedback so we can
figure out which things prioritize
thank you take another audience question
my questions about HTML in ports they
were mentioned a couple times today but
and maybe it's just me but I sense less
optimism and I have from you in the past
do you still think are you still hopeful
that HTML imports will be supported by
the browsers the way they are today
Dimitri we've locked home me and you
have locked horns over HTML imports and
what they should do so you can you can
take those where is the proud father of
HTML imports yeah let's in that red no I
think it's still a pretty cool primitive
and it does get advanced a field you
know how do you do modularity on the web
pretty pretty far I do believe that
there is interest among browsers to
implement something like imports and the
latest proposal that I have so far is
called HTML modules which is effectively
taking the semantics of es6 modules and
transplanting them to something that
looks like HTML imports and folks have
been receptive so far but right now our
biggest blocker is actually shipping and
getting yes EGIS modules out in the wild
and trying to understand how this will
actually work one of the saddest things
ever I think is that this is the first
time we're actually going to be this
this week is week you're going to say
something that's the saddest together
i'm looking forward to this let me base
one of the saddest things in 30 last 30
minutes is that where we actually are
not sure what the performance
characteristics obvious six modules will
be once they're available because they
are a new brand new primitive and even
though is six modules are used pretty
widely in the development developers and
build systems environments nobody
actually has done a good performance
characteristic analysis obviously
modules and until we actually have a
running code in the browser we want now
so that's step one and once we have
something good and will understand what
is the next steps we will start thinking
about the HTML much HTML modules in the
precise timing of all the things they're
loading across the wire when they're
ready and when other things that are
blocking on them some of the things
that's been when I joined the team just
crazy complicated this was a intuition
in the beginning and I think right now
we're really like if you look and look
at what Sam was talking about look at
Alex was talking about we actually
understand the space a lot better so in
a way my answer today would be no HTML
imports will not survive the way they
are but yes there will be something like
it that is better Thanks who's next so a
few years ago at Google i/o it was
showed off that you can that chrome tabs
and apps which are treated like every
other app now that's no longer the case
what happened to that is that ever going
to come back or is that apparently gone
or what is gonna be replaced good mmm
yeah so we try to that motto is a bike
event it's in the end royal time is when
they introduced called a documented mode
is a lighter the app to go into the to
the system and we adopted that we are
first adapter from the app perspective
but when we start to get it to the wild
and then we realize is not a lot of
other apps adopted adopting that model
and for Angel also some of major like
devices like Samsung devices they don't
have the quick affordance the recents
button is not available there so that
make a lot of user can now finding their
tabs so based on that kind of like
feedback it is a kind of decision
because we actually run this in in the
wild for like over a year but there was
we collecting a lot of people coming
back we change back but we are gonna
re-evaluate
you looking at it I got today's chrome I
think we actually run the new is like if
a type is opened by another app we
actually will put in a the singer as in
the Android reasons so we'll try to
introduce this if you user using Chrome
as a Chrome browser and odor tab and
will stay in home but if they using like
haven't spoke model that's what a week
holidays like they using say twitter and
click the link just reveal the content
and then i will show up as an individual
document and when they headed a bag and
now we just go disappear I think awesome
is about user expectations and with with
that model every single site you visited
even if it was like accidental or that
celebrity gossip site that you aren't
very proud of you know that one time is
is kind of there in the same Mexico
together but like and I think the model
that we're at now is in many cases users
are just tapping around to a couple
places they don't intend to come back to
and like that still feels like a website
to something said but now as you grow a
stronger and try our connection to this
when you add to home screen that's more
of a strong signal of like now please
promote this to be like a thing that is
treated like a nap so I think some
extent is is like a us exploring this
space figuring out what works for users
what works for developers trying to
figure out the right mix for all there
was another factor if I could pile on we
introduced the feature called chrome
custom tabs a little while ago which has
seen really rapid adoption and prior to
that some folks were you know flirting
with using webview for trapping content
in their experience well we found with
chrome custom tabs is that people really
liked it they want to intent out of
their app into the browser because the
users sort of got lost and didn't know
how to get back to that app but with
chrome custom tabs they have that X in
the top left corner is really easy to
pop back to the app you're at so it
works really well for this hub and spoke
style of browsing but once you start to
have a lot of folks going in that
direction and adopting chrome custom
tabs and I don't know about you but I've
seen that more and more no longer do you
have that experience where you sort of
the segregation between the browsing
that happens outside of chrome and
I was going to happens inside of chrome
and so then we sort of that led us back
to this model of will if I launched
chrome I want to be able to find all my
tabs I wanna be able to find the
activities and the tasks i was doing
there and then we we thought what way we
can even evolve the task management was
in chrome around that notion because
it's actually really hard we can't
involve the task management of the OS
and many ways were just saddled with
whatever old versions of android
implemented for that and his grace said
some old hardware didn't even provide a
convenient affordance so anyways look
for us to do some some you know
explorations in the task management
space I don't know we have to use voice
you know just be like show me that
celebrity side that you poked on on my
computer just have a comeback this is
jamie sorry when I when I started Google
I just realized that every story I tell
involves a bathroom toilet but this one
does as well i started night and I
wrecked mentally urinal and I saw that
the person standing next to me was
wearing Google glass and I just fine ok
glass take a photo and he's like dude
works a question from the audience my
question is about pH performance earlier
we talked about pw in mobile performance
and the need for having less JavaScript
and less parsing a lot of those websites
have this one megabyte of Nam size but
the rest of the megabyte comes from the
advertisements so the biggest challenge
that we face on many websites page
performance yeah i can go pwa can go
offline but also we have uses a 2g 3g
what are your guidelines and how can we
bring it are the clear guidelines from
dfp that allow us to say we don't really
recommend you to put heavy ads or you
know you have the amp and that's
excellent you only allow certain type of
ads two words so am pages are faster so
what are your guidelines to make sure
the ads somehow don't affect the main
page flow another faster than and did it
doesn't impact the user so yeah this
isn't this is a very compact here
there's a lot of moving parts and we're
focusing on we're digging into a number
of levels and so in particular we're
looking at ways to isolate third-party
iframe the performance from the rest of
the page and making sure they reduce the
amount they can jank the page we've also
implemented a few api's and designed a
few new web standards like intersection
observer that makes some of the things
that many of these ads do that give you
ability calculations that many other
things sites do much much much more
efficient we're depending on the ads to
go and do the right thing and infinite
works yea networks usually countably few
in case of the intersection observer a
lot of them are using flash on desktop
to measure position and Taylor example
we've changed our public or a plug-in
power saver heuristics to also target
sometimes now that you can do
intersection observer just very very
efficiently we're actually changing the
heuristics for plug-in power saver to
disallow small flash plugins which is
one of the things you see on desktop
that leads to some performance problems
the other thing we're looking at in many
ways we're looking at making some
targeted interventions and roll back the
clock remember pop-up blocking this was
browsers intervening
to try to help right the ecosystem to a
better model on and you could argue
whether that worked but but the point is
that things like what we're talking
about here ways where we get involved
right and another example that we've
been talking about is in the standards
groups even is is around blocking
synchronous script that's injected
through document dot write a lot of
times these analytics packages or ads
will go and document are right one
script and then another one and another
one you get this awful sawtooth pattern
so we're exploring ways to kind of like
say hey that's not okay you don't need
to do it that way how about we just
start breaking that and it's that one in
particular we're shipping I think Bert
resume soon on 2g connections will
basically kind of ignore it won't wait
for that document written script and
actually if you as a developer or open
devtools on a page that does that
behavior we even if you're on 2g will
warn you by the way this behavior we
might intervene in certain conditions to
change this behavior there's a lot of
other work happening in this space for
it this is obviously a really complex
situation because just like Rick and
Robert came on stage and said we want
this to be predictable and we're with
our interventions coming in and saying
hey we're gonna break your andum Lee
it's going to make you do the bad things
but if you don't know what the bad
things are you know it does look what
random so it's it's a hard problem but
we are really interested in solving it
we hear this loud and clear this is a
really hard problem with this
exploration already another's work sorry
there's an exploration will get up as
well like looking at a spec where you
can have an attribute on an iframe to
say to kind of set some limits on it
it's very early days and sort of how to
attribute usage to a particular iframe
or to a particular origin is not easy
but it is we are looking at it cuz
you're right it's so important so you
can imagine saying this iframe can load
no more than three megabytes or whatever
exactly so a page can go one day can be
loading in five seconds the next day is
15 seconds so does
darling and there's no way to monitor
what comes thank you I'm going to the
last question from the audience of one
I'm just kind of curious for some inside
perspective on kind of the seeming
contrast between Android instant apps
and kind of that side of the house
versus the chrome team I really
okay that's that's I've been there you
go I mean I realize I'm kind of asking
you know half half the group here but I
am curious kind of what your what your
perception is of kind of the internal
dynamics there because as user I'm so
shall I go well I think that it's no
surprise that Android team is investing
in in snaps right that we talked a lot
about low friction and how that's so
valuable or friction and how that's such
a problem and so they're on a path to
try to figure out how to bring instant
loading native apps to become a reality
there's a lot of challenges their
security model somebody said yes sighs
but the reality is that's also know the
reality is that we're you know we're all
sort of thinking about the same sort of
ideal model one where you can happen on
an experience very easily discover an
experience and then as a user choose to
retain that experience and and re-engage
with it easily and that act of retaining
at Grant's additional powers and things
like in the case of pw a's today it's
full spain tomorrow maybe it's
notifications and perhaps other things
but the point is as a user you make a
you discover content within the context
of the browser or in the case of in
snaps and similarly within the browser
because you're following urls and then
you might as user retain it and that
makes that transition to being a thing
that you're keeping on your device so in
a sense we're all kind of converging on
a similar model for computing but
there's some fundamental differences
between web and android I was a betting
woman I would bet on pedo be a well so
that takes us quite nicely to the good
well a good nice last question and
that's what's the best way to convince
my management to jump on pw ace cuz
management has the money it just makes
sense it just makes sense cost-wise if
you think about just like iteration and
like update updating I imagine that
developers can sort of you know capture
the cost of being able to update and
evolve whatever product or service they
have and how challenging that is like on
native apps probably the one of the most
one of the best reason examples of that
was the big quiz right no one had to
reinstall a nap when you guys ran
backstage right I'm just Anna Mae if I
would have had the same problems that we
had today I just want to stress that
playing here and in seriousness we have
a number of cases number than or new
today the Tau covered in her talk we're
gonna have a blog post a couple days it
summarizes it as well a lot of these
things like that that's stat about the
user acquisition cost for example these
are very powerful to people who are in
the making of the business decisions in
this the other thing to remember is I'm
starting to see progressive web apps as
a term it's coming up in press articles
it's coming up at conferences at
marketing conferences at other places I
imagine at some point if you already
know these technologies and built a
prototype know what it would look like
for your company at some point someone
from business and your company is gonna
come to you say what's this progressive
all that thing and say oh oh actually
here's an example of how our thing would
look like yeah I mean I think the best
thing you can do is probably I mean
today people aren't experiencing
progressive web apps on a daily basis
yet and I think and sometimes it's
really hard to imagine your site inside
or what your site should look and feel
like and how it could be instantly
better I mean West Elm is such a good
example I mean they built a demo first
God sign off and and now they're gonna
do they did an early beta gonna move
public beta and then move their site
over cuz once you see something so
amazing you don't want to go back I mean
I think that's the that's and so I think
you sometimes you just need that
visceral like demo you don't have to
take your entire site take a couple of
api's just put it together and just make
it beautiful and immersive and engaging
and I think it's hard to say no once
people see that in it on their device
instead of you if you can take somebody
twenty percent and build a demo or a
prototype I think that's the way to go
make it real make it
are in concrete cuz abstractly who are
like with home screen icons yeah offline
but when they see it for real it feels
very different if you meant so good note
to end on can we have a huge round of
applause for the panel
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
