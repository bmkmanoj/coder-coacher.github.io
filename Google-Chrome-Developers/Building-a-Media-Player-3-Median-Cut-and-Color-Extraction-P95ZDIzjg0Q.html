the prototyping that I've been doing in
that area if you remember from the I
think it was the first entry yeah
probably the one where I was talking
about the icons which I've got on
screaming see do you remember how I was
saying the color scheme of the site was
going to adapt to the content
well if you remember that and I
mentioned I think at the time that I was
using a thing called median cut and I
thought I'd show you a little bit more
around that in this particular entry so
what I have is I've just I've got a
script here which is it's all JavaScript
is written in node which I would expect
to ultimately be part of the build
process so that when I take a video in
and it's thumbnail image I can pass it
through to this scripts and say what
colors do I need to have from for this
video and it will spit me out a part of
16 colors let me show you it running
there on the screen there node swatch
test and then I've got this this image
here that I took of Gibraltar when I was
there very nice place to go and visit
it's quite small though it's not so it's
just like things like a mile long or
something but I really enjoyed it anyway
nonetheless we have the photo of that
and we'll run this and you see it says
quantizing - sixteen buckets so what
it's doing is it's trying to find the
sixteen representative colors from the
image and it spits out a bunch of RGB
values but I've also had it make an HTML
file which I double-click looks like
this and so this is the part of 16
colors that it's derived from this photo
which if I put the photo up you can see
that that's yeah that's you know those
colors look correct so how does it do it
well median cut is the answer but let me
show you around the code so the swatch
tests it loads the image that I whatever
I give it and then it gets the pixels
back for the image and asks the swatch
class which I'll step into in a moment
to quantize quantize is basically
grouping
in this instance and then it orders them
by luminance because we've got order the
colors by something and sort of
brightness luminance is pretty much one
of the best ways to do that because it
means you you know it's going to kind of
get brighter as the palette goes along
anyway we'll come back to that in a
little bit and then you see I write that
out and then I write this file just that
I could show you these basically what's
in the swatch so how do we do swatch how
do we create those images
well loading is just a case of you know
loading image and I am using get pixels
here which is a node module that kind of
behaves similarly to the canvas that you
can draw in an image into a canvas and
then you can say get me get image data
on the canvas and it will give you back
a contiguous if I get a contiguous array
of pixel data which means that rather
than having say an array of objects with
like RGB a you just get one long array
with RGB a RGB and so you have to step
up in groups of four and pull the red
green blue alpha values per pixel as
like a block anyway so you can see
actually what I do is I call get pixels
which does a similar thing it gives you
back one of these continuous arrays and
I convert these across the IV be a Marcy
RGB in this particular instance because
I don't need the Alpha values you can
see that it's pretty much what I was
explaining there you go up in Y go up in
XY values if I go from what each row and
I times it by four because I know that
each one of those pixels will have four
four items in the array so I pull those
out so we end up with an array of
objects which I have our G and B values
in okay so that's one that's one per
pixel of the image great the next thing
to do is actually do this medium cut
stuff and if you look at the Wikipedia
article on medium cut it's actually
really good as an explanation it's play
explains that what you do is you find
across your all of your pixels
which component the red the green or the
blue has the most variants in it which
ones have the largest range of values
and you use that one that component the
red green of the blue as the one to
order all the pixels by so you'll say
for example you go through that process
and you go ah blue is the one with them
the most variance and what you do is you
order them all the the pixels by blue
their blue component value and then you
split the the whole array into so now
you've got two buckets and you repeat
that process lien with four and then
eight and sixteen and so on and so on
and so on and the idea is that
eventually you'll reach the base case of
this recursive process and you'll say
right I've got a bucket with however
many pixels in and you average that that
whole bucket now at each step of that
recursive process you could say need to
order by red or green or blue so you'll
always run that the process that gets
you the one with a the biggest range so
if you see here I've got this find
biggest range and it just takes a bunch
of pixels and you can see I stick
through each pixel in there and I figure
out the oh that's wrong that should be
max max max max lists all 16 bugs on the
fly hey we'll have to run that again see
if that they'll actually fix it anything
that's what you get Paul when you
copy/paste just as low it's a prototype
in it yeah so anyway we go through that
process and we figure out the maximum in
and then we figure out where the red
green or blue has the biggest range and
then we basically return Red Queen or
blue depending on which one has the
biggest range that shouldn't have
extended column Nina there we go
next up we have the quantizing so
imagine now that we've ordered our array
however big that is of pixels by red
green or blue and we now need to to
bucket them appropriately so we will do
let's see the recursive case first so we
start off with a big array say I don't
know a thousand pixels in there whatever
and we figure out which one of the
components the RG ought to be
that we want to sort by so he then
sought alive pixels by that and then
what we do is we slice hence the name
median slice it down the middle and then
we basically quantize we call down into
the same function again recursively with
the left half of the sorted array and
the right half of the sorted array and
we increment the depth value by one and
we still maintain what max depth is now
I'm going for 16 which is 2 to the power
of 4 so you'll see that my max depth is
defaulting to whatever this default
depth is which at the top you'll see is
4 so we go so one would be to do to two
buckets to beat for 3 would be to 8 and
4 would be to 16 and that's how we get a
16 closing the in the bucket and the
base case this is the base case when we
actually hit the depth equaling the max
steps tada we step through all the
colors in all the pixels in that
particular bucket and we add them all or
they're RGB values and then we divide by
the number of values we have to get the
average and round it and we return that
as an array with just a single color in
and because I've got the spread operator
here all those will then get turned out
turn back into an array of colors and
that's basically how we go ordering by
luminance if you want to do that it's
very very well documented on again
Wikipedia and wherever else that says
take a pixel and times its red component
by in this case not point to one to six
green by not point 7 1 5 2 and blue by
not point not 7 2 2 that will give you a
scalar value as a number which you can
then use to order so you see it's part
of a sorting function here where I can
calculate the Luminess for a given pixel
and then I just sort my values by that
and that is basically what's involved
now since I have actually fixed a bug
let's run it again and see what happens
so let's do that
lalala ok do we get a vastly do we get a
vastly different swatch we
do we do we get a different swatch now
no that's my fault for having a bug but
again you can see those colors so I
bring up the image as well and you can
see that those colors are still correct
it's just that I was doing a median cut
in the wrong place essentially by
ordering by the wrong component but you
can see now I actually get a much
broader palette so that's good glad we
had that had this chat good so that's
that's how this works now the other
thing you can do once you've got a color
like this is you could do things like
complementary colors if you think about
the HSL you're not done HSL it's where
you can think of it as like a color
wheel going from red all the way around
the rainbow back to red again so that's
the hbq and you think of that in the
color i think you actually marked up
between 0 and 360 degrees when you mark
it in CSS and then there's the
saturation which is how saturated the
color is and lightness taking it from
white to black and I think 50% lightness
is especially kind of the color in the
middle between like black the color and
white that makes sense but what we can
do is if we have a color and wherever it
is on that color wheel and we spin it
through 180 degrees that will be the
complementary color so let me just show
you that in dev tools very quickly so
I've said I picked this one here this
this this one here and in dentals you
can click on the color and you get this
little thing and it's currently set to
an RGB a value but if I do that you can
see that it's now gone into hsla so
they're giving your the alphabet so we
don't need to know so 48 plus 180
degrees will be 228 if my math is
correct
then you end up with you this kind of
purple color
whoops-a-daisy so that's why it was
originally and so I mean yeah so I don't
know how I'm going to put this
side-by-side but if I could I would
easily but I don't think I can very
easily
wait-wait-wait-wait-wait
1336 now let me just reload this page I
know it's because it's an RGB Deary me I
am having a
day HSL area so if I do two to eight
he's the end up with this kind of purple
color which you see also works just fine
in terms of the colors around it but it
is actually technically the
complementary color so if I was that if
I pulled out that kind of light brown as
this is the color I think I should use
as the dominant the primary color for
this palette then I can also find its
complementary color by converting to HSL
and then spinning it through 180 degrees
there is a plenty of code out there to
show how you convert from RGB over to
HSL so I'm not going to get into any of
that and also I think you probably can't
do it in SAS I imagine that we sort of
SAS helpers let you do that
maybe not but all the same there is
plenty of code so I'm not gonna go into
that but there you go
that is how I intend to get from a
thumbnail of the video and find out its
colors and then figure out what swatch I
need hey brilliant alright I will catch
you in the x1 I think what we'll do in
the next one
the next entry is talk about soccer
player which is how I think I'm going to
do all the dash and HLS video playback
stuff see that hey folks thanks for
watching don't forget that there is more
confidently you can find kind of over
here ish and if you want to subscribe
this probably Bucky
oh maybe there may be somewhere around
there click directly not on that
brilliant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
