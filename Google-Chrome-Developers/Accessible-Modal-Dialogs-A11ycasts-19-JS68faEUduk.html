and welcome back to the alley cash show
today I want to talk about modal
dialogues which I consider sort of like
the boss battle at the end of
accessibility because they're pretty
difficult to implement there's a lot of
things you got to consider and today I
want to show you how I do it and
hopefully give you some tips on how you
can make it easier to do them in your
own app so starting off with usually
whenever I'm going to implement any new
pattern that I'm not super familiar with
I'll go over to the Aria authoring
practices guide and I'll see what they
recommend for a pattern and in
particular around keyboard interaction
and any Aria roles or states that those
elements need to have applied to them so
here it's telling me you know when the
user presses tab got a move focus within
the dialog
ideally wrapping focus inside of the
dialog I'm going to use a press escape
we want to close the dialog right
because you know someone might not be
familiar with the orientation of it they
might not land on the the right clothes
button or whatever they just want to get
out of the thing we should make sure
that they can do that and then there's a
few you know rules we want to make sure
we've got we've got a role dialogue on
the element and we're using Aria labeled
by to label the element as well so when
it opens we move the user into it using
some focus management techniques it just
amounts as hey this is what this thing
is if it has does its role and then
hopefully they can move around to the
immediately focusable controls the
authoring practices are really useful
here there's another document I want to
clue you into as well which is the the
eBay mind patterns so this is a guide
written by some accessibility testers
over at eBay it's also a super useful
very practical guide to building a lot
of different UI patterns in particular
modal dialogues so the the
implementation that I'm going to follow
today is the one that is sort of
presented in this mind patterns dock
I'll be using a lot of the same code
there's some places where I'm going to
deviate a little bit and I'll kind of
call this out but but those are your
authoring practices guide and the mime
patterns dock are very very useful for
for building some these UI patterns so
over here in this lifestyle site that I
have built I'm going to show you the
modal dialog that I've created and it's
pretty simple basically when I click on
this Add to Cart button I'm going to pop
up in this little window
it just says like dialog example and has
a little message here there's a couple
controls for you know either closing the
dialog or you know saying okay yeah sure
it was added to my car whatever I think
a few things that are happening here
that I want to sort of highlight so
notice that when I tab down to this Add
to Cart button and I hit spacebar to
open my modal that focus has moved right
away into the modal dialog so it's
actually on the first focusable element
which is this close button and I can hit
escape right to close the modal dialog
and focus is returned to the previous
active element so that's a very nice
pattern that you want to implement to
make sure that the user has kind of like
a continuity of their context right you
don't want to open a modal dialog and
then when the user closes it you just
like blur focus and I have to start over
from the top of the page and work their
way all the way back down to where they
previously were turn on a screen reader
so you can see the experience in
voiceover voiceover on troll-like 0 step
remain a TD scarf button dialog example
by our awesome stuff it really awesome
closed ok dialog close button right so
it announced the title of the dialog it
amounts the controls are inside of it
can read the content it said the role it
was kind of mixed in there but it also
said dialog letting the user know what
they're interacting with right so want
to make sure that I get that same result
in my implementation as well and it's a
fair bit of code that I've used in this
example so rather than build it live I'm
going to walk you through the code that
I've already implemented just kind of
explain what's happening as we go so the
first thing that I often try to do with
a modal dialog is rather than mix it
into the rest of my page content right
so you might have like a main section
and then like some other sections inside
of there and sometimes I see people just
like drop a modal dialog right inside of
kind of like a main area instead what
you want to do is you want to make it
kind of like a top-level sibling to all
of the other stuff inside a body so for
instance you want it to be sort of an
immediate descendant of body and what
this lets you do is make sure that all
of the other controls in the modal or so
all the other controls that are sibling
to the modal are disabled in some
fashion and that way we can make sure
that the screen reader and keyboard
focus stays just inside of the modal and
doesn't ever break out and you can get
into the rest of the page which we
definitely don't want and so I placed
this
right basically right along where my
script tags are kind of closing body tag
I've got the implementation for my
Moodle right here and that way I can
just go through and I can make
everything else in the document inert
which I will talk about in just a second
and let's talk through the HTML here
that I'm using for this dialogue so
first I create a div with a roll of
dialogue and I'm also going to say that
it's going to be labeled by this element
called dialogue example which is
actually this little h2 that I have
inside of here now following the the
pattern from that inlined pattern stock
there's actually two elements inside of
my dialogue this dialogue window itself
right which is where the the okay and
closed button goes and then there's also
the dialogue mask so this is going to be
the overlay that sits behind the
dialogue and if the user clicks on that
that'll also closed down the dialogue
and return their focus back to the page
so these are kind of the two elements
that I want to work with over in my CSS
initially my dialog is set to you
display:none so all those things are
hidden and that also means that they're
not going to be in the accessibility
tree or anything like that what I often
see people do with dialogues if they
just position them off-screen but they
forget to hide them and so a stream
reader user is still actually able to
navigate into those things even though
they're off screen and you definitely
don't want that so setting them to
display:none or visibility hidden is a
very useful way to make sure that
they're completely removed from the
accessibility tree then whenever the
dialog is getting ready to be opened
I'll just apply an opened class to it
and that's when we'll set it to a
display block and in that moment it gets
added back to the accessibility tree for
the dialogue window I'm using a fixed
position for that element I'm saying
that I want it to be top and left 50%
and then using a little transform trick
to kind of like move it back so this is
how we sort of perfectly vertically and
horizontally center a fixed element
using this little position fixed and
transform combo here and then for the
dialogue mask I'm going to also set it
to position fixed and I'm just going to
make it span basically the the entire
dimensions of the page and set my
background to black with a 60% opacity
now over in my app.js file whenever you
click on that little you know product by
button I'm just going to run a little
open dialog method and over in my mind
is file here is my actual implementation
for that open dialog method there's
quite a bit of code here so let's walk
through this kind of piece by piece so
the first thing I often do is I'll just
define like a constant for some key
codes that'll be commonly used in this
case the escape keys is probably the
only one that we really care about and
for for our dialogue and that's going to
again let the user quickly exit out of
the dialog and collapse everything down
and then I go through and I'm just going
to grab the references to a few
important elements the dialogue the mask
and the dialogue window itself I'm going
to have this variable here for the
previous active element remember the
behavior that we want is when the user
opens the dialogue when a routine
knowledge of what the previous active
element was so when they close it we can
return that so I'll go ahead and set a
variable for that and whenever I open
the dialogue so this is what gets run
when someone clicks that button the
first thing I do is I look at the
documents active element and I save that
in my previous active element variable
so that way I can restore it later then
I go and this is kind of a kind of a
quick and dirty trick that I'm doing
here you might want to do something a
little bit more refined in your own site
but I just look at all the immediate
children of the document body and
remember we made sure that our dialog
was an immediate child of the body so
look at all the other sibling elements
and I'm going to set them if they're not
the dialog I'm going to set them to
inert equals true so inert right some of
you maybe have not seen that property
before this is actually something that
we're working on proposing in sort of
the standard space and what inert does
is it removes an element from the
accessibility tree and make sure that
none of its children are focusable there
is a polyfill for inert which you can
use which I have used in this site so
you go to github.com / WIC g / inert you
can also just npm install this with npm
install - save WIC G - inert and that
will get you a Java Script file for the
inert polyfill in my application I've
just included that's basically right
here right before my my Moodle J's
script right so I'm setting all the
other siblings to inert so they're not
going to be in the accessibility tree
and I mean
that someone can't you know tap around
and they'll just stay inside of the
modal dialog then I open the modal
dialog up by adding that class that
makes our CSS go and then I just add a
few listeners for things that should
close the dialog so you know someone
clicking on the dialog mask here I'm
kind of cheating and I'm just saying if
you click on any of the buttons inside
the dialog I'll just go ahead and close
it but in your case you probably might
actually have some additional actions
that happen there and then also
listening for a key down handler I've
got a method here called check close
dialog and what that's actually just
doing is hey if someone hit the escape
key let's close the dialog and then
finally at the very very end I find the
first focusable element inside the
dialog which is a button in this case
and I move the users focus there right
so I've managed the focus into the
dialog element that's really important
to do because if you just open the
dialog and you don't move the user's
focus then what's going to happen is
they're not even going to know maybe
that the dialog was open they're not
going to know anything is on the page
because you haven't kind of moved their
context into that new element you have
to inform them about it so we're moving
focus into the dialog now the user knows
it's there and streamreader should
announce it as such and then for closing
the dialog right it's we're basically
just going to go through and kind of Big
D structure all the things that we just
did so we go remove our event listeners
we loop through all the sibling elements
we make sure that they are no longer in
dirt we remove the opened class and then
finally we just find that previous
active element and we focus it instead
so we've managed focus out of the dialog
now back to that element and so what
this gives us is that experience that I
was showing before here we'll go through
to game of our screen reader and we'll
highlight some of the focus issues here
as well so voiceover on troll-like zero
together a TD card I love example I our
awesome stuff it's really awesome ok
button cool voiceover off so that's
working something that I want to
highlight is how the focus behavior
works so I open this and I'm tabbing and
you'll notice that focus is allowed to
escape a little bit right so it actually
is allowed to move up to the URL bar and
then the user tabs and it moves right
back down into the dialog some documents
like the Aria altering practices guides
say that should be completely trapped
inside of the dialog personally I I
there's a bit of a debate and I kind of
like
question that mainly because if you're
if you're trapped inside of the dialogue
and you're forcing the user to take an
action which I think could be a bit of a
security issue for instance you might
have a malicious website that's like
trying to trap a user inside a dialog
and force them to like install some
malware or something so I want to make
sure the user does have the opportunity
to get out of the page if they need to
to close the tab and will happen for a
screen reader user is it'll actually
announce that they're leaving the
document so we can see that here over on
troll life dialog example by our awesome
stuff okay button
leaving web content close WAF WAF always
over all right so it's a leaving web
content actually started to hit some
keys there so it didn't quite finish
what I was saying with it so the leaving
web content and then I was going to say
you know clothes lifestyle tab basically
letting me know that I can close this
cramped page if I don't want it to be
open any longer
so anyway this is I know it's a lot of
code and hopefully we can have some new
standards in the future like the dialog
element itself which is part of HTML but
currently only shipping in chrome and
opera but hopefully some other folks get
interested in that we also have some
some lower level primitives that we're
working on to make this easier things
like editor and a few other things so
hopefully in the near future this will
be a little bit easier but today if
you're building modal dialogues this is
the process that I would recommend you
follow to make sure that your screen
reader users have a really nice
experience that about covers it for this
episode again if you have any questions
you can always leave them for me down
below in the comments or hit me up on a
social network of your choosing
as always thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time hey folks if
you want to learn more about managing
focus or things like the inert polyfill
I've got a couple episodes that you can
check out give those a look as always
thanks for watching and I'll see you
