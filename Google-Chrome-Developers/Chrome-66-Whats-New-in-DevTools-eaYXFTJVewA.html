tools in chrome 66 black boxing in the
network panel audio just zooming in
device mode HTML rendering in the
preview tab pretty printing in the
preview and response tabs and an
improvement to local overrides first
step black boxing in the network panel
the initiator column tells you what code
caused a network request if you don't
see it right click the table header and
click initiator here in this demo you
can see that there's a framework wrapper
around the requests so they all point to
the same line of code what I really want
is to see the application code that
caused each request to do this I hover
over the initiator which shows the call
stack leading up to the request right
click the call that I want to hide then
click black box script the wrapper code
is now hidden from the results and I can
see the app code that really caused each
request to manage your black box scripts
type black box in the command menu or go
to settings
the preview tab now always renders HTML
and pretty prints minified files here
we've got the stack overflow page for
dev tools questions when I click the
request for the main document then open
the preview tab I see a rendering of the
HTML it's not a complete browser so the
rendering isn't perfect but it's good
enough this often comes in handy when an
API returns an error code that's
formatted in HTML and you just want to
see the rendered output the preview tab
now also pretty prints minified files by
default such as this jQuery file you can
also pretty print from the response tab
by clicking the pretty print button in
device mode you can now configure dev
tools to always resize the viewport so
that it doesn't overflow your screen
first let's see the old behavior here
I'm simulating a mobile viewport in
portrait mode when I switch to landscape
the viewport overflows my screen in
chrome 66 if I never want it to overflow
I can click the zoom drop-down and
select auto adjust zoom now when I
change orientation the viewport resizes
itself to fit my screen in the last
episode when we announced the launch of
local overrides I mentioned that it had
a limitation around CSS and HTML if you
had some CSS inlined in your HTML and
made a change to that CSS local
overrides couldn't take the change in
chrome 66 that's fixed here on this
super impressive demo that I built we've
got a CSS rule in the head of the
document the rule sets the color of h1
elements to fuchsia in chrome 65 when I
make a change to this declaration and
reload the page the change is gone even
though I've got local override setup in
chrome 66 though it works as you'd
expect I changed the color then reload
the page and the change is still there
that's all for chrome 66 here's a bonus
tip back when I created the JavaScript
debugging tutorial some viewers pointed
out that event listener breakpoints
aren't that useful if you're building
on top of a framework because your event
listeners are usually wrapped in
framework code the black box and feature
that I showed you earlier can also help
here
when I click this button the count
increments when I set a click breakpoint
then click the button dev tools pauses
and views rapper code which isn't that
helpful what I really want is to see the
app code that causes the count to
increment since the framework code is in
a separate file I can black box that
script from the call stack pane now if I
click the button and trigger the
breakpoint again dev tools pauses on the
code that I actually care about thanks
for watching leave me a comment if
you've got any questions or feedback
otherwise I'll see you in six weeks for
Chrome 67</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
