welcome back to the chrome dev summit
I'm joined here by tau and how you are
the lead for the product partnership
team on Chrome I got that right you just
gave a talk on building progressive web
apps and so the first thing I'd like to
ask really is just like what inspired
you to to give this talk so I think it's
just been an incredible year in terms of
you know seeing lots of partner adoption
of progressive web apps last year we
just had flipped car at this conference
and now this year we have like a few
dozen partners around the globe to
shipping building really cool stuff and
I wanted to just be able to take the
opportunity to kind of share the
motivations best practices and learnings
from across the world evolved like these
awesome developers building really
interesting and really impactful
progressive web apps there's a lot of
success stories um but I know I'm sure
as you're going on you're talking to
partners there's also probably some
challenges that they face getting folks
within their own organizations excited
about progressive web apps so what are
what are some of the common issues that
you see sort of across the board that
that you know are holding people back
from building their first pwas right now
so I think a lot of it has to do with
you know some people still have the
mindset of mobile equals native and so
that is shifting pretty quickly but yet
you know the web hasn't really been
around on mobile or it's been around but
it hasn't really had a lot of the
capabilities and so what we're seeing is
that people are still having to kind of
get executive level like leadership or
buy in in order to like start investing
in the web again and so this stuff let's
just take time and so that's a big
challenge I think the the second big
challenge will be around like how to get
started especially in the US or in
Europe where people have 15 or 20 years
of legacy content or legacy architecture
and they don't know where to start or
how to begin so for somebody's watching
this who you know wants to get some
buy-in from from their team or from
their higher-ups about building
progressive web apps what are some ways
that they can maybe overcome some of
those challenges I mean I think that one
of the first things it's just kind of
scope and see like what are the most
painful user experiences today on your
mobile website and so you can build from
like a
overhaul like the entire site you can
choose to do a section and what I found
is that people really have a hard time
imagining their content or what their
site could look like in a progressive
web app and here I think you know a lot
of the more creative dev teams that I've
seen are actually just built a prototype
built a demo and then you know showcased
it to their like senior leadership and I
think that's when people can see okay
this is awesome like you can just feel
like it's a very different experience
and at that point once you see what you
can do with a progressive web app you
don't want to go back to your regular
normal website anymore right on awesome
well well thank you so much for being
