twitter handle and github and pretty
much everybody on the Internet
I am from web developer relations at
Google but it's really new job for me I
joined about five months ago I was a web
developer before that so it's kind of
like a new field from you right now so
the events like this are great not only
I get to meet you all who use the
platform but also I get to need the team
behind the people who's building and a
lot of people who walks on the chrome
and stuff so you know I go to people at
an aspect hi I'm Monaco I'm new here I
recently joined what do you do and then
I get the reply like I'm on the platform
team and you know okay cool and then I
go to my email and then I get involved
invite like web platform meeting cool
I'm going to go to that platform meeting
and then in that meeting the
conversation goes like this like wow so
like at some framework use with
technology but not on the platform or
like from what platform point of view
wha-wha-wha and then also there's a
whole hashtag use a platform which you
know I'm sure you've seen it like yeah
banners so platform platform saw some
photos awesome so do you know those
seven years that you get at the tourist
destination waiter has all the city
names and like tote bags and
everything's if I were to design a flag
for my five months of experience at the
Google this will be the textile design
um so what platform write to me this
keyword is kind of like a sort of like a
programming technology that I use like
you know one of those things that I kind
of know what it is and I copy and paste
it and use it but I'd soon as somebody
challenge if you like so explain to me
I don't know JavaScript promise I can
I'm going like I use it I can't really
explain what it is but platform II to me
is like that so I try to find that
example of like me kind of pretending
that I know so this was from Mars
somebody asked me like I don't really
understand what the nodejs
is and like the deviation to the
I love the diagram the diagram itself is
not important but then like zoom in I
use the web platform even though I had
no idea what it platform was I just like
titled it web platform so it got me
thinking like I don't mean II understand
what what platform is and I'm not the
kind of person kind of like a total or
if you ask everything and question
everything in the universe like I must
know everything so I got two people
engineers on the team who works on the
platform and asked them like tell me
what exactly is web platform one thing I
got was like things you do like websites
and apps out of language of the web and
like okay it's like a plan of building
box Lego Ueno another one I got was a
set of into operably implemented
technologies available to developers
across the web browsers and I'm like
that's great I have no idea what you
mean
so platform right and then I got kind of
like I must understand this let me dive
into it the thing is in my past life
before becoming a developer even I
worked on the platform I was in the
software platform industry and I would
go into client and tell them about like
you should join our platform build a
product on that platform I was on the
company that made the video platform and
then I go back to office and talk to
engineers and product managers and other
stakeholders about like what should be
in a platform a kind of API should we
expose and most importantly how are we
going to make money from selling this
platform because in two thousand eight
and nine like SARS the software of the
service was like a one thing one wave
and then like platform as-a-service was
a thing to do so I know what platform is
in software sense but when I started web
development nobody called me or email me
saying like you should use what platform
or nobody charged me money to use to
start writing HTML right I just started
an open up a text editor write a talk is
debated to the server and then
while our there was a website so what is
the platform because even I don't even
remember who told me or when I was told
but there was this like general
understanding that web is open it's the
open web platform so I was like okay
that's a keyword I can google there is a
definition on the w3c wiki which is the
open web platform is the collection of
open royalty-free technologies which
enables the web so let's dive into this
sentence and what it means first of all
open royality 3 almost everything
anything I feel like that goes into
where the platform is done and logged
and open and what I really mean is open
that you can find a conversation as far
back as 91 logged on the internet about
like you know discussion about what the
World Wide Web should be my favorite
part of this log is the first email in
this log is titled test again from Tim
berners-lee inventor of the Internet and
then he says like test again clearly he
sent these message before because it's a
game and then like if you've got this
delete it sorry but this is the one that
did not get deleted and now it's logged
forever
well joking aside if you go through
those thread there is a really
interesting history and artifacts of how
web was formed so this thread I think is
a particularly interesting
it's a Marc Andreessen who was at the
time working on the mosaic advisor
proposing the image tag and it goes like
I'd like to propose a new optional HTML
tag IMG required argument is SRC equal
URL and if you see through this thread
there's a conversation about do we even
need to embed image in HTML should we
just have a link to some other external
resources and not even display the image
can we use other tags that we were
considering
instead of IMG and it's like a whole
bunch of discussion and it ends with
marker and reason going like yeah that
solution doesn't evoke
I don't think that works out for us by
the way we already want the code and we
are shipping it so that's the open part
the discussion is done in open nobody is
trying to say like my HTML we're gonna
have embeddable image and I'm gonna
charge money for it no like it says that
ideas and technologies and how it should
be the API should be is discussed in
open another part is that it is a
collection of technologies that enables
the web and we looked at the image tags
example but it's not only just defining
the the HTML tags so what kind of
technologies out do we have on the web
platform
well the web is evolving ecosystem so
one example is the pointer event so we
used to browse websites with keyboard
and mouse but then now we've rao's on
those devices and we use our fingers and
two fingers so we needed a way to
address those interaction in my web and
we added a pointer event another one the
web used to be just a document that we
shared across the internet but now we
make applications and which internet
application needs to get access to local
file system maybe so that you can upload
image and make something like Instagram
so filereader api was added this is the
API that is near and dear to my heart
this is the API I use what for the first
application I wrote on my job like not
the the side as a hobby but like the
first application my role on the job I
use this file reader API because I had a
two weeks of off time I wasn't a web
developer yet but I was on the business
side and I had like a week two weeks of
off time that client wasn't sending me
assets I was like well I want JavaScript
recently and I know how to control log
and I know how to like HTML I'm going to
like I try to make this like a little
tool that's going to help me do this
analytics thing and what I use the file
leader to load all of the data the
attributes that I needed to automate my
job
so when I did this my company did not
buy any license I did not ask for money
to start making this thing I just opened
up my text editor and did it and that's
great so question of technologies which
enables the web and this definition is a
lot close to the description of the
platform I got from the engineer a set
of technologies for the web but that's
only half of what he described as the
web platform there's a whole nother set
here which is into a probably
implemented across web browsers so it
went back to same engineer who said this
and asked them like so how does browser
into all probably implement things and
his answer was like well we used to just
copy each other's bugs but now we write
specs for Sanders and that's the way we
make platform and Alex the the secret
before before this I kind of talked
about how that came about so you got
that thing but every a web api and the
platform features that we use that as a
web developer we might encounter it on
MBN or any tutorials that we publish
behind that is thing called
specification document and it looks like
this and if you go in here's the custom
elements section where it defines the
element it goes in detail what to look
for
when to look for what to check for LR
and what kind of eller to throw eller
when it goes in step-by-step detail of
how this API and how this piece feature
should work and you might have ended up
this in page when you are trying to
search for some tutorials and then you
might look away because I did I
certainly remember this like a design of
a blue bar sidebar thing but like I
don't ever remember just like getting
any information that I can use on web
development job to finish this PR or
from this segment I was just like ah
that's not for me I'm just going to look
away while I was just having this
conversation I'm not a colleague of mine
kind
ask me interesting questions so he walks
on slanders I thought at Google and he
asked me like so I have a question why
don't you just contribute the standard
and my also was like but the interesting
question I have never thought that's
possible because I somehow I think the
standards are like a mythical creature
called w3c and Akama standard gives me
this like golden document that we can
use and I've never thought that there
was somebody or some human close to me
writing these things so I told him that
like I just never considered as things
that I can do and he was like oh that's
interesting feedback glad to know
because we never thought that was like
I'm you thought that way and he told me
by the way here is a way to contribute
to the spec and it turns out it's a lot
closer to how we make web application
and how we do software development so
let's look at how we walk on spec so
let's say for example if you want to
edit or add something to the existing
spec what does it take here's HTML spec
that is defined by what WG and you know
here's our link to the document that is
kind of like I felt like that's not for
me but all of those are hosted on github
and there's issue tracker that has all
of the thing that needs to get updated
it even has a label for good first bug
and it's interesting that the spec is a
English text when they say mean bug
means fix this English text so if you
look at the PR that is made against say
CML Lippo you find things like this like
explicitly mention possible values for
image smoothing quality so this was from
one of the good first bug it just means
that somebody noticed that in the spec
text is a little ambiguous when they say
values image quality it didn't say what
kind of quality is possible so this edit
just adds three more words to what
kind of image quality needs to be added
and now what person who made this yard
is contributor to the HTML much like we
write tests or software what platform
and spec has a test code the web
platform tests and if you dig into this
lippo you can find how each of the web
platform features should behave and you
can leave through what each of them
should do and I'm kind of the person who
sometimes when you don't need me
understand bug you read the test and
then see like okay this is what it's
supposed to do and here's what I need to
fix I really enjoyed the looking at web
platform tests and knowing how things
should work but what if you have a new
idea what if you're working for a
company or working on the project that
is completely out of what we consider as
a web right now and you need something
standardized how do we go about that I'm
going to show the example of how to do
it on w3c but many of the founders
follow the same steps so there is a
thing called web platform incubate in
computer community group ycz at w3c and
if you needed the announcement which
happened okay it's a relatively recent
thing like a announcement from 2015
it specifically says we will develop
spec use cases document like we develop
any open source software so how do we do
that
one says 'i have discussed and then
there is a value of things and features
and discussions are happening there so
let's say you have idea new API that you
want to bring you create a new thread
here's one from sama who is speaking
later today
and make a proposal usually those where
comes with a little bit of explainer so
in the github there's explainer like one
markdown files it's like here's the
problem we have and here the potential
for potential solution that we wants to
solve with this new API if you read
these threads the threads go into people
asking like well what do you mean by
that can you qualify your question is it
the V valued problem or any other things
like
can choose your focus with this other
thing that we already exist in the web
platform and those discussion happens
monster the mature discussion happens
and community agrees that this is
actually a problem that we need to solve
and this cannot be solved by existing
technology we should make new thing then
it moves on to next step so if you are
curious about those specs and explainer
Doc's ycz web Imperial community group
has a github org and you can browse
through all the Lee posts with all of
the explaining things it's kind of a
good place to know what kind of new
things like web USB or considered for
web platform once that is discussion
matures they do thing called intent to
migrate and which means that we identify
the problem community and we said we
should work on it and we want to
formalize the process and it moves on to
what is called walking group working
group is kind of like a subset in the
w3c that works on specific features and
discuss and it brings a lot of
stakeholder together to discuss like how
can we actually make interoperable
technology so CSS our working group
service worker have working group and
working group usually hub github and you
say like you you might think they both
like we already have to get how what's
the difference well you know there is
the Lippo is now under weg oak and there
is a whole bunch of process to move the
spec in order to be official spec or
they are recommended spec so there is a
document that what feels like a
gazillion pages of the process but if
you're interested you can scroll through
and you can find things like okay if you
have a spec it goes from walking drafts
W D to C R to P or to recommendations
and you know you can beat hole through
that but once you identify the problem
then identify it will agree that we
should actually walk on it then there's
a whole other set of process to bring
more stakeholders together and make sure
that the specs are
done so if you're curious if you're
browsing mvn you can see what kind of
specification this platform feature
belongs to and what steps in those are
spec process that is in and it's in the
table for MDM and it's kind of fun to
the cut so I'll summarize I talked about
w3c case but generally other sunders
bodies follow the same thing somebody
has an idea and sometimes somebody start
the conversation about hey I have this
problem I want to solve this what do you
think and people says like I also think
that's the problem and if somebody at
the adult conversation happens one and
two and many cycles and then if they
agree that yeah we should actually
invest the time and bring the see closer
together it moves you a little more
organized steps and then they do another
more set of discussion around it and
then once that's done then it's verified
and now everybody's happy and go party
so I asked the same engineer who told me
a lot of a platform like how many were
platform standards or like how many
standards goes into making a web browser
and his answer was all of them there is
a lot of Sanders body specifies many
bits or parts of web platform so WCC has
SS a lot of web Web API what WG defines
DOM and HTML x ma is specifically a
comma Technical Committee 39 is the one
who's defined the Java Script Unicode
most importantly to me defines emojis
and you can propose new emoji su Ãºnico
there's a process for that and IETF has
things like a CDP so I before going into
this I felt like this you know person to
person somebody who is definitely not me
working on spec was a process for stick
fighting but after this I came out that
well it actually most many parts of
standardizing our platform and defining
the what's awesome
- it's something that I some it looks
like something that I do day to day it
looks a lot like a software development
but I warn you it takes time and
sometimes it's a little frustrating I'm
sure we were at a polymer sÃ¡mi we are
frustrating eyes the spec lady is it
like already recommended like why is it
moving so slow and there's a reason for
that what platform is platform built or
many different environments since
joining Google
I got opportunity to attend one of those
standards meetings and I witness
interesting conversation so there was a
conversation about internationalization
API and one browser was saying that well
our browser is built on top of specific
architecture specific OS that does not
use this internationalization library
which other browser uses to other
browser you can share the same library
so their point was that like well you
two might think this is easy to
implement because it's in your library
but it doesn't look for watch texture it
doesn't look for hours and it's really
hard for us to implement and those
discussions making sure that it is
interoperable takes time another one is
that web is really unique ecosystem you
have to support HTML from 20 years ago
and you have to think about supporting
HTML from 100 years from now you know we
can't just say like oh excuse me sorry
in order to use polymer 3 you need to
install web 2017 that's not how it works
it has to work backwards compatibly and
then also has to walk in future so a
little story time what though like when
when they're considering those buckets
compatible and future proofing
what kind of conversation happens at the
standards so 2014 one of the engineers
who was sitting next to me I think so
Rob's talk from a Google i/o and he was
really excited and told me that you need
to
this thing called polymer and use web
component this is a new and shiny thing
you should do it and I was like okay
great I can write my own HTML tag I want
to look I want my HTML to look like this
I was in business so I was kind of like
thinking about data dashboard and like
this looks pretty really like I can
define my element and like make my thing
well my first prototype didn't work
because I didn't hyphenate the tags name
and that's one of the spec and support
doesn't look that way I have to make it
like my dashboard and bar chart and -
like the name and I was like like why
like I had this like a specific markup
in mind that I want to write like I was
kind of frustrated that Palmer didn't
let me do it and at the time I was like
polymer didn't let me do it I didn't
know anything about what platform so
that was my frustration two weeks ago I
always in the conversation with the
engineer who was in the meeting when
they decided that the custom element
should be hyphenated it was just
enlightening experience to me so when
they are discussing okay let's have this
thing called custom elements and web
developers to find their own tag
basically how should the syntax feed and
sending usual at the meeting told me
that they were like okay but we need to
define the way that doesn't conflict
with existing HTML and they CMO tag that
my coming future so we need to name
spacing well what about name zip spacing
it with :
turns out XML use this syntax and SVG
use XML syntax so let's no go because it
conflicts with what xpg so column no
another one was like what if we just
like prefix it everything so like X -
custom element or something but like
making up these kind of like looks like
a ridiculous so like they're like well
we really don't want to do that so at
the end the day and it was just simply
hyphenating the word custom element and
everybody's happy and that's how we code
now but this is so much more than just
having an e lurking mark up when the
specifications decided that this is
going to be
some element is going to be hyphenated
that means that they decided in any in
future when they were to be considered
you a CML native element then they will
not use a hyphenated name they it will
always be known hyphenated name because
the future or HTML element if they have
a high form then it conflicts with
custom element so that is kind of scary
things to discuss and like you know you
have to be careful about it because HTML
I think will way over live my life and
you have to take care of this what would
happen in the future so it takes time so
hopefully you kind of got the idea of
what the platform is and what kind of
discussion that goes into and I admit as
a web development myself sometimes it's
frustrating I'm like why is this doesn't
work this way
and I go into Twitter and just like I
hate this thing why but I hope you got
the idea that where you should go if you
have those frustration there is a
community discussion forum that you can
send to many of the engineers who are at
this table engineers and people who
works on the standards at this
conference are more than happy to talk
about why certain things that you are
happy about happen that way and I
specifically want to thank the people
who answer to my most one demand
interest question about I don't
understand the platform I don't
understand what the web platform is so
thank you very much and thank you very
much the polymer team for letting me
share what I discover and thank you very
much for listening me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
