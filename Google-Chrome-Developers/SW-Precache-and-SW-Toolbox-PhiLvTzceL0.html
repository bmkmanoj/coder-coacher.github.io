quite complicated especially with larger
projects there may be a number of files
that need to be pre cached and hundreds
of requests for different types of
assets that all need to be handled
differently Google maintains two tools
that make it easier to work with
serviceworker and the cache API these
work really well together to give you a
solid strategy for different types of
caching of different resources in order
to reduce Network requests and make what
you build work offline in combination
they work really well with the app shell
architecture that we describe elsewhere
in a nutshell we recommend you use
sw-precache and sw-toolbox for your
sites even if you want to roll your own
implementation sw-precache and
sw-toolbox are a great place to start at
w precache is a tool you add to your
build process to generate a
serviceworker file that will ensure that
certain static resources are cached
these resources are likely to be the
core app shell architecture components
index dot HTML main dot CSS main dot JS
your company logo and so on it also
gives you ways to implement different
caching strategies for different
resources sw-toolbox mops up the rest
you add code to your serviceworker that
describes what files you want to cache
and the strategy you want to take
pre-caching every resource that a site
needs to work offline isn't feasible
some resources are too big or aren't
used often enough by all users to make
pre-caching feasible other resources are
dynamic such as the responses from a
remote API or service so let's see how
to get started
sw-precache generates a production-ready
serviceworker you can specify resources
for the service workers to cache on
install there are many other options for
configuring the generated serviceworker
to accomplish whatever you need we cover
these options here
now just a quick reminder sw-precache is
a node module used to generate
serviceworker code to precache specific
resources so they get cached and work
offline sw-precache can be used with
JavaScript based build systems like gulp
or from the command line you can use the
module directly or if you'd prefer use
the wrappers around sw-precache for
specific build environments like web
pack for example it works really well
with the sw-toolbox library which works
well when following the app shell and
dynamic content model in a production
system we want our tools to handle
building the service worker with
sw-precache and add the service working
generation tasks in this example we add
sw-precache to our default gulp task so
it will run every time we do work in the
application in this section will cover
how to automate the process by adding a
generator service worker task to a gulp
workflow now the first thing you need to
do is to tell gulp what plugins to use
because gulp must know what plugins to
use we register each plug-in to a
variable by assigning a require
statement for each of the plugins we use
in this case we add path and sw-precache
to the list of plugins at the top of the
build file we can then create an array
of variables to reflect the paths used
in our application now right now the
code we only use has source child to
represent the root directory of the
application the service worker task
takes the static elements we want to
cache for our application shell we tell
the gulp task what files we want to
cache in the static file globs section
marked as one and what files to import
in the import script section which is
Marcus to the script imported will be
used by sw-toolbox strip the root prefix
free to turn the element into a relative
path now if we do not strip the source
prefix we would be working with absolute
paths absolute paths are written
currently in Windows CE flash directory
and Macintosh Linux flash directory now
the service worker task takes the static
elements we want to cache for our
application shell we tell the gulp task
what files we want to cache in the
static file globs section marked as one
and what files to import in the import
script section marked as two the scripts
imported will be used by sw-toolbox now
we can run gulp to generate the
serviceworker sw-precache generates a
production ready service worker we can
specify resources for the service worker
to cache on install there are many other
options for configuring the generated
service worker to accomplish whatever
you need we cover these options here
with the reminder sw-precache is a node
module used to generate service worker
code to precache specific resources so
they work offline sw-precache can be
used with JavaScript based build systems
like gulp or from the command line so
you can use the module directly or if
you'd prefer use the wrappers around
sw-precache for specific build
environments like web pack now it works
well with the sw-toolbox library which
works well itself when following the app
shell and dynamic content model there
may be times when you want to test the
result of using sw-precache and don't
want to have to change your build system
for every version of the experiment
sw-precache allows you to use the tools
from the command line we will first
create an sw-precache config json file
with our sw-precache configuration in
this example static file globs indicates
the path to each file we want to
precache or a glob to match multiple
files in the case of images and strip
prefix tells sw-precache what part of
each file to remove once the sw-precache
configuration is ready we run it with
the following command sw-precache config
path to sw-precache config jason surveys
you can get all that you can use
conflict to get location of
sw-precache config Jason or add the
verbose flag to provide additional
information sw-toolbox provides service
worker tools for cashing assets from
runtime requests sw-toolbox simplifies
the creation and customization of
caching rules and strategies at its
simplest sw-toolbox creates one or more
roots roots match request URL patterns
and route them to the specified handler
we start each route with toolbox Rooter
we can then specify an HTTP method to
match this can be get post put delete a
head
the first argument after the HTTP method
is the URL pattern this can be written
using express like syntax or a regular
expression we'll talk more about that
later the second argument is the request
handler this can do anything we choose
in this case we've used the built-in
network first strategy for requesting
and caching resources more on that later
as well there is an optional third
parameter the options object that lets
us specify some options for the route
now most of these options give us more
control over the cache for that route
the example defines a route using the
get HTTP verb matching the pattern / app
slash index dot HTML and using a network
first handler it will fetch the resource
from the network first and fallback to
the cache as the network is not
available sw-toolbox provides five
handlers for responding to route
requests toolbox dot network first try
to fetch the resource from the network
and store the response in the cache it's
successful otherwise try to fetch
resource from the cache now this is the
strategy to use for basic read through
caching it's also good for API requests
where you always want the freshest data
when it is available but would rather
have stale data than no data toolbox
cache first
if the request matches a cache entry
respond with that otherwise try to fetch
the resource from the network
if the network request succeeds update
the cache now this option is good for
resources that don't change or have some
other update mechanism toolbox fastest
request the resource from both the cache
and the network in parallel responds
with whichever returns first now usually
this will be the cached version if there
is one and this strategy will always
make a network request though even if
the resource is cached
however if or when the network request
completes the cache is updated so that
future cache reads will be more
up-to-date toolbox dot cache only
resolve the request from the cache or
fail this option is good for when you
need to guarantee that no network
requests will be made for example saving
battery on mobile toolbox dot network
only handle the request by trying to
fetch the URL from the network if the
fetch fails fail the request essentially
the same is not creating a route for the
URL at all we can use one of two pattern
matching languages to write our URL
patterns these languages allow us to
match wildcards in our patterns they
also let us match requests from
different domains but note if you're
matching a single same-origin URL a
simple string will work now if you're
familiar with express dot j s you can
create routes with a syntax similar to
its routing syntax if the URL pattern is
in string quotes it is assumed you're
using Express style routing to match
requests from a different origin using
Express style routing we must specify
the origin in the origin parameter of
the options object in the first example
we will intercept all get requests to
Google API calm and use the cache first
strategy if the response is in the cache
we return it if it isn't we fetch it
from the network and add it to the cache
the pattern in the second example
intersects all get requests ending in
fly like butterfly and dragonfly for all
the requests it matches the route uses
first strategy if you're more
comfortable working with regular
expressions you can define them in
routes pass a reg X object as the first
parameter of the root and this regular
expression will be matched against the
full URL request and pass to determine
if the route applies to the request this
matching makes for easier cross-origin
routing since the origin and the path
are matched at the same time without
having to specify an origin separately
like we did with Express style routes to
use a regular expression in the URL
pattern do not wrap the URL in quotes
the route in example 1 will handle all
requests that end with index.html
regardless of how deep into your
application structure the route finds
the match notice we have defined a
custom handler for the request the
second example will handle all requests
that begin with HTTP API dot flickr.com
using a network first strategy this will
ensure that your app gets the freshest
content possible but will still get some
content if you're offline sw-precache
also gives us the ability to control the
cache and its characteristics we can
define a cache parameter in the options
object in the example the Express route
handles requests ending with google api
Escom using the cache first strategy in
addition to handling the origin we
customize the cache itself we give it a
name Google API s we give it a maximum
size of 10 items indicated by the max
entries parameter we set the content to
expire 86400 seconds that's 24 hours
after we've started and whenever there
are more than 10 items in the cache the
oldest items will be purged to make room
for the new content will also be expired
after 24 hours that's
86400 seconds now to use sw-toolbox you
include the sw-toolbox module in your
serviceworker
along with a custom script containing
the routes in the lab materials that
accompanies this video you can find out
more about how to install and use
sw-toolbox and sw-precache and how to
incorporate
in your workflow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
