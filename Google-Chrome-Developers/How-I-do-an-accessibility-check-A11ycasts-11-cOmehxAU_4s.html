welcome back to the alley cat show so
today I thought it'd be fun to go
through my process for doing a simple
accessibility audit a lot of times I
have teammates or even like third party
partners who reach out and they say hey
you know I've got this site that I built
I'm not deeply familiar with
accessibility so can you give it just a
once-over and let me know if there's any
sort of like major gotchas I should be
looking out for so I wanted to cover my
process today this is not you know an
exhaustive review or anything but this
is generally the stuff that you can do
to find some obvious high level issues
so if all the way over here to my laptop
usually the first thing that I do on any
website I'm going to use webbing as an
example here webbing is an awesome site
for web accessibility usually one of the
first things I do one on any web site is
I want to ensure that I can navigate
using the tab key on my keyboard and
that there are discernible focus styles
as I move around the page so in the case
of webbing if I start tabbing through
here you'll actually see the first thing
that it does the very first time I hit
tab I get this thing called a skip link
up here in the top left hand corner skip
links are super useful you know on sites
where you might have heavy navigation
you want to let the user skip
immediately down to the main content so
webaim implements the skip link some
other sites like github have skip links
if you actually go to github and hit tab
you might notice it says like you know
jump to your repositories or whatever so
skip link is kind of a cool thing to
look out for but then as I'm tabbing
around the page I want to make sure that
I see a focus ring on different elements
on the page now web aim actually does a
cool thing here where they animate their
focus ring so you can even see it moving
across the screen which is pretty cool
they highlight their focus States this
is you know just about the best link a
tab focus behavior I think I've ever
seen really but I just tab through the
site and I make sure that you know I can
reach everything that is interactive
using the tab key on my keyboard right
so that's step one tab through your
experience so the other thing that I
like to look out for is as I'm tabbing
around the page I want to make sure that
there's no off-screen content that can
accidentally be focused so follow me
over here I've got this this material
design Lite sort of like template site
that the the team has created and notice
that it has this sort of like sidebar
over here and as I'm
focus moves into that sidebar right now
let's say I shrink the page a little bit
right so it's totally possible that
someone could have their browser this
size on their desktop and let's try it
and tap through this now so I tab
through this write my focus is over here
on the top left or sorry top right in
that search field now it's on that
button now as I'm pressing tab though we
don't see the focus indicator it's as if
it has disappeared and we keep tapping
we keep chatting and eventually it's
gonna show back up ah did you see it
down here at this like read more button
so what was going on there
well if we expand again we can see that
actually what was happening was focus
was sort of hidden in these off-screen
fields was over here in our side nav and
so I see this on a lot of websites and
this can trip up you know anybody who's
using a keyboard to navigate and I can
come trip up mobile screen readers
because you have something off screen
but it's still in the tab water it's
still focusable so a screen reader might
travel into those off screen elements
you know you might have dialogues off
screen you might have side nav off
screen and you don't actually want the
user to be clicking on those during that
current state so that's another thing
that I look out for I want to make sure
that people are disabling off screen
interactive content making sure it's
removed from the tab order the next
thing that I look for is I want to make
sure that I can do kind of like a simple
navigation of the page using a screen
reader so for this demo I'm going to use
the shop app by the polymer team this is
a pretty cool site that I work with that
team a lot to try and make sure that
this was a good accessible experience so
in the previous few episodes we covered
how to use NVDA we covered how to use
voiceover on a Mac I really recommend
all web developers familiarize
themselves with the basics of at least
one screen reader just so they can
quickly move through a page kind of like
what we were doing with the tab key and
this is just sort of like a sanity check
to make sure the screen reader can
actually like land on controls and
they're announcing things that they
should so let me turn on voiceover and
all kind of like move through this page
quickly to show you what I mean by that
all right so I'm just gonna use the vo
Keys to kind of like quickly move
through some interactive stuff visit
link home link shopping cart zero items
link where link ladies outerwear link
men's t-shirt I might you know try and
move down to like Lane section
I want to land on an image right I want
to make sure that that image has alt
text that's really important a lot of
websites especially like e-commerce
sites and things like that you'll move
through and because they haven't
provided alt text for any of the images
it'll oftentimes just read like the file
name for an image so that's another
thing that I often look out for as and
as I'm going through this phase you know
did the the person building the site use
proper alt attributes
I also want to make sure that if there
are custom controls like buttons and
things like that that have been
implemented using either custom elements
or using like divs with a bunch of
JavaScript that those are interactive
with a screen reader okay so we're on
this drop down it says size collapsed
pop-up button let's try and use
voiceover to interact with this so I'll
click on it okay it's reading me the
number of items and now I want to use
just like my regular arrow keys to move
around inside of this control so up down
right left right things like that so go
down to extra-large hit inner right okay
that's something that I look for right
any custom control is working as I would
expect with the keyboard the other thing
I know about this site is when I add
something to the cart it's going to sort
of add like a little sort of a like
modal pop-up type thing that'll show up
on screen and so I want to make sure
that the screen reader user is notified
of that possibly by moving their focus
into that item so let's do that item
added to the cart added to cart for
items interact without it took our view
cart don't close dialogue voiceover off
so you can see that when the item was
added to the cart the screen reader
focus was directed into that thing that
just slid out on screen so I know the
way the polymer team is doing this if I
recall is they've got something in there
with the tabindex of negative 1 and
they're focusing that element just to
direct our focus so that's another thing
that I watch out for making sure if if
something is being dynamically added to
the page that focus is directed to it so
that's a quick pass that we can do with
the with screen reader the next thing
that I do is I try and check the page
structure so I wanna make sure that the
page is using appropriate headings and
that there are appropriate landmark
roles or landmark elements on the page
because those help with screen reader
navigation as well so let's look at
something like Wikipedia which does a
really good job of this so I'll turn my
screen reader
voiceover on Google and what I often do
is i just opened the the rotor inside of
voiceover in NVDA there's the I think
it's called the web elements thing I
think we showed it off in the last
episode basically it'll give you kind of
an outline of the page in voiceover you
can open it by using a ctrl alt or a
control option you and just hitting left
and right to menu all right so we can
see all the headings on the page we can
see that they're doing a really good job
of using you know h1 h2 h3 going all the
way through the hierarchy of headings
they're not just mixing and matching H
tags based on like the size that they
are which I see a lot of developers do
which can generate kind of like a broken
document outline for the screen reader I
want to make sure that when they're
using heading tags they're using it to
basically build the skeleton of the page
so you know we can right move through
this content in a sort of a logical way
so if I wanted to jump down to this the
section I can easily do so the other
thing that I look for again is is
landmark elements so let's let's go back
and look at webbing so webbing does a
really good job of using landmark
elements on their site so again I open
my web Roder I look for landmarks and
here we can see that there's things like
banner navigation search main so if I
wanted to bypass all the navigation and
get right to the main content I can do
that right so that's another thing I
look for you know there are sites out
there which really don't include many
landmark elements at all and again
that's sort of an efficiency feature
that you can very easily add in use use
main tags use nav tag or use like you
know role attributes to create those
landmarks somebody users who use screen
readers can you know just navigate
around a lot faster fashion so that
covers a focus that covers basics of
screen readers that covers headings and
landmarks the next thing I check for is
color and contrast I want to make sure
that you know if someone who might have
a low vision impairment it's gonna be
able to discern the text on the page so
again you know looking at a site like
material design lite this is a really
attractive website but there are areas
where I think some of the
texts could be a little low contrast and
maybe a little difficult to read so
there's a really great Chrome extension
that you can install on the Chrome Web
Store we can look for axe extension so
acts like a like a chopping axe right so
this is by DQ systems and basically this
is a simple extension that you can add
to Chrome which will sort of run an
audit against the page and flag a number
of accessibility issues but one of those
is color and contrast so on this site I
can just open my dev tools after I've
installed that audit you can see it's
right here in my dev tools panel there's
this big analyze button so I click on
that and it goes through it looks at the
page and can tell me right here that
there are some elements which need
better contrast so I click on that and
it'll actually give me kind of like a
path to reach that element in CSS I can
actually even click on it and it'll
highlight that element in the dev tools
for me so in this case for instance this
might be a little hard to see but maybe
I'll try and boost the page but you can
tell that uh that these footer links
down here right where it says right
under this github logo wears like web
starter kit and help these are low
contrast texts that the audit has
highlighted for me so that's something
that we can watch out for there's
another extension the let's see the the
chrome accessibility dev tools extension
here we go
so we'll include a link to this as well
it does very similar stuff to the axe
extension but one of the nice things
that this extension does is when you
highlight something that is low contrast
it'll actually give you a color
suggestion so it could be like you know
maybe if you make the links you know
this different hex value you'll be able
to meet the what tag minimum so let's
see if we actually highlight these guys
right here and then our dev tools I'm
gonna go to where it says accessibility
properties and see right here lists this
warning for contrast ratio and I can
actually click these color values and
it's very subtle because this one's
actually like almost perfect it's not
quite clicking these little swatches
will actually change the text value on
sites and it'll apply an inline style
for you and that way you can see you
know what a better alternative color
would be the last thing that I try to do
after I've done all of this is I try to
recommend that you know whoever is
building this site
integrate some excessive
regression testing into their build
process again if we go to github and we
look up acts core so this is the library
that powers that axe extension but you
can also use this library as part of
your build process right so as you're
running your automated tests you can
have a sample page you can have axe core
look at that page and flag in
accessibility audits and you know those
could then call your tests to fail at
which point you know you got to go back
and you got to fix those issues okay so
we we've covered a lot but this is
basically how I do my accessibility
audits it's by no means exhaustive but
on many of the websites out there this
is how you'll catch some of the major
issues that folks need to work on that
can take their experience from totally
broken to you know at least sort of like
a decent baseline experience for folks

can leave them for me down in the
