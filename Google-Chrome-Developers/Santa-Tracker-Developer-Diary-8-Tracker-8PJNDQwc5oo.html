episode of the Santa Tracker developer
diary for this year I want to talk about
the tracker itself now this is what you
see if you go to Santa tracker on the
24th or 25th as Santa is flying around
the world delivering presents to all the
good boys and girls now the tracker is
made up of a couple of things it's made
up of the map itself it's made up of the
way we get data from the server to show
where Santa is and we also want to reuse
the map throughout the site which is
pretty cool
let's have a look so this is the tracker
itself we can see Santa fly around the
world here we can see where he currently
is he's in San Francisco and you can see
that he's not at any presents because
this is actually a trial run we can see
a few other things too like the weather
and we also play some games down here
so unlike the village which is very
interactive we keep this simple and show
the games in a card layout there's also
a few secret games that aren't normally
visible but are just made available for
the tracker itself like this trivia game
here we also have a few videos to watch
down the bottom and a social feed so we
fetch Santa's route in one of two ways
based on whether you're on the android
client or on the web
obviously this is a series about web but
on android we use the firebase remote
config api which is actually really nice
as it allows us to send down a JSON blob
to clients and actually update that
fairly rapidly that's really important
because if Santa changes his route on
the fly we can get a new version almost
immediately we do something very similar
on the web we've got an API server which
is internal which kind of emulates the
same thing than our case we pull that
every minute or so and so this sync
method here on the Santa service object
actually does that work for us so this
is called every minute or so and it
requests our info object and so that
returns things like the current status
any upgrades that are acquired by the
client let's say your site's out-of-date
and then it also includes things like
the route so we then use the route
method here which builds on that data we
already fetched and we fetch the data
this route URL here as you can see we're
actually storing at a local storage as
well their routes quite large when it's
not gzipped it's about 500k when it's
gzipped it's much smaller but we still
want to saw that in local storage rather
than fetching it every time a user
navigates back to the site and that JSON
we store in firebase storage Santa
uploads it there when a new
is submitted so how do we then use that
route so inside our new tracker scene as
opposed to our old tracker as we've got
some great naming right here we actually
call the Santa sync method when sync
happens and so that method if we can
find it does a couple of things it
basically takes the data that we have
and does a few more updates there's a
bit of a chain here as we can see so as
a result of Santa's sync we update
Santa's state which basically means
placing Center on the map so that's
really nice right you can say this is
actually a really simple call here we
say this Maps ant all that long equal
started opposition which is the Santa's
current position but actually what's
really cool is while you always
obviously see the map here with
everything around all the you know
little cards and stuff like that we can
actually use this as a reasonable
component which i think is really
interesting let's look at this tracker
demo page all this does is take a
reusable tracker map element and places
on the page here so of course that's not
very interesting we don't know where
Santa is we haven't hooked it up to the
API but I think this is really cool
because as someone who works in the web
I can take this component and reuse it
in a bunch of places on my side and in
Santa tracker we do that we use the map
obviously in the tracker itself but we
also use a cut-down version of the map
in our cast experience because
chromecast is quite an underpowered
device we don't want to do too much on
that so we only want to show the map in
Santa we don't want to show other
information about the social feed or
other videos or things like that so the
way we can use this is so i've created a
thing called map which is the object
team and I can say map dot Santa
lat/long equals let's pick a location I
also seem to set map Santa heading
equals let's say 120 so great this turns
out to be the middle of the ocean but we
can see that Santa is flying in a
certain direction I can even turn them
around this is quite cute and we love
the idea that we can reuse this custom
element anywhere in our site and this is
something we get through polymer so
while this is obviously a very simple
example this tracker map here is very
powerful and it allows us to wrap up a
bunch of the behavior and a bunch of the
stuff we want to do with Santa tracker
every year like show the markers of
where Sanders being and show his route
line so every year Santa visits about
500 different cities around the world
give or take however he is a bit magical
and turns out he wants to deliver the
presents to everybody no matter where
you are what we actually do is take your
geoip
now GRP is pretty coarse it's only about
city level
detail but we use that to make sure
center visit to your house no matter
what so if you're up late in the 24th
this year make sure you check out Santa
tracker because said it might just be
above your place thanks for watching
this year have a happy holidays and I
hope Santa's good to you see you next
year you can subscribe to the google
chrome developer channel down here we'll
check out some other great videos along
