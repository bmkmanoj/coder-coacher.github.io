- my name's bead I'm a developer from
Melbourne in Australia and I work on a
content management platform called
simpler so I'm here to talk to you a bit
about web components for content
management systems so I've been working
with CMS's for a while and honestly I've
been a bit frustrated with them
essentially I've been frustrated both
from a developer's point of view and
also as a content editor I've been
frustrated a couple of years ago though
I started using web components and I
realized these could potentially really
change the way we look at content
management and they could help resolve
some of these frustrations so that's
what I'm going to talk about today I'm
going to talk a bit about content
management systems where there have been
in the past and where they are now and
help web components could potentially
change them
I'm also then going to go over some of
the patterns you might use to build out
your own custom element for content
management so let's first look at a
monolithic CMS so a monolithic CMS is
essentially your your traditional CMS
such as a WordPress or Drupal it
essentially gives you all the
functionality that you need in one
single app so on the one hand this is
great it means it's really easy to set
up and get going with but like any
monolithic system it means it's quite
rigid so from a developer's perspective
it can be quite difficult for example to
change the way you're displaying that
content for example if you want to use a
different framework or a different
templating system it's going to be
really hard to wangle that in with the
monolithic system also for a content
editor you're going to have a bit of
frustration there so most of these
systems you're going to have some kind
of a dashboard where you log in and you
edit that content in a form the problem
with this is that that content there is
in a completely different context to
what your user is going to see it's a
very different environment so for your
content editor they're going to get a
real disconnect between what they're
seeing and what the user is going to be
seeing over the last few years though
there's been a
huge huge rising popularity for
something called the headless CMS so the
headless CMS essentially takes this
monolithic system and gets rid of the
view layout instead it replaces it with
generally a really consumable json api
or similar essentially for developers
this is this is fantastic
because at this point they don't
actually have to deal with the CMS
instead what they're dealing with is
just an API so they can really use
whatever framework or library or
back-end that they want to talk to that
content generally though these systems
are going to end up with a dashboard
just like the monolithic systems where
you have to go into some form and edit
that content in a different environment
to your users viewing the content so
this is where components come in what if
we had a componentized model for content
management the idea here is that you
essentially build upon a headless system
with that API to a consume content
except you take that view layer on the
monolithic system and you break it down
into really small chunks of data such as
image text or something a bit higher
level like a blog post so this is
already being done on the dashboard of
these other systems if you go in you'll
edit a content type so in a kind of
componentized manner but the idea here
is that that view layer is insert is
embedded into the component itself when
it's delivered to the user in the
browser on top of this we're also adding
in a editing layer that's embedded
inside the component itself so for our
content editors they're actually able to
go in and edit that content in the exact
same place and same environment that
users are going to be viewing that
content also because this is a small
modular and componentized system we're
trying to retain a level of flexibility
for the developer so that they can still
have control over this content and how
it's displayed so why am I talking about
this now in the context of web
components so first of all custom
elements is the first time that we truly
have interoperability before any
componentized model was going to be
restricted to the framework it was
working in this way we can build
components that can actually be
distributed to any HTML environment
modern this we also have encapsulation
through shadow Dom so that we can make
sure that editing you
why isn't having any side effects to the
rest of the dom so what would this look
like so here i've got a dynamic image
custom element with a path property that
maps to some URL somewhere essentially
it's just pointing to some data i want
at some point for it to fetch from an
api and i want to render out that
content so in this scenario that means
an image tag later on i then want it to
save back to that same endpoint so we'll
do a put request there so this is for a
developer this is generally what we'll
see what about that editing experience
so for example here we want the edit to
be able to come in interact with that
image in an isolated environment maybe
upload a new one manipulated manipulated
in some way and then be able to escape
all in the context of that one image and
see what the user is going to see so how
would we build that so i'm going to go
through a basic primitive i'm going to
go through that dynamic image and i'm
going to focus on the fundamentals of
the content part of that component so i
won't touch on the server and i won't
touch on the internals of that editing
UI so this means i'm going to look at
how do we store that content how do we
render it onto the page for the user how
do we toggle that editing UI to
manipulate it and obviously how do we
get and set that content over a network
so first of all we need to create a
basic dynamic image gentleman and that's
inheriting from the base polymer element
and straightaway as early as possible we
want to set up an image on our instance
that's going to act as a rendering point
for all that data we're going to have
next up we want to append this into the
light dom in the connected callback so
we want to do this in the connected
callback because only once the element
is inserted into the dom do we know that
the user actually wants to start
consuming this content we also need to
make sure that we're doing this into the
light dom not the shadow dom at this
point and that's because content should
fundamentally still be accessible to the
user for example if if they want to use
any third-party stylesheet or any
third-party library that expects an
image tag to be on the screen you need
to be able to make sure that's
accessible this also opens up the door
for really easy server-side rendering
so as long as your content is in the
light Dom anything that can spit out a
HTML string can server-side render so
let's look at some properties here
essentially what we want is we want some
properties that are going to be able to
hold all of the content to display that
image so for us that's pretty simple
that's just a source and an old property
you could add some more meta information
if you need but this is fundamentally
what we need we also have a render
function so this is an observer for
those two properties so this is going to
get called every time and just pass
those props down to our image this might
be more complex in other scenarios so if
you're building an article element
that's based on markdown you might store
the content and markdown so your render
function is actually going to have to
take that markdown and convert it into
HTML so at this point we're storing some
content we're rendering it out to the
Dom which is great but it's pretty basic
it's essentially just a wrapper frame
image it's not doing much so let's look
at adding in some editing controls so on
the right I've got my template which is
how I want my shadow Dom to look for
this dynamic image element and
essentially we're encapsulating all the
editing functionality into it now you'll
note my editor controls is surrounding
the content but really that's just
depending on the structure of your
editing UI it is important though it is
beneficial for all of your editing
functionality to be packaged into one
element just because this means that
it's a clean separation of concerns and
also is going to give you a performance
benefit which I'll talk about later so
first off we need a way to make sure
that our we can toggle those controls
open and closed so we've just added an
editing property to the host and an
opening open property on our editor
controls and all this is doing is just
making sure our host can control when
they're open and closed we also
obviously need to pass down that prop
those properties and that data to our
editor controls and at this point we
don't really care what editor controls
is doing under the hood it might prompt
the user for a file it might bring up a
canvas to manipulate it but essentially
we're just giving it at the data and at
some point in the future we know we're
going to want that change data lastly I
want to look at a load controls method
so most of the time with a dynamic image
most people that use it mostly
we'll come to your site with a dynamic
image on it are just going to be viewing
the content they don't actually want to
edit it so we don't want to burden them
with the functionality that comes with
the editor controls so what we want to
do is we want to have this observer
function that when editing goes to true
we can then import a HTML file that has
the data has the definition of editor
controls inside of it and only at that
point once we know that the user
definitely wants to edit we can load in
and pass and boot up the JavaScript data
for editing you can actually do more
than this you'll notice this entire
shadow Dom is only for editing so you
could actually defer all of your work
for for for dealing with a shadow Dom
until the user is actually editing
content so now we have a dynamic image
it can display some content for the user
and you can add an editing proper which
will open up some controls that you can
start manipulating it this is pretty
simple and it's a nice base to work on
we have an interactive and dynamic image
element but it's not there yet we really
need to have some kind of networking to
be able to load and persist that data so
first up you need some kind of property
which is going to let you uniquely
identify the data it's talking to so
I've chosen a path here to map to some
kind of URL but you could choose a
unique ID
whatever essentially is going to pass
you back to a unique URL we're also
going to need a deserialized function
essentially just a way to take whatever
the server is giving to us and hydrate
our own properties from that information
again this API is pretty it's pretty
simple it's giving us nice those source
and all property straight up but in
other scenarios you might not have
control over that API so your
deserialized function might have to do a
little bit more work conversely we're
also going to need a serialize function
which is just going to do that same
process in Reverse we just want to take
the content stored for us that's our
properties package it into an object
literal that can be sent over the wire
later on and obviously we need some
methods to actually perform these
requests so our load method is fetching
a URL based on that path property we're
taking that jason passing it and giving
it over to our deserialized function the
same again pretty similar just do
in Reverse so we're getting that
serialized function we're calling it
trying to get into a string and sending
it over to our API via put method so
this save function you're really going
to want to wire that up to some external
UI for example a Save button that you
might have on a page or perhaps an
internal event such as those editor
controls maybe when they close you want
to automatically save lastly we want to
make sure that we're loading in that
content of the appropriate time so I'm
doing this in the connected callback
because basically you want to make sure
that you're not making a network request
too early but you want to make sure
they're getting it at the right time so
once the element is in the Dom we're
making that network request but you
could be a bit smarter than this for
example you could use something like an
intersection observer so that you could
load in that content only once the
element has been scrolled onto the page
itself so now we have you know a pretty
simple image but it can display content
it can provide an editing UI so that you
can edit it in place and get feedback on
on that ending and it can also
dynamically fetch that content from a
network endpoint and persist it back to
that same endpoint but this is just one
component ultimately to get to a CMS you
need more than this you need a whole
library of components and that's what
we've been doing with simpler so we've
been developing out a bunch of primitive
elements such as video or image and text
and bringing them all together using
other mechanisms such as authentication
systems and global management systems
that are able to synchronize save events
amongst all the elements and and make
sure they're all editable at the same
time but more than just a single CMS
wouldn't be great if we had an ecosystem
of these dynamic elements where people
could mix and match and use the ones
they need based on their website or app
and what if we could have a plug-in
system for those api's so that you could
choose the content source that you're
using for a specific element you could
have multiple content sources on the one
page ultimately I think using all of
these together and utilizing web
components and the features that it
gives us I think we could really see a
different approach
and a better way to manipulate and use
content on the web so thanks very much I
hope this has been interesting please if
you're interested at all come and chat
to me afterwards Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
