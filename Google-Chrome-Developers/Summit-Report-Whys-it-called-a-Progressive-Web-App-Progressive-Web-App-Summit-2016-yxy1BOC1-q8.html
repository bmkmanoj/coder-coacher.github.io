are here again at the progressive web
apps summit we are in kind of like the
speaker ready room this is where folks
are hanging out in between their talks
I'm joined right now with Alex Russell
who is a software engineer on the chrome
team alex is sort of like the the
progenitor of progressive web apps I use
that word correctly okay that's all good
yeah sort of like a creator of the sort
of the concepts around forget some web
apps and I'm curious Alex for someone
who is new to the topic of progressive
web apps can you tell us a little bit
about what it means for something to be
one of these things like is this like a
hybrid app or what is this exactly yes
so I'm like a hybrid apps which you kind
of package up and put in a bundle and
then distribute through store
progressive web apps are just websites
except if you use them enough and if
they need specific quality criteria so
that the browser knows that it would
work well say offline or had good
metadata for your homescreen
once it meets that bar the browser can
start to treat that more like an app and
you can start to opt in to having it or
keeping it to your home screen putting
it in your apps list that sort of thing
and so if I'm a business and I'm
checking this out like what is what is
sort of the the motivating you know use
case for me to be like alright cool
let's let's take our current thing and
and switch over to this model so the
model has a bunch of underlying tech
below it so you need to get TLS so you
have to have a secure site service
workers are what enable offline and
reliable performance and push
notifications and a bunch of other
really good modern web stuff and once
you have all of that you put it all
together you can deliver an experience
to users just through a link that can
rival native apps and eventually they
can be on the home screen and Berrian
gaging just like native apps and its
really working the folks are starting to
build progressive web apps even for
browsers that don't support them are
seeing major gains like Aliexpress
really strong team they just sort of
stop the world and they turned their
site into a progressive web app and I
saw a huge lift in engagement even on
iOS so really investing in the mobile
web experience is what this is about but
we give you the ability to actually get
to aplex periences on Android and so
okay I'm sold I want to start doing this
what are some tools that I can
to start to transition over to this
model it's a big it's a big text app but
the hardest parts so far for folks have
been sort of verifying that you meet
that engagement bar that sort of quality
bar for your app and there's a couple of
tools that are helping now if you check
out the new applications panel in dev
tools in Canary and beta and Chrome
you'll see that there's a bunch of
support for sort of getting all the
information you need about your app when
you're doing live debugging and also
there's a project called lighthouse
which is in the Google Chrome
organization on github and this is
awesome because it gives you an
extension and a command-line tool you
can verify that you've met all those
criteria with which is which is pretty
awesome save me tons of time recommended
right on so we will include links to all
the tools that Alex mentioned down in
the show notes we've also got links to
Alex's talk on the chrome Developers
YouTube channel down there as well Alex
thank you so much for being with us
today in sunny Amsterdam I'm Rob Dodson
from the PWA summit I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
