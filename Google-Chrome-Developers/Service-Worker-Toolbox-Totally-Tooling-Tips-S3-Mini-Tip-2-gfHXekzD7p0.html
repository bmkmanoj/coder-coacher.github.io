looking at serviceworker toolbox I'm at
gone I've got ideas money with me be
awesome
so yes serviceworker toolbox is a
library that basically helps you with
building out a serviceworker these
serviceworker toolbox use like runtime
stuff oh yeah it's largely for runtime
stuff but it also does some pre caching
and other bits generally it's like any
boilerplate stuff that you would always
have to write and some of the best
practices this just bakes into like much
easier cleaner api so true so that's the
end goal of it and the entire goal of
this mini tip is just to show you how to
get it set up to use it and all we're
gonna do is just cache one web page that
will basically serve offline so steps
are going to be register a serviceworker
we no need to grab sw-toolbox wheeling
in a pre cache our page and then we're
gonna serve that page up sounds legit
yeah addy pointed out that I didn't need
to put numbers next to an editor with
line numbers but some people would call
it redundant so the first step is going
to be we need to actually check whether
serviceworker supported which we can do
with that if check if service work in
navigator and if it is we need to
register a serviceworker so we're gonna
register and i'm gonna create a random
file and i'm gonna call it swgs and put
it at the root picking of the root is
quite important because it means it can
control any part of your webpage and
that'll return a promise so we've got
then in catch then we'll basically do
the callback if the registration was
successful
catch will be if there was any errors or
anything like that okay so using
promises here and there's a nautical by
Jake yeah this stuff from last year
super good super thorough probably has a
couple of poop jokes in there because
Jake but yeah well link to that in the
YouTube comments because if you're new
to promises definitely worth checking
out so I'm Alison logging because you
know
I need to check with her Ashley works or
not I did add in some stupid errors when
I first tried this so yeah it's done boo
no serviceworkers registered and the
reason for that is that swgs well
doesn't actually exist so got to make it
as you can tell I'm really efficient at
typing and because the service worker is
just normal JavaScript we can just dump
in like a console log to make sure it's
working and chrome dev tools will show
us that message hello from serviceworker
and yay it registered so that's all good
so first step registering a
serviceworker we've covered that next
step is to add hidden sw-toolbox before
we can add in we've got to get it so you
can get it from NPM or power
I prefer NPM for all the things so go
grab that and the github page is like an
example of what you need to do which is
import scripts and what import scripts
does is basically for a serviceworker it
will go and grab that file but it will
also cache that file for you and make
sure it all works so you can always rely
on that being there if there's any
problems with it like being pulled down
or anything serviceworker will install
so that's all nice and handy so we
import scripts and it's all funky I'm
going to ignore that bit because you
know reasons and once we important it we
can actually use it by just toolbox so
if we added to the the serviceworkers
global scope and we can do toolbox two
options debug equals true now this is
really handy when you first start out
using this and if you run into any
problems with it but it does get pretty
spammy pretty quick so if i refresh
there you go
serviceworker toolbox now printing out a
load of different logs as you start
using this more this will get full of
stuff but for now it's really useful we
know it's working so the next step is
kind of B we need to actually precache
homepage so what that means is when the
serviceworker is installed it will go
and grab index page and save it so pre
cache is a method it takes an array of
strings and it will cache whatever's in
there so that's an array of different
file names that you want to pre cache
right yeah so you could do CSS
JavaScript files anything you want so
just doing that we can go refresh the
page and then to also be like hey I've
got some pre cached stuff
precache list / nice so this stuff gets
pre-cached into the serviceworker cache
API yes sweet so it's different to the
HTTP cache this to the cache that you
control and the serviceworker or the
actual webpage review what's inside it
but that won't actually do anything
right now because we need to actually
tell the serviceworker that when you see
this forward slash request return
something
and what that return is you can control
so here we're saying for a get request
on the router and when it's a forward
slash get request I want you to use the
caching mechanism toolbox dot fastest
okay so it's got toolbox dot fastest
what are the other options like cache
only network only they're fairly
self-explanatory but toolbox fastest
I've used in this example because what
it does is it makes one check in the
cache and then it does one request to
the network and whichever one is the
fastest to respond wins so normally it's
always the cache but the nice thing is
is once the network request comes in it
will update the cache and it'll be clear
why that's important in a short walks
I'm gonna show you a demo of why it's
useful so I'm doing some control shift
refreshes because I need to force a
refresh of the serviceworker and the
shift basically makes it happen so we've
got to make sure logging you can see
like strategy cache being printed now
and that's because it's actually serving
up the webpage from the cache awesome to
make sure it's definitely working you
can go to network panel click on offline
do another refresh and you'll notice
that the page is working even though
we're offline awesome the front has
changed because Google Fonts is being
used and it can't actually pull them
down so you can also set up toolbox to
offline your google fun stuff as well
you may certainly can because it
supports calls so if I now change the
HTML page and refresh the page cuz we're
offline it's not gonna change because
there's nothing you can do if I change
the no throttling and refresh it's gone
back with the fonts but it's still the
same thing if i refresh again this time
because of the fastest is update the
cache from the network and now we've got
a new change that's kind of nice so till
we stop fastest is like a really safe
option because it means as you're going
along your cache things but you'll also
update them I
the time which is really nice the
problem is it's quite wasteful because
it basic means you're not really doing
anything other than having a cache as
we're going along which you can make a
lot better yeah so there's a couple of
mechanisms and it's too much for me to
cover ins mini tip but this is your way
of saying you're lazy no I'm saying that
right now we need to find some better
options for it they'll all be good but
generally there's a couple of options
you can use things like if it's a static
site maybe build day or a build version
of some sort if there's a way with
things like CSS and JavaScript if you're
using fire visioning that's really handy
because you can pre cache just say only
use the cache because I know it's going
to be there and basically once the fire
original dates your serviceworker
updates and then basically everything
will just train them from that the
browser will update your serviceworker
yeah and then there's also sw-precache
as well which does loads of crazy stuff
with your build process and basically
gives you a really efficient way of
doing things it generates you
serviceworker with everything set up yep
but it's kind of its bit more of an
all-or-nothing it's a bit more configure
the initial setup yeah but it does
result something really solid at the end
so you've got two options like SRB
toolbox is great if your first like
tinkering with serviceworker tool like
service workers in general that's really
nice cool so people should probably go
check out the serviceworker toolbox SME
precache build tools and libraries over
on web fundamentals yes yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
