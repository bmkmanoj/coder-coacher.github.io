a product manager on the polymer project
at Google I'd like to welcome all of you
to the third annual polymer summit we're
absolutely stoked to be here in
Copenhagen for a couple of days
celebrating the web platform it's always
awesome to see so many different people
at these events from all over the world
representing all kinds of different
companies with all different roles
skills and passions and this year is no
different
totes to come from far and wide
representing almost 100 different
countries there are people from industry
open-source contributors weekend
warriors and even people who are brand
new to web components and polymer many
of whom we met this morning at the code
lab but no matter who you are where
you're from if you're here in the
audience that one of the numerous GDG
watch events we're at your own computer
on the live stream we are so glad to
have you here I think I speak for
everyone on the polymer team and on
Chrome when I say how much we love these
polymer summits
it's a huge opportunity to get a group
of smart bold future thinkers in one
room to talk about awesome stuff
happening in the web platform we also
love being able to meet real developers
using our products face to face to learn
more about them and get feedback
sometimes we don't even find out a
company if using polymer until they
reach out at an event like this if you
were at those previous summits or watch
the videos on YouTube you'll look around
and notice that they've evolved a bunch
over the years let's get a show of hands
and see where we are how many of you
were with us last year in London wow
that's a lot and what about the first
year in Amsterdam anyone awesome oh
great so to all those who visit past
events welcome back and to all the new
faces thank you so much for coming out
the first summit was just one day and
frankly we didn't even really know if
people would show up but luckily they
did over 700 of them and at that time
polymer 1.0 had just recently been
released and all of the summit talks
were from polymer team members
themselves
it was the first big long-form
opportunity to tell the polymer story
directly to you what we were doing there
what we were trying to accomplish and we
had such a great time that day that we
knew we had to do it again so the last
year in London we doubled everything two
full days more tops more space more code
labs more rain more everything polymer
1.0 was in the rearview mirror at that
point and now lots of real companies
were using polymer we wanted to showcase
how much our community had grown so for
the first time we invited some of those
companies on stage to tell you how they
used polymer and how important web
components and polymer were to their
companies and their workflows and that
brings us to today to 2017 and things
feel a lot different now even more than
they did just last year you can tangibly
feel the web components community coming
into its own so for the first time we
opened up talks to the wider community
and we were blown away by all of the
suggestions it took this much longer
than anticipated it took us weeks to go
through them all and that as you know
even delayed registration a little bit
and just in that call for topics we
found out about amazing community
projects and several big companies that
were using polymer and a lot of them are
here today we of course couldn't fit
everyone but we did everything we could
to give a voice to as many different
parts of the community as possible these
are the community speakers you'll see
over the next two days they're from
companies large and small universities
and the research worlds and the open
source community some will be talking
about polymer but many will be talking
about different web components libraries
or different web components tools we're
hitting that fun part of the J curve in
the web components ecosystem thanks to
both those longtime web components
champions who have done such amazing
cutting-edge work for so long and the
newcomers looking to give a new
technology a shot adding your voice to
the community our first time it was just
two years ago next month and it blows my
mind when I think about how much things
have changed since then the polymer
project itself has gone through a long
journey
many distinct phases to get to where it
is today the polymer project was
conceived a few years ago by some
engineers on the chrome team they wanted
a team of web developers who lived in
the future who can look at web
development not as it is today but as it
will be and report back to the present
to help inform the platform the first
official phase or the infancy of the
project was an experiment to help prove
out the idea of web components itself it
was to work side by side with speck
authors and browser implementers to find
the most natural way to extend the
platform to hand greater power and
flexibility over to developers by giving
them access to the browser's component
model and they wanted to do this without
introducing concepts that would be
foreign to the way the web platform
itself worked so we build polymer
primarily as our means to tinker with
these new specs to wrap them together in
various ways to invent new patterns to
anticipate how these specs might be used
in the future and at that point the only
people using polymer were us a handful
of Google teams and a little sprinkling
of some crazy brave souls
oh also comcast is the comcast team here
well which is clapping up for them for
taking an early risk
so the real promise of web components
though the real value of baking these
new capabilities directly into the
platform
it couldn't be realized until the
majority of users were on browsers that
natively supported web components so
this meant trying to help convince other
browser vendors of their value and
working with them to ship compatible
implementations we could make this case
on our own though this required
developers to broadly make the case
through real world web component usage
and actual tangible business results so
that was our cue and we decided to
transition the polymer project from a
small experiment to a full-blown
production grade library and this was to
unlock the power of web components in
the wild for everyone so polymer 1.0
attracted a lot of new friends and a
much larger community blue chip
companies like General Electric startups
like szimpla and platforms and web
component libraries like Baden
developers and communities all around
the world from Nigeria to Spain to India
and Indonesia developers everywhere
we're diving into web components
unfortunately our friends over at Safari
Firefox and edge and across web standard
bodies worked hard to hash out a new
take on the web components api's ones
that we could all agree upon and more
importantly ones that we could all ship
so let's take a look at where we were at
around this time last year before v1 of
the web component specs native web
components aport was varied and
scattered template was supported across
the board but other critical features
like shadow dom and custom elements they
were either behind a flag or entirely
unsupported but now the web component
specs have finally gelled with custom
elements and shadow dom v1 the journey
wasn't always smooth and it wasn't
always as fast as we'd hoped but we've
arrived at our destination I mean look
at that fall green yeah web components
are here
they're native on over 1 billion mobile
devices and everywhere else with
polyfills the web reaches farther to
more extremes of geography and network
conditions than any other technology and
now web components do too so we were
able to transition a polymer project yet
again to its next phase polymer 2.0 and
polymer 2.0 paid bounces technical debt
from the specs upgrading and unlocked
that really awesome future forward
technology today a lot of what you're
going to hear about at the summit a lot
of that is just capability as we
unlocked with the advancements of 2.0
major companies from all around the
world have continued to adopt web
components Nigeria's e-commerce giant's
Conda and Junia travel general
electric's industrial Internet of Things
platform predicts over 700 projects at
Google
India's Ola cab opposed a few you'll
hear from today like Netflix YouTube
Electronic Arts USA Today and szimpla as
a community we've grown web components
org to have over 1,000 high quality
open-source components in just over six
months I know many of the people who
helped us get there are here in the
audience so thank you so much because
web components eddore gets huge it sees
over 60,000 monthly active users that's
well over 1 million page views a month
and over the last six months we've also
seen work on supporting web components
happen across the web developer
ecosystem from libraries to frameworks
major frameworks like angular and ember
have made public commitments to web
components whether by giving talks on
Interop or by releasing glimmer j/s with
support for web components pre-act has
done some amazing work on making it
super easy to support web components and
tomorrow on this stage ionic will be
here to share how they've been embracing
web components as well so the first goal
of the polymer project was to get web
components up the mountain well here we
are at the summit so what's next
well we have this concept of a weirdness
budget on the team so a very scientific
measurement system but basically it
states that we can only be a certain
amount of weird both people we can be as
weird as we want like I could bring my
pet lizard Julie into the office and
teach them how to use the polymer CLI
and no one bats an eye at that but as a
project we have a budget and every
project has a weirdest budget because
you can only stretch things so far
outside the mainstream while still being
relatable and with web component support
growing in leaps and bounds
we're finally less weird when it comes
to the library itself you know super
native es6 classes but now we have the
opportunity to be less weird on another
big front in this next phase of the
project we can both embrace a lot of the
amazing work that's being done in the
broader web development ecosystem as a
platform growth and capability we can
also expand beyond just a singular view
of web components to a much more
practical place of building apps that
users will love and all of this if
thanks to polymer 2.0 web components v1
the growing support for other new
platform features and the expansion of
our community with this solid foundation
to grow upon we can more easily take
advantage of some major pieces of the
web platform and web community so I'm
extremely excited to announce that as of
today we will be joining the massive
sprawling JavaScript ecosystem of NPM
and we will be embracing the power of es
modules
this is a critical step in bringing web
components to the mainstream there is so
so much to say on this topic as you can
imagine and I want all of you to hear it
directly from one of the folks working
on the projects himself so in just a few
minutes fred shot from our awesome tool
team will share more information on how
we're approaching this why we decided to
do it now and how you can check out a
super early sneak preview yourself and
that will be the first of many awesome
talks over the next few days you'll hear
about using polymer with other
frameworks about building polymer
projects with web pack using polymer
with redux about not using polymer at
all and using other approaches for
building web components you'll hear
about how companies universities and
teams are using web components you'll
learn about how specs even come to be in
the first place not just how to use the
platform but what the platform is you'll
hear from polymer tech leads on what
they've been researching since launching
2.0 about all the collaboration that's
happening in the broader web component
ecosystem will cover VR SEO and
server-side rendering for web components
and of course we'll actually get our
hands dirty at the very end with some
live coding so I'll say it again
we have a packed schedule we're covering
a lot of bases and venturing into
territory we've never had the luxury of
exploring before and this summit
represents a major transformation for
the polymer project but as the polymer
project grows we're always going to be
sure to maintain our core values of
course to use the platform to take
advantage of powerful new features being
shipped in the web platform to minimize
abstraction to keep overhead down while
maintaining those developer ergonomics
that we all care so much about and
lastly to inform the platform
so we're cans in hand with browser
vendors to drive changes that push the
web platform fundamentally forward I'm
extremely proud of the work we've been
doing with polymer I'm ecstatic to see
how far we've all come together as part
of the web components community and I
couldn't be more excited for what's to
come next thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
