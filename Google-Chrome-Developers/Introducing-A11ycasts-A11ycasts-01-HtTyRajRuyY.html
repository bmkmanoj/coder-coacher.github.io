show on YouTube polycast you may have
noticed recently we've been doing a lot
of episodes on accessibility
accessibility is a crucially important
topic for anybody building components
because without it there are some users
who will be completely excluded from
your experience according to the World
Health Organization about 15% of the
world's population lives with some form
of disability and if it's that another
way we're talking about 1 billion people
worldwide so that's a huge audience that
may be missing out on your app and in
general we found that when you address
accessibility issues in your application
you tend to find just UX problems that
when fixed benefit all of your users so
for that reason I wanted to create a new
show here on our YouTube channel
dedicated specifically to accessibility
we're gonna call this show Ally casts or
ALM and why cast Alama why is shorthand
for accessibility so you start with the
a you've got 11 letters in between and
then wide at the end the goal of a ly
cast is to take this really important
topic and put it front and center so
that all developers can have a better
foundational understanding of how
accessibility works in the platform if
this sounds interesting to you and you'd
like to tune in then you can go click
that little subscribe button and catch
us back here later this week for the
very first episode of Alli cast as
always I'm Rob and thanks for watching
if you're excited and you want to learn
more a little white goodness check out
some of these other talks that we have
on the channel
