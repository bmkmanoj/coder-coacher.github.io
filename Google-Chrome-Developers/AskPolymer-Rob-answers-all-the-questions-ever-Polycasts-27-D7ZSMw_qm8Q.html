wanted to welcome you to this brand-new
segment we're doing in our show called
ask polymer every other week we're gonna
do this we're gonna have you send in
questions on a social network of your
choosing you got some sort of crazy ear
worms something you want to know about
polymer you're not quite sure about you
send those in you hashtag at askpolymer
and we will answer it alright question
number one comes from kenneth who writes
in and asks didn't you mention that
there would be a CD in for polymer or
something like that is that gonna be
rolling out anytime soon
now in the past we've we've actually
encouraged people not to use CD ends
with HTML imports because they would
have a hard time deduplicating their
dependencies if they're all coming from
different domains the D duping mechanism
can't really figure out you know where
there are copies of things but at the
recent polymer summit we showed off a
new project we've been working on called
the poly get addy Osmani did an entire
talk where he included polygit as one of
the segments in there showing how you
could use it in your projects the idea
with polygit is that it's actually kind
of our own magic server it uses the
github the raw github api is kind of a
CDN like thing so it's great for
experimenting not quite ready for
production though you don't want to be
taking polygit and using it in a real
project but if you're doing something
like a like a jsbin or a little sample
you just want to show something off our
prototype it's perfect for that and we
hope kind of in the long term that
probably it will eventually be
production already so that could be our
CDN solution down the line so thank you
kenneth for sending that question in
alright our next question comes from
Andrew who asks when will polymer and
angular play nice together so great
question Andrew this is actually
something you know a lot of people ask
they want to know about polymer and
angular polymer and react or you know
some other framework the main reason why
many of those frameworks have a hard
time working with polymer today is that
pretty much all of them predate web
components and so they're not quite sure
how to work with things like shadow
Dom's now once we have shadow DOM
shipping natively everywhere the story
actually gets a little bit better
because it hides and it sort of
encapsulates a lot of the things that's
the web components are doing behind the
scenes
the frameworks don't need to know about
it but right now we're still in this
little in-between place we've got
polyfills for shadow dom and that can
trip up some of these frameworks so when
we get native shadow dom everywhere
things be a lot better
also with something like you know
specifically for angular and angular 2
they've been rewriting their data
binding systems it'll work better with
the sort of events all new elements fire
and also be able to handle shadow Dom
better they've got a whole sort of
shadow dom renderer that they're working
on so thank you Andrew really great
question all right our next question
comes from Rory who asked what is your
favorite custom element alright this is
a pretty good question Thank You Rory
for sending that in my favorite custom
element is either iron localstorage or
iron Ajax which we just did an episode
on so you can actually go back and watch
the previous episode of polycast learn
all about how to use that element and
the reason why I like both of these is
because they're nice declarative data
providers so I can just sort of wire
them up in my application and then
persist some data or fetch some data and
I don't have to write like any
JavaScript to do that which I don't know
it just makes it a lot easier for me to
build apps so Thank You Rory really
great question our next question comes
from Andre who asks why did polymer
choose to use Bower as its package
manager and you know what about
something like NPM are there plans to
switch to that in the future so great
question Andre the reason why we
originally went with Bower is because it
gives you this nice flat dependency
structure when it installs everything
and that's really important for HTML
imports in p.m. on the other hand tends
to nest thing is and I can kind of
confuse the system now in NPM 3 they've
done a lot of work to improve on this
deduplication mechanism so now you can
get flat directories and NPM 3 but the
one thing that you can't do is conflict
resolution and that's actually really
important for us we want to make sure
that people aren't installing or you
know getting the wrong version of
something and getting some weird errors
so in a future version of NPM it sounds
like they're gonna fix that and at that
point we'll probably switch over to
using that as our package manager so
thank you Andre really great question
all right our last question comes from
David who asks Mozilla has recently said
that they're not going to implement HTML
imports instead preferring es6 modules
so what are your thoughts about
so great question David we actually
talked about this a little bit at the
polymer summit so you check that out
over here and basically the long and
short of it is muslin said that they're
not implementing them yet they didn't
say that they're never gonna implement
them and we've been doing a lot of work
on the loader spec recently which is
what under the hood both modules and
imports depend upon and what we'd like
to maybe see in the future is perhaps
both systems using the same mechanism
under the hood and then you can have
modules that's the imperative flavor you
can have imports as the declarative
flavor and developers could benefit from
so that is the long-term plan we're
gonna continue working with Mozilla on
that to see where we get so again thank
you David a really great question okay
thank you all who send in those
questions a lot of really great stuff we
didn't get to everything we're gonna try
to get to them in our future episodes so
be sure to click that little subscribe
button down there so you can get
notifications as those roll out if you
yourself have questions you can leave
them down in the comments or ping us on
a social network of your choosing at
hashtag ask polymer as always thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
