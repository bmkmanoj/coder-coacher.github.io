web is a standardized API for payments
this replaces the payment forms on a
site with a much simpler experience on
mobile devices so let's talk about
paying for things on the web this is a
longer talk so let me give you an idea
of what's coming up first we'll talk
about the user experience today and what
could be better we'll look at the
payment request API twice first to give
you the big picture then we'll dive into
the code finally you'll get the usual
resources in lab it's no surprise given
the rise of mobile computing that a
majority of commercial traffic is coming
from mobile devices what is surprising
is that 66% of that mobile commerce is
still happening on the web even when
people have native apps installed
unfortunately we also see a lot lower
conversion rate on mobile web relative
to desktop websites mobile conversions
are about one third of the desktop
conversions if you wonder why this is
the answer is pretty simple checking out
collecting payment from the user is
still rather messy people often give up
while filling the checkout form some
checkout forms have improved since the
beginning of web Commerce what hasn't
changed is you still have to manually
input the same information credit card
billing address and shipping address our
first step to solving this problem is
autofill because autofill works on
existing forms you don't have to modify
your site autofill just works to help
users check out faster autofill alone
increases conversion rates by 25%
autofill does a good job of identifying
form fields but it's not perfect if you
want an even better experience you can
have the autocomplete attribute to your
forms in this example we've annotated
the credit card portion of a form using
values such as CC name and CC number
autofill will know exactly where to
place its information if you want to
learn more about autocomplete attributes
search the web using what WG autofill to
find the specification autofill gets rid
of the manual nature of data entry and
makes it much simpler for the user
the current checkout experience presents
you with a form to fill out every time
for users though the ideal experience
would be that when it's time to buy they
just buy site should be able to focus on
creating an amazing and engaging
shopping experience without worrying
about optimizing a long checkout form
this is where the payment request API
comes in we're going to look at it first
from a user perspective and then look at
the code what if we could do away with
the form using web payments when it's
time to pay the user just pays payment
request is a simple JavaScript API that
helps the browser collect payment
information then it's a simple one tap
checkout for the user and an easy way
for a site to receive a payment with the
payment request API you can make the
whole process much faster and simpler
and since the browser is actually taking
care of collecting payment information
from the user we go from end taps to one
tap let's take a quick look at the code
flow here first the site initiates a
payment request in this request the
website passes to the browser the
parameters of the payment for example
how much is being charged and the
available forms of payment don't worry
about the details now we'll come back in
a few minutes and look at this in detail
the browser then determines the
intersection of payment methods from the
site and what the user has it then
presents a selection UI where the user
chooses their method of payment you get
the UI by calling show this displays a
native UI over the browser within this
UI the user can change how to pay the
delivery method and the delivery address
the payment method can be credit cards
or one of the apps that's installed on
their device such as Android pay and
finally the user taps on pay then the
browser requests a response from the
selected payment method this might be an
app on your device or going directly to
a payment provider the payment processor
verifies the request by examining its
details and then returns the response
directly to the server and the website
now has all the information it needs to
process the payment is this safe the API
is more secure than forum based payments
the new payments are based on modern
cryptography you don't need to enter
payment data that could be logged or
observed at the point of entry
autofill is safe from website access and
is typically stored an encrypted storage
on the hard drive to prevent disclosure
even when the OS is compromised payment
request is not just a chrome only API
the API is currently under development
in the w3c web payments working group
the goal is to create a universal cross
browser standard for any website to
accept any form of payment so to review
payment requests eliminates manual and
tedious entry by storing the user's
information securely in the browser the
browser passes addresses and credit card
details immediately and securely to the
site and since the browser is collecting
payment information from the user we go
from end taps to one tap you've seen how
payment request works for the user now
let's go over the code in more detail
first a quick review the site initiates
a payment request in this request the
website passes to the browser the
parameters of the payment including the
price and the payment methods accepted
the browser determines the intersection
of payment methods for the site and the
user and presents a selection UI payment
can be anything from a simple credit
card payment to a payment application
installed on the user's device the
browser requests a response from the
selected payment method and returns the
response directly to the merchant there
are multiple code samples for this on
Google Chrome github dot io let's start
writing some code step 1 is to tell
payment requests all the ways you can
get paid step 2 is to define the details
about the actual transaction cost items
currency shipping options and so on
here's an example of how you would
define shipping options notice the
selected bit you can include this if you
have multiple options the browser will
tell you which one the user selects step
3 is to define what information you want
the API to collect take the three data
structures you just created and pass
them to the payment request constructor
you often do this when the user
indicates they're ready to pay take the
request and call it show method this
returns a promise and opens the user
interface the UI shows the details of
the purchase and collects payment
information when the user approves the
prom
resolves with a payment response object
next you should check that the payment
is valid send the information to your
payment processor for processing the UI
will show a spinner while the request
takes place when a request comes back
call complete to close the UI the
complete method tells the user agent
that the user interaction is over the
payment response object contains
everything needed to submit a payment
for credit card payments the response is
standardized for non credit card
payments such as Android pay the
response will be documented by the
provider there's one loose end to tie up
what happens if the user changes their
shipping address or options this may
change the total cost and in some cases
may change the shipping options payment
requests can omit shipping address
change and shipping option change events
you should add event listeners for these
and update the payment details
accordingly the sample code will show
you how and that's it you can find a
full set of resource links on this final
slide you may have noticed I didn't
mention a lab we're just finishing it up
at the time of filming so check your lab
notebook for a complete ecommerce
