replacement for xml httprequest that
lays the foundation for progressive web
apps it includes much of the code you
had to write for yourself
handling redirection and error codes and
decoding the result like most new API s
fetch is built on promises this is a
much cleaner interface than using event
listeners and it simplifies error
handling fetch can be used with or
without service workers while the
Service Worker API is used fetch heavily
you can also use it for your own tasks
finally fetch supports cross-origin
resource sharing or cores we'll go into
the details in a few minutes let's look
at a simple example here we're fetching
a JSON file named example about JSON
decoding it and using the data fetch
returns a promise so we use then to wait
for a result once we have it result
includes a function for decoding the
JSON that also returns a promise so we
use then to wait for the decoder to
finish the final catch intercept any
errors that come up this is one of the
things that makes fetch so nice your
error handling is all in one place let's
talk a little more about handling errors
by default fetch doesn't throw an
exception if the server returns an error
but instead returns a normal response
the response dot okay property will be
true if the server returned 200 and
false otherwise you can always check
response status for the actual code in
this example we're throwing an exception
if the file can't be found this is the
best practice and you should make a
habit of checking response that okay
early now I promised to talk about
cross-origin resource sharing let's
start by looking at a problem it solves
assume your page is running from food
calm and you try to get something from
example.com
what's going to happen the browser has
strict rules about going outside your
domain to fetch resources so you'll
likely get an error it's not such as
fault the same thing can happen with XML
HTTP requests most developers resort to
hacks to get
this using json peer dynamic HTML blog
content but there's a better
standardized way called CORS CORS which
is short for cross-origin resource
sharing enables fetch to retrieve
resources from outside of your
applications origin so what's an origin
it's a combination of scheme host and
port HTTP www.h TTP port 80 and the host
is wwx ample comm if any of these things
change say from HTTP to HTTPS that's a
different origin the browser is in
charge of enforcing the same origin rule
and it provides a few loopholes
generally you can load scripts images
and other media files from a different
origin but if you try to load some XML
or JSON from another origin you'll get
an error unless the other origin gives
permission here's the course
implementation in a nutshell when the
browser makes a cross origin request it
adds a special origin header to the
request if the accepting server allows
the request it will add an access
control allow origin header to the
response the browser will note the
response and allow cross origin access
to this location if you have a
server-side application it's easy to add
access control allow origin to your
responses and get rid of hacks like json
p if the server doesn't support CORS
fetch will return an opaque response the
content is in there
but any attempt to read it cross origin
will throw an exception note that fetch
uses cores by default in this example
we're forcing it to disable cores just
for demonstration purposes why do this
imagine you have an iframe with the same
origin as the response you could pass
the response object to it and it can use
a result this becomes important when you
add offline support to an app and need
to cache responses from different
origins we've been using get but you can
use any HTTP verb here we're using the
head method to get the size of a
resource without actually loading the
resource itself the content link field
contains the size and bytes what if you
want to send some data you can use the
post method to send it this is an HTTP
request for the body so you need to
supplied that as body property remember
that you are responsible for encoding
the body properly and you should always
encrypt any sensitive user data we could
post a form easily using a form data
object just create a form data object
passing it a Dom node and the data is
ready to use this is much easier than
individually compiling key value pairs
you can also set custom headers for
fetch requests and you can set headers
for responses note that sending custom
headers with cross-origin requests will
cause your request to be preflighted
this means an options message will be
sent to the other server first and the
browser will check for access control
allow origin on return
also not all headers are modifiable some
are guarded such as origin and writing
will fail silently or with an error
depending on the header one last trick
for using headers if you don't always
know what type to expect for a request
you can look at the content type header
think of user-generated content or a
server that's in the process of
migrating from json p to straight json
here's one quick example to review the
fetch API this example gets an image
extracts the data and append it to the
Dom read responses blob and make image
node are functions that we wrote the
read responses blob function extracts
the data from the response but first it
throws an exception if the input
response is not in the 200 range we pass
that data to make image node this takes
the image data and packages it as an
image node to be added to the Dom here
we're using create object URL to
generate a data URL with the image and
setting it as the source attribute in an
image tag the old way to do this was to
pass a files URL to the source attribute
and then capture the load and error
events on the image tag the fetch based
version is much cleaner and simpler now
it's your turn go to the fetch API lab
and there you will practice making HTTP
calls working with responses using
custom headers and using cores good luck
one last thing if you're an instructor
this final slide links to more
information on fetch if you're a student
these links can be found in your
textbook you may want to use these while
you are working on the lab
