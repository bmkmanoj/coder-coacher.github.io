exciting topical payments left for this
afternoon I'm sorry but it's one of
these things that is a yeah I know
usually at a home actually when we have
the last panel I'd say you know look I'm
sorry for standing in the way of you
guys in the pub but we don't really have
the pub here so I'm story we're standing
in front of you guys and dinner but
there is decent beers so I suppose
that's okay and now I'm starting to
sound like an alcoholic Brit so sorry
sorry okay let's move on so and payments
are very very important and I've been
speaking a lot of with the w3c people a
lot of people that involve in
standardization and we all want to make
the web better and that's fantastic but
you know what one of the problems is is
the money needs to come from somewhere
we need the funding to do the cool
things that we want to do so
unfortunately this is just something
that we have to go and have a chat about
and you know if you're really into it
then great because there is a lot of
money to be made out of that so cool and
panel panelists we've got manis morning
on my left he sits in the w3c and the
IETF doing a lot of work round
standardization on payments right now
and co-founder or founders scuze me of
digital bizarre I'm Ricardo Ricardo from
telefonica recorded valera and head
honcho of the lluvia changed to mobile
work and did some stuff on whack before
then Ron Grimshaw managing director of
the Financial Times is sitting to my
right here so I'm known for FT's
pioneering payment models have a lot of
questions for you qumar macmillan rights
at the end there from Mozilla working on
a lot of things I'm sure you do a lot of
stuff with maz pay and Firefox
marketplace excellent and Cindy over
here does a lot of work in Google with
google wallet and the magic
requestautocomplete which I'm sure will
come up today so man who is speaking for
us today so I'm I'm driver of the slides
so yeah I get all the good jobs cool as
so take it away all right so um this
panel is kind of titled payments but i
think it's far deeper than that
you know I think when we think payments
we think you know getting payment from
customer to the vendor we don't think
about for example thirty percent of the
people in the united states that
currently don't have a bank account that
have no way of saving in other nations
it's even worse than that it's it can be
up to seventy percent of the population
that has no way of saving money putting
money aside for school for food things
of that nature so while we're talking
about web payments I think that there is
a far deeper and more important story
here and that is figuring out a way to
get the web to help people that can't
save money that don't live in countries
where putting money in a bank is a
feasible solution for them so okay so so
this isn't just about you know paying
for products well that's important for
all of us this is not just a first world
problem it's a problem for people all
around the world so asthma Tosh said I
and the w3c chair for the web payments
group right now I also deal quite a bit
with linked data microformats and I
could already FA json-ld things like
that and I also deal quite a bit with
identity and security both at the ITF
and the w3c and basically what that
means is I get to see a lot of different
technologies come by these these groups
and what we're trying to do is we're
trying to pick and choose which
technologies will probably be good
candidates for integrating into the core
of the web's architecture until now we
really haven't had a core way of
transferring value around the web right
i mean the thing that we look at to
spend money on the web right now are to
move money back and forth or things like
credit cards and ACH and that's just not
cool anymore we have to have a better
solution and so I spend a lot of time
kind of championing technologies a lot
of the technologies that our panelists
are working on currently so we've we've
got a problem
on the web right and that's sending and
receiving money is typically proprietary
it's very slow it's insecure and it is
actively hostile to innovation right
that's that's the reason that that we
don't have very many innovative
companies in the payment space you can
argue that we do and I hope that we do
get into that argument on this panel but
really when it comes to making money on
the web many of us make our jobs are
trying to or our jobs or such that we
get paid to work on the web but some
people don't have the benefit of working
for a large company like Google or
Microsoft that can you know cover their
expenses they would like to have a more
direct relationship with their customers
and right now content monetization on
the web is really hard it's really
expensive especially with if you're a
merchant you pay thousands of dollars in
fees just for the right to process
credit cards and the reason that is
partially is because a lot of the
payment tech that we use today on the
web was invented in the 70s right it's
the ACH automated Clearing House system
its credit cards all this stuff is
really really old legacy stuff that
predates the web by large degree so I
guess it would be good to kind of take a
look at some of the use cases that we're
trying to address right let's let's
ground this discussion payment for
physical goods today is actually a we do
a pretty decent job at it on the web
right I mean we've got like things like
Google Wallet and paypal that that you
can use to pay for goods we get the
goods everyone's kind of happy right but
when you look at the merchant side of
this creating a Martian account to be
able to process credit cards is very
expensive there are a lot of fees
attached to it even even when when you
have a really good merchant provider
payment provider it's still kind of its
it's an awful process for for folks that
are kind of mom and pop shops that try
to set up on the web you're usually
locked into a payment processor when you
pick them there is no such thing as data
portable
if there is like it's really kind of
terrible doing things like in-app
payments right now you're usually tied
to a particular app store of some kind
even they either the itunes store the
google play store things like that and
doing things like crowdfunding and crowd
loaning on yourself about or by yourself
you know instead of going through
kickstarter which takes ten percent of
the money that that you make you can't
do that right and these are these are
funny this is these are things that at
least some of us in the web payments
group thinks should be fundamental
rights not just in the US but around the
world you should be able to be in charge
of your own financial well-being so i
guess the the the the core here that
we're talking about at this panel is
three different categories of things
three different ways that we spend money
on the web three different ways of
raising money and the first one is kind
of the old money in the popular
proprietary category right this is most
of the payment services that we have
right now and this is absolutely not a
slam to any of the any of the companies
that are on this slide this is these
companies solve a very important problem
which is it really sucks to do
transactions over the web web using your
credit card and ACH so we've got paypal
amazon payments Google Wallet even the
new like poster children for like really
cool payment startups like stripes
square payment Walla in sites like
Kickstarter IndieGoGo and crowd tilts
these are all based on this really
horrible old legacy system right there
are tons and tons of problems that will
go into during during the discussion
today so that's that's kind of the first
category this is what what's kind of
popular right now the next category is
online app stores so these are other
types of kind of proprietary silos they
lock you in apple the Apple iTunes Store
the apple store facebook credits which
used to exist when these slides were
made but doesn't exist anymore they were
just shut down a couple of a little
while ago the Windows Store Google Play
these are all kind of examples of you
know stores that give really great kind
of user experiences but you're kind of
locked into them when you use them right
there's the idea of having this open app
marketplace has been talked about in
Lee for us I think Mozilla has been
doing some really great work in this
area of the making it so that you can
sell web apps from any website you don't
have to go through an app store of one
kind or another and so the final
category i think is is predominantly
what i'm really excited about right this
is what gives me hope and so the last
bit or these open web payment solutions
finally people are starting to work on
things that fit very nicely with the web
they don't try and shim the old 1970s
you know credit card architecture into
the web they are a new way of looking at
payments on the web where payments are
instantaneous there's a lot of rich
metadata that goes with it so Firefox OS
is doing a great job with their
marketplace stuff we have pace worm
which is the first Universal payment
standard for the web Bitcoin I'm sure
many of you have heard of Bitcoin how
many of you have heard of ripple Wow I
was just at a banking conference like
last week and like half the bankers
raise their hands so that's surprising
that like never happens so anyway ripple
was built by like the Bitcoin folks it's
kind of a better version of Bitcoin but
these are all really cool technologies
that are like native to the web that are
a really gonna shake things up I think
they're really going to finally bring
kind of payments into the modern age so
I guess the goal here what we're trying
to do is we're trying to integrate open
payment technology into the core
architecture of the web right we we did
this for communication with email emails
got protocols the reason that it's so
easy to type in a person's email address
and send a message halfway around the
world is there's a whole set of
protocols around it no such thing except
exists for payments on the web it's just
starting you know we've got kind of
Bitcoin ripple coming along but we
really need to work on it and that's
what we focus on at the web payments
group at the after what w3c most of the
panel members here are part of the web
payments group it's completely open we
really need developers to join so if
you're interested in any of the stuff
that you hear on the panel
today please join jump jump onto the
group and join if you just google web
payments w3c and if you want to talk
about this stuff pull me aside and
introduce yourself I love talking about
this stuff so so pleased at the party
after this pull me aside if you're
interested in any of the stuff that you
hear on the panel as well as the rest of
the panelists here so quickly in closing
there's a whole bunch of contact info
for you to get in touch if you're
interested in payments are interested in
actually taking part in this work
there's a lot of good that you can do
here right this is world changing stuff
Twitter G+ handle email in the slides
are posted up their pace 1.com / slides
so without further ado let's get into
the discussion fantastic so thank you
very much for that man you and with that
like you said will kick off with the
first question which comes from Aida
Edwards I believe you're reading out
this one oh actually can we just wait
for a mic yeah thanks so I have a
question from a certain and rubettes
topping up a prepay account with a
merchant to fund micropayments is free
money for the merchant why would they
kill the Golden Goose by moving to
instant micro payments so so I can jump
in yeah gopher III don't know if I quite
agree with the question meaning meaning
that i think it's it's short-sighted for
any merchant to think of it as any
anybody that's not large so like google
can think in that way google can say i'm
going to require someone to pre-fund an
account and then across all the Google
properties you can buy things right your
mom and pop webstore someone doing like
a niche site is never going to be able
to do that or if they're good if they're
going to do that they're going to lose
quite a bit of business because I guess
themeforest is a great example of this
they required to put in like five or ten
dollars what their themes cost a dollar
24 and you have to kind of be at least I
was when I when I bought one of the
themes often I was pretty desperate I
was really looking for a theme I was
under a deadline I was like fine here's
five bucks and
and a lot of my money is kind of sitting
there still right so I'm a bit ticked at
him for that right i wish i could have
just gone to the site spend a dollar 24
and gone somewhere else and i think that
is the model that we really should be
shooting for on the web you should be
able to go to a site just click a Buy
button don't you don't have to sign up
for an account you don't have to put in
your credit card information just click
by the browser takes care of the vast
majority of the payment for you right
it's easy its ease of use and I and I
think micropayments is is kind of a part
of that you don't want to be charging
people like two or three cents at a time
but the idea that you should be able to
do a dollar twenty five transaction I
don't think is is crazy I think we
should be able to do that on the web
does anybody feel any differently about
recording I was actually going to
comment one thing so first actually if I
could do a bit of a survey how many
people actually take payments on the web
how many people have a product that
actually takes payment kind of reduce
one and regarding the ripple question
how many people know Bitcoin for example
everybody know it's a good money good so
the thing that I was going to mention is
that one of the problems that we have
had with payments have been working in
payments for like years and when I got
in i work with mobile operators which if
they're good at something is basically I
taking your money as you gonna do so has
anybody never receive a charge from a
mobile operator the bill always gets
there right so and I thought that
actually we had our stuff better sorted
out that when I actually got there and
in payments the main problem is that
it's a domain-specific problem and it's
heavily regulated domain as well so for
example why would somebody want to
preload an account and then take your
money from there and actually make make
that charge of fees in that transaction
because there are different roles in
payments so when actually when a payment
occurs it hasn't really occurred it
occurs in different phases so when you
for example based something with a
credit card that money is not yet on the
merchant account that money has got to
go from bank to bank normally through a
serious if not only one clearing houses
and then that ends up in the other bank
so basically that means that that bank
hasn't actually got paid there's
actually a risk that that money never
gets paid and that is what normally they
serve ankles but depth so when you for
example prepay and
count what that merchant that acquired
in that case is actually trying to do is
reduce their about that problem they're
trying to say I've got the funds so I've
actually this transaction occurs I'm
going to automatically pay myself thank
you very much so that actually occurs
whenever two parties the new transaction
don't have trust in between them and
this is a concept that I suppose we'll
go back and back again in the panel
because payments is all about trust if I
actually email you and tell you could
you lend me 20 bucks and you actually
give me 20 bucks a that is actually a
transaction that has occurred I've
actually maybe I don't even have my
money but you promised me that you're
going to pay me 20 bucks then I get my
20 bucks at some point I may pay you
back or not you never know so that is
action electronic transaction and that
actually happens so the concept of you
paying me the concept of you
establishing my identity we are
receiving an email from me which by the
way is not something that you should
trust probably smtp is not the more
security thing in the world those things
are what actually happens in payments
and I think we are still don't have a
full solution to model or that
complexity technically in the web and
that's one of the problems we're trying
to deal with I think I actually Oh
Andrew that's 20 bucks so we'll see if
he does or does not get that money and
so we actually have a panel a question
from the floor sir alex sexton these are
they go over there guys hello uh full
disclosure stripe employee so uh oh
actually for the floor would you mind
just explaining what stripe is just in
cases stripe is a company that currently
does payments for the web so i think
we're in the first slide along with many
other companies so i think me and my
friends would all agree that stuff like
ripple and bitcoin is really cool and
totally this cool federated way of doing
payments but but the bootstrapping of
that system is the blocker I think right
so how do you get my parents to be able
to deal with Bitcoin you're talking
about I don't want to sign up for an
account I don't do any of this stuff I
just want to hit this button and money
changes hands and there aren't any of
these old systems so how do you rewire
people's
brains to make this much more
complicated system to them something
that that makes sense at all I think
that the short answer is is ease of use
right i mean that's that's that that is
the that is a killer app for all of
these payment technologies is the
ability to just go to any site click the
Buy Now button you know be shown
what your what going to buy and that's
it right and it doesn't matter if you're
using Google Wallet it doesn't matter if
you're using stripe or PayPal or
anything they're all speaking a fairly
similar payments protocol this is kind
of what pace warm that Universal payment
standard is designed to do the idea here
is that you're you're you have a common
payments protocol that all of the sites
use that's open non-proprietary w3c
standard and then you can choose right
you can pick and choose who's going to
process your payments for you if it's
going to be your bank or if it's going
to be Google wall or if it's going to be
paypal and then the merchant can choose
whoever they want to so I think that the
way that you bootstrap this stuff is one
through ease of use and then the the
second thing is you you have to you have
to somehow convince vendors that this is
worth doing and I think that's going to
be incredibly difficult to do if Google
Wallet mr. i paypal don't join join on
to the work right if they defeat if they
continue to the proprietary take one
more comment from robyn emily i do agree
with actually with the point of the
question I you know things like bitcoin
is such a just they're wonderful ideas
but you know these things only really
five if they're starting from scratch I
mean you know if you do it in a market
like a go somewhere like developing
countries like Kenya or whatever then
actually you can make something happen
very quickly so you've got a system like
m-pesa with 17 million users but most of
those people never had a bank account in
their lives so they just up cept it as
this is this is what it is for most of
the developed markets that we're dealing
with on a day-to-day basis as a you know
their merchant like like DFT and all
these people have got their money in
existing bank accounts stuck in this
1970s system and it's not going to come
out quickly so for me the
atiqul solutions are about yeah
mitigating that existing system and
making it to something which is at least
some way practical from web payments
point of view rather than thinking about
how we can start again through some some
of these ideas which are wonderful but
to some extent utopian you know from the
perspective of VO today's business just
quickly ripple ripples whole business
plan is to get being so we'll get ya
will come to ripple in the in the next
next couple of questions but interesting
to what Rob said I think one of the next
questions is going to make you touch on
those utopian you points a little bit so
Teddy conned I think has the next
question for us I'm here thank you so
this question kind of strikes close to
home because I worked in publishing and
media for good majority of my career and
I don't know if we'll have an answer to
it in this forum because it's a a topic
that has fundamental problems of his own
however I'll add a bit to it as well as
read the question what payment model is
the one that will will finally make
quote unquote old media profitable
enough online and how soon can we get to
that and furthermore do you know of any
media venues publishing houses they are
doing this correctly and are actually
profitable through through a payment
model online I think Rob this this kind
of hits in we've done it it's fine so
explain it to us robots are all about
well the the the sort of key thing is
actually to be bold enough to charge for
your product and actually the the world
is prepared to pay for for great content
and I think we've established that quite
successfully over the past five years
that we've really pursued this policy of
becoming a company that generates the
majority of its money from content
rather than advertising if you look at
FD coms finances right now we generate
you know in excess of seventy percent of
our revenues from content i
subscriptions the vast majority of that
paid digitally
through our subscriptions and that is
not an indication that we've lost all
our advertising revenue in fact our
advertising grew over the period of time
that we grew our subscriptions business
it's a sign that actually if you have
the right offering and you do work hard
on the payment side you can build a very
successful business around quality
content online fantastic we've got a
couple of cushions from the floor so umm
Ali if you want to raise your hand oh
a kind of off topic now because I wanted
to speak actually about the last topic
is it okay to go back to that or would
you rather continue moving forward I
guess what what I was thinking was we
mentioned like with the problem with a
more widespread adoption of Bitcoin
being ease of use and I just like I had
a gut reaction to disagree with that
because I think that a much bigger issue
with it especially among an older crowd
has to do with trust issues and you know
feeling that you know they can trust
these different sources and I was just
kind of what I wanted to bring up and
you know i'm wondering kind of how you
address that and how you make those
older people feel more comfortable with
these payment options we have please um
I'm not sure that they'll ever be
comfortable with them honestly I mean
look at the supermarket when you're
standing at the supermarket how many
older people use debit cards and how
many are still writing checks right so
it might be that that user behavior is
so divergent that they won't get there
um but that doesn't mean that we should
continue to push the envelope right like
I do believe that bitcoin is going to be
really challenging I do believe that
from a usability perspective even when I
read up on it and there's big warnings
keep your wallet offline I was like oh
you know like I'm a tech person right so
the lay person is going to read that one
line that's right on the Bitcoin website
and they're going to run they're going
to run as fast as they can so um so it's
a very this is a social issue as much as
it's a payments issue and it's a trust
issue so payments is at complex
ecosystem of a lot of different players
and trying to make everyone happy is
very challenging we do live in a period
where the price of gold is at an
all-time high mainly because people
don't trust currencies full stop you
know let alone new ideas like like
Bitcoin and this you know this is a
really difficult complex issue for
societies and economies as a whole which
people have been wrestling with for
hundreds of years and just kind of
introducing something new into
it's not something that happens in a
couple of months or a couple of years it
can take decades hundreds of years to
really establish a new currency properly
I'm also sorry was going to comment that
actually their payment is recently we've
been actually talking about how this
whole payments on the web thing should
really be a bit more we will some of us
think that it should be more like a
two-phase approach is essentially
there's no weapon technology to
basically do payments on the web at the
moment and there's also the whole
Bellator currency thing which at some
point may arrive and actually I think
there would be even government
initiatives do this because there's lots
of benefits about issuing currency that
is not physical but until that moment
happens basically that doesn't mean that
you cannot start with the first part of
it which is the okay how about we have
open technology to those payments on the
web because sometimes and we have that
thing in w3c where we basically go into
inventing problems that you cannot
really solve not even in the existing
system imagine on the new system so we
tried to first have a system and we
tried to add things like we're told
currencies on it so this goes into the
third question which came from actually
man who I believe this is one of the
questions that you originally also i'll
skip for you which it actually goes back
to the bitcoin and rippled quite
question which is do they fit into the
plan for web-based payments and should
they be included as a payment options or
should they remain on the periphery but
it seems like what record is talking
about now is they're already being
considered as as being wrapped into the
standards yeah and i really ask that
question because i was more interested
in the answer from the panelists right
and i was i was wanted to be a bit more
pointed with the question are there
definite plans to integrate alternative
currencies into product lines I google
wallet with Google Wallet ever consider
adding Bitcoin or ripple would you know
Mozilla consider putting a Bitcoin
wallet or just some kind of even a USD
wallet directly into the browser so that
when you get you know when you download
a browser you've got pre-loaded ten
dollars that you can spend online with
it you go to website you click buy now
and the payments made its instantaneous
yeah that's actually a quite interesting
question so like a man who said at the
beginning lots of us are involved in
this in this payment stuff and
regarded and I from the operator space
but Kumar mozilla have taken a little
bit of a different approach to this
where they have said you know we don't
care who the payment provider is right
we've just given you the option to pay
which is a very different stance in in
this space yeah I mean the thing with
bitcoin is you can already pay with
Bitcoin on the web you know there's
already web-based wallets and so I mean
Mozilla's Maas pay API which I think
you're referring to is just one of the
ways you could pay in Firefox OS it's
not the only way so any any any app in
Firefox OS can can take Bitcoin payments
they would just you know need the
JavaScript to do it they would need the
online wallet in order to do it so it
would just work but yeah as far as Maas
pay a lot of people are interested in
incorporating Bitcoin you know it's
already being asked by a lot of people
they want to see that as a way to buy
apps in the market place for sure
whether or not it'll happen I don't know
cuz it's it's it is tough there's a lot
of challenges and while we are at it
actually so that you get some of the
data that we wanted to get how many
people here actually owned Bitcoin of
any kind because I mean we're like the
geekiest of the geek somebody here
should have Bitcoin how many people have
actually done a transaction with Bitcoin
okay and how many people when they but
be kind actually when you mean you have
Bitcoin you bought it either in mont
God's or one of these basically a big
exchanges how many people are mon
actually okay then you use a smaller
exchange whoo okay things working how
many people have lost their wallet and
lost over over ten to fifteen dollars
there's the problem right there at least
with Bitcoin cool add me for some
questions to the floor I think Marcus
has got a question and at the front this
is quite a contentious topic so if you
guys want to vote on the on slide tool
that'll be great because it's a it's a
strange one we don't we'd like a little
bit more developer feedback on how
people are feeling about particular
payment methods so Marcus please okay
this one sorry simona started the
discussion
talking about people that don't have why
not in the old system so they're still
using real money so paper money so one
thing to note is like a little people
don't want to move to digital money even
if they now need to or if they had to
because I wanted to buy service how
would they enter this digital economy
you haven't really touched on that
mobile devices m-pesa is completely
mobile based mobile devices are
basically the way that a lot of people
in emerging nations are getting access
to the web and I mean they have they
have access to the largest communication
network that the fate that mankind has
ever known and if we build a financial
protocol into that that's huge right
yeah that's a really big thing you're
treating you're basically converting
telcos into banks hopefully it's going
to be telcos and the banks and companies
like Google and paypal everyone would
have a level playing field to
effectively be a financial institution
to these people okay and so that so that
we know for example in Europe there's
actually a green paper that has been
discussed at the moment the European
Union regarding what is the role of
actually telcos regarding the whole
payments industry this is to regulate
explicitly digital payments and one of
the things that would have full
consequences for telcos if it actually
ended up being through because the
moment that you're regulated as a
financial product then basically you
don't have a prepaid phone account you
have a value-added accounted delle cose
is storing which means you could go to a
shop and they should refund your money
and things like that so it has a lot of
implications regarding how do you handle
money there but also it also has a lot
of advantages so what in this I can
actually give one anecdote which is a
blue ear with the payments for different
basically the back end the different
stores connected with the payments with
Mozilla with the payments with Google
and one of the things happen in google
recently is that in the android store
what's up which is this famous IM
application recently decided to charge
for subscriptions and what's up only
what's up triplicated are transactions
during a period of time in spain because
people who had never entered their
credit card in Google Wallet decided to
pay with their mobile account because
they didn't want to enter the whole
Carrie car thing they just said okay
there's an option to actually pay with
my phone that was the first time they
saw the option pay with my phone
probably because it was the first time
that they actually paid and that thing
really launched the transactions up so
actually shows that that percentage of
population who probably was the only pay
transaction David did they actually use
them a lot phone so I mean I mean the
question is so the larger question
raised you know you mentioned some of
the implications there are tons of
legals implicit legal implications
around this you know how are you guys
can deal with that especially in that
small community group yeah right now
it's actually it's a bit of a gray area
because at the moment you for example
when you charge something to your phone
and then it gets into your bill and your
bill gets settled with your bank account
in reality the operator never got hold
of that money that money hasn't never
gone to the operator it actually only
settles when the bank pays me from your
bank account so in reality your money
has always been in your bank account
it's more like a bit wall ledger what we
are holding yeah but that's because that
seventy percent or so you take for
example a country this is a country like
Spain where people have got more league
contracts or UK there's countries like
Brazil or most of Latin America we're
actually there's three phone plums
basically there's prepay there's
postpaid the contract that you used to
and there's mixed up which is where I
pay viewing a period of time so I say I
pay five euros and I'm liking a contract
for a week that kind of thing so when
you're in those system most people are
prepaid on those markets by the way and
what they do is that they actually they
pay their bill on a shop they go to a
shop they get a coupon and they load
their phone so that that's most what
they use okay and yeah complicated like
a las vegas hotels so um we will go on
to the next question which I come up a
little bit already but Matt Morgan if
you're around and stick your hand it oh
there we go very easy hi I think part of
this question comes from our host Andrew
bets I'm going to personalize it a
little the basic question is what needs
to happen to make one click payment a
reality for everyone what I'd like you
to do is think of everyone really
broadly and include
food maybe organizations like libraries
and their readers for whom complete
confidentiality as a requirement okay so
um yeah the one-click payment thing is
quite interesting and it was one of the
things that i was quite blown away with
Google i/o this year and Cindy this is
something that you work on right yep so
I mean this is a common problem users go
to hundreds of different forms and fill
out the exact same information so that
was kind of the hypothesis between the
behind requestautocomplete which is the
new web standard initiative that chrome
is implementing and part of that
initiative I'm fortunate to be able to
be part of it because they are
integrating Google Wallet as a payment
option in addition to Chrome autofill
data but it's that concept that users
are filling out the same exact
information again and again and again
they don't necessarily want to hand it
over 250 different merchant websites so
why does not the browser as the
container hold that information for them
and provide it to the different merchant
websites on their behalf so now
requestautocomplete is obviously
dedicated to that true payments use case
it is providing the users information to
complete the transaction so in terms of
in a minute and a not pronounce turning
that it's um you know that that gets
challenging in payments period so that's
an interesting thread that I was
surprised hasn't kind of up sooner
because that is one of the biggest
changes between those 1970s technologies
and kind of what is coming out today
because there are tons of regulations
around payment companies and once you're
regulated you have to monitor for you
know depending on changes country by
country but there's
anti-money-laundering there's
initiatives that governments put in
place really for consumer safety that
with this anonymous new digital currency
you lose so that's the definitely the
identity thread is an interesting one
you will not be able to be anonymous
when you do a payment online it is going
to be highly highly highly unlikely your
government will not let that happen
unless unless you rise up and change it
but if we look at history that
doesn't happen so actually I have a I
have a quick question to go over and
talking about one kick payment will is
this fight something that Firefox OS or
Mozilla are looking at generally and
then what if a user decides to do the
two opt in to do not track and then
would that then how does that work oh
yeah no it's mean yeah one tap payments
are definitely something that that you
know Moz pay wants to support Firefox
marketplace wants to support it that
doesn't mean it'll work for everybody so
that's a really harder much harder
problem to solve amazon already does one
clip name click payments i mean it's
obviously very possible on the web it's
very easy to do i think in the short
term requestautocomplete is the best way
to get there i think that you know
that's just the reality of the web right
now is that every place you know takes a
credit card form and you know carrier
billing is a little bit more complicated
but with credit cards you can have
requests autocomplete securely store
your credit card number and it's two
clicks maybe but you could just tap the
button and say that yes fill in my
credit card and you're done and you know
that's going to be a big win for both
sides for consumers and for the
merchants because on mobile especially
it's really hard to enter in your credit
card and if you do it once on one site
and if you have to do it you know
infinite number of times for each other
side that's going to really suck and so
I I disagree partially I think you're
right in that it is and you were very
specific you said in the short term
that's probably going to be the best
solution quest I'll complete and I
totally agree with that but I think that
is and I don't think anyone on the panel
believes this but I think it would be
incredibly short-sighted for us to stop
there to say that this is the way it
should be for the next five or ten years
we really need to fix the whole like
credit card numbers given to every
single merchant you visit on the web
site or on the web issue right i mean
how many people in here would tell your
users I think you should use the exact
same password for every single financial
account that you have and whenever you
go to a website whenever you want to
spend money you give them your password
cam that's your credit card might jump
in and that's where the Google Wallet
integration with
request autocomplete especially on the
chrome side does close that hole because
we do use the virtual tokens so we do
protect that users true crime but its
proprietary good okay we probably should
take but we are open to integration with
other browser men okay we need to take
some we need to take some questions from
the floor and chen h edit le so I
somebody compulsion airmar and Mike
please so I guess this my question kind
of relates to the debate that countless
is going on but we've been talking about
responsiveness Lexie clients and it's
great we moved to a world where yeah
there is an open web standard for
payments but that's right now it's not
that it's very fragmented everyone's
trying to pitch a one you know one click
solution to payments you have you know
amazon you have stripe everyone's
putting a button on your page saying pay
with me and so now we're in the negative
for developers week you know our payment
form is just now cluttered with hey with
everything alright so it's really kind
of strategy for developers that in that
way that we're not you know cutting into
our margins because we're not you know
giving a user the payment that they want
he'll be kind of like balance that this
is a web intense I just I endorse that
comment because I mean you're referring
back to the last answer so many of these
solutions for one click payment are
essentially proprietary and when you
look at it from a merchant's point of
view what it amounts to is this sort of
small goods board of different payment
solutions that one by one you have to
kind of integrate with your with your
own systems and each one just delivers
like a tiny fraction of extra payments
and you know for a merchant like us
which is operating across borders I mean
we have subscribers in 150 countries
this is just a nightmare because many of
these solutions only work in one or two
or a select number of territories and
it's it's completely impractical you
know that we are so far away from a one
click solution which will operate
seamlessly around the globe for any
merchant really at the moment and that's
what that's what we really need to make
things work yeah I was going to talk
about something around the intense model
to be able to say I just want to pay and
then it's just your chosen payment
method come
through but this is very similar along
the lines of what facebook tried with
credits right and then they came up
against the foreign exchange problem
only one who's worked in the financial
markets or no it's just a complete
nightmare so yeah any other thoughts on
this topic yeah so I think Cindy and
Kumar probably never going to talk to me
again after this panel persuading
dangerous yes I know in a by the whole
tube so I I think the best thing that
web developers can do is put some
pressure and Google and in Mozilla in
paypal and stripe and tell them that you
want some kind of unified payment
mechanism that's non-proprietary on the
web I mean I think that I honestly think
that that is the best thing for the web
right now and I really in your heart of
hearts I think you you you agree right i
mean we mean everything everything you
touch down what i think is really
interesting what's really interesting
about that is Mozilla and Google are
browser vendors and I actually don't
think that we have a lot of leverage to
do this I think it needs to come from
James you didn't I was I was in dubai at
a banking conference with all the major
world bank's and they're absolutely
terrified of technology companies coming
in and stealing their customers you have
so much power to change this i I'm I'm
being apt you have so much power to
change this okay let's uh let's move
back to the questions from the floor
Steve and I hear if we can get another
might too yeah i guess it was really
just a question about what Manny said
that I I can't be anonymous on the web
in the physical world I can go and pay
with something cash and be completely
anonymous why would I want to give up I
mean why should I give up that anonymity
that I currently have in a physical
world it's a very good question you
shouldn't if you don't want to but i
think it's i mean you know we're dealing
with with i mean you know there's a lot
of information that's collected for on
us on the web if you don't want that
information collected on you don't get
on the web I mean you know we've got
we've got issues with prism the NSA we
know how easy it is to tap this stuff
it's very easy to track it even Bitcoin
which is supposed to be this pseudo
anonymous protocol people have been able
to track down
you know spending habits who's spending
money so for example if someone steals
your bitcoin wallet that money can't
ever be used really because if it's used
then and it's in its track down to a
shipping address then they can find you
right you report your wallet is stolen
and any money coming out of that wallet
can be tracked to the person that that
made of any kind of physical purchase
but this brings me back to the whole Do
Not Track thing I'm still really quite
interested to know about how this would
work with a maza pay system on Firefox
OS because they're pushing so much for
that and I wait for the most pay one if
I cannot only one thing today's the
problem as we were saying before is
basically the whole payments is based on
risk and trust and in this case what
you're saying what you're doing in a
financial transaction in cash with
somebody is that they issuer the person
who's generating the fans AKA you is
making a transaction with a merchant
which is at the same time they are
quieter this person and this transaction
occurs on something that we both trust
AKA government money because we both
think that that is actually valuable
money so this transaction has occurred
between us you actually gave away your
identity you gave away your identity to
this person who actually can recognize
you and he thought that this was enough
to establish trust so that's why they
accepted your money in the digital world
the problem is that this person is a
server down there and you are a browser
somewhere down here and that trust has
got to be established between you two
before those funds get changed from your
bank to their bank and that's kind of
the problem is that at that moment the
issuer that other person that acquire is
going to only trust something and in
general like Google will perfectly trust
your Google Wallet account paypal will
perfectly trust your paypal account and
Mozilla will trust whichever account you
actually have got to be configured in
mostly but Google won't accept your
paypal identity has been a valid
identity that is where the problem comes
because they don't establish trust based
on the other identity we probably should
actually before it so Tom see if you've
oh ok good there we go thanks i think if
we if i can distinguish between
anonymity and confidentiality somebody's
coming to the library to pay
a 25-cent fine for an overdue book and
we don't want anybody to know we know
who that person is because we know you
checked out the book but I don't want
anybody else to know that you paid a
fine on it is there a way I can do that
online for 25 cents no no yes I mean not
yet I well I think there is right if you
use bit going to do it and it's a and
you create a one-off wallet you could do
that payment but I mean that's really
it's it's very difficult to do that
technically possible not very feasible
which i think is the answer is is the
answer they were giving it's not very
it's not a good user experience oh sorry
Bob you some of the stuff is not about
the technology that I think governments
around the globe are attacking and
anonymity in the financial system on all
fronts for issues of Taxation money
laundering etc and I don't think that
effort is going to stop and as we you
know as we move into an electronics
payments world I don't think they're
going to allow big channels of an online
mom's payments whether it's technically
possible or not all right we should move
on now I'm liking what people are
managing to cattlemen we have money bags
and Scrooge McDuck this is assisted a
human am I is creating adult brilliant
and that's fantastic see the things I
kind of wish that was the case
unfortunately not so Matt's Andrews have
you stick up your hand for the next
question please this is another
anonymous question I think it's probably
been done to death but here we go what
are the possibilities for decentralized
peer-to-peer payments and what security
considerations are involved in doing
this so decentralized peer-to-peer
payments and what security
considerations are involved in doing
this going back to a similar thing Kumar
do you want to start us off on them sure
I think well I've been sort of in the
realm of Firefox OS which is a mobile
operating system and its really hard on
mobile devices to do something to get to
a decentralized place like that we would
need like a the web crypto API to land
so that we can make sure that things are
very secure and even in memory or secure
and there's there's some ape and another
API which is coming is to access a
secure element on certain sim cards
where you can actually do you know sort
of public key exchange type of things
all those technologies are needed but at
the end of the day you could still root
a device you know if you if you were to
steal it and then you can get access to
a lot of things so I think I think we're
pretty far off but i think there's
that's what would need to happen it
would have to be something that's you
know it have to be this bulletproof
device because you know also if it's
completely decentralized that means that
your pain with a device and let's say
it's Bitcoin or something and it's not
backed up on a server because it's
decentralized you might lose that device
and then you lose all your money and
maybe there's some way to distribute
that across many nodes I don't know but
yeah hard problem it's sort of against
the cloud pattern that seems to be
happening with lots of things I guess
any other points on that um well I mean
you can you can aren't there already
decentralized peer-to-peer payment
systems on the web Bitcoin and ripple
ripple or two of them you can use them
there they're online wallet so you have
to be able to get to some website to run
the transaction but the protocols work
right i mean the bitcoins been under
attack since it ever came out and and by
really smart people in crypto in
security areas and no one's really
broken the protocol so i think they're
they're here it's just the idea of it
being integrated directly into the
browser is is probably i would expect
that I would never happen right or at
least not for the next 10 to 15 years
because the risk you run when you put it
into a browser is you have to end up
supporting it forever and I don't think
any of the browser and I don't think it
would be smart for any of the browser
vendors to build that technology in
right now which is why you know the
Firefox marketplace and Telefonica are
taking the approach they are on these
api's they're trying to be very generic
and not trying to be king makers when it
when it comes to payment technologies
it's the right way to do it
fantastic let's take another question so
Adam sonntag if you're in the room we
put up I think he's over so this is an
anonymous question that at the request
of Jake Archibald I have mildly
reformatted into rhyming verse so one
question that still needs distilling is
what's the feasibility of operator
billing and given that cell phone phones
prefer why fight you sell well I have to
forget this network to buy and sell very
impulsive by the way so my skill is not
enough to actually answer you
embarrassed I'm afraid but definitely I
mean operator billing is something that
is widely used now we are also in the
middle of for people who are not
familiar with in the middle of a change
of technology so we went from premium
SMS which is essentially I charging you
for an SMS message very clunky had lots
of messages a really high revenue share
for the operator because it was a really
old technology used to sell ringtones
and things like that so not as good to
direct operator billing which is
essentially you make a call to an API
which is more 24 hello for 21st century
and basically you send me an amount and
in phone number and the phone number
acts is basically the user account that
is working now it's actually you can pay
with that in Google you campaign rim in
nokia in blue via work with we work with
at least 20 something different
providers they including mozilla and
basically that is what modern operator
billing is about the problem that I see
modern operator billing is that mother
operator billing was operator billing
was thought to be something that you
negotiate with an operator so you
negotiate without to then you go and
negotiate with Vodafone then you go and
negotiate with Telefonica and the
problem there is that you have to close
one account for each of these things so
one of the things that we actually try
to stop with Bolivia is to give to the
telefonica group just one connection for
all those Billings so do what visa does
in the case of banks where you basically
take Visa payments right you don't take
no it's not West Barclays and whatnot
no what payments you take payments from
a network so i think that is the step
that we have missing but actually you
can do charges to a phone number now
with all the technology one of the
problems is those this issue of being
over Wi-Fi is that you can't an operator
cannot recognize you as a user if you're
right if you want a Wi-Fi network
correct you only need to know what's the
phone number of the user and that can
happen in a one-time transaction which
is for example how Google does it is how
Mozilla does it basically if you are
operators have multiple ways of
recognizing what phone number you're in
first start you're connected to a base
station so we if you are giving you
service we know your number so if
there's if you're connected to the
normal network you can identify the user
through the network if they're connected
in Wi-Fi then you do a fall back to SMS
which normally is either you send an SMS
to the device with a code or you make
the device send you an SMS and then you
receive it in both cases you establish
what is the number of the user and then
you can just use that again and again we
have a specific API built for this in
blue via in other operators you have to
do it more manually but you can do that
and to be clear you can do it again and
again because it just stores a cookie on
device I mean the cookie last 30 days or
something like that and when you're on
Wi-Fi it reads the cookie so it knows
that you're authenticated ok so I'm and
so can I be Montgomery burns please this
time yeah awesome um it's getting better
right and we only have five minutes left
so I'd kind of want to close on a we
have a room of technologists here and
and I'd like to I'd like to focus on a
little bit of the standards a little bit
of the what we can do so if we just go
around and have a little bit of a chat
but well if you could all say give one
minute on what we could do as developers
to push to the ideal payment solution
and kumar's I'm afraid I'm going to
start with you sure as developers all
standardizes yeah that's a tricky one I
i do think as I mentioned before I think
to really have a sort of federated
payment system where anyone can pay with
any currency and any merchant can accept
money from anywhere I think something
needs to come some API needs
to be agreed upon and implemented by
banks or something maybe a clearinghouse
in front of banks and I don't think that
browser vendors can do that so I have
strayed from the topic of what
developers can do I still don't know
what developers so recording well I
think that for a start we have to have
more realistic expectations I think in
all of this I think there's judging from
the word that we didn't work where you
try to do a mobile billing in this case
for 40-something operators across the
globe and this includes Asia and Africa
and Latin America there's no way you can
sync all of those things is too big a
problem however you can start in a
smaller area so it takes something like
the European Union the European Union is
about to standardize on a series of
measures called sepa you could do in
theory some hub for the european union
with a specific protocol that works
across all the providers in the european
union obviously won't work in latin
america it won't work in china but it's
something so we start trying to
standardize there and we try to push for
a standard API or standard way that
different providers can implement that
there which is how it normally happens
banks didn't go and try to standardize
on this type of thing worldwide they
standardized in the European Union more
or less and then let's see how it
extends or you do two networks and then
we talk a common protocol among our
networks that would be fine the thing is
that you need those initial solutions to
be there so requestautocomplete or must
pay our initial tries of getting to that
standard API just use them feedback to
them into saying I'm lacking these
things require to complete design super
carrier billing must pay we're going to
do another iteration now which
everything that we have just feed back
to that and start with that smaller goal
before we get to the bigger goal I'm
actually very excited about some of the
things that Ricardo is talking about I
believe fundamentally that the solutions
are going to be mobile-based ultimately
you know there were almost at the point
where the more mobile devices than
people on the planet there are far more
people with mobiles and there are with
bank accounts for example and if some of
the things that Ricardo is talking about
I the development of a network and
a sort of global standard network for
payments across major mobile operators
can develop then I can see how a
merchant like us can take payments on
mobile devices potentially from a
marketplace of billions of people around
the globe and that's very very exciting
and if you think about it what you've
got there is a chain all these devices
in some way are linked up to a source of
value whether that's a bank account or
whether that's a prepay or whatever that
the chain of value is already there if
you can create the the standard across
the top of it may be starting the EU or
the US or whatever which then a merchant
like us can then hook into that can
deliver the solution and and I don't
think you have to think about utopian
scenarios in order to get there it's not
difficult to see how this this step can
be taken yet so from my point of view I
think that's a important issue lots of
people lots of users think about what
would be great for the users and I think
the way that you're going to get the
thing that you want as a user is to
influence from a merchant standpoint or
from the bank standpoint or from the
standardization standpoint and that's my
takeaway is that okay if you want your
use of goals you go for it you put a
slant on it and sell it up to those
other people that makes them think that
they're getting something when you're
actually getting something and that's
the way to get what you want and so hard
lifestyle tips and Manny go for it so
anybody in here that's interested in
payments the thing that you could do is
join the web payments group join the
discussion it's completely open anyone
can join and participate educate
yourself about it and help us actually
figure out what standards to build right
what to build it that that you can you
can use the other point I wanted to kind
of make is playing off of kumar's you
know a bank bank based thing I did spend
the last week at the world banking
conference and Dubai no Bank is working
on this I guarantee like I had high
level high level low level all kinds of
discussions with them the standard bank
system is written in COBOL or Fortran it
was implemented in 1987 not tended to
1992 they're still running that code
base they are absolutely mortified
of doing any kind of large change to
their system so this solution is not
going to come from the banks it could
come from the mobile operators it could
come from the the people like Google
Wallet paypal stripe but at some point
all of us are going to have to band
together in some kind of clump and push
something for it's definitely not going
to be the banks that do that though all
right so throw yourself into the
standardization and finally Cindy real
quick because I know everyone's ready to
be done so no just really use Mose pay
use requestautocomplete even though it
is technology from the 70s it is what
everyone is still using and there's
plenty of room to improve that 70's
technology experience on the web as we
try and lay a foundation and segue into
more you know different technologies but
definitely requestautocomplete Mose pay
participate we are trying to make it
better ok excellent so that's all stone
thank you so much the panelists and so
