know Monica mentioned earlier we were
asking some you to tweet questions at a
hashtag ask polymer summit so please do
that if you have questions we've also
got microphones set up there and there
I'm gonna invite my panelists on stage
please welcome Justin a software
engineer on the polymer team got windy a
product manager on the polymer team
scalar product manager on the polymer
team monica software engineer on the
former team steve orrible software
engineer on the product team and Matt
McNulty director of Chrome please give
them a hand
oh I understand some good Twitter
questions in here um all right so and
remember if you have questions please
just like come up and you know line up
at the microphone or something like that
we will start with a Twitter question
though this is from we've got a few of
these that are all kind of related which
is basically you know Alex just gave a
good talk on the importance of HTML
imports a lot of folks are wondering
you've got it seems like there's
disagreement across different browsers
about implementing HTML imports and we
also have this question of you know HTML
imports or es6 modules like where are
these things going so yeah like could
could could you all maybe address
perhaps these two issues like like where
we're imports headed and also you know
how do we kind of reconcile that with
with modules what's the dive in on that
yes I didn't I can start I mentioned
this a little bit off the top yesterday
but yeah look like Rob said all the web
component specs are well on their way
already being implanted browsers except
HTML imports is still kind of on the
fence it's on hold as what many other
browsers saying it is implemented in
Chrome but it's on hold on many of the
other browsers and really that's just
because we're waiting for the es6
modules to land in browsers and to be
implemented and it's actually kind of a
funny story of the way this happened as
es6 modules are landed at all the
browsers figure okay you know the specs
are pretty far along they'll be here any
minute and then we can kind of weight on
how we decide to actually if went HTML
imports maybe take advantage of the same
loader that es6 modules use so we'll
wait for your six monitors to land turns
out like these specs tend to sometimes
do take a little bit longer to actually
settle into place with the a6 modules
and so as the es6 module discussion was
happening at least in conversation that
we've been having across browser vendors
the there's been more attention focus
now back on HTML imports particularly as
a performance printed primitive because
it with es6 modules you're blocking on
JavaScript with HTML imports you get to
take advantage like like like Alex was
saying of all these great built-in
platform browser optimizations to do
background parsing of HTML to queue up
the all the requests in an efficient way
and so actually we've been seeing that
HTML imports could be a performance
one thing we're really optimistic about
is as es6 modules are starting to kind
of come together there is a great
opportunity to really marry HTML import
mechanism at least loading HTML HTML
that idea with es6 modules particular
potentially even something along the
lines of HCL HTML module that would
interoperate perfectly with es6 modules
so we've seen some experiments in this
space and and we're really excited about
it so roughly I think it's fair to say
that everyone is generally on board with
the idea of the need for a primitive to
load HTML with HTML the question is just
how does it interface with the six
modules and we've got some pretty good
ideas around that cool all right it
looks like we have an audience question
now really quick for all audience
questions I'm going to ask one favor of
you which is to please be considerate of
the people who might want to ask a
question also so please know like I have
a multi-part question part 1 a of 7 it's
not questions having said that ok sir
yes you there my name is Dylan I worked
for best buy canada we're currently
considering polymer we were wondering if
you had any advice for transitioning
your large applications in the past into
modular components I'm just going to
repeat the question really quick so do
you all have any advice for
transitioning your you know large
existing application over to using
something like polymer I'll take that
one we've seen customers do this before
where they have inside Google we have
like I don't know at least a dozen
different frameworks that people use and
when they start using polymer sometimes
they work from the leaves up and they'll
say like oh I want to use the awesome
material design components because they
need to be you know material design
compliant and they keep working up from
the leaves using buttons and inputs and
stuff and then they're like oh then I
have this thing that uses a button and
input now I make it polymer and
eventually they just they don't stop and
they go all the way to the top
so I think you know when you get
interrupt between whatever framework you
have and web components that's a good
way to go I think the bottom up and not
stopping idea also kind of applies to a
lot of products that we've been shipping
recently is the polymer team so
particularly things like the polymer app
tool box and the shop demo we've got a
few exciting demos that are similar to
the shop app on their way and the idea
is it's a really great place to start
the polymer seal I can download it as a
template it builds right out of the box
you've got a progressive web app in one
command which is great for prototyping
and for having something up quickly
within a day within two days three days
to you know show and executive and
really convince them that this is a
great experience we can actually achieve
and similarly we're seeing some people
start there and then just kind of
continue with that template until it
becomes the full application so similar
idea starting with what we've got as a
starter template and then expanding from
there and with things like the purple
pattern really there scalability becomes
kind of by default because purple is so
there's so much emphasis on lazy loading
as you add pages to the application
there's no impact on that first load if
you're if you're constructing
application with the probable pattern
with these templates that are built that
way by default so I encourage you also
to kind of start in a prototype phase
maybe with a new bottom-up app and then
see how far you can get all right I this
is a fun question I would like to make
the panel score him a little bit when
will polymer to be released as
production ready I can take that one so
first officers we have this plan it was
well thought out for the last 12 minutes
to bring the 360 view via our camera
thing on stage we're going to give it
its own spot and we're gonna call it
blinky and we're gonna throw all the
hard questions do it no last minute it
didn't work out so we came up here I
think the plan is you know roughly
around january to have that come out
with the elements everything's you know
it'll come out when it's ready but you
know we'd had a stretch goal to try and
get it done for the summit that was sort
of know and tongue-in-cheek I didn't
want to tell Steve until kind of late
until they've really started getting
stressed out but yeah the idea would be
the next couple of months the holidays
add look at least
they're month to that so that's the
point this one more thing to add is that
so I mean just we are in preview mode
now and I mean I think we were in Palmer
one we got to a phase of polymer when's
development where it became hard to
change things because of the need to not
break people and you know based on your
feedback on the preview we're sort of in
a nice period where we're still trying
to maintain backward compatibility with
Palmer one but we have a little bit more
wiggle room now so I mean I encourage
you to please play with bomb or two and
give us feedback because it'll help us
make it the best we can so if steve was
like a little bit more devious you would
have realized that he could say
something right now on camera about when
it comes out that's much less ambitious
computer near you absolutely as soon as
possible you could be a manager okay so
I got another question this is one we
get a lot I would say this is like this
is like sixty percent of all questions
or this question what about using
polymer with insert framework here okay
yeah angular whatever what about using
polymer with other other frameworks Rob
to learn I don't know what I I'm good I
think we have to throw that one to
blinky oh wait yes well yeah yeah yeah I
listened to Taylor's keynote yesterday
and what he told me was you don't have
to throw out your your framework that's
right because polymer is based on
standards it will work with your
framework that's right yes thank and
yeah and maybe he can add more yes so
yeah we do get expression that a lot of
it all the time this is you know one of
the big promises of web components by
having this web standard way to build a
component frameworks don't necessarily
have to bring along a totally custom
model to be able to get things like CSS
encapsulation like Tom encapsulation so
with polymer to particularly where all
the things we've been doing to make it
more interoperable to strip away all of
the polymer specific idiomatic things
that you had to knew that broke through
that that layer so that a polymer to
element is truly a custom element it
going to be a lot lot easier to
interface polymer two elements with
existing frameworks on the framework
side as well more and more frameworks
have been evolving and shifting slightly
to better support web components and
custom elements and I think we'll
continue to see that in the near future
from some of the big frameworks and also
already there are existing kind of
couplers that make it really easy to use
framework X with polymer element or
framework X with web component the
bottom team was up here they mentioned
their angular adapter highly encourage
you to check that out that makes it
pretty seamless to work with polymer
elements inside of an angular
application so a lot of solutions that
already exist polymers making it easier
for an opportunity to happen frameworks
are making it easier I think this will
be the continued arc of web components
towards kind of seamless
interoperability so we're on our way
there okay good and reminder again we
have these microphones if you do want to
get up and ask questions don't be shy
all right another question we have is I
you know we heard from a number we had
partners here we heard from a number of
those partners that they run into
situations where they had too many
components um you know so uh is having
you know a my app element still a viable
approach when is the right time to
create a component sorry that's a bit of
a few questions I'll jam together there
but sure well yes sure I can handle that
I guess um so I think this is a hard
question to answer because as with many
things there's not really one size fits
all I think it's perfectly fine to have
one element that defines your
application you know if you're using the
purple pattern and development you know
delivering a small bundle that's going
to write down down the bundle for that
is going to download and render quickly
the resources so that's pretty
straightforward I think in my talk I
emphasized that you know focusing on you
know very specific you know high
frequency elements that you want to make
as fast as you possibly can you know
having reasonable goes for those and
being careful in those elements and
actually got some feedback which was
that the thing i was saying do lesson be
lazy it's not actually sounded really
hard and so one thing I can say about
that is that because we're using web
components the good news is that the
hard work that anyone does is something
that all of us can leverage so I mean
that seems potentially good to me so as
long as someone figures out how to make
a think fast we can all benefit from it
and then I think you know there's a lot
of really specific questions that go
with the kind of have to be answered in
the context of your application but from
a performance perspective I think you
know just keeping in mind that the sort
of the cost of the element should match
the task that you're trying to have it
to you so you know where you need to
make a lot of things make them as cheap
as you can so one thing you can think
about it is that creating a custom
element isn't free you've got to like a
tiny little bit of cost with every
custom element did you have so if you're
going to just make a custom element to
wrap a span that's not really worth it
you could just put a class on that span
especially you're going to repeat that
span a lot on the page but if it's like
a little bit of like a sizable amount of
Dom that it's hard to style and copy
pasting it in different places in your
app is kind of really annoying that's a
good place to put a custom element in
there luckily we never said like
everything is an element or anything
like that so we didn't encourage the
wrong way yeah yeah we never made any
dumb we'd never did that um all right we
have a question back here sir this isn't
exactly a polymer question but its
future centric and relates to our stuff
that we do what's with web assembly when
does that arrive in the real world and
what goodies do we can we expect from
that maybe perhaps related to web
components and polymer I'm scanning the
room for v eight people there's one
right behind us Adam me over here right
next um I don't think we really know up
here no web assembly doesn't impact web
components that much I mean I don't
think it really has direct access to the
Dom right now so if you're writing a
game yeah but you found us he found his
person he's hunting him down there in
the back corner yeah standing up yeah
hmm I'm gonna move on uh this is a good
question because I see a lot people they
ping me and they're like I want to make
a thing like paper input opening
as I've been doing a lot of
accessibility work lately I've realized
hmmm input gives you a lot in terms of
accessibility and things like that so
the question though is how do you
leverage semantics when you're writing a
component so for instance if you are
trying to write something like input you
and there are reasons to perhaps you
know wrap some these components so how
do I leverage existing semantics inside
of a custom element that I am creating
and I think that might be a good
question for Monica um why do you mean
exactly by leveraging existing semantics
if you were to redo something like paper
input how might you go about doing that
paper input in particular is enormous
it's like a Hydra with 17 heads so it
should be 17 sub elements instead what
paper input does because it wraps an
input in its shadow Dom it has to
channel all of the properties that you
could set on an input and sort of expose
them to the paper input itself so we
have a behavior for that which basically
defines every single property that input
has as a property the paper input can
have which isn't great but if that's the
thing that you want to do I you can do
that the reason why I'm saying paper
input shouldn't be like it is is because
it should be something like paper text
input and paper number input and it
could only have like three or four of
these existing properties that it needs
to pass down to the input i don't know
if that's answering your question sounds
yeah we also try to this is sort of
tangential but we try to mimic in our
custom elements what the platform
chooses to do so paper check box has a
lot of the semantics that input type
equals check box has for example it
doesn't look like input type equals
check box it has a completely like it's
called paper check box but it has the
same sort of it has a checked attribute
it has a fairly quirky value where it's
on or empty because that's what the
input I people check box element does
and ideally we'd like you that you could
replace wherever you're using input I
people check box with a paper check box
and have the same semantics without you
being freaked out about that yeah and
that's honestly I feel like it's one of
those things a lot of developers
overlook is semantics especially how
they relate to accessibility this is
about it a lot of people are like well
you know I don't even know if I have any
that need this there's about a billion
people worldwide that have some form of
disability and so if you are creating a
a widget that already has an existing
analog in the platform you really need
to make sure that you are adding back in
all of those semantics and the proper
accessibility and keyboard support and
stuff like that if you're not going to
be using that existing platform element
which is why for instance I often tell
people just use button okay like button
actually it seems so simple it does a
lot for you and there's a lot of stuff
you probably don't want to add in but
you're going to have to do if you if you
need to turn that into a custom element
you totally can do it and my friend Eric
bidelman has done a talk at a the PWA
dev summit on exactly how to do that
which is a great talk you should all go
check out but remember the platform is
trying to help you here and give you a
lot of stuff so when we say use the
platform it also means just you know
leveraging vanilla HTML where you can as
one more thing yes sorry just real quick
so I just want to come back quickly to
the loss of is in v1 custom elements I
just want to get back to that because
this is one way you could in the v0
custom elements leverage exist at you
know semantics here and and doing it
yourself with implementing all this
accessibility up yourself as hard so I
mean we on the team basically really
like this idea of is and it's still in
the spec and it's probably going to be
implemented in chrome and we're arguing
for it it may evolve one kind of one of
these things this is why we're not
really recommend using it going forward
for now is because the support may
evolve I think there's general agreement
my sense is there general general
agreement this is incredibly valuable to
be able to leverage these capabilities
but the exact way that it happens is
tricky and there's some nasty things
about is like the you know we actually
engage then directly with the old legacy
built-in elements like input and like
input uses a shadow root and you know
therefore you can't add your own there's
a lot of tricky stuff there so I mean
this is a little bit of it there's still
I think a little bit of a growing pain
hear that hopefully it will evolve
relatively quickly well five for the
people to get is back don't so we have
two questions but I'm going to hold you
for just a second because this question
is one that we get asked this is
probably the second most other question
I really want you all on stage to answer
this how does SEO work
elements and shadow Dom content be seen
by a search engine you actually answered
one of the audience questions nice uh
yes so do get this question a lot not I
yes sure yes is the answer the short
answer is SEO with polymer web
components is absolutely different than
any other front-end JavaScript based
framework that you work with period
right now no web crawler that I know of
actually natively supports shadow Dom so
it's not even a question of actual
shadow roots you need for a web crawler
to see your page you need to include the
polyfill anyway so it's right now it's
irrelevant and now that web components
are in the spec I highly highly expect
that anyone who might build a web
crawler for search would very likely
probably look inside the shadow roots as
it's part of that HTML spec and
something that's gonna be use cross
browser well I think that the most
important thing to acknowledge here is
that like callers run JavaScript right
like I don't know if everybody knows
that but you know the crawler will
render your page internally as it goes
and yeah blog post on the Google
webmasters vlog I don't have it like you
know the URL top of mind but it's from
making about a year ago where the team
said yes that the Google roller at least
does run JavaScript for a brief while
against your page yeah yeah you can dig
up that webmasters blog post that's in
there which would give you trying to you
know we strap some components yeah and
so for for obvious reasons I can't go
into too much detail as to how these web
crawlers work or index there's work but
I do highly highly recommend if you're
skeptical about how your site is getting
indexed I highly recommend checking out
the fetch as Google tool which is part
of the webmaster tools set and what you
can do is go in give it a URL of your
page and actually see how Google's
crawler sees your page so recommend you
do that you can see make sure that it
shows up the way it expect another nice
little tip is the site colon query is a
very valuable query to use so if you're
skeptical that you know polymer-based
you know my app apps get picked up by
the crawler I encourage you to do to go
Google search right now site colon shop
polymer project org if you view the
source of shop you'll just see one tag
and that's it that's the entire dumb but
if you cycle inquiry you'll see that
everything gets picked up by the crawler
so I highly encourage using that that
fetch and render as Google tool in
webmaster tools ok you have patiently
been standing so you go next hi I'm Sam
I'm from brain lap and my question is
about supporting old browsers in
particular like Explorer is it stillness
and plan or feasible we support IE 11
and we still support 10 a bit I mean so
Monica made that noise you know audibly
see you leave made a much worse noise in
his head we want to end support for 10
we do not list I you 10 I supported on
the polymer website if you had checked
it recently so I yes so technically how
do we have a PMS I 11 up is supported we
always used to support I 10 till
Microsoft end of life I in nylon spudger
item across most Microsoft platforms and
so we decided well Microsoft can go it's
a probably good time for us to to but
and the reason that being is at micro
you 10 the support because of some
flakiness and some features it call it
adds a lot of complexity to the
polyfills so that's why we're like on
the fence here is that for most cases
everything should work fine you might
see a touch of flakiness which can be
fixed if you drill way down if that's
worth it for your set of users that are
happen to still be on a 10 so that's
that's the the end please do not open
issues on polymer elements if they don't
work on I attended know what happens it
thank you thank you all right over here
Russian hi coming about luck for pjs
software and I have a question about
because polymer to leverage a lot of es6
syntax and and you have a York toning
and
you know in my project for example we
are using a lot of Babel and everything
so we would want to make more custom
built so but I saw it yesterday that you
were using the Gator set at syntax and
using Pro adding the serviceworker by
magic so if I prepare the output from
Babel of the trans pilot it will be
still be able to add this as a service
worker and we work on polymer too yes I
mean there's a couple ways that we want
to integrate compilation into the
workflow one is that the Palmer build
library the reason why it's broken out
the way it is is to let you plug in
things like you know goat Babel or
something in that pipeline in the
appropriate place it turns out that the
type of compilation that Babel does to
output es5 generally preserves the
ability for the analyzer to recognize
that there's an element there there's
some cases where that isn't true like if
you're using typescript with decorators
that would output something that's very
difficult for the antlers lies that are
recognized so our general approach is
that like if if you want to run analysis
on your program you want to do that
before you've compiled it to make sure
that it's looking at your original
source we're adding a compile flag to
the CLI to kind of give you like a
default good compilation via Babel and
we're going to add the ability for that
to pick up the Babel RC file out of your
project and take out what take what
settings you need there but in general
it should play nice you know in the
serviceworker the way we determine what
needs to be in your service worker is by
crawling the HTML import dependency
graph that's not changed by double so
there shouldn't be any problems there ok
thanks all right I have a question for
our our product managers windy and
Taylor what can non google developers do
to get better support and feedback for
issues and PRS for Boehner and polar
elements basically a filing issue is not
fixed you can email me personally it's
taylor savage
thanks Matt well first i'd really
appreciate when you guys do submit
feedback so thank you to everyone who
does that already it's a big reason why
we're open source we love getting that
feedback and PRS from other people I
mean a lot of our channels on slack like
we have tools channels and those are
smaller generally so if it's tools
related Justin shred Peter they're in
there we've got some other channels up
there usually we're on general pretty
frequently so if you've got a question
and you might want to stick that in
there you can get information contact us
on Twitter there's a bunch of ways if
you find like it's a pretty regular
thing feel free to bug us and we'll get
back to you we try to yeah the best way
by far to get quick response on a bug is
make it a really really good bug yeah
meaning detailed repro if you can get to
it you know example of even a jaspin
that shows us wow what the bug actually
failing those help us triage because we
know that there's not going to be a ton
of overhead just digging down to a root
cause it helps us also just kind of get
a feel for how serious you are about
getting this bug fixed in a sense how
much it's impacting your project if it's
worth actually putting that together so
obviously we get a ton of bugs on the
product polymer project across our
polymer library are 100 plus elements
are dozens of tools I really do wish
that we had infinity engineers to fix
all the bugs all the time and we are you
know fortunately it backed by Google
which allows us to have some awesome
resources but when it comes down to it
we are still a small team of just people
and we have hundreds of repositories
that have introduced on them it's really
really hard to manage yeah yeah so we do
our best we really do appreciate issues
that come in we're always looking for
better ways to better processes to
triage and get bugs fixed and we
especially appreciate the really
detailed bugs those help us a ton and if
you're nervous about sending us PR as we
really really like very
so even if you're like not super
confident in your fix you can be like
I've got an idea for this it's probably
not great but it will work with you to
improve your PR because that's much
easier on us rather than starting from
scratch so you know this is recorded
right we're gonna be believed thanks
daddy I mean longer-term there's also
you know I think we've been doing a lot
of things as a team you know having our
own element catalog and things that have
sort of gotten in the way of the
ecosystem that might otherwise solve
some of these things so I think you're
going to see us very very soon and you
step one with just the data of web
components torg getting out of the way a
little bit more allowing the community
to thrive and start to respond to things
a little bit better too yeah so again as
Taylor savage @ gmail.com I hope there
isn't it sorry dude okay dog thank you
oh we actually his you probably just
give aways personally I mean dog stealer
Irish is yes Irish on github out our
issues it'll be great hey right ha minds
thomas um let's remark for a CEO first
maybe the best advice would be used
schema.org for the time being but i
always the question is key I'm not the
question but remind us and regardless as
CEO so maybe schema.org is the answer
for the time being right but my real
question is about inputs and shadow Dom
move in forms because when you have
fields inside shadow roots forms doesn't
worry I mean a job or validation
validation breaks so maybe does it truly
work will it work or maybe I'll just
have to put everything in light them
yeah so that the question again is a
native form element I want to put custom
elements inside of it that does not work
WTF me Rob you know anyone who knows
about this yeah I don't know
you want to yeah so um this is a seven
part is no good so result i actually
just did a poly kept the out the outtake
said you saw this morning or for me
trying to record to polycast about
exactly that using custom elements and
forms and the punchline for now is you
can either copy the valley that you want
to a hit an input so because that's the
form only cares about the input tag at
the moment and that's baked in the
parser it's kind of really hard to
change so either you copy your value to
an input or you put that input in the
light dom if it's in the shadow Dom you
have to somehow copy the value to the
input if you want to use a native form
we are trying very hard to work up and
change the spec in this but the problem
isn't that it's it's not a speck
changing problem as much as it's
literally bark bark bark bark baked in
the parser so the parcel will see a form
and then only look for input tags and
changing that isn't exactly
straightforward blink engineers have a
panic attack when you tell them about
changing the parser we're trying i am
desperately trying to add spec to this
to make inputs so make make you be able
to get input functionality and i get b
is equals attribute helps a lot with
this because you could be able to extend
the input tag and make your custom
element basically fake that input tag
which would make it work with forms
alright we have like one minute left so
we're going to go kind of lightning
round here I do want to try and get just
some more these audience questions but
this one question is pretty important
how long will polymer 1 dot 0 be
maintained now that Elmer to do is a
thing yeah yeah what y'all think about
that as long as it needs to be remember
it's Taylor savage Taylor no this is
recorded
and I think I think we've hopefully made
it pretty clear throughout the
conference how much we care about
upgrades and upgrade paths and upgrade
cycles and making it as easy as possible
to upgrade we feel that pain on the
polymer team we feel it within Google we
see if they got the ecosystem so we've
really taken that seriously with polymer
2 and all the tooling around it and
hybrid mode and all the documentation is
coming so we hope that the upgrade from
Palmer 12 polymer 2 is fairly
straightforward certainly not and I know
many people mentioned about being around
from the 0.5 to one dead upgrade which
was one of the moments where we really
learned this lesson hard so it should be
fairly straightforward to upgrade i
encourage everyone to try to as soon as
possible that said we expect you know
palawan dodo to it's it's a huge
dependency inside of Google itself so we
are certainly on the hook for supporting
it for at least you know many months
years to come I've won one tiny addendum
to that will the v1 web component API is
be supported in polymer 1 dot oh that's
that's not currently planned but you
know based on feedback will see yeah
yeah so that's kind of more gets to when
would the threshold for V weeds 0 usage
get low enough in chrome because chrome
has shipped it other browsers have not
shipped to be zero which is one point 0
is based on so it's really a question up
it still baked in chrome right now v1 is
also support in chrome side by side so
you can use V 0 and B 1 on the same page
in terms of web components totally fine
so really that won't matter unless the
zero usage gets to such a low point that
prone can take it out and support for
entirely which would be you know fairly
well into the future yes I mean and just
a technical note I mean one thing just
to be clear the V 0 and the v1 specs are
not hugely different but they're
different enough that frankly having
both in play on the same page is just
not something that makes sense to really
contend with so kind of having polymer 1
have that sort of mindset of having to
deal with both b0 and b1 it's just it's
just a world of pain we don't want to it
might also be a good reason to look into
hybrid elements and Eleanor to dot 0 if
you sort of need that transition path
okay we are over time but I would like
to take one last audience question
because you've been standing very
patiently so sorry everybody else if you
if you tweet at a spa
sumit i will go back and try and answer
all of those on the twitters Rob you
know this is recorded right Rob Dodson
and everything all right yes yeah hello
hi maximum from bestbuy canada and we've
talked a lot about performance
optimization and i would like to know is
the purple podium and to replace
completely stopped outside any suicide
run dodd templated wants to talk about
surrendering well I think server-side
rendering is a really interesting
question like we need to look at how it
actually relates to you know pushing
less it for your initial render but I
was actually talking to some engineers
who work on a another framework
framework X we're talking about
server-side rendering and I have this
analogy with that where server-side
rendering is kind of like data
compression right component is like you
know a compression you know using a
component is like using a compressed
format of like your component definition
and it should be cheaper to use a
component than to expand that component
everywhere out where you use it right
and so server-side rendering is kind of
like decompressing your data sending the
uncompressed data over the wire and then
recompress in it once it gets to the
browser and this should be bad right and
so it should be faster to send you know
your decompression which is your
component definitions and that and get
it all down there and this engineer said
yeah you know once we split up our
applications so that we're only sending
what was needed for the first route it
was faster than server-side rendering I
think our challenge with web components
is that we don't have an existing server
side rendering solution that we can
compare against but it certainly seems
likely to me that with the purple
pattern and if you're rendering as soon
as you possibly can with the minimal
resources for that route that it's going
to beat server-side rendering and it's
also going to give you a less
complicated you know setup and server so
we need to measure it to be sure but
that's my hunch thank you for that
question all right that is all of our
time please give a round of applause to
our lovely panels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
