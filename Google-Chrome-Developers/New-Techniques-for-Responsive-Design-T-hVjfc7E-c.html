this why do we need responsive design
the problem is that on the web one size
does not fit all we have different
devices different needs even different
data requirements and this is at the
core of the PWA attitude to building for
the web
we need layouts and content that work
across devices if your site doesn't
adapt to the user's device you break the
illusion and lose trust these quotes are
from Brad Frost and Liza danger Gardner
you should check out that blog post
about responsive design which are linked
to from the course materials as Liza
says manage risk focus on content you
know you can make virtually any site
usable simply by sizing elements and
content correctly the golden rule for
great progressive web app content is not
to let content inadvertently overflow
horizontally especially on mobile that
sounds basic but lots of sites break
this rule by making images inputs and
other large elements on the page with
fixed sizes using relative measurement
units and RAM percentages will reduce
the severity of this issue adding a meta
viewport tag will also solve a lot of
problems this tells the browser the size
of the virtual viewport on which it
renders a web page without setting the
viewport meta tag correctly most
browsers scaled down the page to fit a
virtual 980 pixel wide viewport I've
seen some great examples of this in
action on w3schools we'll give you the
URLs for that in the course materials
with this video the initial scale value
sets the zoom default for this page
don't set a maximum value that will make
it impossible for users to zoom and
that's a big problem for accessibility
one other thing you should be aware of
the viewport meta tag will mess up the
layout for fixed-width sites the Mater
viewport tag is designed to work with
responsive layout if you use it in a
fixed sized layout it will break things
until you convert the site to a
responsive
lay out trade document.documentelement
client to see how the viewport meta tag
affects the virtual viewport here's
another simple technique this solves
many layout problems you're setting the
preferred size and the maximum size and
works for video and audio too so yeah
you might think that relative sizing
would fix everything in fact for a while
back in the day some of us thought that
relative sizing could solve everything
we layout we had you know liquid layout
maybe even text could be relatively
sized
but relative sizing isn't enough
simplistic relative sizing like this a
diagram means that you have content
areas that are too big on desktop and to
smaller mobile this is why media queries
were invented it's a simple concept use
different CSS for different sized
viewport based on width that doesn't
just mean making the same layout for
every device on a phone you might want a
single column layout a two column layout
on a tablet maybe three columns for
desktop and so on you can use media
queries to select different layouts
depending on the viewport size here's a
single column layout on mobile to column
on tablet and three columns for desktop
so do you think about devices and you
might think you could get away with this
ask yourself what could go wrong with
this approach what about new devices new
viewport sizes what about changing
window sizes on desktop we'll come back
to this later now is that all there is
of course not there is a better way go
back to our original exercise remember
content is king devices keep changing
and device viewports are getting bigger
and smaller
not to mention pixel density pixel shape
display quality and so on don't force
your designers and developers to make a
change every time a new device appears
start the design process with the
smallest form factor then add the major
breakpoints for the form factors that
you work with phone tablets laptops and
widescreen devices
you can then create minor breakpoints to
handle specific changes to elements that
don't affect all elements the final
detail to keep in mind is to optimize
the content for reading ideally keep the
width of your content to 70 to 80
characters wider than that value makes
content hard to read now that doesn't
mean you stop thinking about devices and
device classes you might want one column
for phones two columns for tablets three
columns for desktop like we're saying or
whatever you can find out more about
these recommendations on web
fundamentals now remember the earlier
media queries example in the mobile
first world of PWS we need to turn that
around make small viewports the default
look at the example here by the way
there is no fixed rule about whether or
not to include media queries inline or
use a separate file also you might want
to consider using m's or REMS for units
here but I won't go into that now
you'll also do responsive layout in
JavaScript if you like this is a simple
way to do conditional content match
media is well supported and there are
polyfills calc is really useful in
responsive design where you want to use
a combination of fixed widths and
percentages in this example we have two
thumbnail images side by side 50% the
width of the parent element with a 10
pixel margin between them no matter what
size the viewport responsive design is
about more than just changing layouts as
well as changing layouts you might
actually also want to manipulate content
depending on the viewport size and
device type for example on a phone you
might want to make sure page content is
visible when the user goes to your home
page so you might opt for a hamburger
menu for navigation and put banner ads
lower on the page also if need be you
can just get rid of stuff on desktop
your users will want full functionality
but not on mobile right wrong don't
guess your users needs based on viewport
size plan content and functionality
carefully and don't assume users want
less content or
functionality on phones than desktop for
example again this is a crucial part of
the PWA attitude understand your users
don't second-guess them data-driven
design design content layouts and
transaction processes so users can get
to what they want as quickly as possible
our data shows that every step to get to
content loses 20% of users rather than
removing content a more sensible option
can be to choose different content now
for images this is called art direction
choosing different images or different
image crops and I'll show an example of
this later you might even want to
provide different text for different
viewports such as shorter headlines but
yeah be careful again not to assume that
mobile users want less content for video
the general rule is to use a smaller
resolution for smaller viewports this
can result in massive reductions in bite
size playback performance and proven
sand also reduced streaming cost the
best way to do this is with adaptive
streaming - or HLS not just media
queries and yeah you can find out more
about that more about adaptive streaming
in the course materials but just to
reiterate the key point here is that
when you're delivering video to mobile
don't use resolutions larger than you
need and talking about video content
don't forget to caption videos using the
track element it's really easy let's
take a look at the relatively new
technique for creating responsive
layouts CSS flexbox provides flexible
sizing and alignment element reordering
and better performance than floats CSS
flexbox is well supported and we
strongly recommend it easy centering is
the holy grail of CSS take a look at the
code here it is incredibly simple I
still find it slightly thrilling by the
way the materials that accompany this
video have links to lots of flexbox
examples including this one let's look
at the CSS for the examples here this
uses CSS flexbox for three different
layouts depending on the viewport width
let's start with the defaults for
smaller viewports remember mobile-first
the container is declared to use CSS
flex
the flex flow property means child
elements can wrap rather than being
squashed onto the same line you can also
use inline flex that's shorthand for
flex direction and flex wrap properties
the default is ro no rap 100% width for
each div in the container add a
different layout for slightly larger
viewport and different again once the
width hits 800 pixels the container is
now a fixed width and centered
horizontally using margins let's take a
look at the example here once again this
uses CSS flexbox for three different
layouts depending on the viewport width
and again let's start with the defaults
for smaller viewports for view puts over
600 pixels in width the order is changed
on the smaller viewports we wanted to
give child 1 full width but for a
slightly larger viewport we can put it
next to child 2 I could go on anyway
to other properties I'd like to draw
your attention to justify content how
items are packed and aligned items how
items are aligned CSS grid is in some
ways related to the grid system concept
familiar to graphic designers a page is
thought of in terms of lines tracks
between lines cells and areas CSS grid
is coming and it's already behind a flag
in Chrome and Firefox you'll find more
information in the resources for this
video the lab exercises that accompany
this video will help you get started
with media queries breakpoints grids and
with flexbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
