savage great intro yeah my name is
Taylor savage I'm a product manager here
on chrome on the polymer project I'm
here with Monica who's an engineer on
the polymer project as well tell you all
things polymer so I'll start off by
talking a little bit about where we are
with the project overall and how we
think that web components are really
changing how we do web development and
then Monica will go into some of the
more technical details around how to
take best advantage of polymer of web
components
to build a really great high quality
modern mobile progressive web app but
first off let's talk about the mobile
web and we've been talking about the
mobile web a lot at this conference it's
kind of like the mobile web conference
and there's good reason for that the
mobile web is incredible
there has never been a more important
time to have an open decentralized
communication network where anyone in
the world can access this information
coming from anyone else in the world and
as developers this is incredibly
exciting you can put something up on the
web and a user somewhere halfway across
the globe is just a URL away from
accessing your application that's great
but for developers there's also a dark
side to the mobile web and if you've
been doing mobile web development if
you've been really trying to get the
best possible user experience across to
your users on their mobile devices
you know this dark side which is that we
are at war with phones phones are our
enemy there are users best friend but as
developers there are they are our enemy
and it can feel like as we're trying to
produce the best possible user
experience the phones are fighting
against us at every possible turn mobile
networks are vast there are over 2
billion users with a more mobile
smartphone in their pocket to access our
web applications but chances are a large
percentage of those users are on slow
unreliable expensive data connections or
they're not on a data connection at all
and that's something that we've never
had to really deal with as web
developers as developing for the desktop
web where you're plugged into the wall
at all times mobile devices are
everywhere
they're in everyone's pockets they're
there oh you're a pocket reach away from
a great user experience on the mobile
web but that means that mobile phones
are fundamentally performance
constrained they need to have this tiny
little battery that can power them all
day long and they need for when you take
them out of your pocket for them to not
burn your hand and that means that the
to power for the battery to last all day
to power the sensors and the radios and
not to mention this high-resolution
screen it's going to happy very
constrained in the terms of the power
that it can actually deliver to the CPUs
that are doing your math for you that
are running your application and we've
got a lot of tools available to us a lot
of open source tools available to us as
web developers to allow us to create
these web applications then these tools
are incredibly diverse and incredibly
powerful but it can seem like more and
more the tools of L but available to us
are getting continually bigger and
continually more complicated building a
great mobile web experience is hard it's
a little bit like climbing Mount Everest
it's challenging it's expensive to
really do it right you need kind of a
lot of training and a lot of good
guidance and this is a shame it should
be much easier to deliver experiences on
the web to users especially in this
important mobile context but there's
good news we have a mantra on the
polymer project we have kind of a
philosophy about how we think we should
be building web applications how how
what we should be thinking about as
we're constructing these new mobile web
applications to make our lives easier
and to make our users lives better and
that mantra is to use the platform the
web platform is getting increasingly
powerful with new primitives like
serviceworker like web components with
new serving mechanisms like HTTP - we
have more tools at our disposal as
developers than ever that allow us to
build and deliver a really high-quality
web application and so it's our
responsibility now in fact it's our
advantage to take advantage of what's
already there baked into the browser
sitting on our users devices in their
pockets in the form of the web platform
so the polymer project is the chrome web
platforms team set of libraries and
tools for web developers to hit to help
developers take full advantage
of the modern mobile web platform to
take advantage of what's right there
sitting on the browser now the primary
feature that polymer the library has
been focused around is web components
and web components is an umbrella term
for a set of low-level api's baked into
the web platform new web platform specs
the lap that allow you the developer to
create reusable composable components on
the web they create a new component
model on the web allowing you to
essentially extend the HTML language to
create your own HTML tags that get
understood by the browser just like any
other baked in HTML tag now if you've
been following web components they've
been around for a little while now so
the first spec came out in 2012 which
was awhile ago and frankly back then we
were over optimistic we were over
optimistic as to the speed at which web
components would become broadly
cross-browser supported but this is ok
we went back to work we went back to
work with all other major browser
vendors to work out a new stated set of
these api's the idea was sound everyone
was on board the idea we just needed to
kind of work out the kinks in the api's
themselves and so I'm very happy to say
that as of today we've turned a major
corner with the web kamon it's api's
with an updated version of some of these
web component specs web components v1 so
previously web component support was
scattered and it was varied template was
supported about across the board across
all major browsers but shadow DOM and
custom element support was either behind
a flag or or unsupported in most
browsers today with web components v1 as
you heard earlier at the keynote this
story is completely changed so all major
browser vendors are on board with
shipping shadow DOM and custom elements
v1 versions the specs in fact Safari in
Safari 10 that just shipped recently has
shouted on v1 shipped chroma shattered
on v1 shipped it's on the high priority
roadmap of edge this is very exciting
time for web components HTML imports are
still on hold as we're working out how
they're going to interact with es6
modules but I'm confident we'll come to
a really good solution for how to load
HTML with HTML so I can't say this
enough it's this is a huge turning point
for web components at Google i/o early
this year I said that cross-browser web
components was not a matter of if but a
matter of when and when is right now
cross browser web components are here
with web components v1 which brings me
to polymer so the polymer library the
library itself that kind of forms that
the soul of the polymer project is a
lightweight layer on top of these web
components api's and it's designed as an
opinionated way to pull together at
these different low-level specs these
low-level api s and make it easy to
build for us developers to build a
reusable web component a reusable custom
element now polymer started out as an
experiment it has evolved with web
components as the web components specs
themselves have evolved so polymer
started out just kind of to test out
what would be the different low-level
features that we would need as a web
developer to create this kind of
reusable element to extend HTML so
polymer 0.5 with the last release of
polymer that was still kind of in this
experiment mode and then after a few
years of iteration after working on the
specs after working on the library that
it turned out that these web components
things were actually pretty powerful and
so last year we released the Wando 1.0
version of the polymer library which was
the production ready version of polymer
it allowed us as developers to take
advantage of web components today in
production applications without
necessarily the API is having to yet be
shipped broadly across the different
browsers so polymer has kind of quietly
been out for a little over a year and I
think because polymer started out so
much as an experiment with these very
early web component specs we often get
the question you know who is using
polymer is anyone is anyone actually
using polymer in the wild so I want to
just name a few of the companies that
are using polymer in production today so
polymer is used by Comcast which is the
largest media company in the world it's
used by the USA Today which is the
flagship brand of the largest newspaper
publisher in the u.s. Gannett used by
ing which is the largest online bank in
Europe it's used by net a port a the
largest luxury fashion ecommerce company
polymer is used by BBVA which is one of
the largest banks in Spain and Latin
America by coca-cola which is the
largest beverage company in the world
it's used by Electronic Arts
which is one of the largest game
publishers in the world by predicts
which is the software platform for the
industrial Internet of Things from
General Electric which is the largest
digital industrial company in the world
and of course polymer is used here at
Google actually quite heavily here at
Google on some of our biggest user
facing products so polymers used in
Chrome in the chrome UI pages which has
over a billion users it's used in play
music it's using YouTube gaming and just
recently at the polymer summit a few
weeks ago we announced that polymer is
actually being used on YouTube YouTube
which is one of Google's biggest
products also with over a billion users
is now building the next generation of
their mobile and desktop applications
all on top of polymer so there's an
immense organizational power that we're
seeing to relying on standards to
relying on standards-based web
development you get this seamless
frictionless sharing of code that we've
never been able to really truly achieve
across all kinds of different teams on
the web platform before and we're seeing
more and more large companies going
all-in with polymer with web components
with web standards based development
using the platform so a big value prop
for web components is that they're
interoperable that you can build a
component with browser based technology
and then share it to other members on
your team share it with other teams of
your company share it with the overall
ecosystem and anyone can take advantage
of that component no matter what kind of
stack they're using no matter what the
rest of their JavaScript stack or
JavaScript stack looks like but this is
great but clearly we've got big projects
working with low components big teams
that want to not just build components
but want to build entire applications so
we got the question a lot how can I take
web components and then build an entire
application specifically an entire
progressive web application out of web
components and our answer in the past
has always been well that's the whole
point of web components is there's no
one way to build an application you can
choose any of the tools that you're
familiar with anything that you like
already and use that to put together web
components into an application but
obviously that is kind of unsatisfying
and what we realized is that if you take
web components which are one new set of
web platform primitives and you combine
them with other new
the exciting web platform features like
serviceworker like like HTTP to you can
actually end up with a hole that's much
greater than the sum of these individual
parts and so we wanted to put together
kind of an opinionated showcase of how
these all these different features are
really designed to come together and
make for a really great user experience
and so earlier this year we released the
polymer app toolbox
and again the goal of the polymer app
toolbox was to go beyond just components
and show how components can be put
together with these other technologies
into complete progressive web apps so
the app toolbox includes a set of web
components app level components for
things like layout and routing an
internationalization it includes a
command-line tool the polymer
command-line tool that lets you build
and deploy your application and things
built with applications built with the
polymer app toolbox are designed to be
served via what we call the purple
pattern a way of using HTTP 2 and server
push 2 being able to deliver just
absolutely the minimum of what you need
to be able to render each view of your
application to your users with minimal
overhead and you'll hear more and more
about this purple pattern across various
talks at this summit and then in
addition to the components and a pattern
and the CLI we wanted to show what you
could actually create when you put all
these things together and so we launched
chopped-up polymer project at org which
you've also already seen in many of the
demos up here a progressive web app that
really is just a killer user experience
that uses the app toolbox that uses the
purple pattern it uses polymer web
components to deliver an e-commerce like
application you can visit that at shop
that polymer project org and we're
already seeing the kind of value of this
polymer app toolbox being used by
companies to build applications so take
Junia travel which is the travel
division of Africa's largest e-commerce
site now 75% of mobile connections in
sub-saharan Africa are on 2g and that's
forecast to still be 45 percent in 2020
so there's an immense challenge to be
able to deliver a rich full application
over the narrowest network you possibly
can and so thanks to the polymer app
toolbox and thanks to web components in
the purple pattern
Jimmy has progressive web app is able to
achieve this they built a progressive
on the polymer arctoolbox that has twice
twice as fast a page load on 2g and uses
six times less data than their native
app to be able to deliver the same exact
flow and I think the quote from the
Jimmy team really speaks to the value
and the power of web components which is
that they were able to build a complete
kind of prototype of this website the
entire flow in just four weeks so that
they could show it to their management
and sell the management that this is a
very valuable compelling experience and
then go from there to build the actual
production application so this is
exactly what we want web components to
allow developers to achieve really rapid
prototyping all the way through to
production deployment so we're really
starting to feel the momentum of web
components web components are now being
truly broadly adopted cross-browser
they're being used in real serious
production applications by large
companies and here at Google and this
means that it's time to kind of open the
next door for the polymer project so
we're working right now on the next
major push of the polymer library which
is polymer to toe so we just released
the preview version of polymer toe to
polymer 2.0 it's up on github and there
are a few key things that we're focused
on when we're designing and working on
polymer to do a few a few key features
and distinctions that from from the
polymer one dot or Elise
so the first obviously is web component
v1 support web component V 1 are the
specs that are going to be broadly
shipped across browser that we're
already seeing out there and polymer 2.0
is you designed to take advantage of
these new custom element and shadow DOM
v1 API is baked into the browser polymer
tirado also offers better
interoperability with other JavaScript
frameworks with other JavaScript tools
by eliminating some of the polymer
specific abstractions that kind of
leaked through in polymer one namely the
polymer Dom shady Dom API s and some
structured data manipulation that leaked
through so the takeaway is that an
element a custom element built in
polymer todo is truly web native it will
be indistinguishable from any other
vanilla web component that you might
build with any other web components
framework or just with raw vanilla web
and finally we don't want to leave
polymer one auto users in the dust one
thing that we took away from the polymer
0.5 to 1 dado transition is that
transitioning a major framework
transitioning a major dependency even if
it's small is a huge pain point
especially for large companies
especially for large projects especially
for teams at Google that are relying
really heavily on polymer so with
polymer tirado from the beginning we've
designed it with backwards compatibility
in mind
so polymer tirado comes with a near
seamless backwards compatibility layer
making it as simple as possible to be
able to transfer a polymer 1 dot oakum
ponent to work in polymer 2 dot o and
Palmer to doto also supports what we
call hybrid mode and hyper bone means
that you can there's a way to write a
component such that it can work on
polymer 1 or on polymer 2 dot o and so
what this allows is if you've got lots
of components in your application if
you've got lots of components shared
across your company you can
incrementally upgrade one element at a
time while your application is still
live in production and once all of these
components are upgraded to this hybrid
mode you can switch over from using
polymer 1 to using polymer 2 dot o and
then continue to take advantage of the
polymer to tie those specific features
so it's a much much easier much smoother
more seamless upgrade process than
having to stop all the presses and
upgrade everything at once before you
put your application back into
production so polymers your my 5 was an
experiment for web components polymer
guado was allowing you to use and
achieve the promise of web components in
production and with to know we can
finally realize the full value of web
components which is going web native
which is using actually truly using the
platform using standards-based cross
browser AP is to use the platform to
write less code to ship less code to
write more elegant smaller applications
and deliver them across the mobile web
and we're actually seeing this this use
the platform mantra out bearing out in
the numbers with polymer todo when you
take a close look at how polymer to dido
actually works and is built so polymer
to dot o if you build a web component
with polymer 2 and you ship it on a
browser that doesn't need any polyfills
so that supports web components v1
out-of-the-box polymer itself is only 12
kilobytes
it's small and it's getting smaller and
smaller and that is our whole goal with
polymer we're not trying to build a
massive framework we're trying to build
a tool that gets smaller and smaller as
the platform fills in our developer
experience so this is using the platform
in actual service to the polymer library
we are just at the beginning of the
story for web components and we're still
actively figuring out all the kind of
best practices and best ways that we
have developers as teams as an ecosystem
can take advantage of all the things
that web components provide so we've
been building web components for a few
years on the polymer team and we have
certainly learned a lot in those in
those few years and so here to tell you
more about how to take advantage of web
components in the browser and how to
build really killer applications using
web components is monika and engineer on
the polymer team coming up mid talk
means that I didn't get an awesome Paul
Lewis introduction so I'm super bummed
about this now hi so the thing about
polymer the library is that it's not
really about the library itself it's
about what you do with it and that's
building elements and what what I've
been thinking about on how to like
structure this talk I've realized that
um when Taylor said that mobile web
development is hard um the same thing
can be said about about element
development it takes a lot of expertise
it's really hard to make a good element
that you can put on every page that you
have so I think it's really important to
actually talk about it um and what we've
been talking a lot about is how to make
a good element that how to make a fast
element and we've given talks about I'm
not allowed to go back um and we've
given talks about that but then I
thought about it and there's three kind
of people that actually interact with
elements you've got the people who use
their elements who don't actually want
to build a good element they just want
to use other people's elements when
they're developing a web app there's
people who author the elements and we've
been talking about them a lot and
there's people who maintain the elements
and these may be the authors but may
just be other people who've inherited
these elements don't really know like
the intimate details on how this element
came to be the monster that it is so we
need to be able to address their
concerns too so I'm gonna do two
different things I'm gonna talk about
the people who use the elements and
be some advice about how you can
architect your your apps using web
components and how we've built some
tools for the people who have to
maintain those elements and on the
polymer elements team we have a lot of
experience with this we initially
authored over a hundred elements I think
it's over like 130 now which is kind of
a lot we've spread them across three
different orgs to make everything
actually really complicated and hard to
sync and test together why not have a
little fun while you're at it we've used
them internally like just in our team on
over 20 20 apps and this is important to
us like the shop app because that's how
we come up with with advice for other
developers that's how we come up with
patterns that you can use and we're also
on the maintaining side of this its
polymer elements are used in over 500
apps these are internal to Google
they're external to like some of the
cause like the companies that you heard
about before so we kind of cover all of
those three different areas that I
talked about so let's talk about app
developers it's probably half of the
audience you maybe want to use a web
component in your application how can
you how can we make this better for you
what best practices do we have for you
in the best advice that I have is that
you should not look at web components is
something that there are new you already
know about components if you used any
language you've got objects you've got
the ideas of like comprising your code
that's not new and web components
themselves aren't actually new either if
you've ever used an input element or a
button they're kind of like a web
component they're a little nugget of
functionality and code and styles that
have been put together in a little box
and given to you and it has an API and
you know how to use them you've been
doing it for a long time what's new is
that other people can now build these
web components are just as powerful is
input and button they just have
different names and you should treat
them basically in the same way that
you've been treating input so I built
this really to demonstrate like the next
example I built this really dumb app for
the polymer summit
it's basically a emoji social network
where it's kind of like Twitter and
slack jammed into one but instead of
being useful the only thing you can type
is English and it gets translated to
emoji so the only thing that you see is
like a stream of emoji and I'm walking
around with a beacon now I've got my
first physical web beacon so if you're
like around me you can
so I get a link to it it's mochi brag
dot Fri based app comm but when I was
designing it I was like okay cool let's
say that I've never used a web component
before and I want to design an app with
them what do I do and it's basically the
same way that you would use like a
normal application you just think about
the features that you have in your
application somehow I have to
authenticate a user then I got to show
them something like a giant screen of a
blob of text and this text can be like a
list of other people's dub emoji posts
or the amazing ability to write your own
dumb emoji post because how else are you
gonna get content in there and once you
figure out these features you can like
go ahead and deep dig deeper in each of
them
well when you write a post you have to
somehow translate from English to emoji
and then if you've got a list of post
you can like like them and see their
location and all sorts of other stuff
like that but once you have this idea of
like what the logical components in your
application are it translates
immediately to web components the
authentication part is done with
firebase auth which is an element that
does authentication with firebase iron
list is a thing that manages your a list
of elements and then you post in my app
our little web components that I built
internally to my app just to like
logically structure code around and it
was really easy and the awesome part
about components and this again is not
new it's happened if you've ever written
a class before if you've written a
component you can refactor it really
easily because it doesn't affect the
rest of the app it just sort of sat
there as a standalone thing and you just
get to fix its code so this shouldn't
look scary it's how you would write web
components you could call it a div class
equals main screen but now you can just
say main screen as an element and
because web components aren't in you and
you've been using them in the browser
just didn't know that an input was a web
component you should use these new web
components that you're getting from
users in the same way and that's by
using properties and events if you look
at an input you set all these properties
in it you said it's type you said it's
value you said whatever the min length
and max length when an input when an
input does something it fires an event
it fires an input event for has a change
event this isn't new and this is exactly
what people have been doing with their
web components properties go down events
go up and you get this like magical
unidirectional data flow in your
application so if we go back to my
application from before
you have that like giant screen at the
top that knows about the state of the
world and you've got like your post
button or you like mash on your keyboard
and emoji comes out and the app is gonna
know things that not every component
knows about for example it knows what
channel you're posting to so it's going
to inform anybody that it cares about by
setting a property on those elements
again just like you've been doing within
point and when you're done mashing on
the keyboard and you have like a new
post ready you file it fire this custom
event and be like hey I got an emoji
pose does anybody care and if anybody
cares they're gonna intercept that event
and the same can happen if you want to
like hide conditionally UI in like parts
of your application you just set
different properties what I didn't tell
you here is that you should call like a
public method on this element or
something like that because again that's
not have you been using Dom elements
before we don't call random functions on
input we just set properties which leads
me to my third advice use properties and
non methods you might be tempted to use
methods because javascript is really
keen on having methods but that's not
how the Dom really likes to be used the
Dom has properties and attributes and
this is really great if you're using
properties because then you can just use
them imperative lis and you can have
data bindings and stuff like that so
imagine you have a dialog you could call
dialogue head open on it but you don't
need to if it's got a property you're
going to say hey dialogue dialogue that
opened equals true and once you've done
this you can just do it as a binding
somewhere in your code and it depends on
like some other state of the world and
without writing any JavaScript like
things will open and things will hide as
they should because that's how
properties work umm so properties
properties on methods properties go down
events go up those are your rules so
that's the advice that I have for app
developers but what do we do about
element maintainer zhh you're like this
poor sucker that has inherited like 17
elements that somebody else wrote left
the company and you don't actually know
why they're in that state and this
happens whether you're maintaining
elements externally like we do for like
the rest of the world or internally like
a lot of companies do they just have an
internal set of elements but they still
have to maintain them so we've been
writing tools and the biggest advice
that I have is
you keep hearing what like a test-driven
development that's great but I think you
should practice fear driven development
and that's not being afraid of the code
or anything about anything like that
it's really just being afraid of your
users and that's a healthy approach to
to development because most importantly
you should be afraid of like breaking
them and breaking their applications
that's like your one responsibility as a
maintainer don't break other people's
code so in preventing breaking changes
we've been using this tool internally
and we're working on like making it it's
a public repo on polymer labs and we've
been working on fixing it so that you
all can use it and it's called tag two
which stands for test all the things
over and over because why not come up
with a complicated acronym if you can
and the idea is really simple when you
if you're a maintainer and you want to
like accept somebody's pull request your
biggest concern is that you don't
actually know what this is gonna impact
look at this dependency graph um which
is not a real dependency graph they're
usually way worse than this but if you
modify a leaf at the bottom unless you
you will have the ability to like hold
all the 130 elements in the polymer
elements catalog in your head you're
probably not gonna know what that change
is gonna affect it could be a behavior
it's maybe like the ability to be
included in like a custom form or
something like that you don't actually
know how many elements depend on that
change especially since they can go many
levels up the tree so what tattoo does
is that lets you specify a branch or a
particular hash or something like that
in a particular element and rerun based
on that commit a whole suite of elements
a whole suite of tests so in this case
we make a change to one element and like
make sure that all the other tests pass
this is great because then you have the
confidence as a maintainer that like
this PR isn't gonna you know destroy all
of YouTube cuz we've definitely not done
that before the other thing that you
should be afraid of is perf regressions
it's really great that now you've like
have the confidence that you're not
gonna break somebody's application but
making their application slower is kind
of slightly worse because that's harder
to fix and we have two tools for that
the first one is poly dev which is a
Chrome extension and you can run it on
any app that uses custom elements and
basically ranks how expensive the
elements that it sees on the page are
but it's great if you want to like audit
your page
and like me make sure that like as
you're contributing to an app so this is
also good for the app developers as
you're like fixing your app the
performance sort of stays as you expect
but it's also really good for maintainer
x' if you have like a giant catalogue
that has like different demos for
different elements in one of these
elements that used to be really cheap
after it commits suddenly like spikes to
the top there probably means something
bad has happened and you want to like
undo that change so that's what Polly
def does for you it's in the Chrome Web
Store you can download it it's awesome
my favorite tool is Polly proof and
please note how these names have a puli
prefix at the end but tattoo doesn't
because Polly tattoo is weird so Wally
perf lets you basically compare the
performance between changes so here this
is an example from Steve stock from the
polymer summit where as a baseline he
has an input element and that's not it
doesn't cost you 20 milliseconds to make
one input it cost you 20 milliseconds to
make 250 of them on a page and then he
had like this ratings element he started
with like a super shitty version and
just made it progressively faster I
think it was like three iterations of
that ratings element and the reason why
this is good is because you can start
doing it for like again different
commits and different shows and
different features that you're adding to
an element and be like cool this element
used to cost like 129 million seconds
and now it's 500 milliseconds is this
change really worth it which is great
for you as a maintainer because then you
can go back and be like no this changes
 we're not merging it it's fine
so that's fear driven development um
the sort of parallel and kinder version
of development to that is demo driven
development if you think about your
users um they don't really like I
personally can't look at a snippet of
code and be like I totally know what
that element looks like and how he's
gonna fit on my page that's great I can
only like look at demos and be like I
want it I want the shiny button so
that's what demo snippet is for that was
different let's he write basically how
you would use that element shows you
what the code is and shows you what that
element looks like here's a whole bunch
of paper fab buttons fab stands for
floating action button not fabulous and
it took me about a year and a half on
the team to find that out and I was
super sad I think I think fabulous
button is a way better name but nobody
listens to me so that's a demo step but
it's really great and we've noticed
we've like heard that Comcast for
example uses this element very
aggressively internally to just be like
these are all the elements we have this
is what
look like do you care and we've taken
this like demo approach very
aggressively to the new beta site for
the web component org so beta web
component org is a new element catalog
where we're moving all of our elements
to and it basically supports collections
and elements and they're curated curated
collections you can make a collection
called fabulous elements and you can add
all sorts of web components to it so
when people search for fabulous elements
they'll get to it but oh sorry but most
critically it supports inline demos so
this is the documentation page for paper
fabulous and here at the bottom you see
a demo and it's a snippet but the best
thing about this snippet is that it's
not static like the demo snippet used to
be it's actually interactive so here I
can change the contents of one of these
buttons or I can even add a style
because this but this kind of element
advertises a custom property to change
this color so you can go ahead and do
that so what now we have we have web
components they're native in the browser
polymer 2.0 is right around the corner
what does this mean for you as
developers cuz this is called you know
polymer web components and you let's
talk about the you part there's never
been a better time to actually start
using web components so you know go
ahead just go and use an element add I
have a really dumb an element called
emoji rain that makes it rain emoji in
your page go ahead and drop it on your
blog why not use polymer don't use
polymer uses vanilla custom elements
that you stumbled for us make your own
element and if you do share it polish it
up submit it to beta L component or go
that everybody else can look at it and
it's going to be really awesome so that
their applications can get better but
most of us make things use the platform
use tools that make your life better and
make you like write less code and build
awesome things for the web because it's
up to you to make the web better we can
just like help you along with it but at
the end you're gonna make it awesome
