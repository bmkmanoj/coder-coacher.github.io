to day two of polymer summit I am joined
right now with Monica I think a leskew
Monica is emceeing day two of polymer
summit right now and on top of that you
also gave a talk yesterday on the
importance of being lazy and so for
anybody who hasn't seen your talk yet
can kind of like summarize what what you
mean by that why it's important for
developers to be so lazy yeah I think
one of the things that I don't enjoy
doing is reinventing a lot of wheels I
try to be the laziest developer possible
so I try to use things that other people
have built and in particular with
polymer I try to use other people's
elements if you build something that
authenticates me or gives me a nice fast
list I'm gonna use that and not do extra
work that I don't have to so one of the
things that you mentioned was you were
kind of freaked out about doing
authentication which is like a legit
fear I got that same fear and so in your
talk you talked about using firebase to
do that and how it kind of streamlined
that for you so in a nutshell like how
did firebase make that easier for you
Remy's is really awesome because you can
create a project and then like on the
firebase console but then Kris on our
team and Elliot have a bunch of people
have written these amazing polymer fire
elements which are polymer elements that
work with firebase so you can
declaratively you know connect to
firebase and there's like one element
that lets you authenticate magically and
it's basically you put an element on the
page and you called that thing got login
and that's it that's how you sign in
right on now for folks who haven't seen
your talk yet but about are about to go
watch your talk and if you can have them
do one thing what would that one thing
be OMG you should go to moji bragged on
firebase app comm which is this dumb
social network that I built for this
talk where basically everything your
type gets translated to emoji and
everybody just right emoji at each other
and it serves no purpose at all so go
check it out but it's internationalized
and translate things for me if you speak
any languages that you don't see in the
drop-down make sure you send me a PR
that's right right PR s not issues folks
okay
so Monica thank you so much for being
with us monica is actually about to take
off and go MC the rest of day - yeah you
out there keep watching on the live
stream I'm Rob reporting live from
palmer summit stay with us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
