and once you're done you want to publish
it to the world you log into your server
you built the app and it doesn't work
small differences in runtime
environments can be extremely
frustrating when trying to get your app
running docker is one way to keep your
runtime environment identical for
development testing and production here
I have an extremely important and
complex node app using Express to put
everything in a docker container we need
to create a new file called docker file
and write a couple of lines we are using
the official node based image set our
working directory where our apps code
will live
copy all source files of our app into
the container image and run NPM to
install the dependencies now we declare
our port and define the command that
starts our app we can now build our
image using docker build and give it a
label afterwards we can use the image to
start a new container using docker run
don't forget to bind the port to your
host now we can access the app just like
we did before when the container is
running to get the app running on your
server you can either rebuild the image
there publish your image to the docker
registry or save the image from your
local machine to a file using docker
save and publish it to your server and
then you have it our app is now running
just like it was before but this time we
can be sure that the runtime environment
will always be exactly the same every
single time no matter what machine it is
on thanks for watching see you next time
if you're wondering why I'm suddenly
smaller and only partly covering the
screen that is because I need to make
room for the big chrome logo that you
can click to subscribe and also we need
more space for our latest live stream
over there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
