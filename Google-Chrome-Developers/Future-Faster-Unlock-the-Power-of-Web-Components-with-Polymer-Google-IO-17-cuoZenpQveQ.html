thanks for coming to i/o 2017 yes we've
got a great way to start I'm so excited
to kick this off my name is Taylor
savage I'm a product manager here at
Google on the chrome web platform team
now we work on a number of different web
developer facing products on this Chrome
web platform team and here today I am
here to talk about one of our biggest
which is the polymer project so the
polymer library is a small javascript
library that makes it easier to build
web components now building big complex
things out of smaller less complex
things is a pretty fundamental part of
any engineering discipline and it's
certain event it's certainly fundamental
to web development it's hard to imagine
building any kind of large complex web
site or web app of any meaningful scale
without some way of encapsulating and
reusing logical and interface components
in the past though the web platform
itself has never really provided us
developers with a clear way to build
components we've had HTML elements baked
into the platform but the we haven't had
a platform provided way to actually
design and build our own components that
that method has been nowhere to really
be found so as developers we've always
had to kind of drag our drag along our
own component model in JavaScript so
along with our application code that
actually ran our applications we've had
to ship an invented abstraction in order
to build any sort of meaningful a large
application or to be able to reuse
components in any sort of meaningful way
now we have web components web
components provide us with a very
flexible a very low-level but have
fundamentally standardized way for
building components on the web it gives
us encapsulation and reusability and
interoperability all things that a good
component model needs but baked directly
into the web platform itself now we've
been excited about the prospects of web
components for a few years now
and we've been working hard on the
polymer project to make it easier to
take advantage of the promise of web
opponents today but this year this IO is
by far the most exciting moment that
we've ever had throughout the entire
history of web components because as of
this year Safari now natively supports
web components yeah yeah this is
incredibly exciting with Safari 10 the
Safari browser shipped native Platinum's
platform support for custom elements and
shadow Dom the two most critical web
component ap is chrome supports these ap
is opera supports these ap is we've been
onstage at i/o promising web components
for a few years now but now they're here
they're actually here
so with these browsers there are over a
billion active mobile devices in the
world in our pockets right now in all of
your pockets right now that natively
support web components with their
browsers web components are no longer
some distant future web components
aren't really even that cutting-edge
anymore web components are just a
reality of today's web a massively
powerful new tool in our toolbox as web
developers and really a deeply
fundamental change to the way the web
platform itself works that makes it a
much more capable development platform
to build the types of experiences that
all of our users expect today so our
mission on the polymer project on the
polymer team is not just to build useful
tools for web development but to work to
fundamentally move the web platform
itself forward and to make this future
of web development more possible today
so the polymer project as a whole
started a few years back with a
directive from some engineers on the
chrome team and they said we need to put
together a team of web developers that
can live in the future that can build on
the web platform not as it is today but
as it will be and then kind of report
back to the President to help us that
web platform team on chrome know what
direction to go so the polymer project
in this way was kind of designed as a
laboratory for future web platform
features that we wanted to
baked directly into browsers to find out
what worked to find out what didn't work
to provide feedback back to browser
implementers and spec writers and to do
whatever we could to then bridge the gap
between the web platform as it existed
today and the new platform features that
developers were going to be able to take
advantage of in the near future so
fortunately we are not alone on the
polymer project in this mission we have
friends also looking towards a web
development future in fact we have a lot
of friends looking forward to a web
development future the open source web
ecosystem is a dazzling place there is a
ton of innovation as everybody here
knows happening all the time when it
comes to web development react has
brought functional reactive programming
for you eyes into the mainstream pre-act
has made this possible at a fraction of
the size beyou takes a very bottom-up
and modular approach to framework design
spell looks to start with this framework
and then compile it all away there's so
much exciting stuff happening all the
time in the web development open source
the ecosystem it's an awesome place to
work their luminaries charting new paths
trying new things guiding away all the
time so on the polymer project we look
at our mission we look at our
contribution to this open source
ecosystem through the lens of being part
of the web platform team here at Google
the polymer team itself is really half
web developers and half web platform
implementers and what we quickly
realized was that web platform users web
developers framework authors have ways
that they like building web apps and web
platform implementers the browser
engineers who spend their days
optimizing platform features building
consensus around new platform features
and api's across different browser
vendors web platform implementers have
ways that they think web apps should be
built in order to be fast in order to
take advantage of all the things that
this web platform does well and avoid
the things that it doesn't do well and
these two worlds how web developers like
to build and how browser implementers
like to build sometimes don't agree and
sometimes they lovely
disagree so before web components in
order to build an application of any
meaningful scalar size on the web you
needed to use a large JavaScript
framework it was an absolute requirement
and JavaScript frameworks can be really
amazing they allow for all sorts of
different mental models to think about
how you're going to build your app the
help developers avoid foot guns that are
in the platform they grow large
communities and ecosystems in and of
themselves in their own rights but
fundamentally as browser implementers we
see the fact that you can't really build
apps with just the platform as a flaw of
the platform itself so with the polymer
project we are pushing to make it
possible to build and deploy apps that
are closer to the web platform and use
that platform the way implementers
intend it to be used rather than
substituting a separate platform on top
and we think of course that there can be
some very real benefits to using the
platform directly to build an app less
abstraction shallower learning curves
better performance better reusability
and interoperability faster load times
and ultimately a better user experience
so we sum up this mission in our slogan
and rallying cry which is to use the
platform there are two properties of the
web platform that make it great one is
it's standards-based and two is that
it's open and distributed anyone can
look at the specs and build a browser
that supports the web platform in fact
most browser rendering engines are open
source and no single entity can decide
what makes up the web so we end up with
is a number of different browser vendors
in this collaborative competition with
each other this cooperative each looking
to provide a great user experience to
its users in its own right and each
building off the same kind of general
set of specs but inevitably providing
its own slight interpretation of what
this web platform is and so the end
result is a web platform that moves very
slowly and very methodically now there
are benefits to a slow moving methodical
platform but today more than ever we
need that platform to change in to adapt
the original web web platform was
designed for documents and then it
allowed you to style those documents and
then maybe allows you to script some
things in those documents but the
platform itself wasn't fundamentally
constructed around the idea of building
applications it
black very basic things you need to
build an application it lacks proper
encapsulation that lacked a component
model I lacked an efficient way to load
resources and frameworks do an amazing
job of making it possible to build apps
that can survive on this web platform
they bring along the things you might
need to build an app they provide
encapsulation they provide a component
model they create a layer of abstraction
that lets developers do things that the
low-level web platform hasn't let them
do on the polymer project though we have
our web platform hats on we have our
browser implementer hats on we want the
platform itself to be rich and lush and
powerful we want the code you write to
be eminently reusable we want it to be
more maintainable we want it to be
lighter weight and faster we want it to
be possible to be the hospital to build
higher quality applications closer to
this platform itself and for your
applications built close to this
platform to directly benefit from all
the whole hard work that's going on all
the time to make the platform better and
faster so on the polymer project again
with our web platform hats on we don't
want to find a way to work around the
web we want to terraform the web itself
we want to make it easier for developers
to take advantage of what the platform
does well and actually change what the
web doesn't do well and that is what we
mean by use the platform now of course
use the platform doesn't necessarily
mean use only the platform and nothing
else that's not reasonable there's this
wonderful symbiosis that exists between
the platform and the JavaScript
community and there's plenty of the
other frameworks can do that the
platform can't provide that polymer
can't provide there's plenty that
libraries and tools can do that wouldn't
necessarily make sense in the platform
or that you couldn't reasonably build
cross browser consensus around in order
to get baked directly into the platform
so it's use the platform we're just
trying to go from the bottom up we're
trying to help raise the tide that can
float all boats to help developer ship
code it's absolutely just the code
that's absolutely unique to their
application and let the platform itself
handle more and more of the glue so the
ultimate success for us on the polymer
project would not to be to have everyone
in the world using polymer the ultimate
success for us would be for the platform
itself to be powerful and extensible
enough that polymer and our tools would
no longer have to exist at all
so with web components chipping broadly
along with other new powerful platform
features like HTTP - like Service Worker
use the platform is not some
hypothetical vision it's a very real
strategy that major companies and major
projects are using today so we get asked
a lot who is using polymer and the
answer is a lot of people so comcast the
largest media company in the world uses
polymer to share components across
multiple different xfinity properties
that they on USA Today uses polymer to
build rich interactive experiences like
they had for the Olympics and the
election ing the largest online bank in
Europe uses polymer to share components
across the dozens of different
applications they have built for dozens
of different markets Netta port a the
largest luxury fashion e-commerce
company uses polymer to share rich
components to keep a consistent design
across multiple properties and pages
BBVA
one of the largest banks in Spain and
Latin America uses polymer to share
components to be able to quickly build
new applications coca-cola the largest
beverage company in the world uses
polymer components to ensure consistent
branding across all their different
digital signage Electronic Arts one of
the largest game companies in the world
uses polymer components to quickly spin
up beautiful new sites for all the new
games they're coming out with and
General Electric uses polymer for
predicts which is their industrial
Internet of Things platform to make it
easy to build all kinds of great data
visualization applications on top of the
predicta platform so companies around
the world are using polymer to build
applications at companies around the
world are also using polymer and the
polymer apps toolbox to build
lightning-fast progressive web
applications that use less data that
load fast Knights like Jimmy a travel
and konga the two largest e-commerce
platforms in Nigeria have production
progressive web apps built using polymer
we go when the largest travel booking
sites in the Middle East in Asia has a
blazing fast progressive web app built
with polymer and Ola cab the largest
ride-hailing company in India just
launched a progressive web app using
polymer and of course at Google we like
to use the platform as well so
over 700 Google projects that use
polymer in fact polymer is one of the
largest front-end dependencies used here
at Google we use it in production on
products like Chrome and YouTube gaming
and play music the new Google Earth just
launched using polymer and the new
YouTube redesign is built using polymer
one of the biggest web properties in the
world making a bet on web components so
we're seeing huge momentum and polymer
web components but this is only the
beginning we've been working on a ton of
new stuff as well which we're extremely
excited to share with you today so here
to talk about some of the latest
projects that we're working on on the
polymer team is Wendy gets Berg the
product manager of the polymer project
thanks Taylor the first version of the
polymer library was released about three
years ago and it was one of those hey
you go live in the future report back
and tell us what you found
proof-of-concept project that Taylor was
talking about before it was a
proof-of-concept that you could take
these nascent web api's and wire them
together in such a way that you could
build encapsulated reusable platform
based components and we have through
that for a while explicitly as a non
production grade Developer Preview but
that didn't really seem to stop anyone
we saw that developers were still
picking it up and trying it and using it
and they really liked it and even some
large companies like Comcast immediately
took to this idea of having
platform-based components so we took the
next logical step and we decided to move
out of a proof of concept and take
polymer into the big leagues to graduate
a little bit as a production quality web
components library with polymer 1.0 and
since we launched 1.0 we've seen a great
deal of advancement and traction as
Taylor was talking about before and
polymer 1.0 came a really long way on
its own we've seen a flourish in
production in web apps all the way from
Southeast Asia to North America and with
these web components AP is supported
widely across browsers we have the
perfect opportunity to realize this
initial vision even for
so we've taken the best of the polymer
library and the best the platform has to
offer and fuse them together to form the
next major version of the polymer
library I'm proud to announce polymer
2.0 polymer 2.0 is based on web platform
standards that are natively supported on
over 1 billion mobile devices because of
advancements in the platform polymer 2.0
is one quarter the size of 1.0 and all
of this makes web components built with
polymer 2.0 interoperable by default
meaning you can use them more easily in
popular JavaScript frameworks here to
talk more about polymer 2.0 main goals
and how we achieve them is one of the
tech leads on our core polymer team
Kevin shop great Thank You Wendy
so on behalf of the entire polymer
engineering team we are really excited
to get this new release out to all of
you so I'm going to give a brief
introduction of polymer 2.0 by talking
about three key goals that we organize
ourselves around for this release so
first is aligning to the latest platform
features that are shipping across
browsers today delivering on the promise
of web components interoperability and
then providing a smooth migration path
for our existing customers to polymer
2.0 so in the last couple years since
polymer 1.0 shipped all of the web
browser vendors got together and agreed
on a new set of web standards for
defining web components and in the
modern browser
defining a new web component is as
simple as writing an es6 class that
extends from HTML element now you may
not be familiar by HTML element is
actually the built-in base class that
all elements in the browser extend from
and now using es6 classes we can do that
very Adia matically this is as simple as
it is to define a new element that
extends the browser and then by
registering that element with the new
custom elements API we can associate
that class with an HTML
tagname and then anytime the browser
sees an instance of that element either
in static markup or created dynamically
say via a framework it's going to create
an instance of our class it's going to
run the constructor and it's here and it
could life cycle callbacks provided by
custom elements that we can implement
the unique behavior of our element and
that's where shadow Dom comes in so
shadow Dom allows us to create a scoped
subtree of Dom that's completely hidden
from the outside all of the styling and
Dom are completely encapsulated and
self-contained and this is the real key
to ensuring that web components are
interoperable and can run in in the
environment and what's awesome is that
the code that I had up there on that
previous slide requires no library code
at all so that that three or four lines
of JavaScript we can actually just paste
into an inspector plugged into any one
of your phones right now hit enter and
the browser knows how to construct and
render that element that component web
components are native right
so you may be wondering if the browser
is becoming so capable if we have this
built-in component model why do we need
polymer at all
so Palmer's goal in life is to fill in a
few key features that we find useful
when building custom elements things
like being able to render the contents
of the shadow dom from a template
keeping that the elements in that
template in sync with the element state
via data binding providing a little bit
of declarative sugar for things like
custom event handlers and then polymer
elements also keep their property and
attribute api is in sync so that you can
send initial configuration down in
markup and then interact with your
element after that via properties in
JavaScript so this is a sampling of the
features that we provide in polymer in
in polymer 1.0 we provided these as kind
of an opaque function call that kind of
hid a lot of the beauty the elegance of
web components so now that es6 classes
are native in the browser we're actually
in polymer 2.0 moving to a new syntax
where we're layering the the polymer
features on to that native elegant
syntax in the browser so if you're just
getting started with web components I
actually really recommend you take take
this little snippet of code and play
with it in the inspector in the browser
you can just get a feel for the web
api's right there and then as soon as
you're ready to start layering layering
in some of the functionality to that
polymer provides it's as simple as
changing the base class that you're
extending from so when polymer 2.0 to
use the features of polymer all you have
to do is extend from polymer element
instead of HTML element and then provide
a little bit of metadata on your class
to start taking advantage of those
features and because we're aligning to
the es6 class syntax you get things like
native inheritance for free you can
extend an element that you've created or
found on the internet change some of its
implementation details I might return a
different template that I want to render
and define a new element that has some
some extra different functionality
so to recap polymer 2.0 is aligning
ourselves to these new platform features
that are shipping across all of the web
browsers so es6 classes custom elements
shadow DOM and CSS custom properties so
I didn't really show custom properties
in action but this is very analogous to
how custom elements allows us to extend
HTML CSS custom properties are a new
native browser features that are
actually
getting across all browsers now as I
vege 15 that shipped a couple weeks ago
we can now use CSS custom properties to
define a custom styling API for our
custom elements and for the shadow Dom
and of course for the remaining browsers
which are mostly users on desktop right
so most of our mobile browsers with
Chrome and Safari all have have all of
these features natively for the
remaining desktop browsers will continue
to provide a set of high-quality
production polyfills that you can use to
target all of these features and the
result of all of this is a dramatic
reduction in code payload on top of
using these platform features we're also
shipping polymer 2.0 with an improved
polyfill loader that detects the
capabilities of the client and only
loads the the polyfills necessary for
that individual browser and the result
is this really nice reduction in payload
so as the capabilities of the browser go
up the amount of code that you need to
load and run on the client to use all of
polymers features goes down if we
compare this to polymer 1.0 you can see
this is a huge improvement especially
for the most capable browsers we're able
to use polymers features in a fraction
of size and this slide right here is
really the promise of web components in
action right aligning to the latest
platform features so I'll move to the
next goal this is around
interoperability and interoperability is
a feature of web components that we
promise from the beginning that building
your components around the state of a is
a set of standard API is that the
browser understands means that you can
use them in any environment so we've
always known that polymer elements could
be used here in static markup say sent
from the server or inside of other
polymer elements but the promise has
really been that you could use polymer
elements here in an angular component
for example or even in some of the
hottest new JavaScript frameworks out
there like pre-act but unfortunately in
polymer 1.0 the realities of poly
filling these browser features kind of
got in the way when we set out to ship
polymer 1.0 we found that the mobile
browsers of the day kind of back in 2014
weren't capable enough for us to
robustly feel polyfill the entire shadow
dom spec and so we made a conscious
decision to really we really reluctantly
shipped a proprietary api for in
acting with polymer elements in the Dom
that mimics a lot of the shadow Dom
features so that you could use those
features today on those underpowered
devices but unfortunately this obviously
broke that promise of interoperability
so I'm really excited to say that things
are different now
right with all of the mobile browsers
that we're all using now shipping shadow
DOM and now being able to leverage
shoutin on the importance of the
polyfills is slowly slowly fading away
and so in polymer 2.0 we've taken the
opportunity to rewrite the shadow Dom
polyfill to be completely transparent so
that any framework that's rendering the
Dom is actually using shadow DOM and the
result of this is that polymer elements
built with polymer 2.0 will now be able
to be rendered by all of the JavaScript
libraries out there today and as you
know in the JavaScript community all the
frameworks that everyone's going to be
using tomorrow are probably going to be
totally different but the key points to
take away is that elements built with
polymer 2.0 and web components will
still be compatible with them right the
promise of web components all right so
last I want to touch on the migration
path that we've charted for polymer 2.0
so as Taylor mentioned there's a ton of
really awesome companies making huge
strategic bets on polymer and web
components and we're really excited give
this release out to all of you but we
also know how scary a big breaking
change it can be to the foundation of
your tech stack something like the
component model that you're building
everything from right and so we spent a
ton of time and effort on the polymer
team to craft a really nice migration
path from polymer one to polymer 2 so on
the left here I've got an example of the
polymer 1.0 syntax you can not familiar
with it it's fine all I want you to do
is pay attention to the right and get a
feel for the amount of work that will be
required to port from polymer 1.0 to
polymer 2.0 all right is everybody spot
the difference that's right there's not
any because polymer 2.0 is shipping with
a backward compatibility layer that
allows elements written with the polymer
1.0 API to still target polymer 2.0 and
all of the native browser features that
we're taking advantage of and so for the
vast majority of polymer 1.0 code out
there the only changes that will be
needed to migrate are some minor changes
to the template to align to the new
shadow Dom spec but that's really
mechanical so
from for the users getting started with
polymer 2 will have a really nice set of
options for getting started a lot of
users will be able to just start right
with the es6 class syntax and get all
the benefits of using native classes in
the browser like inheritance and native
super calls on the other hand a lot of
users that have existing polymer 1.0
code will be excited to be able to port
that to 2.0 as quickly as possible and
for those users they can just simply
load the compatibility layer make those
minor changes to the template and be off
and running and then migrate es6 classes
in over time as they see fit and then
last we're also shipping with what we
caught we're calling a hybrid pattern
which allows users support elements to a
common subset of features in polymer 1.0
and 2.0 and then those elements can
actually run in applications targeting
either version of the library and this
will be really useful for organizations
shipping a lot of components to a lot of
production applications at the same time
so that means they won't have to freeze
their application development while
they're porting their whole element set
so I'll also mention that we've dog who
did this this migration path with all of
the elements that the polymer team
maintains something like 75 or something
and then a whole bunch of our demo
applications we're also hearing really
good things from the community that the
migration from polymer 1.0 2.0 has been
incredibly smooth
so that's polymer 2.0 in a nutshell
we're aligning to the latest platform
features we're delivering on the promise
of web component or operability and
we're providing that smooth migration
path for people to get up and started
with it today so with that I'll hand it
back to Wendy to talk about all the
other awesome stuff that's happening on
the project thank you
all right thanks Kevin so the polymer
project isn't just about the polymer
library it's made up of a bunch of
things because building web apps can get
complicated and as we all know web
development nowadays can be
unnecessarily challenging so we bring a
whole suite of tools libraries and
patterns to support you we have our
elements a collection of at a hundred
web components made by our team this
includes material design UI components
firebase integration pieces data storage
elements and much more to make
development with web components as
streamlined and accessible as possible
we have a full suite of web component
tooling projects so you can use those
with polymer or any other sort of web
components you're using to learn best
practices for rendering web components
both reliably end up scales we've
created a few helpful patterns most
recently we've developed the purple
pattern which focuses on fast first load
emphasizing time to interactive and
reliability in all network conditions
including usability offline and with the
polymer library as a foundation for
building components and tools and
patterns to help along the way we've
also gone that next step and built the
polymer app toolbox the polymer app
toolbox is a set of tools templates and
off-the-shelf components to help you
build web component based progressive
web apps more easily so that's quite a
lot under the polymer project umbrella
and over the past year we've advanced
each portion of the library and the and
other projects to pack in more power and
help you build for the future faster so
the polymer library exists to help you
build and capsulated reusable components
we know this so of course the polymer
team uses it ourselves to power all the
elements that we've made and as Kevin
mentioned we've taken all of our
elements about a hundred of them and
ported them over to hybrid mode so they
can be used in projects built with
polymer 1.0 or 2.0 so sure there are a
bunch of elements that we've made but
there are hundreds more open-source
off-the-shelf high-quality web
components that you can use today and if
you want to find any elements to you
they're all conveniently located in the
same place on web components org web
components org launched just a few
months ago and it's a consolidated home
for high quality open-source web
components of all types made just plain
JavaScript or library base and since its
release just a few months ago we've seen
an overwhelming wave of organic growth
for the site and the community around it
as of now there are almost 1,000
elements up there to choose from and
besides that large selection there's a
rich feature set on the site that makes
it an awesome place to search for try
and vent components before downloading
so there's automatically generated
documentation across the entire site
that gives a consistent look and feel no
matter which component you're looking at
there's also inline editable demos so if
we watch here if you're looking at this
game card component you can click see
that CSS animation inline you can even
edit the attributes down there change
the rank so an ace of five it updates
real time pop in another one on reveals
and the card flips over it's pretty
awesome you don't have to download a
thing this works right there on the page
we also have collections if you want to
make it even easier to find different
elements that are related this is the
google cast collection so if you want to
add cast integration to any of your
projects it's as easy as finding this
collection and popping one of those
elements in there's also a couple from
IBM Research and other developers in the
community have collected really great
components together and lastly if you
really want to vet and see how popular
component is before you download here's
a super helpful one if you want to add a
Moche range than any of your projects
because of course we all want to do that
made by our very own Monica you can see
that it's got 120 stars on github you
can check out Forks active maintainer
and see the health of an element in the
open-source community before downloading
and lastly I just wanted to show some
super cool elements but I really like
that you can install import and insert
directly into your code on the top left
you can check out that game card it's
got those beautiful CSS animations and
resizable SVG graphics the Queen's on
the jacks look awesome there's that sign
here
element which has really cool ink
texture for the signature and there are
way way more and if any of these look
cool to you just remember that this is a
tiny sampling of what's on web
components org and there are many more
useful interoperable components anybody
can get up there and publish an
element's so anybody here you want to go
home tonight and do that it's open to
you and a big reason I really love web
components org is because of that
community driven variety that only
continues to grow and flourish rich with
web components of all types because
polymer is just one way to build web
components
it's that same philosophy which inspires
our tooling teams commitment to building
tools for all web components not just
those built with polymer because it's
2017 and where would a web developer be
without her trusty tools I know that a
lot of developers including myself have
a love/hate relationship with tooling so
we make sure to make our tools as
straightforward as possible so they
really empower you while you're
developing to be better two of our most
popular tooling projects are our IDE
plugins and our CLI and yes they work
for polymer and vanilla web components
I'm not going to go into too much detail
on these because we have a whole talk
about this tomorrow
but real quick our IDE plugins are
awesome for polymer and web components
development we have them for atom and BS
code and they include features like
type-ahead completion real-time linking
real time error checking and even inline
documentation so you can check out Doc's
as you're typing to get reminded of
different properties we also have the
polymer CLI which you can think of as
your web component multi-tool or your
Swiss Army knife and it's simple it's
smart it's got just a handful of really
powerful commands that make building
with web components smooth and efficient
so by using the polymer CLI and all of
the commands you can get a web app
template with a responsive design
client-side routing and an automatically
generated service worker with little to
no effort on your part
just a few command line scripts so our
CLI is built around the concept of
taking all the best practices of
progressive web apps
with web components and making them as
simple and straightforward and
accessible to achieve as possible so I
wanted to dive into one of our newest
best practices that the CLI enables how
many of you are familiar with the purple
pattern Oh awesome
so the purple pattern was designed by
the polymer team to promote efficient
scalable loading on client-side web apps
we introduced it last year actually
Kevin did on the stage at i/o and we've
seen it really take off since then
you'll hear a bunch of folks talking
about it at i/o including addy Osmani
and Alice Russell and it's pretty app
that Alex Russell talks about it so some
of you might be familiar with alex
russell or a slightly late on twitter
but if not know that he one cares a lot
about web performance and two is very
active about that on twitter he's also
an engineer on the chrome team who sits
just a few feet away from us and us
being on the same team does not make us
immune to that it actually makes us a
really conveniently located audience so
in fact it was one of our many
performance discussions with Alex that
led to the creation of the purple
pattern so you all have to him to thank
for that and even though we read it as
purple it has nothing to do with the
color it's just a really convenient afro
name highlighting key loading techniques
and you can think of it a lot like Ajax
and that it doesn't specify one specific
API that you must use rather a kind of a
roadmap for how you should be building
and loading the first P stands for push
proactively delivering all of the
resources necessary to satisfy our users
initial requests and you can do that
using HTTP HTTP to server push or
preload r is for render render only the
requested route because the most
important thing when loading is getting
that initial critical view rendered and
interactive the next P stands for pre
cache precache the resources necessary
for that a user might want to access
later and you can do this using a
serviceworker and that will keep you one
step ahead of a user as they interact
with your app an L is for lazy load
which is how you'll be loading your code
or your resources whether that's from
the cache or by making an additional
network request so this might seem like
a lot to do
with the power of the polymer CLI and
mostly just the inherently granular
declarative and low over nature of web
components we've done much of this front
work and automating it away so now
getting started with purple is as simple
as choosing a purple ready app template
running a CLI command or two to let us
analyze your dependency graph and
generate a manifest and then follow
instructions to deploy a serving
environment like firebase or App Engine
that's it and if you want to learn more
about purple you can see it in action
both in demos and production today
purple is actually being used in the
most high-profile PWA on the web Twitter
Lite Twitter's new progressive web
experience and Twitter light isn't even
built with polymer it's just using these
purple principles in action if you want
to build purple experiences faster we've
got you covered with the polymer app
tool box and our polymer apps toolbox
sample apps polymer news is a
full-featured
open source progressive web app built
using the polymer app toolbox along with
a demo and all of the code full
documentation outlining our design
decisions architecture choices and even
advanced features like integration with
amp or how to include ads all of that is
outlined for you online but that's not
all our apps team has been working on we
test a few of the engineers to build
something awesome out of the newest
api's we challenge them to deliver a
mobile web experience that you would
only expect from native and of course do
it in a fraction of the size and they
did and they called it cheese so let's
take a look at the demo when cheese
opens up it looks like a native app but
I can assure you it is a full web
experience it's got that jumping up and
down button that says say cheese at the
bottom encouraging you to either upload
a photo or take a photo so we're going
to upload a photo and the photo pops
right onto the screen and you can see
these beautiful CSS animations scanning
the image for facial expressions and for
your face
and then it Jazz's up the photo with
emoji popping
eyes and silly hats even gets your
expression and replaces it with an emoji
it's pretty cool yet and then you can
even slide through and find all of the
other great things we've added and when
you when you find one you like let's go
all the way back I think I like that
first one a little bit you can even move
the emoji so maybe we want to take the
the cheese off of Baldwin's head and put
it on a Frankie's if he looks he looks
pretty good with it and then you can
download the photo and share it with
friends share it with us on Twitter
share it later and as you can see our
team our family our friends had a blast
using cheese and Google's vision api's
to jazz up our photos with emoji you can
check out kevin's kids wasn't really
great there my dad blending in with some
sheep in the top left and it was really
fun to use cheese
but Frankie Valjean and Keanu who built
it had such a great time building it
because they got to use all the latest
web technologies they built a polymer -
es6 class-based syntax progressive web
app using purple pattern with H to push
on firebase all of that earned them a
100 out of 100 on lighthouse which means
it has all clients support and it uses
Google's machine learning technology
through the vision API to power all of
that finding your expression finding
your eyes your nose and even cooler it's
got some great accessibility features so
it uses Google AI to read your image
figure out what's in it and add an alt
tag right on there so you can use voice
over and listen to what you took a photo
of pretty crazy here's the URL for
cheese cheese dot polymer - project org
we'd love to see your selfies whether
you're here at i/o or watching somewhere
around the world and then you can share
them with us on Twitter see if you can
come up with any crazy combinations so
that's everything that's the polymer 2.0
library built for platform based
interoperable web component development
web components at Oregon our house-made
polymer elements all poured at the
hybrid mode a suite of web component
tooling with our CLI and our IE plugins
the purple pattern for scalable
efficient loading and the apps toolbox
and app toolbox reference
implementations polymer news
this is our mission and action bringing
the future of web development into the
presence by enabling web developers to
more easily lean on everything new and
powerful the web platform has to offer
we are committed as a team to
researching and developing better ways
to leverage all of these new platform
features we're going to continue to
advance our library and support
developers and companies large and small
that depend on us and we'll focus on
spreading spreading news and best
practices for make to make sure that
developers can build with a platform
symbiotically for the long term the
future is here and with all of the
recent and revolutionary platform
advancements right now is a really
awesome time to be a web developer so we
hope you enjoyed hearing all about the
latest releases from chromic polymer
projects there will be many many more
ways to learn about us all throughout
i/o in fact this is our largest presence
at i/o yet if you want to learn more
yeah if you want to learn more about 2.0
and Alucard you can check out Monica's
talk bright and early 8:30 tomorrow on
stage one if you want to learn more
about tools you can check out Justin's
talk tomorrow right here on this stage
at 3:30
we've got refresh brand new code labs
we've got onboarding material on our
site we're going to be in the web
sandbox and at office hours you can come
talk to members of the team most
excitingly you'll have to make it to the
after-hours event tonight to check out
the poly Monde battle stage if you were
at CES if you played Santa tracker if
you're at the polymer summit you'll know
about this but it's a progressive web
app where you can battle people
head-to-head and if you want to see even
more about polymer after IO is said and
done there's a full event dedicated to
it the polymer summit and we're
extremely excited to bring it back for a
third time in Copenhagen on whoo
the summit will be in Copenhagen in
August 22nd and 23rd and this time we
want to hear from you the community so
if you want to talk on stage at a Google
developer event now is your chance go to
this URL do dot code last polymer summit
2017 to hear more about tickets which
are free as always and updates hope to
see you all there
that's all for us if you have questions
or just want to say hi feel free to stop
by thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
