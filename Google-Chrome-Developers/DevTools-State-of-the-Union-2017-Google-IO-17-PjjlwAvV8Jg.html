some other good stuff we've been doing a
past year on the chrome dev tools team
and to speak for the team we want to
enable you and equip you with the tools
to make you a productive developer that
means powerful tooling to help you
understand and improve your application
and we want that experience to be fun -
delightful
so today we're going to cover a few
things debugging your script or form in
so we're going to look at auditing for
excellence we're also going to look at
nodejs and headless a lot of good stuff
in error we're going to start off with
debugging and some console kind of
ergonomics you know the console is part
of our core experience right it's you
spend a lot of time there and so we
enjoy investing in these workflows so
these are a few of the things that we
noticed that might need some sprucing up
a little bit so the console right I'm
going to show you object previews and
some new improved autocomplete object
previews we're going to show a little
bit of a little video this is an object
we're just opening up we're exploring it
this is a bunch of network requests so
it's an array of objects and the hunt
around and find that like one object
that I'm really looking for it takes a
bit of work right same thing here I'm
just clicking around we're just
wondering you know maybe is that we
could provide this a little bit more
proactively and so we're switch over to
what it looks like now take this object
open it up now when you click on open it
so we get the previews of all the child
objects immediately so just instantly
browse you see all the sub properties
and you got you're in a good state of
knowing immediately what's happening
inside the data all right so that's
object previews and just another view of
that on the left got what it was well
last week to be honest but in today's
Chrome Canary you'll see something a
little bit more like this
an array of arrays and I get to see
exactly what is in there without having
to click in all the time good stuff all
right
yeah I like it I like it
it's good all right I'm going to show
you some autocomplete stuff and I come
over here to my machine take a little
sip of water we're going to pop over to
the console all right so we're here in
the console and bring it in on about
blank solid page now you're the console
you like to type things and we want to
make sure that it's very fast for you to
get completions so that you are just
people to do the work that you want to
do I'm like at document and well like it
document ahead and now I want to make
sure that I don't look at a child nodes
okay so I'm switch over to child's nodes
now at this point like I've had these
little auto-completion as I type all
these things in because we know exactly
what document head is right but then we
reach this point where we type in dollar
0 we've done this kind of array access
right now when we do dollar 0 then all
of a sudden the completions they used to
just completely fail so I'm just happy
to report and now you hit period we're
like no problem array access you got the
completions to O'Brien now another one
let's say that you have an object object
looks maybe like this guy um so the
properties have dashes and so you might
know where I'm going with this if I
switch this over if we take this and now
we run this in the console then classes
dot no I can't because there's dashes
right not a problem
square bracket notation no big deal and
square brackets we'll just make sure
that you have the key names right here
too
so good stuff but we can do a little bit
better you might be more on kind of the
bleeding edge of things than the new
side so let's take this object here of
classes and we're going to make it a map
all right so do map equals new map and
we're going to use object at entries I
think this is a yes seven even so object
our entries new map we create a map of
the deck same information now we do map
get open up the paren and there are keys
too so making sure that you have all of
your data right at your fingertips all
right now while we're in the console
sometimes we spend a little bit more
time typing something out than we
actually thought we creat not just a
one-liner and we're like okay well
there's some work to do so I'll type out
this function and I call it log and
we'll just say args and we'll open up
our bracket at this point you're like
okay well I want to do a function do I
hit shift enter so that it doesn't
evaluate I don't want it to air don't
worry about anymore just to enter we
know that you're not done it's good
we're just going to give you a new line
we're going to indent in a good place
now type in console.log args log that
out and hit enter again we know you're
not done but we close off that brace and
we're like yeah you're good we'll fix
the indentation you hit enter once more
evaluated all right that's good so now
we have a nice multi-line console that's
aware of what's happening and not going
to evaluate something that's obviously
incorrect
now this console to have some upgrades
syntax highlighting it's not here a year
ago
also other text editor features for
instance I'm gonna hit command D I can
do multiple selections and easily just
change whatever I need right there
inside the console all right so this is
something cool stuff in the console q
thank you and now I'm going to switch
gears a little bit and talk about
asynchronous JavaScript right so do you
guys write a lot of asynchronous
JavaScript
and yeah okay we check do you guys use
promise ooh yes promises all the time I
mean because what what would be like if
we didn't have that it's it's nice but
on the other hand like debugging
promises yeah not not as much fun really
is it so I want to talk a little bit
about a thing bugging I'm going to show
it with a little trio of examples so we
come back over here and I like the about
blank page this is good and I'm gonna
look at these snippets okay so here we
got a snippet here zoom out just a tad
right so let's nip it we start out with
a jobs job runs we call a process in the
process we log out a little bit we get
some data we printed out just logs we
finish up and I got a debugger statement
here so that I break right
synchronous execution flow we're good
I'm gonna run this this is a snippet so
I can just click this button or hit
command enter and we're good well we do
have a reference there so we're not
perfectly good but if I just put that in
there then I think we're okay it was
just a necessary adjustment that's all
no big deal
all right now I'm paused here
synchronous right so we look over the
call stack okay health deck we start off
at an on recipes at the instantiation of
this job function and process gets
called we go in we call finish and we
end up there just show you straight
forward right we're good we're good
alright now that we have that out of the
way we're going to take a little kick it
up a notch
so we're going to go from synchronous to
async but we're going to use async await
all right so just some small changes so
now we're going to call job but we've
also introduced a little sleep function
just you know
delay a little a few milliseconds so now
inside a process will log out but will
sleep will go fetch a favor
Saavik arm will print out that result
will sleep a little bit more and will
finish okay now let's try that out I'll
just run up and we pause and okay now
the difference here is that we have same
for call frames in the stack and they're
pointing at the same location but in the
middle of this we have this asynchronous
hop because going from job over to this
call points and finish we had any
synchronous operation inside process all
of these are asynchronous sleep print
and sleep again right so this also works
and makes sense but promises are how I
think a few more of us these days are
doing async work so switch over to that
same basic approach but with promises
this time it's that job we do a resolve
and then we go into here and inside
process we have a promise resolve sleep
fetch get the results sleep finish right
so we run that I'll stack again for call
frames here but to asynchronous hops in
there now the important thing here is
that we are able to show the history of
why we got here
I know admittedly these are kind of toy
examples but in the real world things
get a bit more complex so this is a
slightly more real-world stack this is
just the immediate stack of five
synchronous call frames and looks like
something coming from jQuery there's not
a lot of context but if we have
asynchronous stacks enabled we have that
feature behind this call stack
then it looks a little bit more like
this taller stack but it gives us much
more context so even down at the bottom
actually see that this came from an
event handler in to submit handler and
submit data so I know even at the top it
doesn't really communicate much I know
why this actually happened all right
this is increasingly the default look of
stacks and the browser we have many
short spurts of synchronous work held
together by asynchronous operations so
like set timeout requestanimationframe
promises I think away plenty of other
api's I'm not going to mention like
react new core algorithm fiber this is
designed to break up big chunks of work
into small asynchronous while chunks
work the browser runtime is all about
asynchronous
just for a look at how this is in a
reality this is the view of all of the
async operations happening over the
course of a quarter of a second and
we're taking all the asynchronous
operations and rendering them as little
arrows I mean I don't expect you to like
get a lot out of this but just suffice
it to say it's busy there's a lot going
on but dip tools is able to track what
is going on from one-call frame a stick
of the top over the next we think it's
imperative for the tools to communicate
why you arrived at assets at a call
frame so to pull this off we've had to
do a lot of work under the hood so we've
instrumented all of the browser points
where he synchrony emerges the timers
and the RAF's and the promises we worked
closely with the v8 team we checked all
the Dan gleen kind of asynchronous
execution hooks and so that we know from
the entirety of the program execution
ways to the beginning back to the
beginning of the page load in order to
pull this off and do this efficiently at
scale we needed to do some work because
we were really driven to flip the switch
on this feature making it from something
that was like an opt-in checkbox and the
corner
just something that everyone should just
get for free all the time so there's no
reason to collect you know expensive
snapshots from the VM replay execution
or like switching out into another tool
so what this really means is that
stopping at any point of your program
execution shows you the complete
asynchronous history of how you got
there
it's right there your fingertips but
okay sounds cool
what is this actually enable I'll show
you
so I've three new features I'm going to
show to you continue to point in line
breakpoints and step into a sink well to
do that or come back to these same demos
and alright the finger that's one place
a little breakpoint here on line eight
and we're just going to start the
execution we pause I'm gonna hit step
over I just want to work my way down
results print the results okay at this
point I can inspect the results okay
great perfect this is a common debugging
scenario but let's bring it over to the
asynchronous world so here
I'll place the breakpoint I'll run pause
now step over and I get to step over and
this time all of this work is
asynchronous but we're still able to use
a nice convenience
step over we've made that asynchronous
debugging experience feel just like it
was synchronous now step over so it
works great with sync code and with a
way they sync but we often do this a lot
of times either you're stepping over or
you'll be like you know what you know
I'm here on this log here on this line
and I want to jump down to this
I'll just set a breakpoint right now
I'll play execution you know but it
happens a lot so we wanted to make sure
that there was a bit
more of a convenient shortcut for this
so that's continued to point so now if
you're paused you hold down the command
key or the control key and we're going
to highlight in blue a few destinations
inside this function that are available
for you to just jump to so when you
click on one of these destinations we're
going to allow the execution to go
forward and then we're going to pause
you right there so I'll do that I'll
just click on this print and we just let
the execution go forward now I'm paused
here and of course I get to inspect this
response it's just a little bit of a
convenience cool thanks
now promise it okay I'll pause here and
step over and step over again what do
you think I'm I feel about me stepping
over at this point it's like yeah like
what happened uh what does yeah we just
jumped like right to the end we are now
exiting with a return value of a promise
none of this work has even happened yet
and it is like yeah so we don't have the
power of async/await and the nice
convenience to step over that's not
going to work for us but we want to have
this power so we actually thought about
this and figured maybe there's another
way that we can do this and that led us
to inline breakpoints so now because
what I really want is I really just want
to pause like like here you know I want
to see what this result is so I want to
pause here so I'm just going to put my
breakpoint on a 14 we're going to
highlight a few areas in that line where
we can actually pause and so you know
that spot right there I'll turn that on
and flip that one off and now when I go
forward I start off there and I continue
execution and now I pause inside of that
function and now I
inspect the results like I want it is
good and that works but be honest if
you're using promises as much as I am
like you will be doing this all the time
so again we're like we could make a
little more of a convenience function we
want to be able to pull this off with a
single gesture so I'll break and now
this time I'll hold down control or
command again
now there's the blue destinations but
there's also these green destinations
the green means I'm going to step into
this asynchronous function so this time
I'm going to step into this result print
result and now I am paused inside of
this a Singers function and I can
inspect the result just like that
so single gesture or handling the step
into async all right so there's a lot of
stuff in the asynchronous debugging
we're really excited about I know that
was a lot I switch gears what does it
talk about performance okay now when we
talk to our users and we ask questions
like alright you guys work on
performance what sort of panels do you
use so I don't what do you guys use do
you use the profile panel a timeline
panel yeah good network panel yeah
obviously a few things and admittedly
the tools are a little distributed but
we're talking about browser performance
here where the completion of a
javascript file downloading immediately
leads to main thread work and it's
critical to see that connection and when
the JavaScript finishes executing the
browser takes a moment to calculate the
layout and it sends off you know pixels
to the screen this pipeline is very
integrated so we need so we knew we
needed a single integrated tool to
visualize the entire picture so that's
led us to the performance panel all
right so I'm going to show you a little
bit of the front panel in act
so do that come back to my browser clear
those out and we're just going to look
at the home page of nest just for fun
bring open the dev tools now this is the
performance panel we have screenshots
enabled that seems good and you know
what I just want to capture a profile of
the reload of the page just the load so
I'll hit that one button and what we're
just going to do is capture the entire
thing and we'll stop it automatically
when the page is done loading all right
so we have some stuff on the screen sure
up in the top of the little overview and
a film strip and I can just kind of drag
my mouse along and the screenshots of
the page as it loaded go from just the
very top bar so a little bit more
vintage of the text but like I said we
want to see kind of how this worked
so I'll just zoom in on well everything
up to ya where things there looking good
and of course the page load starts with
some network requests so going to open
up Network I'm going to zoom in this is
our HTML some JavaScript some stylesheet
and so on alright this JavaScript
catches my eye right nest web component
bundle min Jaya so the network
connection goes out waiting for the
bytes and then it starts downloading
right here so downloading downloading
downloading all right what happens when
this file stops downloading well stop
download the layer right here the main
fried gets it right here and then look
at this main thread evaluate Script web
components bundle yeah that makes sense
okay so it's a nice connection between
the network and the main thread so we
see that work there and we're just going
to look to the right okay with parsing
HTML
a lot of things happen soon enough the
browser calculates what we're gonna what
it's going to look like the recalculate
style the layout the paint
so imagine somewhere around here it's
actually going to ship these pixels to
the screen so now you can open up the
frames track and in the frames track we
have screenshots of what was happening
the page just positioned exactly where
it actually happened so now I can see
well this was when yeah we got the top
bar with a little nest logo at the top
okay that's something I expected more to
be honest
we'll just scroll to the right a little
bit okay yeah yeah there we go
so now we got these images and then the
text okay the fact that the text took a
little bit more time
it leads me to an idea I bet I bet that
we're dealing with web fonts here and we
were waiting for the web fonts to
download I closed up well open up
Network and zoom out a little bit and I
bet you that the web fonts just finished
downloading so i zoom out and scroll
over here
well yeah I spot them here we have at
least at least the WHA files of white
and regular and these are just completed
and once they completed then the browser
had a chance to recalculate the style
which it needs to do and layout and then
we were able to ship that frame so we
have this nice integrated view from the
beginnings of Network requests to pixels
on the screen now some of you who might
have been using the profiles panel to do
JavaScript development I just want to
orient you with what we have available
here so if I collapse again the network
on the main thread we're dealing with
just over time what is happening but
oftentimes you're looking for what
consumes the most time at an aggregate
view right so we'll zoom out and open up
the bottom and the bottom up view the
bottom of view is just a summary of
everything that took time sorted by its
own self time so here we can see well
there was some JavaScript on the page
that took a little bit of time the
function e yeah not so he was a little
slow I guess and are also not
so you know enr watch yourself but the
other important thing is that you see
this in context the browser was doing a
bunch of other work right
it was compiling scripts and laying
things out and recalculating style I
know you get to understand that No maybe
II isn't so bad after all maybe I need
to make sure that I need to recalculate
style a little bit less or lay things
out less and make those take less time
protip fewer Dom elements will help this
one anyway that's a good quick look at
the performance panel and we hope you
dig it now I did that the fastest code
in the browser we're talking about
profilers right the fastest code is the
code that never even runs and better yet
that fastest code is the code that isn't
even downloaded so we're thinking about
that and wondering what if we could
provide you with a better view of what
is actually being used in a page and
that's led us to the coverage profiler
I'm going to give you a short video of
how this works all right
so this is a little progressive web app
that I made and we're going to scroll
down to the bottom open up inside the
drawers menu the coverage panel all
right
this point we could just hit record and
start collecting data we're actually
going to get instant data especially
from our CSS because we know what's
applying to the page right now so here
we actually see you know all of the
selectors and which selectors have
already been matched the page the ones
that haven't are in red now select focus
there's no job down it's in focus let's
try it now we're going to click in and
hit tab and that green sorry that red
rule went to green so instant live
updates here over in the coverage panel
now javaScript
it's also available now this is the
JavaScript file
half of it is unused which isn't great
we can like look down and if there's a
get tripped function it's not executed
feels like it should be alright well we
could just try it out we're gonna you
know
so like the schedule will go from San
Cisco down here to Mountain View and
yeah alright drop down the 50% on use
which is 10% unused which is good yeah
you making good use of all the bytes so
the coverage profiler gives you this
sort of insight
armed with this data and you can go to
town the red unused bytes they are not
your friends they are not your users
friend either
don't send users red bytes nobody likes
them check it out the coverage profiler
but then again okay then again sometimes
all the bytes that you're running on the
page are you know not necessarily yours
there's someone else's there third party
code so when you see a big waterfall of
a sorry a network waterfall of a big
site you're like a lot of stuff going on
like who is this and this is you know a
challenge you you should know exactly
what is happening on your site and who
it is so it's all about attribution I
thought about this and we have a new
feature to show you you can try this out
in Chrome Canary now and it's some
third-party attribution now the command
palette is a great place to turn turn
this on command shift P type in
third-party type in badges put this on
and once you have this on go over to
something like the network panel now
next to the network request we're going
to throw a little badge next to it so
next the file name will say something
like DC when you click on DC will just
see like it's double click and then
you'll see a ga badge and we like what
Google Analytics and we're doing this
for a lot of different third-party code
ads analytics tracking all sorts of
stuff this is available in other places
too so in the console with do you have
logs or heirs and you're like who is
this coming from like VM Script I don't
even know that doesn't tell me much
we're going to tag it there too and put
the little badges in you
now also over in the timeline you can
take that bottom up view group it by
product and see okay looks like these
guys are spending a lot of time on my
main friends it's cool yeah I know
that's good alright so uh come back here
yeah it's good we got a good amount of
data in here we're recognizing over
1,400 different projects products and
that means over five thousand domains
now we're keeping track of and showing
how the data is just kind of built in
there but we have a little link report
mismatch if anything looks fishy to you
click it report it to us we want to make
sure as the data is super useful to you
and it's accurate as you can be alright
brings us to authoring we've covered
debugging performance and cents but
there's some other key actions in your
workflow and we've added some features
there I think you're gonna like them
some good stuff this one cookie editing
you've been able to view cookies for a
while not been able to edit cookies I
know I know I know you were excited
about the floods yeah the long time
coming
we have cookie editing we're good now
we're good okay
the next one the good one change
tracking so often you get into this case
right you're you know editing CSS just
tweaking something you make a bunch of
changes you at this point like you've
got it to where you want it to look like
you kind of have lost track of all the
changes that you've made so down in the
drawer you can open it up the changes
view and we're going to summarize we're
going to give you a diff of all of the
changes that you've made file by file
Thanks this is an experiment as of today
but we'll be turning it on in Canary by
default Oh Monday Monday let's do that
okay good all right screenshot oh yeah
all right check this out so we're
looking at the Google store right let's
take a screenshot of the page now we're
gonna use that command palette right
command shift P type in screenshot yeah
and we could just capture the screenshot
captures it at ping we can open it up Oh
easy all right
who's good in there for a little bit but
I can do better I can do better
we're going to open up the the device
menu and now we can do the same thing
there but what I like to do is I like to
turn on the device frame get that light
nice art around it then you capture
screenshot and you got that good look
looks good in presentations puppies and
dogs are really pucks with that show
them the love it and then there's one
more I like even more the full size
screenshot where you get the full page
capture it and now single ping full
resolution
yeah I'm right there with you right
there if you alright there's one more I
had to sneak this in I like to call it
break point resolving you know sometimes
you put a breakpoint on a page and
you're gonna change it around and then
notice that it like it's not on the line
that you meant for it to be on all right
like kind of a pin I'll do that here
I'll place this great point put it on I
put the big point on construct select
now I'm going in my editor I'm moving
things around adding a log or comeback
yeah there but when i refresh it's in a
different it's in the first run function
different thing it's not where I left it
like yeah all right and the new brow in
now you'll see this in Canary beta use
refresh we keep the position we track
where that was and even if you change
things around a little bit we're going
to make sure that the big point stays on
the same line all right
yeah it's good not going to work all the
time if you completely change things or
gotta lose chat but we're going to do
our best
alright now I wanted to share with you
or my favorite part here that's good so
that's the past year and a half
personally I've been working on the
lighthouse project and when I was great
it gives you a lot of insight into
what's happening and sorts improvements
that you can make right it's available
as a Chrome extension command line app a
node module access it in a variety of
ways but we always knew that there was
value in having it more deeply
integrated integrated into the
development workflow so I'm going to
show you what this looks like with the
dev tools integration so we'll look at
chrome experiments as an example pop
over the dev tools and we're going to go
over to the audits panel on the panel
then refresh it a little bit we'll go
down we'll run an audit we're just going
to do the full audit of everything at
this point we're emulating a nexus 5x or
throttling network or even Spradling CPU
to slow it down a little bit more like a
phone and we're looking at a lot of
things we're looking at the load
performance and capturing a bunch of
different metrics
also looking at things like
accessibility how much of a first web
app it is all that then we get the
report right here in the dev tools and
so a few things going on with this site
forgets the web app side
not so good for them but you know there
HTTP some good stuff in the performance
section a filmstrip and some of the high
quality metrics you might have heard
about first meaningful paint first
interactive and how those line up
against the screenshots and then other
things like you know image optimization
we're giving you idea of how much value
you're going to get out of all those
recommendations you don't have to guess
and be like it really wasn't that
impactful now I'll show thank you thank
you I'll show one more thing while I'm
at it on Google I just ran it on the
Google homepage and the accessibility
results were kind of interesting to me
so I open that up and because we're in
dev tools now when you hover over this
node result we're just going to
highlight it up there you can click
through and it start inspecting it in
the elements panel so do that again with
a color contrast so now a few things
looks like in the footer that don't hit
the color contrast mark and we see them
highlighted and we can see immediately
the actual elements that we're talking
about so this nice integration between
the deep end sites of lighthouse and the
runtime of dev tools together brings a
lot of power I've saved a developer
favorite till now headless browsers you
know they enable you to create automated
tools that can run in a variety of
different settings and people do a lot
of things with this text extraction
screenshots and performance testing
security tests and unit testing I mean
everyone here I'm let me raise your hand
if you're using a headless browser of
some sort in your workplace yeah of
course lot of things and we've seen this
happening and for the longest time us on
the chrome team we've been wanting to
make provide a contribution to that
scenario to those workflows and so today
we're happy to officially announce the
availability of chrome headless
Chrome headless works great on all os's
linux and mac and windows as working
great in all these places windows chrome
60 a little bit newer the other ones in
great shape and so this enables quite a
bit there's a lot to come
selenium support for instance is right
on the way we're really sad about this
now right now things a little bit low
level there'll be higher level API is
coming soon there's a big flourishing
developer community coming around
chromium headless right now and its
primary API which is the dev tools
protocol so encourage you if you're
curious about this check it out there's
a great blog post from Eric bidelman
about chrome headless it's going to get
you started with how things work and all
sorts of tools available right now
alright last thing know Jaya so who here
develops of node yeah yeah yeah me too
there's a lot going on a last year a
year ago here we announced that nodejs
could be debugged and profiled with dev
tools well we announced a pull request
that enable the poor request is
submitted
we're like we'll announce that because
that's what we got but soon enough yes
the poor requests got merged into nodejs
and it shipped and so now we're in a
great place give a lot of it developers
we spend time both in the browser and in
node and we want to make sure that the
experience and debugging node is good
and so I want to show you some
improvements to the workflow that we've
made and to contrast it to what
debugging node was like two years ago is
good it's so good alright I'll show you
a little bit of stuff here
okay now I'm actually just going to be
this is how I do bug lighthouse when I'm
working on it and I'll bring back open
this browser this one yeah great
now I'll do something like this this
commands right node and I'm going to be
running this script but anyways the
important thing is inspect break this
allows this says that I'm going to start
inspection and I want to put a
breakpoint on the very beginning okay
otherwise we're just running lighthouse
so the first thing I hit enter this URL
popped out
now if you've done this before you've
seen this URL and you're like okay well
I guess I'll copy and paste it and you
can you certainly can but there are
better ways so one better way is we can
type in a doubt inspect and we see this
panel and the best one here that I
recommend you clicking instead of this
shiny looking guy is the dedicated dev
tools for node now this window is going
to be dedicated to just note and so you
can see immediately we broke on the
program execution and I again have all
the power that I need I can continue
step in and just go crazy so that's good
but we can do a little bit better all
right now this time I'm thinking it
would be good if I didn't have to
remember that URL about inspect every
single time and this functionality was
available to me in a bit more in the
immediate place where I spend a lot of
my time so now I'm going to open up dev
tools and when I run this command again
I hope you spotted this but right up
next to the inspect element icon there's
a new one
a little green node icon snuck in there
right there we detected that there's a
debuggable node and we're like you know
what if you want to debug that we got
you right here
so you come over and click that we're
going to pop open that same dedicated
dev tools for node window
the cool thing about this dedicated
window I love this is you know okay this
works and I'm debugging and I do what I
need and they're like okay found a bug
and so now I'm going to need to you know
fix a bug and that is out of ah you know
changing things I need to like run it
again and so run it again but because we
have that dedicated window it's like hey
I'm right here I got you I'll pop right
back open so it's always there and
connecting so even if you have to
restart node you have that one single
window and that's going to take care of
you the entire time
now all right so yeah stop that there we
go okay you guys have made it which
covered a lot I've covered a bunch of
new features and dev tools from that
great new experience with object
previews the autocomplete in the console
all the asynchronous debugging goodies
performance panel coverage third-party
attribution chrome headless node all
sorts of good stuff if you like this
kind of a thing
false on Twitter great Doc's updated
regularly and if ever you have bugs we
doesn't want to know if you have future
requests we also definitely want to know
any feedback just tell us about your
workflow and the sorts of things that
work for you new gr bug comm is where
you can find us reach us first a message
we'd love to hear from you
anyways that's it for me thank you guys
very much appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
