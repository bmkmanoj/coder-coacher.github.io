at the progressive web app summit I am
joined by the one and only Surma Surma
you just gave a talk on HTTP - it's a
great word it's I always mess it up so
I'm wondering for you I'm not like a
super networking pro can you tell me
what is sort of the the difference
between HTTP and HTTP - you can call it
h2 because that is the official symbol
which makes it much much easier to say
there's two sizes so that most
importantly there is no big difference
in terms of how the semantics of the
protocol works so all the web apps to
remain working the same it's still
request/response you still have the
verbs you have headers and the payload
so all that stays the same the only
thing that is actually different is how
it goes over the wire so instead of
having at most six connections and each
connection can only handle one which was
the case when h1 you can now I only have
one connection but each of these
individual streams as they're called can
utilize this one connection to the
fullest though so you don't have this
head-of-line blocking issue anymore
where you have to wait for a response to
come in before you can send out the next
request so that means that's things like
bundling your JavaScript together or
spriting your images are essentially
counterproductive in HTTP - so stop
doing that okay and and and for
particularly for progressive web apps is
did we get something is there a cool
benefit of using h2 for for a PWA well
apart from what I just said there's also
the when you don't do bundling anymore
you get better caching because you can
cache all the files individually because
you don't do concatenation anymore which
means that apps tend to load faster and
then there's a new feature an HB -
called push which allows you to push
resources to watch the client that the
client hasn't even requested yet so when
someone wants to have your index.html
you pretty much know that they're gonna
request your JavaScript in your CSS as
well so you can just put that - into the
cache without them asking for it and by
the time the browser knows it needs it
it's already there so that will
basically make your app even more snap
here and get it on screen so much faster
okay now I'm sold that sounds awesome
I'm wondering are there any any any
tools or like how to what is a good way
for me to get started with with h2 it's
there well I wrote a tool called simple
HTTP - server which if you know Python
there is the simple HTTP server which
basically serves the current directory
and I rewrote it in go so I know just go
because I wanted to have it on Windows
Mac OS and Linux alike and it uses HTTP
- obviously for a to be true you do need
TLS which can be very tedious and that
is why I wrote this tool because it
generates that certificate for you so
you don't have to do it
it also has support for push so you can
actually just start it up and see what
the impact on your app is when you
switch to hb2 which i think is really
helpful all right so we will include a
link to the the fancy server the simple
go server for HT you down in the
description also links to sermons talks
and all the other talks from the
progressive web apps summit are
available on the playlist Surma thank
you so much for being with us today I'm
