new performance monitor a new UI for
filtering the console and automatic
message groupings in the console the
performance monitor gives you a
real-time view of a whole bunch of
performance metrics to open the monitor
press command shift P on Mac or ctrl
shift P on Windows and Linux start
typing performance then select show
performance monitor the monitor opens up
in what we call the drawer press escape
to hide or shore the drawer you can also
explore all the tabs in the drawer via
this menu over here here on the left
side of the monitor we have the
different metrics you can monitor in
real time the grey ones are hidden click
a metric to hide or show it note that
the color coding on the CPU usage chart
is the same as the color coding in
performance panel recordings note also
that the frames metric refers to
document frames not frames per second if
you want frames per second use the FPS
meter which you can open via the command
menu if your pages are logging a lot of
messages the new console sidebar can
help you filter out the noise and focus
on the messages that you care about over
in the console the side bar is hidden by
default click show console side bar to
open it this top item is equivalent to
showing all messages expand it then
select one of the scripts below to only
show messages coming from that script
when you want to focus on messages with
this certain severity level such as
errors or warnings click that item to
show all messages with that level or
expand the level and select one of the
scripts below it to only show messages
from that script that matched that
severity level
note that the info level includes
console dialogue and console dot info
messages you can combine the side bar
with the filter text box for some pretty
specific filtering for example you can
enter a regular expression in the filter
box or you can type a minus sign
followed by some text and the console
hides any message that includes that
text the last feature we've
got coming in chrome 64 is automatic
message groupings in the console over
here you can see that the console now
group similar messages together this
badge over here tells you how many times
that message was logged click to expand
the grouping and see each individual
message you can uncheck the group
similar checkbox if you don't want this
behavior that's all for Chrome 64 here's
a bonus tip that makes it easier to work
with elements that have hover effects
here I'm looking at a little demo that
showcases a bunch of different hover
effects suppose I want to inspect or
tweak what CSS gets applied to this
element when I hover over it I could go
back and forth between making my changes
and dev tools then manually hovering
over the element but there's an easier
way inspect the element then open the
toggle element state menu then check
hover and I force the element into the
hover State even though I'm not actually
hovering over it dev tools puts a little
orange dot next to the element in the
Dom tree to remind you that you're
messing with its state that's it thanks
for watching see you in six weeks for
chrome 65</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
