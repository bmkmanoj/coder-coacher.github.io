waiting for after we had it hinted at
every other panel so far and the lots of
questions and lots of quick solutions
being thrown around like the last
session for example when will voice
recognition be the norm just easy take
people's eyes out takes their arms off
and they have to use voice recognition a
lot of things that we actually think is
coming had to be used in accessibility
for years and years already I always see
accessibility as a hardcore usability
testing it's something that people need
and not something that we just want to
have but Derek is going to do a better
job in that my job is right now not to
talk but to introduce people so to first
make fun of the Germans let's have a
family name like lose weight sara is
here she's from King's College and she's
an academic researcher and writer
bridging the gap between critical
disability theory and accessibility
practice something that was on our mind
for a long long time and we've been
discussing a lot in between us hopefully
Andrew roxley over here is from the RNIB
and he's an accessibility and usability
specialist focus on the web and mobile
platforms he sells to contribute to the
surf right standards which was an
interesting thing to look at Alice
vauxhall is from google but she knows
about accessibility and okay that was
unfair but it was so good because
everybody everybody else I talked to
she's like and here's Alice she's going
to talk to you later about
accessibilities or no pressure you have
to answer all the questions right now
she works on the accessibility developer
tools extension and library and that's
something like we used in the past we
had performance tools for developer
tools but now we have accessibility
testers in there as well which are great
and absolutely necessary for things like
a Chromebook where you only have chrome
on it and nothing else and matthew tylee
Atkinson from the Paciello group over
there is a is for the bachelor group a
tester screen magnifier and occasional
text to speech user and he works on web
accessibility accessible gaming which is
an interesting topic especially when you
think about these kind of connect things
level editing and supporting older users
all users is sort of political correct
term
I'm not sure so speaking of people that
have been around for a longer time I'm
going to introduce you now to Derek
Featherstone who has been with me in the
accessibility world for a long long time
and worked on the first book that we
both had chapters in the web
accessibility booked at two or four
people read and followed up later on so
without further ado over the Derek so
I'm here today to talk about
accessibility and most people think of
accessibility in very technical terms
and and the number one point that I want
everybody to walk away from this today
with is that accessibility is all about
people it has to be about people because
if it's not about people we end up doing
the wrong thing even though we're
meaning to do the right thing so all of
us that are up here have a background in
doing this stuff for people so Christian
actually started his first foray into
understanding accessibility was when he
was working with people with
disabilities when he worked for the Red
Cross Sarah is a researcher she she
actually works with real people on
unaccessible ax t issues alice is
putting Aria support into chrome and
that's for people to use right we cannot
forget this Andrew actually works with
people taking smartphones to them to
show them and demonstrate all the
different accessibility features of
smartphones and how those things can
actually have an impact on their
day-to-day life and Matthew started
changing the authoring environment for
gaming so that that could be so that
that could be accessible to people that
were blind the and I want to do i do too
i work with people with accessibility
with disabilities everyday we do
research and testing and try to figure
out what what UX is for people with
disabilities right what does UX mean to
them and so hearing all of the things
that everybody is talking about this
morning and this afternoon has been
absolutely fascinating because we're
talking about it at very technical
levels
but at the end of the day people have to
use those tools and that to me is what
what accessibility is all about we we
tend to simplify things and you probably
have heard of of all of these different
conditions or things that people have
that that you know people are blind or
they have low vision they have hearing
difficulties or that they have a
mobility or a dexterity impairment and
when you start to think of all of these
things even even those things seem to be
very physical but what about the
cognitive side of things and that those
are traditionally the things that we're
thinking about when we think about
accessibility but there's a whole other
realm that we need to start to get get
into an explorer how many of you have
heard of things like vestibular
disorders so there's a whole group of
people that that have some kind of
vestibular disorder and and I didn't
like the word disorder but issues with
their balance and so when they're
looking at a screen with all you know
your fancy CSS animations and your
parallax effects that actually makes
them nauseous right it actually causes
migraines so when we have you know when
you're scrolling down a page and you
have a car that you've animated with CSS
that's going like this across the page
that actually makes somebody nauseous
right these are these are new things
that aren't sort of in mainstream
accessibility and we need to start to
take those things into account things
like speech we the very last panel was
talking about well what about what about
speech and as christian pointed out
voice recognition software was
originally invented for people with
disabilities so on the speech side of
things and this is this is a I think an
absolutely critical thing for us to keep
in mind as we move forward speech is
just one modality right it what happens
if we create interfaces that use that as
the only modality and what does that do
for somebody that speaks a different
language that that has a stutter that
maybe has cerebral palsy and has
difficulty speaking right we need to
create interfaces that are entirely
flexible and and one of the other other
panels earlier the pointers what about
custom gestures well what about
the fact that and so here's a custom
gesture move up into the left well that
custom gesture has already being used on
Android for screenreader users that are
using the talkback screen reader on
Android so what happens when that custom
gesture that you've created and built
into your page conflicts with the custom
gesture that is required for the screen
reader so we need to think about
flexible alternatives so when I move up
and left in talk back in android that
means something to me and that gives me
functionality so even though you create
a custom gesture like that in your in
your app or in your page you need to
consider that maybe that's not the only
way that we should be able to
instantiate that action maybe we need
some other method or a backup mechanism
to do that we need to think about all of
these different things we tend to put
people in boxes and say you're blind or
you're not blind right you have a
disability or your don't but that is not
reality we we have a scenario and this
is a very standard Gaussian binomial
bell curve distribution whatever you
want to call it and we have people that
that live at at one end of the extreme
or another and this one's talking about
about people size but think of it in
terms of any ability so you have people
on one end that have maybe completely
normal vision on the other end people
that have no vision and then you have
people everywhere in between this is not
a binary all-or-nothing scenario we need
to to think about that all the time
today's assistive technology is really
advanced we've moved from a point where
solutions that we used to think were
completely untenable like aria so Aria
stands for accessible rich Internet
applications and it's a tool that we can
use to add to our code to provide
programmatic accessibility where it just
didn't exist before screen readers for
over the last five years have really
advanced and really done a great job of
getting Aria support into into that
technology but we have to ask this kind
of a question what if a brand-new
version of a certain type of assistive
technology just isn't modern and I'll
give you an example this is
sweet of assistive technology tools
we've got voice voice recognition up
there we've got tools built into
browsers Envy access is a screen reader
for the Windows platform that's free
voiceover on the Mac zoomtext on Windows
as a magnifier and reader combination
now all of the screen readers on there
they have done a pretty good job of
keeping up with modern technology but
some other tools don't necessarily keep
up and so I'm not going to name any
names or single anybody out but dragon
naturallyspeaking is a great tool but it
doesn't keep up with the standards they
haven't implemented any support for aria
and that's something that that all the
screen readers have done this is this is
a I'll give you an example of why that's
actually important this is a very very
new version of a google map and these
things on the interface the the search
button and the the the zoom in and the
zoom out those things all used to be
divs with on click handlers right pretty
straightforward practice very typical
this is something where we could
actually improve that by giving it a div
with a rope mix instead of just having a
div with an on-click that we could
actually give that a roll of button so
that a screen reader or other piece of
assistive technology in theory could
recognize that that's a button so that
there's a more natural affordance there
that hey I can actually click on this
instead of it just being a div in the
page the beautiful thing about this is
that and I just literally saw this with
this new revision of Google Maps they're
actually now buttons like actual buttons
holy crap they're actually buttons and
that totally gets a gold star because
all the semantics of a button are
already in that native element right
this button could be used by dragon
naturallyspeaking the div with the role
of button can't be right so there's a
question about whose responsibility is
this there's there's a lot of people
that are pointing the finger at dragon
and say
you guys are wrong and I want you to
think about this from an aria
perspective this is the last time I
stayed in London I had this in my hotel
room this was a king size bed and so I I
had sleep apnea with the role of king
size bed but it was two twins with a
break in the middle now I complained I'm
Canadian I don't complain so this was a
big deal to me so I complained and I got
a new room and I got a new bed and so in
that bad i had a sleep apparatus and it
was a king with a class of posh thought
everything was great until i dug a
little further and i had a sleep
apparatus with the roller king-size bed
two twins with a break but the break was
styled to be display none if if you
remember nothing else about aria
remember that what's under the sheets
actually matters right the tools and the
code that you use actually have a huge
impact on how assistive technology can
can interpret it and work with it right
so thinking about those kinds of things
and thinking about about dragon and how
it works is it is it our job to be
responsible even though we have a tool
like aria that could really you know
change your app do we have a
responsibility to make some better
choices and actually use things like
like real buttons or just better code in
general my vote is yes but you know
you'll find that out in the next little
while the other the other thing that
that people are asking quite a lot about
these days is stuff about detecting
assistive technology and and I want to
know and as a developer you probably
want to know I've heard it all morning
I'd really like to know is this HTTP one
is at HTTP two is it whatever do we have
the capability to know and my question
to you is if you had if you could detect
a screen reader what would you even do
with that information and there's some
real slippery slopes that we go down
when we do that kind of stuff and say
you know i'll give you one example and
then i'll shut up you know if if we use
a screen reader if we detect this
reader we might inject a whole bunch of
extra hidden headings that give some
extra context to a screen reader user
which is kind of a neat idea I think
there's some some merit to that but we
have to remember that the only people
that uses people that use screen readers
aren't just blind right there's all
kinds of people that use screen readers
for literacy reasons and what's the
impact on them if they have a learning
difficulty if you're having a screen
reader read hidden headings that they
can't see on the page right so we need
to think bigger will address a lot of
those kinds of questions and more during
the during the panel thank you splendid
so we're back to bed components instead
of web components not bad so we have a
lot of experts here we have seven
questions that we cut down on I'm
supposed to get these questions on some
list here but that's not throwing up at
the moment what's going on there so oh
it's a tablet look at that wonderful
touch interface and really small and not
resizable okay so the first question
that we have was supposed by Andrew bets
but I doesn't want to do it so Melanie
lang
what are the main offenders of modern
web sites in terms of accessibility and
what can we and what can be done to fix
that so the question is like in many
time in many cases web developers we do
things that look beautiful and it's a
barrier for accessibility without us
even knowing it so I think we're going
to send it off to Matthew so Matthew
what have you seen in your day-to-day
browsing that drives you nuts although
people think it's amazing I'm there's a
few think I'm sure that there's going to
be many examples from the rest of a
panel but I suppose a personal bugbear
for me is disabling pinch-to-zoom on
mobile sites because that just renders
them completely useless to me personally
I'm vision impaired I can see well
enough to use the device but only if
I've got control over the size of things
on it so that's that's a personal one I
think something to bear in mind is that
somebody bits using an assistive
technology to browse a website say for
example a screen reader but it isn't
limited to just a screen reader they can
only perceive one element at a time so
they go through the whole thing one
element by the next element until they
get to the end and a lot of stuff in
accessibility is providing information
such that the assistive technology can
can help the user get of a bit of a page
they want to get to as quickly as
possible so a lot of stuff is about
saving the user time and making sure
that the structure of a page is conveyed
the semantics are conveyed so that the
user saves time and can get to the bit
they need so things like lack of skip
links lack of headings visually you can
see the layout beautifully but there's
just no semantic information on those
structural information there that's very
frustrating because it might actually be
with a trend on modern sites is towards
things like simpler language fewer words
on the page more focused you know it
could be really good but sometimes
people forget the basics which is just
make sure that you use
HTML headings and lists and stuff like
that Aria if pneus if necessary excuse
me and native controls where possible so
things that save people time and there
is also an article I read recently about
things that just have to go away things
like when you're asked to enter a credit
card number and your asked what type of
credit card is it and please remember to
put the dashes in or don't put dashes in
or put spaces in or you know telling the
user to do this stuff okay for all of
this that's really annoying it shouldn't
be necessary it's just a number but for
accessibility people facing extra
accessibility barriers that sort of
stuff having to go back and correct it
because the instructions weren't
necessarily there or correct that can
really take a lot of time and it's very
frustrating so it's going back to to
like using sensible HTML building things
the way they used to work I remember
when browsers were bad you had to use
the right HTML or otherwise they
wouldn't show up because there was no
CSS so it's need to a degree we then use
tables for different weird things but
that's a different story so um Alice TD
the shockingly innovative way of using
buttons instead of divs with on click
handlers do you have to fight for these
kind of things is there is there a way
that developers are actually assuming
that things work in the browser because
the browser fixes it for them and do we
have to remind people how to make things
accessible standard widgets by and large
it should be accessible one of the big
problems we see is that people just
simply aren't using the standard widgets
and yeah very much like to understand
why my hypothesis is that you can't
style them the way you want so a 22 it
was one your car style the way you want
or they don't behave the way you want so
one thing I would like to see is making
it easier to style custom elements the
way that we want to it's quite difficult
today it's a very simple problem to
solve I think secondly make it easier
for developers to actually apply that
Aria metadata semantics information how
can we get that on our the Golden Path
that we've been talking about today
although the pit of success how can we
make that easier for developers I think
that web components possibly
a big role to play here and I know that
the team is working on that another idea
would be to put it into the developer
tools that were all using so how can we
expose the accessibility information
such that it's impossible to ignore so
wouldn't it be better to make it harder
to put Arielle and stuff how do you mean
well re is a great solution for screen
readers but it's not right now for
dragon and I know in good conscience
that that I I won't but we don't use
Aria unless we know that it's going to
get really good support and that we look
for other ways to do things when we're
building things I almost would like to
make it better to just use a button you
know then to add role equals button
actually yeah completely agree we're
coming back to area in an extra question
later on and I yeah I agree it's it's a
it's a tricky thing to actually to
actually turn something into something
that it isn't when there is something
that is already something but that's a
different story so Andrew what do you
see as like crimes that are happening
that actually makes things in accessible
on mobile devices when you people use
HTML I found it interesting for example
that the unsightly select box that
people hated on the desktop and always
wanted to style is awesome on mobile
devices yeah I'm I think I'm mobile I'm
I think math is already covered it the
biggest one is disabling pinch to zoom
I'm you know I've had so many users come
to me with that with that problem I'm
asking you why does my patients who have
not work on this website and it comes
down to the way we're using the meta
viewport tag and we're all using it to
kind of get rid of the 300 millisecond
delay which I guess in the past my
advice would be to developers you know
think about how you use that but I guess
now going forward I'm thinking you know
should people like myself be getting
more involved with browser vendors to
say okay developers are doing this is
there a way that we can kind of cater
for both scenarios rather than later
developers don't do that is there a way
that we can kind of you know get this
fixed three bugs with the browser's
basically so that's one of the biggest
one I'm I think I'm desktop the the best
bit of our bicycle give to you guys
would be try using the things you build
with a keyboard only I'm so just
recently I was well
with someone who's having a huge problem
with our online banking where they
couldn't complete I'm a payment to
somebody because we're using an overlay
and whoever had built that ad clearly
thought about the interaction with a
mouse things behind their way were
disabled you can click on them or
because this user was using the keyboard
their interaction was going wildly wrong
I'm and if the developer of thought you
know okay maybe why someone's not using
a mouse they prolly would have come up
found that problem quite quickly and you
know cousin something about it cool I'm
very excited at Jake Archibald has a
question but we have to move on to our
next topic so Ross green has a question
for us you're not Ross green I'm not
Ross green but Ross green is not
attending so has asked me to ask the
question and I was a good answer it
because i've got a microphone
accessibility expectations and
requirements are vastly different
depending on the user's world region
what more could be done to align them
example most EU EU rules say don't
autoplay media however most US media
will autoplay the answer is don't
autoplay me and and a slight snark is
well EU rules could be more widely
promulgated if the EU government
websites actually obeyed their own rules
okay the glaring what could be done to
align the different territories
regulations about accessibility so the
good news is that this was hard to
understand the question is basically
there's two folds that there's
differences between accessibility
guidelines in Europe and in America and
you have to for example into government
websites when you do very much basic any
website at face level of audience you
have to apply a apply with them you have
to basically apply the rules and are
different from Europe to America as this
world wide web of us is worldwide kind
of confusing to which ones to follow so
are there ways to actually get the legal
requirements more aligned with each
other so maybe Sarah you could do some
tell us something about that the thing I
find interesting about this question is
it refers to geography which i think is
really important obviously we know
devices very are two very and so forth
but also it's worth understanding and
thinking about how disability varies
globally and internationally so we've
already heard a little bit about say the
nature of disability and how we might
want to conceptualize it but it's worth
or so I think recognizing that
disability means different things in
different parts of the world levels and
types of disability vary depending on
where you are by local region as well as
by by nation so personally I think
there's a bit of attention in terms of
picking a standard to apply in all
situations I think there I mean the
great thing about working is that it's a
glide line and when it's applied as a
guideline it allows perhaps for more of
that indigenous reflection the expertise
of local developers to to come into play
as well so they can account maybe for an
indigenous population with lower
literacy levels or perhaps who have less
assistive technologies at the moment
there's not a great deal of data
globally in terms of the kinds of
technologies that disabled people's
using but obviously we're cog in
particular is being picked up because
the UN Convention on the Rights of
persons with disabilities is being taken
up by more and more countries and people
have this kind of policy vacuum in terms
of information and communication
technologies that are referred to in the
UN Convention and people want to make
sure they're sort of policy is picking
it up so we're CAG is being applied more
and more as the kind of verbatim
standard but I think there's I think
there is a bit of attention in terms of
you know knowing what that means say in
Nepal or Uganda or you know more
regionally it is kind of confusing
because I mean being an extra man
developer and now living here there's
different guidelines even in Europe from
country to country so maybe in point of
the RNIB
you I guess you work with a lot of
people that come to you and say like I
don't want to be sued what can I do for
people with disabilities which is the
awful awful question we keep getting
yeah what what is your answer to that
like how do you get people to understand
that just applying with the law does not
necessarily make an accessible interface
I'm so I think there is a drizzle for me
there is a business case behind
accessibility which will often sorts
companies about arounds you know some
potential SEO benefits potentially
opening up to new markets and i think
when i first got into that sector or
this sexist oreo and you know I kind of
I really did believe in that business
case and I still do but at the same time
it's a little bit theoretical because
you don't have many case studies to back
it up so and their explain about what if
we could detect a screen reader I'm i
think I'm with you that I don't think
it's a good idea to detect the screen
really if you're going to do something
with that information in terms of the
website but I'd really like that feature
as parts of analytics so that you know
we can say okay we made some changes to
the website and we can now see perhaps
you know screen reader users are not
dropping out midway through you know the
process of checking out or something
like that so I'm I'd really like that
kind of stuff because we don't have many
good case studies so whilst we can say
yeah maybe you can get more visitors we
don't have any figures really to my god
oh yeah Derek you used to work on that
for a long time as well like back in
what stays and things with like I mean
we had guidelines that said you have to
have a certain kind of access key on the
page for example and that was not
enforceable or usable really yeah
there's there's a lot of things in you
know you have to remember that
especially when you talk about
guidelines accessibility guidelines and
then talk about giving them the force of
legislation you're taking something that
is designed to be necessarily fuzzy and
putting it into something that becomes
absolute black and white and and I would
even respond to Bruce and say you know
we all said you know everybody laughs I
said well the simple answer is do not
autoplay and I would counter that by
saying that autoplay can actually be
useful for certain types of people
including people that have mobility
difficulties it may be actually much
easier for them
if you do autoplay so that when you go
to a new video page it actually does
play for them they don't have to try and
work hard to actually get it to play so
when we were putting you know embedding
a YouTube video or whatever video on a
side of ours we always recommend have it
embedded and don't autoplay that one but
also link to the YouTube page outside
because then the user has the preference
to set it up so that my videos on
YouTube always autoplay so we're kind of
catering for both both things there so
that you know the edicts like do not
autoplay they sound really good but they
don't necessarily always make sense
autoplay is is bad for everyone except
for the people that need it okay we have
a question from Christopher Emory just
see us the difference for de un us Lord
I just wanted to kind of just with the
ghost of my experience I found it it's
actually even more complicated because
the requirement success if you don't
just live in the government legislature
like for example when you get to a
client you reach the level where they're
now rolling out in difficult markets
they will then have their own
accessibility requirements layer within
that which typically will be based off
one market even though they're running
outlook I mean that's my experience
another right out globally so we've
actually encountered situations whereby
were using writing in one example like
the EU accessibility guidelines even
though we're rolling out in you know the
UAE or
in China and things I love and that
becomes a very weird strange situation
because the document a lot of times that
the accessibility was kind of created
and the companies that was take off the
box to say we yes we have accessibility
guidelines but they didn't roll it out
to the market level just wanted to say
it's you know on top of the gum
legislature there's the actual corporate
layer as well it's a super tricky an old
problem and the issues a lot of people
try to sell an accessibility or
something you could be sued if you don't
do it right but then we don't have the
answer how to do it right it's like
getting someone's attention by kicking
him in the shins like yeah you have to
attention but not the support so Shane
Hudson has a question for us on this not
kicking butt general he's there the man
in the striped shirt so all the work
like the guidelines redundant in a world
of smartphones and tablets our
accessibility laws trying to fix in a
plate as well yeah kind of so basically
the question is the werecat guidelines
define a lot of stuff for example
keyboard accessibility which is on a
touch device a bit of a weird thing to
enforce so neat do they need to be
upgraded do we need to think about
different form factors I think the best
would be just Sarah what do you think I
think this is a problem with the nature
standards in it's quite a lot of
interesting writing about what standards
do sort of outside of development
communities so so for example they offer
a fix perspective which is what I think
some of us struggling with in the sense
that disability is so hetero genic that
it needs to sort of it be as inclusive
as possible and the standard rather than
a guideline is difficult um so so I
think yeah there are these these
problems about how it keeps abreast of
new developments which we can't
necessarily for see but I think one of
the things which I find interesting is
that standards also convey certain
values
and as I say when they're being picked
up internationally there's it's useful
to recognize that they also promote the
rights of people with disabilities and
they promote fair access to technology
and raise a kind of whole argument about
human rights disability rights which
isn't necessarily reflected in all the
communities of these standards touch
upon so that's that's one of the things
I think which we need to also keep front
and center Matthew in terms of gaming I
mean depart yellow group does a great
job in explaining on their blog what how
to apply YK guidelines how to apply best
technologies and most people start with
a blank canvas with no keyboard
accessibility whatsoever for their game
so do you think that the wac heck is
outdated do I'll be fixing the web from
997 rather than the web from 2005 a
couple of things first of all the gaming
stuff is separate to my tpg stuff but
I'm very happy to talk about it of
course you don't get fired Sarah made a
really good point last night which I'm I
just wanted to make sure came up which
is that a screen reader could be a
person next to you reading what's on the
screen in a particular place you were
saying about different countries have
different social views of accessibility
and different access to 80's and and
therefore screen readers that detection
would have to encompass reading glasses
and people sat next to you as well on
both of these at the same time perhaps
anyway I'm moving on transferring the
actual question
a couple of points one of them is that
the if you look at work Hank and there's
a lot to read but the central points
that it's trying to get across and the
values that Sarah mentioned they're
actually written down in there they are
over poor principles that your content
needs to be perceivable operable
understandable and robust and you can
look up what those are but you get the
general idea you can apply those kind of
principles to any medium now some of the
wicked stuff might be less appropriate
unmowed while some of a very specific
technical stuff but a lot of the
guidelines in fact well all of them are
written with that those four principles
in mind and you can apply those to any
medium so in terms of game accessibility
that is about making sure that you know
what information is important to someone
to be able to play this game what is the
best way to present it to the particular
audience that you're thinking about in
our case it was blind people so it was
making a lot of visual cues auditory
instead understandable that well it's
got to be understandable to be able to
be enjoyable in the case of a game and
in the case of a banking website it's
got to be understandable in order to be
able to use it and robust that covers
the kind of security and reliability
stuff on the website side of things and
I'm the game side of things you dont
want it to crash just before you're
going to complete the level so very
briefly that is you know a very glib
high level trying to demonstrate you can
apply these things to multiple areas so
Ellis when you put that into the
developer tools accessibility panel I
mean those of us who have been
inaccessible long enough remember Bobby
approved and people would like Triple A
badges on their website which ironically
didn't have an alternative text of what
are the testing tools that you thought
you have in there do you get like this
doesn't apply with that guideline or is
it more of a transcription of the
perceivable and that the ideas of it
because it's easy for a developer to say
like oh I'm now accessible because I
take all the boxes but what does it
really mean what kind of a test tool
would help people there one point that I
always try to make with the
accessibility developer tool is that
passing mechanical accessibility audit
does not in any way guarantee that
you're completely accessible it's only
looking at the things that we can test
programmatically which is a subset that
said what it does look at are things
like color contrast it looked it tries
to look for click targets and suggests
that you should use an aria role and
keep I had leaned it also looks for
valid Aria use it yeah so those are
those are sort of the main things that
it's looking at yeah so but one point I
did want to make just to follow on that
the the robust in perceivable operable
understandable robust actually
encapsulate working in different
modalities which actually implies that
it should work on different devices so
when we're talking about mobile tablet
even something like Google glass or a TV
or a leap robust encapsulate Saul of
that good Matthew had a question or
you're pulling it she covered everything
you do I just want to show that somebody
from google it was something to say
about accessible so as I have you here I
I once made it a comment about changing
an outline in CSS and basically changing
the background color for the focus I got
slated immediately on Twitter for this
it's not accessible and I'm fine with
that and I'm kinda like well what what
is the right way to do it as apart me
that's like well can I apply filters to
my site that says this is what a screen
reader will see or like what should I be
doing in my workflow that basically
helps me as a developer make my site
more accessible I guess are there tools
is there something you'd recommend or is
it just a case of use native components
use the accessibility thing and use that
so using and now you know seventy-five
percent of all statistics are made up so
you can get probably giant one of some
people know
yeah you can you can get you know eighty
five eighty to ninety percent of the way
accessible by testing everything with a
keyboard and you have to manually test
that because that's interaction there's
no way to test it other than that but
dealing with like straight up good solid
semantic markup that using just writing
good HTML and not screwing up keyboard
access gets you eighty to ninety percent
of the way there straight up honest
honest truth now using it with the
keyboard is going to show you stuff
about your outline changes right you're
going to go through and you know say
shit I can't see the cursor I have no
idea where I am I have to stop this
cursing right now actually and we this
is a longer topic that we could go on so
I'm moving on to actually add Soudan
which is actually covering this a bit so
add soda has a question yeah mr. Snowden
a soda so as developers we often try and
make our sites work well for screen
readers there's there anything else we
can do besides screen readers when we're
designing our sides to make them better
for accessibility that is an incredibly
interesting question that we haven't
quite covered yet or trust did or tried
so Andrew what do you think the big
screen reader debate every developer I
talked to like it works with a screen
reader because that's something I can
test with what else should we be
thinking about and now it's a great
question and I could make up some stats
now but am I going to go ahead and in
the UK there's some around two million
people that have some kind of sites
related issue and the vast majority of
those have some residual useful vision
so the thing you can take away from that
is quite a small percentage of those two
million people are using a screen reader
the rest of them are making some kind of
visual adaptations to the page and I
think you can extrapolate that to around
the world issues so think around the
world it's something like 280 million
people have some site related issue so
things that you can do that I'm not
related to a screen reader I'm and this
kind of applies to all those you think
about using a website out and
out a color contrast the size of your
fonts how much white spaces between
controls so so when he's using a screen
magnifier MLC sites sometimes where
there's a form and maybe there's two
buttons at the end next in previous the
really far apart from each other I if
someone's using a screen magnifier I
think Matt kind of touched on this
before it's a little bit different when
the screen magnifier but you see a
portion of the screen at any one time I
those either everyone pretty much how's
max here you'll all have a screen
magnifier built in windows as well so
you can try us out if you want another
way to think about it is if you imagine
like sliding a credit card around your
screen is imagine that was your viewport
so if the buttons are far apart you know
there's potential to miss them so just
that that kind of stuff is worth
thinking about and that's nothing today
with screen readers at all yeah that's a
very good point I love the credit card
thing I didn't think about that yet my
favorite is always when people now
everything comes with screen readers was
just great for accessibility for people
but it also is kind of bad because
developers think they know how these
things work now the amount of people I
see using a screen reader with their
eyes open is amazing and that defeats
the purpose because of course you can
understand your system so James F lee
has a question or was that already about
the last topic ok good so you have
another one I think differently on
glasses and awesome to simulate of roses
yeah so testing testing this kind of way
works I mean I gave people broken mice
to actually use the website for example
with yeah there's there's tons of things
that you can do like that to you know to
simulate different types of disability
and and I believe that all of those
things are great you know user you know
emulating what a user with a particular
type of disability would be you can you
want to see what it's like for somebody
that has a tremor in their hand to use
their use a mouse turn your mouse
sideways and try to manipulate it
the screen and you'll you know or use
the wrong hand there's all kinds of
things that you can do the one thing
that I would point out I think those are
those are great things to do the what
cat guidelines are designed specifically
because we know and I say we like I was
involved or something but we can't all
go and test with real people and so
those guidelines are all in place
because they're based on years and years
of people actually working with with
with people with disabilities so that
those are if you like absolutely
valuable and useful and everybody should
do it but if you can't do that then you
have guidelines as your as your sort of
first point of advice and I absolutely
go back to it but if you can't just feel
at least partially confident that those
those guidelines are there to replace
the fact that everybody can't do
actually I feel completely someone
coming from what I also feel that's a
bit of a cop-out in terms of I think I
think sometimes standards step in and
people want to learn the standard
because that's the easy thing to do and
they want to turn the most sideways and
do that when sometimes they have
disabled populations sitting right under
the nose so for example in the
university sector there are hundreds of
disabled students at King's College
London how many are involved in testing
our systems you know they're right there
we could easily engage with them so I
think there isn't it's important to be
creative and think about people drawing
people into this conversation so if
you're doing usability testing at large
don't be afraid of you know contacting
say disabled people's organizations or
quickly call out for people to get
involved in testing your systems because
they will give you much richer feedback
about how your your interfaces work and
they're going to bring up things that
you just would not have imagined
possible will be interesting to see if
what kind of I mean you can take the
glasses away from your colleagues for
example or you can read out your text on
the screen to somebody on the phone if
it done if it then makes sense you know
it's an accessible text if it's if you
need the thing to see to understand it
and it then you don't like that's a lot
of what be interesting to set up a wiki
or something about these like little
accessibility hacks to simulate
different things but our outreach to
real people with real dis
hardcore users that know how to use
something is amazing I mean I learned
most working mixer PHP developer was
blind for like four years and I was just
incredible because he told it faster
than me which was annoying now with the
sense of dread Patrick lauki as a
question no question of calling
statement now just a quick note I wanted
to pick up just on something that was
mentioned at the start they're about I
did something to my outline and I was in
thinking he jumped upon by you know an
accessibility lynch mob the dirty color
truth even within the pizzello group
button and I can say that hopefully
openly is that you get three
accessibility experts you get five
different opinions we disagree even on
sometimes very fundamental things like
you know very first our line of work out
you know you know having appropriate old
texts we could have and discussions for
days about what is the most appropriate
alt text for this and you'll get fierce
debates in the accessibility community
about every event should have this kind
of all old or go women should have homes
and so just want to do kind of temper
the whole when you get people jumping on
you and immediately shouting oh that's
not accessible they may be I don't then
may not be right and as Derek mentioned
towards the stars that is not a binary
thing it's not always is either
accessible warning system there's
certainly things that you can do that
completely screw everybody over they
can't see the screen perfect in use a
mouse but beyond that that's there's
lots of shades of grey yeah also stop
arguing on Twitter 140 characters are
not good to actually bring emotions or
facts in we've got Nicki Obama here
because christopher has had too many
things already
so basically I did a bit of a start
check a check that there are about 2.7
million people in Britain who have color
blindness and haven't seen that
mentioned in this talk yet do we
consider people who are colorblind to be
disabled or are they anything that
people generally can do to improve their
pages to prove that the looks of color
Brian I'm a stable I met a few unstable
colorblind people in my part I think
you're I think your tools Alice I mean
you said you talked about like the color
distance but also color blindness ours
one of these simulators in there isn't
it no not even not in my tool actually
well that can't be fixed there are there
are extensions for certainly for Chrome
probably felt the browser's vote will
simulate color blindness and contrast
ratio is also and it has a color
blindness implication in that you know
say if you have like red on white if you
view that as great may not be high
enough contrast ratio Derek you were
twitching a little there's a great tool
color Oracle yeah which you can install
at the desk top level that it will
transform everything and you can you can
simulate things it doesn't you know the
two challenges with color blindness and
I'm saying this is a very blanket
statement so there's probably more
challenges but one is the color contrast
issue the other is the way that you're
using colour to convey information right
if you're relying on color then you need
to it's not we're not saying don't rely
on color use color as much as you want
but use other mechanisms to indicate
things as well so it could be you know
could be that you're using pattern with
color or instead of just using color
think of a line graph that has a legend
at the bottom instead of putting the
legend at the bottom change your graph
so that each one of the individual
legend pieces actually up beside the
line so that you can then follow the
line it's also ties into into
internationalization my famous when
people just use red as a warning whereas
in China meets good luck good luck we
lost all your emails
Oh God lots of questions so let's have
one here the man in the loud shirt sorry
buy my shirt I was just thinking we
talked a lot today about web performance
and things like that and about how does
the whole performance piece fit into
accessibility we'll see one kind of
coming to mind as things being too fast
where where we're constantly working to
speed things up you know is there cases
in accessibility where we actually just
slow it down so what you know that there
was a few of I had a few thoughts when
listening to all the other performance
things and one of the things that I
heard was you know what's in the first
15 15 kilobytes and that I started to
think you know what what should be in
the first 15 kilobytes for somebody that
has a particular type of disability and
and I don't know the answer that
question i think it's it's a great one
i'm not sure about slowing things down
in most technology most screen reading
technology and other technologies they
work on top of browsers that are not
their own thing generally speaking so
thank you I'm where I'm kind of coming
from this back full of perception if
something changes on the screen too
quickly and it becomes harder to detect
that change
so are you talking about in response to
some event that's happened on the page
or like an initial load or these are
more like UX problems just no no I think
like drop-down menu yeah just just just
case of stuff changing either natural
light in a carousel which is kind of
automative or in response to an action
also on a carousel for example we always
you have to have if it autoplay is you
have to be able to turn it off and you
have to be able to start it up again so
I'm not sure that that's really slowing
it down from the performance perspective
but you should definitely allow for
somebody to manually go through the
carousel if you have to have one on your
on your page we also do things like if
the carousel container when you detect
keyboard usage within that container we
automatically stop stop it from rotating
so that it immediately becomes a manual
thing if you're moving through with the
keyboard so that you basically take a
you know screen reader that's on that on
that content if it's suddenly whisked
away quite often what happens that you
know if the note is just slit slit nice
board if the node slides out out to the
side that's different than if the note
is destroyed and in some of these cases
scream your focus is lost and they have
to start at the start over at the top of
the page so that's that's something
where we want to kind of give them a
little bit more info we are running the
danger here getting into implementations
and explaining you how to do a certain
widget and as we all open to a
discussion for that it would be
wonderful to ask her get a few questions
sorted and then we can answer offline
because they rewrite you know it would
be like do it like this or do it like
that so to answer the broader question
about timing there there is language amo
KAG about how how long things should
take how much time you should allow for
things so that maybe gets a bit more of
your question and also like to me raises
a bit of a broader question which is I'm
curious how many web developers have
even looked at work out to quite a few
cool just like to me it seems like this
it's a great set of guidelines for
creating good user interfaces so for
example things like a
going error correction in forms like do
we not all want that do we not all want
the form to lose all of our data if we
make a single mistake so yeah I think
the web would be better for everybody if
we offer lagu KAG and this is this an
example of something which is in there
which we like could learn about just
from reading the guidelines and of
course there's more the stuff that's not
in there or their stuff that their needs
more information that is a really great
place to start okay risk we are running
out of time you're a bit so we're
skipping one of the questions that I've
seeded sadly enough we have one from
aralia Moser here I skipped down Apple
quest he can deal with it ok I'm
wondering how do you prioritize
accessibility in your workflow and right
now it seems that reactive is something
you need to do so happen when you make
it just the thing to do it's the old
question of like where's the
accessibility plug-in that I can put at
the end of my workflow how do you how do
you get accessibility into the workflow
from the very beginning in a cutthroat
environment that has not much time Derek
it's got to be moved earlier in the
process if it gets too if it gets to the
end and you're finding accessibility
issues for the first time in QA or as
you're preparing it for QA it's too late
it has to be done at the design level
and I think if you focus very loosely on
you know design development and QA as
kind of three important pieces not
thinking about the business side it's
important but the the focusing on the
transition points i think is is critical
so having designers talk with developers
and specking things out not like as in
the spec but here's what my intent is
with this design and so that a design
can specify things like here's how the
keyboard flow should work for this
particular widget or for this page
here's the the most you know even
working on it together here's the most
logical source order you know looking at
this wire frame and the hierarchy of
content here's the most logical source
order for that and having that stuff
passed all the way down the chain is to
me is one of the most critical things
that that would help address that's what
it happens early
and we don't get to the end and say
Andrew what do you think I'm this is
someone else's point of view i cant
rember whose article it was but he was
talking about how the first time you do
something it is difficult when it takes
you longer to do it so if you guys can
remember the first time you built a
website it was quite hard and it took
your long time the first time you built
a responsive site it would have been you
know your mind might have been a bit
blowing like this is taking me a long
time but then the next time you do it
it's easier the next time you do it
again it's easier then it just becomes
normal and it's kind of like that with
accessibility it always seems hard
because it's not something you'll do day
to day but if you kind of if you do
invest a bit of time and effort into
doing it a couple of times your workflow
will change and it just will become
something you do naturally I can't
remember whose opinion that was but I
really like to read it if I completely
agree with that and I completely agree
with various things that have been said
before like for example just try it out
with a keyboard as you're doing it I
mean the most important thing is as
Derek pointed out to do it from a very
start from the design process but you're
all going to be dealing with stuff that
already exists and there is some things
I think I'll lift mentioned
accessibility testing you can't do it
all mechanically but some of it you can
and practice is going to sound odd
coming from me because I'm very much
reliant on me going to look at a site
and finding accessibility problems with
it but there are a whole range of things
that you can test me mechanically for
example does every image have an alt
attributes very simple thing now one of
my colleagues is working on or has
developed at all an API in fact it's in
going to be in beta soon it's called
tenon which can perform these tests that
can be automated and it will go away and
perform them and because it's a command
line thing you can make it part of your
build process so if there were two
biggest things I would say is perhaps
look at that see what it can do for you
because it can be part of your build
process a human being does not need to
waste their time on
of this stuff and the other thing is
make sure that you can you know
challenge yourself to like Christian
said take away the mouse for a while and
see if you can still use your site some
stuff like that you can really reduce
the amount of time and effort it takes
by making it part of your process and as
much as possible please do try and
consider it from the design stage from
big from the absolute get-go and then
there's the other sorts of advice that
you've heard just generally sprinkled
through about testing things with a
keyboard and and stuff like that I'm
like to just interject a little bit of
sociology because I know part of the
issue is that it has to be a team effort
across your entire team some people are
going to value accessibility more than
others and I think it's trying to
position accessibilities part of a norm
which is understanding that disabled
people aren't an out-group they're part
of your in group so at the moment
there's a term aversive disabled ism so
most people these are quite liberal they
don't discriminate against disabled
people but if you're designing for your
group and that group doesn't include
disabled people then you might as well
be making disabled list judgments
because you're still excluding the
outputs are still the same so in that
sense it's it's important to sort of
expand our concept of who a normal user
is to include disabled people you know I
think we know okay we have to rev up so
I i have to thank the panel and I
credibly excited about all of your
interest because having worked in
accessibility and having to shout at
people for years to consider
accessibility it's great that there is a
new way there it's kind of disheartening
that we have to remind people about
something there seems to be a
communication gap between the
accessibility evangelists and the
developers out there and a lot of things
can be repeated that have been said a
few times so I'm really happy about this
so take this idea take this enthusiasm
about it out there and pester as many
people as possible who know about
accessibility and if you get grumpy
answers as Patrick set we're just people
too so that just happens so thanks very
much again and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
