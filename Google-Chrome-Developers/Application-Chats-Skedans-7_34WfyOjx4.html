question and that is how many in the
room think that WebRTC is about browser
to browser communication without a
plug-in couple okay so that's that
surprises me a little bit i thought i'd
see a lot more hands than that going up
is it maybe even four months ago i was
talking to somebody that's a consultant
in the industry and ask the question
where's the value and what is WebRTC
about and that's what I got back it's
about browser browser communication
without a plug-in and you know when I
started working on this about little
over two and a half years ago it was
it's not just about that that's part of
what the value is but it's really about
the underlying system that enables that
and enables it turns it into a web app
development problem if you like there's
probably 20 plus years of work it was on
the voice I'd of that slide that was up
there a minute ago whether that's
natural getting through firewalls the
ice protocol and all the various things
that are underneath that went into
making that work and we've now
abstracted that to the point that a web
app developer or a mobile app developer
can very quickly and very easily set up
a real-time application in a
peer-to-peer mode however if the network
settings aren't set correct you've got
to have this thing called turn that sits
out there if you want to get outside of
four maybe five parties you're going to
have to have some kind of selective
forwarding and that puts underneath the
need for now a platform that has to
exist in order to enable this
application to actually run you saw a
couple of those that popped up on the
slides in there so what skedans is about
at the heart of the system there's a
what we call platform RTC which is built
on some of those components that I just
described the ability to do traversal
the ability to put the signaling element
in to say who needs to connect to to who
in a very flexible fashion so not just
as a telephone call her a video call and
that kind of a paradigm but how do you
shift
that media around and how do you connect
groups that need to be connected when
they need to be connected we use the
peer-to-peer fashion where it can be
used we're smart about where we keep
media if it's going to stay inside of a
local area network why move it out if
that's where it's going to be produced
and consumed replayed stored then keep
it where it needs to be on top of that
once we built this out there was an
application that this did basically web
chat through a browser there was a guy
in the commercial drone industry it was
doing a test flight on a range in North
Carolina it was going into the Fort
Wayne Indiana police department to do a
demo and his streaming server went down
not given him access to our online
system called talk and he got it had his
own room in there and he couldnt get a
hold of his engineer to bring that
streaming server back up and he's like
well i'm not going to cancel the the
demo and try to get another meeting so
what he did is he called the engineer
north carolina and he said i want you to
go to this URL talk tom / jason and we
tell me i'm going to tell you to do a
screen share with me you can see what
he's going to do with this they sets it
up on the other side plugs it in does
his screen share they can see the video
coming off of the drone and then he
decides he's going to take it one step
further it's like hey wouldn't it be
cool if we can talk to the pilot in real
time his system didn't do that but he
knew that this this would work yeah
that'd be cool so they get into a
conversation with the pilot and then the
next step was well wait a minute I got
somebody this will even be neater one of
the guys with a laptop hey use chrome go
to this URL now comes together and the
light bulb went on and said we've now
got command and control we can see the
video that's streaming in off of the
drone we can see its telemetry data we
can see where it is we can talk to the
pilot who's remote to us and we can see
all of this together and all
participating parties and they said we
had to have that we need to have this so
that was what exposed to me that wait a
minute the the drone element if you will
is really an IOT element it just happens
to come and go and move around quite a
bit an absolute explosion in that market
that you see on a deal
basis and there's a number of use cases
that we've now uncovered the outset of
public safety as well to utilize the
platform but at the heart of it it is
this platform RTC concept that we expose
and that's basically just an api
platform that allows you to get to the
heart of the signaling your underlying
media transport and media infrastructure
that's associated with WebRTC and then
we can expose that now into the
application space where a web developer
or a mobile developer can make use of
that how we doing on time Chris I can
keep talking for quite a while let's
just open up for a couple of questions
then since we got a minute or two in
here and I know the next speaker is a
tight on time be questioned any
questions for Doug's that's pretty
interesting actually I mean why would
you pick the WebRTC over I mean nothing
over numerous other possibilities if you
look at it again it was it's the the
ability to develop that application very
quickly and to prove this is faster than
anything else I mean you there's a
number of networks that you need to
traverse across here so you need a way
to be able to use the underlying
transport if you will that exists coming
out of the VoIP side of the signaling
world but you could I take a sip client
if you wanted to and kind of build
something like that out but you haven't
got that abstraction now back to making
it really into a web development or
mobile development problem the the way
the pilots control these drones is
really through a mobile application it's
through a tablet and so you need to be
able to interact with that very easily
and again it's the ability for people on
the other side that are interacting that
could be a desktop client or it could be
a browser-based thing and there is no
faster way to develop that than using
WebRTC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
