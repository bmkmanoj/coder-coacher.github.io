technical knowledge do you think that it
can help make the creative process
bergeon and grow or do you think it can
hinder the creative process it can go
both ways but I've definitely found
myself early in my career
kind of noticing that yeah I I've
started thinking about how to actually
implement a design and that sometimes
hindered my design process because I was
thinking so much of how to actually make
the solution happen
that's quite challenging things how did
you've managed to break through so it's
not stopping you but maybe enhancing the
stuff that you actually do I think one
of the things that I always struggled
with is that from the visual standpoint
like I'm not a super talented visual
designer I've seen some amazing visual
designers that I'm just like oh my
goodness like that is really really
slick and I love that and that's not
like my strengths and so I was a lot
came back more from like the coding or a
perspective being able to actually
implement some stuff in code which they
couldn't but you know there was this
kind of this deciding factor of
realizing am i more of a designer or
more of a developer like you know I'm
not necessarily that great at graphics
but there's still so many other ways of
design that can kind of spread in so
really like doing some research and
finding about more about UX design and
realizing that is really kind of
wondered what I wanted to focus on it's
kind of what led me to that so it's
definitely was this this kind of process
of navigating through it's like where do
I fit in my designer and my developer
were you know from the first projects
that I started doing you know a lot of
time I did a lot of websites and when
people come to you they go hey we need a
website built they don't necessarily say
hey we need some front-end developer to
come and come do this especially if
you're working with the smaller
businesses and clients so you do take on
the designer and developer hat to kind
of make that happen a lot of developers
are very afraid to learn about design
it's like as I get question question
like if I was to write an article the
perfect article for the developers would
be how to how to learn to design or how
do you then which makes no sense to me
because learning to design doesn't
really mean anything it's just like what
part of design you know what discipline
to resign but there's still that
question of okay what is the first step
that's someone who wants to really as
someone who's gone through this process
yourself what was your first step to say
okay that's it I'm becoming a designer
right I think you know following a lot
of design patterns at that time I didn't
really understand that they were called
design patterns right you kind of you
implement them in the site's doing a lot
of web work you kind of take on okay the
navigation menu where does that live and
you're following a lot of the patterns
that have already been created and so
you kind of learn to explore through
that and then you know testing out the
site and realizing oh this doesn't feel
right like something's off let's let's
work on how to make this better but I
think one of the the great things that
can really help designer or developers
wanting to go into design is looking at
a lot of like the material spec
guidelines they're actually really
really helpful because not only does it
actually tell you hey here's some
guidelines of what to follow but it
actually doesn't really got a good job
of explaining why you're doing that yeah
exactly so that actually is really
helpful because then you're able to
understand why was this created like
what was the thought process behind
adding potentially a bottom navigation
or why would you have a side side nav
you know it's it's really getting to
kind of explaining that so you're able
to learn from learn from actually
interacting with something and seeing
how they're doing it but also getting
finding out why they decided to do that
because I think well so much of design
is some of its problem solving right so
so many people forget that when I think
of design they think of the finished
product but there's so many different
stages of how you got to that finished
product and so a lot of it being able to
understand how someone was thinking
through that really really helps you
from a development perspective get into
that design field of understanding okay
how do I get from thinking of how do I
develop this versus how do I even arrive
to the solution I think that's the
that's kind of the big difference there
as developers you know you have
something that's already designed for
you for the most part I mean some people
get handed things some people get handed
an iOS mock and said hey make this and
make this into Android so then at that
time you kind of become an Android
designer in that aspect what you think
is like the biggest thing that stops
developers really understanding design
one of the things that we do at Google
is we do design sprints so the design
Sprint's are really great because it
brings people from all the different
disciplines and specialties together to
work into solving a challenge that we
have you know so you have product
managers engineers designers researchers
everyone in the room together and kind
of thinking and working through a
problem which is really fantastic
because you get all these different
ideas and one of the things that I
really notice is where as we're bringing
in designers you know and engineers and
all these people together is when we're
walking through the challenge the
engineers are already thinking of the
solution
yeah and already thinking about how to
implement it they go straight to that
which makes sense that that is their
role right as engineers usually you are
given something and you have to go oh
how do i how do I make this happen how
do I like thinking through
problem-solving how to actually get to
that solution where as designers we
don't know what the solution necessarily
is so I think a lot of the blockers is
automatically wanting to know the answer
yeah instead of being more aware and
being okay with saying you know I don't
know the answer to that but let's let's
explore it together yeah so I think
that's the biggest hindrance that can
really stop developers and to getting
into design and is wanting to have all
the answers it's it's okay not to have
them I mean and what do you think
developers can actually do to get past
that I mean because I find like for me
it's always sketching and just
experimenting and so I suppose is how
does the developer maintain that kind of
playful space where they're not thinking
right here's the library we're going to
use to do like or whatever widget or fab
or whatever but what can they actually
do that allows them to to not thinking
about like the end result or breaking
from that cycle yeah you actually bring
up a great point with sketching that's
probably one of my favorite exercises
when I'm working with different people
to get them thinking of solutions so if
you're developing an app or so is hey
let's get some sketches out there get a
sharpie and just start sketching out
through some ideas because that really
that doesn't you can really get some
ideas on paper and not be merry
to them you know and not feel like
really connected because you spent all
this time developing the solution and
realizing oh it doesn't really work and
so if you start really low fidelity with
some sketches that can really open up
your mind in terms of thinking about
different solutions because as you're
sketching through it you're realizing oh
like maybe I want to use this fab button
or something everyone loves fab right so
you want to incorporate it somewhere and
then you realize hmm maybe that's not
the right thing to do and I haven't
spent all this energy developing or even
designing this so then I can kind of
toss that and move on and create a
different solution so sketching I think
is a great resource instead of people go
straight a lot of people like to
prototype in the code but I usually like
to challenge people and go hey start
sketching some ideas and then once
you've landed on something that you
think you want to explore some more then
dive into code or dive into sketch or
whatever your you're using so I suppose
for the engineer to really understand
design it's almost like okay just start
sketching first and start thinking about
the thing you're going to build and the
possibilities rather then straight to
the in solution one of the things I
really noticed there was the way really
good designers responded to constraints
you know you think about I don't like
black and white photography or jewtown
prints whatever their responses to
restrictions on the medium</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
