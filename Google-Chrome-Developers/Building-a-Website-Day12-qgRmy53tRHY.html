developer diary for the chrome dev
summit website with me your host no
don't I'm not going I'm not taking in
that direction we've got this far
without me being ridiculous too
ridiculous let's just move on um so good
news yay thing that I've added to the
website is this this little this little
but in the corner however when you click
on the little button out comes the
notification settings for the chrome dev
summit website yay so the idea we had
was well you know obviously pushes a
thing let's add it to the site and so
that people can be notified when any of
the sessions start or as you see if that
event updates like I don't know I'm
sorry we're running late or don't forget
to get your you know passes or whatever
whatever people need so when you click
on it I guess I've already yeah there
you go show notifications so I'll allow
that and it goes off on the back it
sends the registration across to the
backend server and then there we go once
it's got a response back from the
backend server that storing these
subscriptions does that and I'm saying
what let me register for Darren's
keynote like so over here on my other
machine that you can't see that I can
see that is down here that's why I point
it I've got my admin interface for the
backend server bear with me and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to let's let's
pretend let's pretend you and I now that
it is in fact the day of the chrome dev
summit and and you know we're off we're
we're doing whatever we're doing
whatever and we send out the
notification for the keynote and all
being well known but there we go in the
top corner chrome dev summit the keynote
with Darin Fisher is starting now and
then when you click on it because it be
the live will actually take you into the
chrome dev summit site or whatever
annual have the live stream and off you
go great okay let me show you around the
code quickly for the things that I think
are in
resting if you're interested I can show
you the back end code in another bonus
dev diary just let us know in the
comments for now I'm just going to be
concentrating purely on the front end
stuff and a lot of it is actually state
management so I'm not going to dive into
too much of that because it is quite
saddened it security have they click
this button have they done that but I
I'll show you what I think hopefully
makes sense so the thing is the first
thing that I suppose is in the service
work installation bit I listen on the
ready of the service worker installation
and if there is a push manager in the
registration then i initialize my push
manager which i change this morning to
push handler but i haven't pushed the
code to github yet so this is still the
old name for it cuz I didn't want to
conflict with the actual push manager
I'm an idiot like anybody needed a
reminder however nonetheless we have
this in it and in the in it we have this
setup which is going to basically fetch
from the remote server which you'll see
is the CD s push up spot calm and when
it fetches that and pulls that back I've
set it so that CD s push at BOTS comp
will respond with the public key that
you that it needs in order to do the
registration okay so we get that and we
basically store that back now I'm using
Jake's ID be key valve to do this
because his ID BTW val is basically is
like this lightweight super lightweight
thing that sits on top of index DB that
makes it behave more like local stores
because i do unlike name value pairs but
i don't want to spend all my time I
don't use local storage because it's
synchronous and it can be slow
apparently and I db's you know is the
right call here but I don't want to do
all the kind of transaction open a
database bubble butt online that it's
not a nice API and so Jake's written
this anybody eval which kind of does the
Get Set delete keys all that kind of
stuff and it's really nice and
lightweight so I'm using that so we
basically store the app key and then we
basically do a bunch of updating of the
initial view which is set up the
controls make sure that any buttons that
are on
green say the right thing so that if
you've if you come back into the site so
for example let's go actually let me
show you this when we go to the schedule
now and I go to Darrin's keynote it says
notifications enabled it already says
that because that's what that that
functions doing it's basically looking
for any of those in the update current
view it's looking for any of the
existing buttons in the page and it says
switch them to notifications enabled or
disabled depending on what we've
actually got in there in the key Val the
IDB key val value for that session and
that's largely what that stuff is going
to be doing it's like finally I you see
a bit current view find the notification
buttons you know find from the Arabic
eval whether it's disabled or enabled
for that particular thing and so on
processing changes is not till it
disables all the buttons finds out what
the current value is updates it using
this push manager and then it you know
there's a bit of toasting and all the
rest of it to go and say what happened
the actual getting of a subscription is
quite interesting you ask the service
worker and if there is a subscription
already and with the key hasn't changed
that public key on the server hasn't
changed since you can just return it
otherwise i set the key val for the app
key and i asked the registration for a
subscription and you have to set this
user visible only to true today in
chrome it basically is the key that says
if i get a push message i will
definitely show a notification and the
other thing is the application server
key which is a base64 encoded version of
the public key or something no no no no
it's not actually you have to convert
the base64 over to a human eight array I
don't know why I'll be honest with you
it was one of those moments when I saw
that I was like I mean surely if I gave
it a base64 encoded string it would be
able to do it for me maybe I should give
that feedback
anyway push manager handles the kind of
global do you have a subscription if not
do you want one all that kind of stuff
the push controls not a lot to really
talk about here I mean I know there's a
like it looks like there's a little bit
of showbiz going on with that kind of
whoo and the whoo but really you know
mostly know and so the way it actually
works is in fact let me just slow it
down in devtools and you'll see this
actually in Canary it's a bit blurry so
I might take a look at that today fell
it's got ten percent speed and okay the
elements that are doing things are these
there's this which is that basically
it's the button and then there's the
headline and then there's the list and
the headline and the list that basically
faded out and they're transformed down
by a hundred percent of the containing
element when they're when it collapsed
like this and faded out so I as I have a
ripple inside here and the ripple
basically expands to be big enough and
it's in so this okay go back this
containing element is however big it
needs to be and the ripple always
expands and it's overflow hidden so the
ripple expands its just a circle that
gets bigger it basically hits the edge
of their that block and just disappears
okay that's one bit then the meanwhile
the button and the note of the headline
and the list they're just basically
sliding up and fading in and because of
the timing of it mostly you don't really
see there you go and it's all scales
transforms all the usual and opacity how
do we make it friendly for the
compositor usual tricks a little
smattering of will change or whatever
and you get you get that effect there
you go and then the picking up the
buttons is again it just tells the push
manager oh this you know they clicked on
they clicked on this and so it disables
the buttons makes the remote request
when it comes back it enables all the
right final piece of the jigsaw today is
what happens in the service worker when
you know you got that the message coming
in look how does that work well when the
when you have a registration there's an
end point and some keys and that's
mostly it that you send to your server
and there's a library called web dash
push which we can link to in the notes
and it will it generates all the keys
you need and does all the things you
need to have a server in JavaScript to
basically encrypt a payload which is
great and ping the endpoint that you got
from the subscription process and that's
what does yeah so that means that on the
client side on the on the chrome side
there's in the service worker that you
register this on push so that when the
endpoint gets pinged so you make your
registration you got an endpoint you
send that to the server the server then
pings it with a payload that causes
whichever messaging service is actually
underpinning all this to actually
pingback your service work and go by the
way a thing happen hey which we get in
the on push right so that's what happens
as we pin the endpoint and I get the
payload I give it is actually the slug
of the session so like / dev summit
/schedule / keynote something like that
and what I then do is I just sort of set
up an initial an initial payload for
this the push then the notification and
then I basically I look up the sessions
and I go through and I look to see if
the URL matches the the slug that I was
sent right yeah hope that makes sense
the session being you know what was
actually posted from is part of push
notification so if I see like / dev
summit /schedule / keynote I'll go oh
it's the keynote with Darin Fisher is
starting now and i set the icon to be
the image of the speaker
which takes me to the next part of the
process where I do something that I'm
I'm not that fond of I'll be honest with
you it feels a bit funny but all the
same it works I take that and I find the
image in the cache and then I get a blob
of the image and then I use a file
reader to read that image as a data URL
and then i set the icon to be that base
64 encoded image URL which then means
that i can show notification with the
title and a message that's been
generated entirely from the cache your
alternative is to just sort of assume
that hey they were they were had a good
enough connection to get a push they
probably have enough data to go out and
get the image and the text or whatever I
feel like sending them but that's a
request that doesn't need to be made in
my view and also it means that my server
has to be able to go okay who are you
what do you need to know oh here's the
image you need and here's that whatever
I seemed like it was worth doing to me
it felt like it was sort of a case of
you know what all I need to tell you is
which session is starting and everything
else will take care of itself now if we
if I send you a push without a message
as in without a session then this bit
will fail they fail it just it won't do
anything it doesn't matter and what I'll
do is I just assume that whatever the
literal text is that came in is what we
should be sending so that's how we do
the event updates so if in the back end
we just put in like some random string
or emoji or whatever when it comes in
that text will not be matched to any of
the sessions so we just propagate it
straight through as that's what they
wanted to say on you know which is true
that's what they wanted to say they
didn't want to say one of the sessions
was starting now and the icon defaults
to the chrome dev summit 512 icon which
is you probably remember is this one
here you know general chrome dev summit
eNOS in an icon so there you go good
news is that i'm going to be pushing
this out hopefully today unless i find
any catastrophic bugs between now and
actually pushing it live
but I've been working on this for quite
a while this has taken some work not on
the client side surprisingly on the
server side it's been quite an
interesting process of just making sure
everything's just aligned and you know
trying to make sure that people don't
get multi notified and all that kind of
stuff ooh final bit that i will show you
is on you know that user visible only
someone it was that what was the flag oh
it was in push manager on it when we did
the subscription let me just find out
which exactly yeah user visible only hey
what because that's it to true and if
you remember I said when you have that
flag you're promising to show a
notification here's something i
discovered the event for the on push you
want it to wait until so you're
basically saying okay don't don't don't
go away I've got some stuff to do and
this will take a promise and when the
promised change finishes you must make
sure that you've shown a notification by
that point and I was finding out that
sometimes I'd get my notification and
then sometimes chrome would say this web
sites updated in the background just so
you know and then I'd also get my
notification so I was getting like a
double notification and I was like what
is going on bit of a stack overflow
search for me and it turns out that it's
because when you do the self that
registration does show notification call
you must return it it must be part of
the promised chain otherwise this
promise chain will finish and there'll
be no notification shown and so chrome
will say oh well they said user visible
only was true so I better put that
message up that says this site updated
in the background fair enough and then
your show notification code actually
then kicks in at some of the points you
end up with two notifications whereas if
you return it you're basically saying
that event not wait until we'll wait
until I've shown a notification which is
actually what I wanted to do so just an
FYI I don't recall seeing this much in
various samples around the web about how
to actually show notification you must
make sure that it is it is returned so
there you go codes up on github have a
proper look around as always thank you
for joining me on the journey we're
getting very close to chrome dev summit
now I
it's like two or three weeks away so you
know you can subscribe for notifications
if you want to be notified now when you
know the events starting or a particular
event particular session of interest to
you is actually starting that's the
whole point of this and also there's the
code there so you can have a good old
look through brilliant have a great day
and thank you very much for joining me
on bonus round number one
