with people in pairs i'm francesco i
lead business development for freshdesk
as you can gather from my accent I'm
from Nebraska originally I'm happy to be
here to tell you a bit more about
freshdesk with technology choices that
we make and why WebRTC is part of it
very big background not everybody might
be familiar with what we do freshdesk it
provides a cloud-based customer support
software it's a software that support
agents have in front of them when they
interact with customers whether it's a
coupling a case where a customer is
purchasing a new product they want to
make a change to a ticket for a flight
to Brazil or are they requesting
instructions or now to restart a frozen
computer that's us we are a basin
francisco five years old more than 500
people in several locations around the
world and nor for the 50,000 customers
globally and our vision is to
democratize customer support which
translates in making customers of
success as support accessible to
everybody from the small start up to the
moment visiting growth phase two large
corporations as well obviously of course
to the customers they interact with
those companies and democratizing
customer support also means making
technology choices and we're going to
talk about that freshdesk is a
multi-channel solutions so our customers
interact with their customers through
web chat web form email social media yet
the majority about seventy percent of
the support tickets are generated
starting from a voice communication so
voice is really critical to what our
customers do and that's why the phone
channel or voice is very much
incorporating to refresh desk experience
and when you talk about voice
two things come to mind first you want
to provide a voice experience which is
pristine which is superb that
expectation or customers across multiple
devices and the second one is how can
you make sure that the source experience
is made available without clunky
installation processes software
implementations so these two elements
are critical to our customers and that's
where WebRTC comes to play which is a
building block of our phone channel
solution thanks to the intuitive Ness
and ease of use and customers what I
have to do whenever they use our phone
solution is simply to login into
freshdesk configure the system and we're
ready to go nothing we are the No planky
software installation a flash-based and
you guys probably very familiar with
that when we are based on twilio web RTC
implementation when twilio came up with
in a web RTC a beta solution sometime
back we jumped on it we sign up for the
for the beta and our customers were
delighted delighted because they
upgraded their flash based experience
our kike experience to a more more
modern web RTC refined experience what
are the key tactic takeaways for us from
using WebRTC well what you see is both
powerful and versatile powerful because
allows neuqua adjustment in a real time
it's something that we load our twilio
friends were able to do to provide
superior call quality with minimal
latency versatile because allows a
richer feature set and that's what we
did for example critical one-way
features that we implemented simple to
throw some clothes on jealous tree
down to web page and immediately a
customer can interact with support agent
hassle-free and cost-free the key
message for us is the paramount for
freshdesk in our customers to have for
us to provide for them to receive a
superb a user experience which in many
cases means implementing complex
sophisticated very advanced technologies
and translating that into a very easy to
use intuitive simple way interface and
that's how we use WebRTC and that's what
I'm about to see enable us to do let's
really match what I wanted to share with
you today if you have any questions
don't shoot on me are not the technical
guy but I can try to answer as much as a
cadet thank you guys thanks for answer
some questions 2 questions here what are
you collaborating here cut good yeah so
right now web RTC isn't available in all
browsers right so how how do you guys
handle that with your cuz we have a
fullback solution which is not fully
desirable but it's flash based solutions
to fall back so so if I understand it
right you basically cover the part where
like the service support person uses web
RTC but the actual most of the traffic
comes in via phone calls right or is it
also or is there also a part where like
basically you do like you connect the
customer from via web RTC right to the
to the service agent so we we leverage
trillion from structure we are fresh
this is a multi-channel solutions to
software multi-channel whether the
inbound communication or request or
inquires from customers come through
voice email chat social media we
centralize them on our platform</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
