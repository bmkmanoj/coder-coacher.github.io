stuff in Photoshop and then export
everything but now everything seems to
have evolved quite substantially forget
everything you knew before forget about
slicing images forget about generating
images just you can just use text and
just loathe a typography that you want
layout in CSS in the web has changed
quite substantially from when I started
I remember it's like it was like table
layouts and stuff like that would you
think about the evolution of layout on
the web I guess we've learned from print
and we've taken their you know their
technologies were their products and
we're just trying to make it work for
everyone in the browser and instead of
just his print his browser with this
never-ending stream of text yeah that
works very well for like doctoral theses
but possibly not for documents of people
want to read I think it's from painful
and you know long and raggy I think it's
very exciting now because you can't
predict what people are using or how
they are reading that so you have to be
design for this wide gamut of options
and I think that's very interesting the
layout is finally like supporting you in
that so that you know designers on hate
browsers yeah what do you think about
CSS grid and flexbox I think that's
generally exciting and you know flex
what got up to like a bad foot because
they were like three or four
implementations when I think two or
three I'm none of them we're compatible
so that quite didn't work with great I
think we we learned a lesson and I know
everything gets together at the same
time with all the browsers yeah so that
was good because you you know that it's
supported in phones which is well again
most people just to browse so it makes
it so much easier once you grasp how it
works is very easy whereas with you know
with floats and all the things from your
it was really really hard to do and you
have to add lots of extra markup that
makes very hard to maintain so nowadays
you can have very simple layouts which
are very easy to understand and maintain
which i think is important it's not just
like building it but also being able to
change it afterwards I know having to
add more
more CSS overwrite the previous CSS I
remember when I first was getting into
coding is like the thing the tool that
really helped me understand it was like
when Firebug was like the first
developer tool and then Firefox had the
developer tools integrated and that
really was like was that a harmone and
now I understand the box model now it
makes it yeah when I saw the developer
edition like your layout to for Firefox
I was like this is amazing now I could I
can finally see like visualize the code
which I always found was like why
haven't we have this tool like this is
this is exactly makes perfect sense like
at the beginning the tools were
basically for the engineers and the
browser to be able to diagnose what
what's going on there but now we are
them lots and lots of visual features
you know like CSS so the engine
everything yes you need to diagnose and
I have seen tools that engineers have
built
everything's flashing like using like
all this really outs are these three
drawings but that's not actually useful
for designers so that's what we need
designers to be involved in designing
the tools as well so that we are giving
you tools and information that is what
you actually need rather than what the
engineers needs like the engineer maybe
just needs to diagnose how many phones
are there in the system or how many
cliffs so they have decided I think the
designer might want to say what you were
mentioning like variable phones what can
I use here where were the things I can
change I think I feel that's very
interesting like it just takes us from
us browser maker
it just takes us from like okay I'm an
engineer I'm providing this feature to
you so okay how can I make this feature
useful and accessible to you and so that
we can all work together and you can
make best use of this feature I have to
implement it for you because it there's
no point right in implementing a feature
if no one is using it but the thing with
tools is in typography it's like the
thing that ruined it for all of
typography is when Photoshop and these
design tools made it really easy to
change the font sizes because back in
the day so you wouldn't have a specific
font for font size 14 and that's the the
metal plates will be very different for
18 and whatever but then when you had
the design tools you just change the
size and almost for classical
typographers for this is really
responsible you're destroying it by the
gray nice tools we've reached a similar
point now with
variable points where you have a
typographer designs all these sayings
and you expose this to the developer
they could end up doing really bad
things like things which are illegible
thinking oh this is really cool so as a
tool maker I mean what do you what the
considerations that you think that you
need to think about okay okay
oh my god I'm very open to people going
totally wild and just like getting
creative because that's part of what
motivates me to work on Mozilla like I
want everyone to be able to whatever
they want to learn the web like if it's
tacky and ridiculous
all the better like just think 90s gifts
colors or very psychedelic I'm fine with
that like we will look back on that and
be like oh those were at the time so
maybe once bribe or funds get in we will
be like this was so much fun and then
people would go like back to like very
minimalism like very composed websites I
am not against that but then if I get
into this kind of like marginally
smaller I'd be like okay let me help you
and let me tell you like maybe you want
to be the tool that says hey maybe
you're adding too many variations of
this font this can be a bit overwhelming
for people with certain disabilities or
this is not readable or you know like
kind of like the two sides like you can
be very creative in the web and also
like maybe you can advise people they
can take all of the guidance yeah but as
a router makers we have this unique
insight on this is not going to work
well in certain circumstances and I
think also as Mahseer we have the
responsibility to be like hey you know
some people can't withstand this kind of
like flashy colors so we can maybe warn
the user we are not doing that yet but
we're maybe thinking of maybe doing that
because you know what's been rendered
and what it's been parts you know the
features are active so we should use
that they attentive just like possibly
display the output you want to give the
the the users of the browser which may
be the developer which is slightly
different from these for the tool side
you want to give them the control and
power but at the same time making sure
that they consider the real users of the
tech
Sokol because we you know with with the
newer features that were added to
animations in CSS you can control them
with JavaScript so you can do things
like well this user has selected not to
have animations so if they've had
selected to have less motion I can
reduce animations go back to a more
consider and compose kind of typography
and distract them less so they can be
more you know able to access the content
without being interrupted by my flashy
creativity so I guess it's cool that we
are giving them all this control but
also we need to let them know that there
is all these considerations that you
have in mind it feels like we're in the
Golden Age of us or industry yeah so
maybe the flash was kind of like the
article era and we're now in the world
was we just need some more time and give
maybe more library it's more support and
also I guess giving people the license
so just do whatever they want because
otherwise it's like they you know the
JavaScript police comes on so it's like
you're doing this wrong this is not how
it should be done yeah there wasn't that
much of that in the flash area so people
were giving themselves the license no
more free creative yeah because people
were not like looking at your code using
that library that's terrible yeah yeah
so I guess we're missing a bit of that
correct tool set for creatives same time
I think the layout all that is in five
flops yeah I think that I think that's
the future like where people bridging
the gap between turning the browser into
a design tool rather than just consumers
yeah a consumption of viewing tool and I
think that's where once that is nails I
think everything will change or will
fall into place perhaps yeah I mean just
one of the things we're trying and I
guess Chrome on a chair also trying like
every time you publish a feature you
want to make sure that it's support and
the tools is there so that it's exposed
to users and they can you know work with
it and edit and also every person learns
in a different way so some people but my
profession visual tools or people might
just prefer calls like some people like
clicking all this like typing so I think
it's very cool that we're showing
this kind of like facial interface for
designers who are thinking of Leia not
just thinking of columns and tracks and
names of tracks which is very abstract
so I guess that's just a Francis type
step we're now talking like this to
these screens but then you're like what
happens if we take reading through into
3d they're all this means that we can
use it's interesting to start thinking
about how do we design tools for
inspecting 3d worlds does that make
sense yeah like even because it's that's
involving like attention and psychology
and like all these like you know like of
the science of perception like if I'm
looking at you if you were wealthy are
object if I'm looking at you very
intensely I guess I should be that would
clicking on you because that's well it
would be conveying but like maybe I'm
just like glancing at things and it
doesn't mean I'm interested me so I'm
like curious but no how do you yeah yeah
so it's like it's interesting scary as
well people tend to assume that their
customers or their users are all like
them but you have to get out of that
mindset and it's really injurious to
health or the web if people just code
for one browser
