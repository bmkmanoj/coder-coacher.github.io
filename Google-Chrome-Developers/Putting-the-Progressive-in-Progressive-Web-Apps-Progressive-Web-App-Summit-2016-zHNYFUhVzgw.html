cool great I was I was thinking about
Kenny Powers going to start this whole
presentation off and I'm terrible and
starting presentations so just be warned
but I was thinking about kind of like
the structure of the entire day right
and like and progressive web apps and
how we think progressive web apps fit
into the overall like kind of the way
that we think developers should be
building or you should be building for
the web in the future and the one thing
I were thinking about was every single
one of these things that we've talked
about in isolation is a great thing for
you to be able to kind of take home and
kind of work on for instance so if
you're not interested in necessary
progressive web apps right now but you
want to build a great user experience
for your users then you know like poles
talk around user experience and that
side of things is great you know same
with like HTTP too and that's a cell
like we want to make the web more secure
we want to make the web faster on the
network and side of things like all
those things individually will be a
great thing for your business and your
services in your site but kind of
putting them all together like we think
that that's where the the progressive
kind of web app part kind of comes
together and I think like what we're
trying to get to with this is like this
in my talk by they like putting their
progressive into progressive web apps I
I I kind of like I'm kind of worried
about this a little bit because there's
a lot of tension between the what
progressive actually means in terms of
progressive web applications and one of
the things right they're going to talk
about is that when in the research that
I was doing for this talk I I was going
back to when we first kind of thought
about progressive web apps and when it
was first kind of talked about and it
was Alex Russell and it was on his site
and it was literally a year ago to this
month they coined this term with his
wife Frances Barrowman you know
progressive web apps and progressive
open web apps when you read the article
it's really interesting right because it
starts off with this whole idea of as
the user uses the experience more it
becomes more progressively installed on
your system which is not necessarily the
same thing as like progressive
enhancement is which is a very important
thing that we want to kind of cover on
the web there was a like we did talk
about it a little bit the idea behind it
is that you know when you interpret the
service worker and you can start
intercept in the network requests you
actually you know you progressively
enhance the network you get more speed
essentially for free at that point I
think that's actually quite an
interesting way to think about it right
because
like we we talked about the progressive
kind of installable nature like you know
if you want push notifications you don't
have to install an application to be
I'll do that you can start to get these
experiences if you want them to work
offline and be resilient and available
you can integrate a service worker make
them work offline but you don't
necessarily have to have them installed
on the system right your web application
your website is just better by having
these speeches in there but at the same
time we know that progressive
enhancement is important because we want
these experiences to work in every
single browser like whether the you have
service work or not whether you have
javascript enabled or not it's an
important critical point and part of the
whole progressive web app experience is
that these things work everywhere and
when we talk to a lot of developers
around kind of what progressive web
applications mean is like hey we got
service worker we can make it work
offline and everyone always asks does it
work on iOS right it's not like does it
work in Opera Mini or unfortunately it's
like you know it's great that on Chrome
for Android but that doesn't work on iOS
and I think that's the wrong question
that people ask it's the wrong kind of
the concept that they go into because
our whole idea behind progressive web
applications is that your application
should work really well everywhere it
should excel when you've got the ability
to use something like service worker and
like the interesting thing is like iOS
has got a lot of users and those users
pay you know they apparently by a lot of
things which is kind of interesting but
it's I think it's about ten or fifteen
percent market share but like if you
look at it like it's not one browser
that's like hugely dominant it's lots of
different browsers used by lots of
different people you go to different
parts of the world and towel
Oppenheimer's going to talk about that
later like you know different browsers
like using mini for instance are
incredibly part well you see you see
browser in particular incredibly popular
and you know we as developers are we
building for the more time and I don't
think we are building progressively
across the entire platform to cater for
every single type of mobile user that's
out there at the moment or desktop user
and I went through this same experience
right I went through air horn accom like
this is my site it's it is jakes you're
a very rude word about this what it
looks like but I'm not going to talk
about it but air horn er is a site that
it's a simple air horn right it's a very
kind of small concept demo about what a
progressive web application should be i
started off building it on desktop
rounds like this is going to be really
easier i can make this experience work
everywhere and it's going to be
instantly accessible it's going to
destroy the entire app store model
because
like the app stores are littered with
these kind of air horn his experiences
like go to the URL enter the year go to
the URL start using it you never need to
download another app again that was my
thought at least anyway and hey heard it
who's got it so like it was kind of
interesting on right i started off in
desktop and then I was like well I can
make it like chrome on Android is pretty
good i can make it mobile got it working
on mobile pretty well use the bit of
flex box brilliant right we're great and
then because like web kitten blink at
the time when chrome and i know they're
not too dissimilar they support web
audio and all the different api's work
in iOS it was great and then i thought
like UC browser is like iOS at this
point so I was like that's great and
then last week someone said doesn't work
on you see right I was like what of
course it works in you see I made it
right I'm not like completely stupid
anyway you get to the page it's like
that like the really interesting thing
is when you start to look at the stats
is like twenty percent of the potential
user base especially on mobile like it's
in like India as a massive place China's
a massive place as well in terms of
usage of this browser like twenty
percent of the users couldn't use my
site they couldn't even see a single
thing right like I just looked at the
stats UC browser users come in they
bounced out pretty much straight away
because it's completely useless for them
hey that's also the time for me to get
off stage as well by everyone over
that's pretty cool and then I was like
okay cool I'll see what it's like in a
lynx browser again right it's like
there's literally no content that button
isn't the actual button for the
experience that I have like it's not the
you press the air horn and it kind of
downloads a WAV file or something like
there's an install button that's hidden
behind the scenes and it's like I just
made a lot of decisions in the wrong way
and the thing i did that wasn't the
greatest thing was I kind of targeted
off one API writers like the Audio API
is the thing that I was building my
experience round and for me like it like
I said it's a very small application
it's not probably like any applications
that you're building today on the web
but he was it was a really bad thing for
me is because I was like Audio API has
got pretty good support and I'm kind of
happy with that and that was okay cool
but then i looked at the profile of my
users it turns out like this is kinda i
want to use combo to the side that i
made but it's all backed by the can i
use data in the idea behind it was that
you choose a feature and go okay i wanna
use audio like what features do i get
for free i mean you know i use Web Audio
API you might get can
like CSS fonts and a whole bunch of
other stuff with dragon integrates my
app and I chose this is the model for
how I was going to build the experience
I think that was a really bad way of
actually starting to build my site at
the time like the thing I wouldn't try
an get across at this point at least
anyway is the fact that I started off
with the technology it was a demo
application I started like I'm gonna use
the Web Audio API because I had this
thing where you press the button and you
could hold it an air horns forever and
ever and ever and I didn't actually
start with the experience that I wanted
to build I did actually want my site to
work everywhere for every white by every
single user on any different browser but
I just I just made this kind of decision
and like this is what I see when we're
building kind of new web experiences
whether their progressive web
applications are just good web
experiences it we go I want to use this
experience while you need service worker
but you don't actually need service
worker for every single experience that
you want to build but when you do
integrate in that you get a better
experience for users of have those
browsers and I think it's more about the
features that you want to build into
your or the experience that you want to
build rather than just the features so I
you want to build a great mobile website
I should have in my my experience I
should have like well I'm going to back
it off the audio element which will then
allow me to play in pretty much every
single browser and then I just won't
have all the same experience inside the
inside the site so i should have start
with that whole the kind of experiential
kind of focus rather than the the
ability to actually go okay i can do
something fancy with the Web Audio API I
haven't changed it and I think like when
like one of the things I was thinking
about and when I was specially looking
at a towers kino earlier on today is
that their progressive web app model of
themselves as well is it smaller just a
way of thinking about how you
potentially architect and construct your
applications then the necessary kind of
individual different API is behind it
and I think like Aliexpress is a good
example they chose to go mobile only
rather than kind of have a complete
desktop solution but they chose to pick
off this kind of tactical battle first
right and I think that's a good
experience where they followed the kind
of progressive web app model and then
they found out that all their users
benefited because they were building a
good web experience that just so
happened to be work even better in the
browser that supports service worker
whether it's firefox samsung or whether
it's chrome as well and soon as we age
and a bunch of other ones i suppose like
that's the thing is like the they got
more users coming through spending more
money and a whole bunch of other stuff
because they built a good web experience
that was kind of in theory kind of
progressive from the start rather than
just focusing on hey this experience is
a progressive web app that needs to use
a service worker and go from there
which i think is the wrong way of
looking at it and they did the right
thing so I I think I'm probably
preaching to the choir at this point but
light the interesting thing for me when
I speak to a lot of people is
understanding what progressive means in
the dictionary definition and I've got
it exactly what it is here is like
developing in stages right it's like the
idea of you can do things in multiple
steps and build on top of them as you go
along which is which is a decent way of
thinking about a progressive web
development as a whole now the way that
we kind of start to think about the way
I least start to think about breaking it
down is like I do want these experiences
to work in every browser sometimes
there's a pragmatic developer I have to
target different kinds of experiences to
different developers or different
browsers at least but my whole kind of
fundamental things I want to get the
experience out to as many people as
possible and not block on you know
whatever browser the user is using
because in most cases the things that
I'm building shouldn't be blocked on the
fact that you know you an API doesn't
support web audio because audio can be
played on the web it's a good example
now again with the air horn or example I
didn't do the incremental approach to
the API is right I just relied on Web
Audio API in this case and if I was
thinking about it again I'd probably go
back from the start and then whether you
have the device like diversity of users
like the importance behind why you do
progressive enhancement is because you
have users from all over the globe and
tell we'll talk about this later all
over the globe using every single
different type of browser that you can
possibly think of so you have to build
these experiences catering for the fact
that you have a potentially wide and
diverse set of users now there is this
kind of a you probably seen this before
in the past there's an illustration by
Davis you at least anyway but like the
core fundamental tenant from the
progressive side of things is you make
sure you get the content and deliver to
the user then you have the presentation
kind of wrapped around it and like
there's the kind of the proper
definition is around kind of adding in
CSS and JavaScript on top or CSS to kind
of improve the presentation layer and
then JavaScript on top of that to
actually make it kind of a little bit
more functional maybe a little bit more
interactive at the time but I think the
important thing for them from our side
of things is like not every experience
can like has a lot of content in right
like not every single site that you
built like air horn has not got a huge
amount of content but I still built it
wrong but this is one thing that we
built in 2014 I we as in our broader
team learned everealm like Sam Thorogood
and Eric bidelman in Australia in
America built this kind of the Santa
tracker experience and it's a great
experience right millions and millions
of you
use it all the time and they get a great
experience out of it but I want to talk
about one specific kind of individual
piece about it in terms of one of the
good things about Santa tracker is that
you can say well where is Santa in the
world right you sit there and go okay
Santa isn't Iceland i live in scotland
right he's a he's not that far away i
need to get the bed in theory with the
kids at least anyway so something exists
by the way in case anyone's watching oh
so the idea behind this is like we have
this idea of like you want we we as the
developers of this piece of the software
we want to know where the user is so
that we can provide some kind of level
of interaction to the user and obviously
we chose geolocation API because the
geolocation API gives us pretty much
exactly where the user is based off
their current GPS location whether it's
on the Wi-Fi cell towers or kind of
satellites and haul buns with the stuff
it's a really powerful API but the
problem is like not everyone actually
accepts it so you don't get a whole
bunch of usage off the back of that and
this is sorry I've come to slide forward
in 2014 like this was our entire
experience we had like you go well what
actually what happen if you go to the
page to say where do you where are you
and then people with either accept the
permission with pretty much no context
or rejected it turns out when you prompt
the user you know hey where are you the
like I'm not gonna tell you i am what
like you didn't give me any context
about why you need this so we had this
experience where the whole bunch of
users didn't get the full rich
experience of like the Santa tracker
experience because they disabled the
geolocation never used it or you know
they didn't have the geolocation API
even available in their browser and like
we found that we didn't have a great
except rate for like using that one
particular feature in 2015 like it was
changed up a little bit right it's like
we know that the GPS can give you a
really accurate information about where
the user is but like we want to provide
this great experience and there are
different ways that we can do that we
can have no experience at all which is
like the kind of this is like the
progressive way at least in theory in my
head like you have no experience at all
then you ask for you basically use the
IP address to get the geolocation and
then if you can do some of the things
like if you know that the users
languages in Japanese there's a good
chance that they might be in Japan if
you can't get the geo information but
then you can tie the two pieces together
to actually say like hey you're in Japan
and like Santa is not too far away but
then if you really want and you want to
provide a super accurate piece of
information then you can ask and kind of
say hey we know kind of your in Japan
you won't find out
the where Santa Claus is give them some
context and then they can use the API
but the fundamental thing here is that
we've still is a browser developer or
not a browser developer as a developer
of this piece of software we still
roughly know where the user might be by
saying okay we're going to use the
existing information that we have and I
think that's one kind of small form of
like the progressive experience is you
start from no experience at all and then
use all the different pieces of
information that you can get before
using the more complex ap is so I think
the critical thing I want try to get
across in this bit is that you probably
want to know and kind of tactically
think about how you're going to use the
different API is when to upgrade the
user to the different experiences and
some of the reasons why you want to do
that is because not because the API
doesn't exist is because it's behind a
permission or a privilege that says the
user to go okay you know if you want
access to geolocation all you want
access to the camera like you have to
ask that usually the user says no like
what do you do at this point and if
you've built progressively you don't
have to retrospectively go okay cool i'm
going to add the file element in which
lets you kind of pick on the camera
you're just going to provide that
experience with front and kind of just
smooth that your development model at
least so that's kind of my room a rough
introduction we'd have 50 minutes is
pretty long what would some of the
things we're going to cover is that our
progressive web app model covers
multiple different stages of like how
you think in a building your software
but like around the app shell like how
you construct your application but also
some of the different technologies as
well that you can use if you want inside
your upper inside your app whether it's
push install for add to homescreen or
make kind of making yourself your piece
of software a lot more resilient and
network connectivity issues so like
these are some of the core tenants of
what we think like a progressive about
might take my tape and I'm going to kind
of briefly cover some strategies about
what you can do the first is the app
shell right like what most people don't
understand is that well when you're
thinking about it is the HTML is an
imperative language right it takes it's
an ordered sequence of elements but this
is without CSS at least anyway it's an
ordered sequence of elements are
executed from start to top and then they
construct your document based off the
back of that I think that's actually
pretty cool because if you look at kinda
procedural languages as well where you
can have functions and a whole bunch of
other stuff but they got a lot more
complex but you know HTML by itself is
actual imperative language so this is
like a rough case study oh this is it's
a very simple blog right it's not really
can't actually relevant to a lot of
experiences that you're a building but
the idea behind this I give eff guns
like the google blog site from the ages
and ages ago like
you had to have a whole bunch of
JavaScript just to be able to run a
bunch of content it was just a nuts
experience but the idea behind this is
like there's a very simple site it's
created from normal simple HTML and Java
or HTML in this case just render from
the server and pushed out to your site
now one of the things that we've seen in
the kind of the broader web industry is
that a lot of developers are building
sites where you have the app shell like
this is the kind of this tap shell model
like a lot of people been doing this for
a long time with other frameworks and
just normally in like whether it's
angular or amber and whole bunch of
other ones I owe you you constructed
like the shell of your application and
dynamically load via Ajax content in
like this model works really well right
we can build some great experiences I
gmail is pretty much built this way lots
of other different applications have
built this way where you load the
structure of the application and pull
the content in but like Paul Lewis has
done this kind of nice tweet a while ago
where you kind of like like ripped apart
the different problems that you have
when you're building these experiences
when you're trying to build a fast
experience at least anyway is that will
get given the HTML right like the
browser download the HTML we had all the
content before but now we haven't got
the content which means we can't really
put anything under this on the page
until all the JavaScript is downloaded
the frameworks have booted up the jar in
the JavaScript and CSS have downloaded
and kind of done all the layouts that
they needed to do so you have this
massive gap between having HTML
available fetching some data and then
actually having something rendered on
the screen and like I said this is like
the like what we think of today is the
the app shell model and this is one of
the ways that we're asking developers to
build applications is using the
application shell we know the
application shell works really really
well for building certain types for
building different types of experiences
but it's not necessarily the only way
that you'd want to build a progressive
web application but it's an interesting
model because one of the things that you
can do is that you can folks in your
content get your you know get everything
hours are rendered so you can focus on
your content at least with the app shell
model get your content out rendered in
that first request and then like you've
probably been doing in a lot of
applications is then start to
incrementally take over the experience
so this is just a simple thing where you
know if you click on the link inside
your application you'll so if you click
on a link inside your application you'll
go normally navigate to a different URL
now that's good but inside like that
whole kind of white page refresh model
is something that which is a detractor I
get detraction from the user experience
especially in the kind of the web versus
app world so what you normally do and
you probably all
familiar with this is that you intercept
the click then go I'm going to load some
content and inject that content back in
that's a perfectly reasonable way of
doing it but one of the things that
we're trying to look at two at the point
now is that we want you to think about
the you do the page load so you get the
content out you're still using the app
shell model where you incrementally take
that over and if you like so they said
sorry I go back one slide if you think
about this model where you kind of
intercept the content or intercept the
link click and load the content you've
probably been doing this already in the
past which is quite a good thing because
when you go to this kind of progressive
model we still want you to go and do
that right so if you have a service
worker behind the scenes intercept and
all the requests and kind of load in the
content you have a number of different
choices about how you serve that you can
still do the incremental load so you can
basically say not the incremental load
so you can still get the HTML parser as
you go through render on the server and
if you watch Jeff talk a little bit he's
going to dive into that kind of
universal kind of JavaScript rendering
side of things where you can render out
in the server and push out to the
content but we're doing that progressive
render the web has got 20 years have
been able to kind of progress with you
run like progressively render content to
the browser we shouldn't kind of throw
that away because we want to get fun
nice model of app shell and then load
the content in we definitely do
encourage you to think about the app
shell model render the content with it
and then start the kind of tactically
replace that like once you know that
you're inside the browser you can do a
bunch of different things with the
serviceworker you can fetch json data
endpoints and kind of have them cached
and pull through or you can just keep
doing kind of full on page request
server rendering push it out and then
kind of parse out the content and wrote
load it there's lots of different models
and I think this kind of progressive
rendering approach at least anyway and
the flexibility that you get with
service workers helps so the thing I do
want to say is like a pill is a model
that we definitely know works like it's
been used for a long long time already
we know it works well but there are many
different tactics and strategies i would
use and i definitely encourage you to
look at Jake Jake art world service
worker cookbook because I stole a whole
bunch of his code to get my blog working
like my blog is definitely not an
application but I want that resilience
from the serviceworker I want it to be
available whenever the user goes back to
it but more importantly if the user goes
to any other page inside my site or
refresh the page it's available
instantly it's not an application it's a
content delivery system in this point
for me and I just chose basically a
stale while revalidate method for
actually kind of fetching my content so
the request comes in I'll pull the date
back from the cash always but always
then go
at the same time go and fetch the latest
content and then subsequent requests
will end refried refresh when the user
refresh the page with subsequent
requests that'll load my new content
because like it's already been kind of
cashed that worked for me in a model
like as a model for kind of making my
site resilient and work offline and I
definitely encourage you to have a look
at the different models that you can
have to build an experience where you
know the service worker is there to
enhance the experience rather than
actually say we have to push everything
to an app shell the other area and I
know Owen talked about this a little bit
earlier on is kind of push notifications
now this this whole section is I we can
we can talk about a little bit as well
it's kind of interesting because the
push notifications API is incredibly
powerful it's supported across a number
of browsers but it's not on like on a
relatively large number of different
operating systems and like it's not on
iOS basically at the moment and it's
another question that we get is like
well I want to do push notifications but
it's not on these experiences like so
what do I do well you know the first
natural thing you want to do is you just
want to check the sport right you can
easily check the serviceworker we check
the virus service work to see whether
you can support push notifications and
then you can say well we haven't got
push we just won't do anything with it
but like that's the problem right is
that you we're not going to do anything
with it there are a number of different
tactics that you can use at the time so
actually say we can do and give the user
more compelling experiences even if they
don't have push notifications we can
keep the user up to date with important
information now there isn't like a
little analogy that we've got is that
like there's like the transport kind of
a coat like the transfer the transport
structure that you'd have in kind of any
major city there's a destination that
you want to get to you start a desk your
point a you want to get the destination
you know point be there are many
different ways that you can do that you
can take the tube or the Metro the
overground railway system a bus about
lots of different ways to get there but
the result is the same that you know
you've got that destination I think that
analogy works quite well for what we
like we talked about in some of these
experiences at least anyway because like
there are many different ways and
tactics that you can actually start to
integrate these that integrate different
experiences the biggest thing about push
notifications are and this is kind of
like you probably saw this from from Oh
in stalker you want to be relevant
timely and accurate that the three
different main areas that you want to
focus on the time limit is important
right because it's not you don't want to
you want to get in contact with your
user but you don't want to get in
contact with user all the time basically
it's not your primary mechanism of
getting in contact the user so you want
to think about how you want to use
notifications notifications normally a
kind of most like most relevant when you
have a timely based kind of action that
has to happen you send the request to
the server the user gets it then you
want the users or action it pretty much
straight away so there are a number of
different I can't use this there are a
number of different questions that you
want to ask right many businesses like I
give you've already got a business or a
site there are a number of different
ways that you're actually starting to
think like you're doing and come tagged
with your users right you that's right
is one of my words I say right great
dead powerful so every time you hear me
saying that it's me trying to think
about long as I think sometimes but you
have a number of different ways of
actually kind of contacting your user
well you know you might already have
their email address and you might
already have like have a regular
communic band communication with them
you might already have the phone number
right so if you have the phone number
like if you have to send important
relevant information you might want to
send an SMS system and I can SMS to them
I think you have all the different ways
by a Twitter and Facebook I don't think
those have ever retaken off in terms of
private direct communication it might
change when you know the messenger
ecosystem can messenger BOTS kind of
come out a little bit more but the
important thing that you have to make is
like push notifications aren't the
answer to everything and it doesn't
matter that not supported in every
single browser if they're supported it's
great you can do really cool things at
it in terms of like hey timely
information you can send it to them get
into action it but the same time you can
other do other nice things as well so
the first one is like native
notifications i like everyone knows that
native notifications drive reengagement
and users back into their experience and
it's normally target through a single
device at the same time which is great
because at most like especially in
emerging markets most people have
focusing on their phones at the time the
current moment now there are a number of
different things that you can do where
you can have contextual actions the
important thing here for the native is
like after that your app after your site
is or your application is on the user
system like having notifications is
incredibly low friction and that's why
we see huge amounts of reengagement so
if they already have the app in native
app installed you might not want
actually send them push notifications
but more importantly many people have
email outbound proactive email
communication with their users and one
of the things that we see is that we
don't necessarily use email in the way
that we think we could use it so like
you have different way like you know who
the user is like is an example right so
you're sending an email to an already
signed in user who has already been
using your system because of some
important action has happened on their
site like you know the context of what
you've sent to the user so that you can
use that context in subsequent web
requests we know that when a user like
email is a massive driver of web traffic
yeah you know especially on mobile so
when the user clicks on that email like
you can do things like send them into
the important kind of area of your site
it's a really nice way of like engaging
with your user where in the past you
might have used push notifications to
say hey this action is really important
go back into your account use this
information like because we know who you
are to actually then go and complete the
action like email is still just as
valuable probably more valuable than
expectations to some extent and then
things like SMS and like I don't think
socials the right one to focus on the
moment but things like SMS as well like
you can send pushing it like they are
nearly real-time push notifications that
can get through to nearly any device
irrespective of whether like a kind of
complete network connectivity now I
think this is really important because
you can embed links in there and then
you can get the user to go out so if
you're targeting a whole bunch of iOS
users who don't have things like push
notifications but you know who they are
and you know that phone number then you
know things like push notifications
oversaw SMS are really good ways to keep
engaging with your users and I know
people say an SMS is dying and it kind
of started to get replaced for a lot of
messaging apps but these type of
experiences are great and then finally
once you get the experience like once
you get the ability to there was a pik
sorry once you get the ability to make
note make calls or sorry rephrase it
once you get the ability to send
notifications because you know that the
device supports the ability to do it
then you need to make a decision at that
point about how you treat your users
like if if you're kind of already
sending the messages via SMS do you
replace that experience and you have to
be really careful because you don't want
to bombard hold all your users now
re-engagement is one bit from push
notifications the other bit is the the
other area of reengagement is and this
is one of the really powerful areas but
progressive web apps is that you have
the user being able to install your
experience on the home screen and when
that experiences on the home screen they
expect a certain number of things to
happen from their side of things they
expect it to be always be available and
instant loaded like once you're on the
user's home screen your kind of
permanently on their real estate so you
have to provide the best experience and
that's what I'm gonna talk about the
install phase at the moment like this
install step is one of those areas where
we've had things like add to homescreen
for a long time
but it's not work as well as we thought
so like I think in 1997 or maybe a
safari 3 at the time iOS brought as the
ability to add our experiences to the
home screen and steve jobs at the time
said hey like this is the way that we
think you should be building
applications and experiences for our
phone that you should go off and use the
web platform to be able to deliver this
we could make it work offline we can
make it installable like the whole bunch
of the things we we know history played
out a little bit differently but
fundamentally we've always had this
ability on iOS at least to be able to
get an experience on to the user's home
screen and on android it was incredibly
hard right like android hated the web it
seemed at the time they trying to get
experiences on to the home screen was
nearly impossible we made it a little
bit better in chrome like there was only
like seven steps rather than 12 steps to
get something on the home screen but
like it was still a bad experience right
and that was until we started to kind of
tie change the whole model and like
where we are now with progressive web
applications and a whole bunch of other
stuff like that's like it's everything
start to change but the really
interesting thing for me anywhere in
this space is that everything was
controlled by meta tags there was
information inside your page that would
allow the browser to say hey this is how
we think this is should this experience
should like look and operate on the
user's device so the good thing was you
could get the experience on to the home
screen like you could say hey I want my
application to be kind of like a full
screen application via one simple math
attack and then when the user kind of
press the button you'll go into the home
screen you could choose whether you
wanted to be a full screen experience
like in native application or like a
browser experience right but the problem
was it was not standardized and it was
on every single page you have to kind of
litter your whole site up with a whole
bunch of meta tags just to get things
working even worse it was completely
broken right like the whole space around
this is like when you have an
application or a site like you like an
application you always launch into one
specific point into the application like
the entry point into your experience at
the home screen was bookmark this page
and store it in the home screen so if
you weren't on already on the home it's
like the entry point into your
application like you'd go in take a leaf
page like imagine adding Google Plus I
mean I imagine adding Google Plus or
anyone's home screen but I imagine you
on like like one of my pages inside the
Google+ and you add that to home screen
you don't want to keep going back to my
content although I'd like it right cuz I
write great stuff I'd like you to be
able to kind of go to the entry point of
Google+ add to home screen with the meta
tags who would never give you that you
could never get back to the home screen
it was a really hard way to manage
things
and then he was even broke even further
from that like if you did a navigation
inside the window rather than say hey
I'm going to replace the current page
with the new content that it's behind
this or the URL that is part of my
application it would just go okay it's
going to open a new window and then you
tap it completely break you out there
overall experience so it's kind of
recognized that the other day I actually
wrote it was like what can I write for
this talk and I wrote a spelling mistake
as well if fixies oh my god that's
terrible basically you have the ability
to actually fix the way that iOS works
it means that you have to emulate a
number of different things and
introduced a new meta tag called
Microsoft it's a Microsoft Nets like ms
application start URL but fundamentally
this polyfill essentially will say hey
we know that you've got the all these
meta tags in place but we want to fix
the iOS experience we want to make it so
that it matches like operas experience
androids experience Chrome's experiences
Firefox experiences I've actually
getting on to the home screen so it does
a number of things like click Jack or
hide it does click Jack in so that it
says hey we know that you're still in
the experience i refresh the page
content rather than redirecting you out
one of the interesting things is that
it's really hard to mind State on iOS
this kind of should get around it but
the really great thing is until kind of
iOS start supporting things I manifest
then like this is a nice model and there
are a number of other people starting to
think about how you can actually make
the iOS add the home screen experience a
lot better and that's if you want
compatibility right at the moment you
might not actually want to say you know
what iOS or whatever browser it is
doesn't support it and that's fine if
you don't wanna do it the modern way is
to use the manifest and like Jake talked
about the manifest a little bit earlier
the manifest is a way of describing what
to launch how to launch in how it should
appear on the user system and now when
you meet all the criteria and I talked
briefly by the criteria you get this
let's pop up that says hey add to
homescreen you add to homescreen and you
get this nice kind of installed full
screen experience if you want it now
there are a number of things that we do
and the whole number of different checks
that we have to make sure that you don't
kind of get the prompt when you when you
don't really it's not deserve it but
when you you're not actually offering a
great experience one of the things that
we want to try and do is we'll make sure
that if you launch from the home screen
you get an online experience all the
time like you never get the offline of
source which is why we force like we
enforce the kind of service worker
restriction we need the manifest because
if you're launching again into that non
home screen experience they
you're not given the users a great kind
of like up like experiences wait
especially when it's launched from the
home screen the big question is can we
bring iOS in line with the manifest and
its own use of ethics and I think we can
but i will say max Amelia maximiliano
Berkman he's done a really great blog
post in the past couple of days about
all the different things that you have
to try and do to actually say we want to
have a compatible experience there's a
number of issues that you have with
icons and differences between the two
platforms but there are ways to work
around it but the interesting thing at
least anyway is that we have all the
information that we need there's a
secret meta tag Apple mobile web app
name which kind of maps to the the
manifest attributes of name and short
name obviously we get all the icons and
those type of things which is really
good it's kind of nice we can say that
we want to launch in standalone mode
right we want it to a lawn take a native
application if we don't have apple
mobile web app capable then it launches
like a normal browser tab which is
another option in the display manifest
we don't have complete full screen but
we have some good compatibility with the
two parts of the platform and we have
kind of have some emulation around the
theme color right you can say I want to
get rid of the top bar by saying black
translucent it's pretty nice there are
other bits which are broken like the
splash screen it doesn't work anymore
which is a bit unfortunate but it's it
was still kind of not too far off now I
think that's kind of interesting but the
thing that I don't want people to have
to do is after then like work out
exactly which meta tags that you need to
install now there are a number of
different polyfills this is 1 i've
written there are a number of different
ones coming through as well where if you
can basically know that you've got a web
app manifest on the page you drop a
small piece of JavaScript in and then it
goes and works out what the exact best
tags are to use and then it'll make sure
that you offer the best kind of
compatible add to homescreen experience
I think it works pretty well this is
just a demo that I've written there are
not another good couple of ones out
there and finally and I know I'm
overtime on the moment is the offline
section luckily i think jake has covered
most of the offline story that you need
to kind of think about but there was one
thing again is that when we talk to a
lot of developers out there is like well
the server's work on work on iOS and
right now the answer is no and like I
said before it's the wrong question to
ask right we don't need to build
experiences are absolutely rely on
service worker but the thing is people
still want offline as one of their core
features so the first thing that they do
skiers well I can you zap cash right
like so who's built a site with that
cash 20 people how was the experience a
good experience no okay cool I mean
through a number of different issues
without cash I like if you would build
an experience they would like a new
progressive web app so you went away and
good I'm going to build a regresar web
app and I need to make it work offline
we still need to come up with the exact
you know case business case why you
should kind of skip the appcache section
but I do think you should bypass app
cache the interesting thing if you've
already got a site that users are cash
and mats can talk about this later you
can add a service worker in and then
there will be no conflict between the
two because the service worker will take
over so there's a nice migration path
off app cache but if you're thinking
about building the experience I would
just say bypass app cache completely
there's a number of different problems
that it has it's hard to do good server
rendering with it and then if you update
your kind of manifest and you've been to
100 different URLs which you've kind of
all kind of had cash then it like this
atomic update system is going to it
basically requests every single URL it's
a bit of a nightmare to manage with a
lot of different problems so i would
just bypass it completely it's a
decision that you have to me but i think
you should do the one thing i would say
is that there are a number of different
strategies that you can take you can
build for resilience in the client first
it give your offline and someone has a
window open quite frequently they don't
bother to reload it because they know
there's an issue the worst thing that
you can do is break the experience right
so bill for resilience inside the client
handle an xhr network failures cache
data locally and if you look at the
firebase platform are a bunch of other
ones as well they do that like they know
that they can cache data locally to
synchronize when there's some data
connection back in when there's some day
thanks data connection that comes back
and finally you can start to then layer
in things like service workers an extra
enhancement to give you that resilience
as you need so that's my thought is I
just kind of stay away from app cache at
least anyway now there are a number of
different like one of the pieces of
criticism that we've had is that there
are a number of different issues in
terms of information and knowledge some
Thorogood on my team has launched this
always be progressive where we're trying
to start to think about hey we have all
these different pieces of technology how
can we actually get you to think about
building systems which are progressive
or at least if you want to kind of poly
think that probably
things through as well so we have this
nice little resource we're going to keep
updated intact you give you the gardens
that you need to actually build these
experiences if you fundamental you
require some of these features which is
quite nice one of the things i would say
is that we'd have a nice was my killer
slide and gone too far too far with it
is we have and we're starting to build
out and flesh out our developer portal
as well so on developers.google.com /
web like we want to make sure that you
have all the tools that you need to
build fast secure and performant
experiences with a great user experience
like they're the fundamental core
tenants of what we want to try and get
from the web at the moment and then if
you kind of start looking at all those
things together we're hoping that I can
good progressive web application
experience that comes out the back of
that as well and that's when you kind of
build an inservice work on their
secretary resilience now the thing that
I will say is that I know and every
single business that we speak to they
can't always completely redo their
entire site and I think a lot of this is
about being pragmatic you can integrate
all these different components in like
if you want push notifications like
that's a great thing to add into
anyone's in anyone's individual
experience you don't have to base your
entire experience off the back of that
and you can provide value to a large
subset of your users rather than have to
think about providing the same
experience to all of them but there are
a number of different strategies that
you can take and I think that's a really
powerful way to think about it is like
you start with a good base get the
content out and deliver to the user and
think about how you can kind of enhance
that experience as you go along and that
was me and I know everyone at a time so
thank you very much
