I'm Matt scales on the on Google's web
developer relations team and I'm here to
talk to you about tools and libraries
for building progressive web apps now
part of what makes progressive web apps
possible now is a shift in the way that
the platform itself is being developed
so on the old web we got custom designed
high level features for achieving the
things that w3c thought web developers
wanted to do so developers want images
so we'll give them an image tag
developers want to lay things out in
tables so we'll have a table tag now the
new idea is this thing called the
extensible web and it says that rather
than building simple api's for specific
things we should be getting low level
deep powerful API is that enable a much
broader range of things so rather than a
tag for images let's have a tag for
arbitrary graphics rather than a tag for
tables let's have CSS properties that
let thing let us lay things out however
we want and this is great and it allows
us to upgrade our pages into apps but
there's this gap between the level the
platform gives us and the level would
like to work it and we can fill that gap
with libraries now in the extensible web
the community is given the
responsibility of providing simple easy
to use libraries to handle the specific
things that developers actually want to
do and this is great because it's much
easier to iterate on the API of a
library than it is to iterate the web
platform itself and this means that even
as we speak someone is out there solving
hard problems so that you don't have to
so today I'm going to talk about
libraries and tools for service workers
I'm going to talk about the new web app
features in chrome devtools and also
going to try and answer the question of
is the thing that I built actually a
progressive web app and is there
anything else I need to do
so obviously the most important new
technology as far as progressive web
apps concern is service workers so just
quick recap service worker is a
background thread full your application
opens up new features like offline push
messaging and background data sync and
for the offline use case it acts as a
network proxy right in the client so
whenever your page requests a resource
the service worker gets a chance to
respond to that request it gets chance
to get in the way and do whatever it
wants and also just to remind you this
isn't about working offline necessarily
it's about because even being online can
be a terrible experience if you have
life I or if you just have a slow
connection maybe you're connecting to
hotel Wi-Fi or maybe are somewhere where
data costs a lot of money what you
really want is network independence
you're on the experience of your apt to
be great regardless of the network
situation but in order to achieve that
complex apps are going to require pretty
complex service workers there'll be a
lot of code and there's a lot of new
api's to learn so we're going to help
with that with the library we built
called serviceworker toolbox or s 30
toolbox this was created by by our team
at Google to abstract away the common
patterns for connectivity independence
so here's a pretty simple example of a
serviceworker written with service
record toolbox you import script from
wherever where of it it's residing and
that gives you a global object called
toolbox that exposes the API here we
call toolbox precache and we pass in a
list of resources this says that when
our service worker is installed go ahead
fetch all these things stick them in a
cache so that we know that whenever our
service worker is running it has access
to these resources and you use this for
your app shell and perhaps any really
common small resources throughout your
and then we use a toolbox Rueter to say
to match different behavior to different
parts of our application so here we're
going to set a default we're going to
say that the default behavior for any
route will be something called toolbox
fastest which we'll get to in a moment
and here you can see just an example of
more specific route this is based on
express j/s rooting for anyone who's
build server in node toolbox don't
forget and then there's a URL pattern /
AP I / followed by anything and then the
behavior here will be toolbox data
network first so let's talk about talk
start fastest to what snake no don't
network first so these methods are what
we call strategies these are so
typically you need to think pretty
carefully about exactly what behavior
want you want for different parts of
your application so you need to choose a
different strategy for each route or
potentially nest of your tool box comes
with five built-in strategies fastest
network first cash first cash only and
network only let's go over what they are
so with the fastest strategy request
comes in and we race the network and the
cash whichever one is going to come back
first is going to return to the page so
in this example the cash is going to
come back first which is probably pretty
obvious though obviously it will go to
the network will win if it wasn't in the
cash in the first place if and when the
network ever does succeed updates the
cash that the next time this happens
even if it goes to the cash it's a
slightly fresher version of the resource
so this is good for stuff that you want
to be fast but is allowed to be maybe a
little bit out of date and just doesn't
note because this one always uses the
network if your goal is to save your
users data plan this is obviously not
necessarily the best thing to do for all
your resources
network first request comes in first of
all we try the network and we give that
time to succeed or fail and only if it
fails do we then go to the cash and
return that to the page if the network
request does succeed that updates the
cash even though we're not coming from
the cash this time around so that the
next time we try it when we're offline
or whether it times out we get a more
up-to-date cached version and so you can
read you like fastest and network first
good for slightly different things so if
you imagine a Twitter client then when
you first load your application your
most your highest priority is getting
stuff on screen so the user has your
application so perhaps you use fastest
to loot load the latest tweets because
it's better to show old tweets than
shown no tweets whereas when the user
does a pull to refresh that's a pretty
strong signal they actually want the
freshest data so go to the network and
only go from the cash if you can't use
the network there's an important extra
option to this one because it turns out
that our mobile devices that network
timeout can be two minutes so if you
have life I and your network your device
is absolutely convinced it has a
connection but it doesn't really then
you can have some sort of action and it
can be two minutes before you even
decide to try the cash so we added an
option for the network first strategy
that lets you say give her a more
reasonable time out so here we're saying
after five seconds I don't care about
what's on the network I'd rather show
something cash first go to the cash only
if it's not there do we go to the
network sort of the opposite of network
first again the network will update the
cache but the one of the important
things to realize here is that once that
network request has succeeded once it
will be in the cache and so the cash
will be consulted every time and it will
never be updated so this is still pretty
good for some cases if you have
version urls you have some resource
where the URL will change whenever the
content changes this will work fine for
that and this might be for things that
are that you want to be able to cash the
things that don't change but aren't part
of your application shell so the example
i've been using his blog posts you don't
want to download 10 years with a blog
post the very first time someone comes
to your blog but if they have been to
your site and downloaded a few posts
it's reasonable to keep them around cash
only so this is go to the cash and if it
doesn't if it's like the cash fail this
is good for the stuff that you pre
cashed because you know it's there and
the network only go to the network and
if it fails it fails this is what you
got without service worker and the only
real reason to use this is that if
you've overridden the default with
something like toolbox da fastest this
allows you to go back to the original
behavior just for one root and if those
don't do everything you need to do you
can also define your own strategies so
here we have a function i've created
called fall back fall back issue image
sorry well this does is it takes a
request and it will try and fetch that
request on the network and if it fails
it will respond from the cash but it
won't try and respond with that a cache
of that specific request it will always
respond with this full bank jpg so you
can use this for example if you have
hundreds of profile images on a page
somewhere perhaps it's not actually that
important to have that in your offline
experience you don't want to fill the
user's device with those images so you
have a single image that you use as a
fallback instead and to make this useful
you have to make sure you have pre
cached for Beck image and then set up a
route that actually uses it so it's just
the same as before except instead of
using tool box store whatever we've used
for back image and finally on toolbox
you you can get fine control of the cash
as well so by default when you called
pre cash or when you use a
only or fastest or whatever the cash
that uses is shared over everything in
your whole application it's a default
cash that as to each other it creates
for you and you can on an ad hoc basis
say for this route I want to use a
different cash for whatever reason so
here we've passed in an option called
cash and we've set a name so that it
will be a different named cash that it
uses and now we can set options on that
cash so that this cash can only have up
to 500 entries and entries can only be
even there for up to five days and
there's two we toolbox we'll go in and
clean up periodically now something
we've kind of glossed over there with us
to root toolbox is that that pre cashing
step is actually trickier than it looks
there there are a few problems one is
that in order to get a new install event
you need to change the serviceworker
script not something that service worker
script imports but the actual original
serviceworker script so you have to
remember to actually update that every
time you update every time you do a
release that changes some of the
resources even if the serviceworker
itself the logic doesn't need to change
another problem is that when that when
the install event happens esta web tool
box will take all those resources and
just download them all again even if
none of them have actually changed and
then you also have to maintain a list of
which resources need to be pre cached
it'd be quite easy to miss something out
of that array and then find that in your
next release your offline experience is
slightly broken because a file didn't
make it into there
so we created a tool to however this
called estill your free cash now what
this does is it takes a few simple
options and it writes a service worker
for you it's something you can stick in
your build step you tell it which files
you want to cash it will take a hash of
each file along with the filename and
write those directly into the service
worker so if any of your resources
change the hash will change the service
worker itself will change and you'll get
a new install it also means that when
they install event fires it the service
worker has a list of every resource with
its hash so it can compare it to what it
already has and only download things
that have changed or anew now this can
be used as a command line tool
installable via node and then you call
Esther we run the extra precash and
here's that the simplest option setter
you say where the root of your
application is and it will just precash
everything in that folder you can also
use it as a require abul node module so
you're requiring has to be precash you
call precash right you say which service
worker file you want to write and then
you can pass in some options so here
we've said we're going to use this glob
pattern to say which static files we
actually want to cache and if you're
wondering whether that means that we're
now lost the ability to do that dynamic
caching that s toboi toolbox gamers
there are actually two ways to bring it
back the first is with this runtime
caching option you pass in an array of
objects which specify those routing
rules that you had in s through toolbox
so you have the URL pattern and then you
have which which strategy to use and you
can even pass an option so we have the
network timeout seconds option and this
is great for most simple cases
particularly if you're only using the
built-in strategies and if you want to
do something a bit more fancy if you
want a bit more control you can just say
that you want to import a service worker
you've written yourself so you could let
st precache handle all of the static
resources for your app shell and then do
the dynamic caching using a service
worker toolbox script that you wrote
yourself and it will in line that into
your service worker and this also allows
you to add in things like push
notifications and background sink into
sto pre caches service worker as well
now service worker doesn't work
everywhere as Paul said and serve an app
cache does so just to reiterate should I
use that cash in a new project no
because it's terrible and doesn't do
what you want and the more you can
taught your application to try and fit
cash the more you find that it's still
not going to work and you have to
contort even more and it has security
problems and is just it's generally bad
can't stress that enough however if
you've already got an app cache for your
application we have a tool that will
help you transition so SW app cache
behavior is this little library we've
created what it does is you you import
the library into a serviceworker script
this would be could be your entire
service worker script if you wanted you
create a fetch handler and you just say
in that fej handler i want to respond
with whatever the legacy app cache
behavior would be essentially what this
will do is it will get your app cache
manifest pause it work out what the
correct thing to do for an app cache
would be and then do that but it also
allows you to get around some of the
security issues and some of the things
like never getting into a state where
the app cache is never updated
serviceworker won't actually allow you
to do that
now I story about cache behavior is just
one of a set of things that were hoping
there were they were releasing as part
of our SVU helpers repo as an example of
something else we're doing this offline
analytics so this was written for last
year's google i/o website and i was used
again this year and what this does is
you set up a route for any analytics
requests that uses that the strategy
function that's provided by the library
and whenever one of those analytics
requests fails it will stash it away
somewhere cuter and then when user comes
back online again it will replay it and
add a parameter so that it correctly
attributes the event to the correct the
time actually happened and we're hoping
to add many more things to this repo
over the next coming months so that was
service worker what are the tools what
other things can we help with so no talk
about developer tools is going to be
complete without talking about Chrome's
developer tools and there are some great
new progressive web app features coming
in the next release so almost all of
this is only available from chrome 52
which is currently in beta but it's
moving towards stable in a few weeks so
first what the application panel has
been renamed sorry the resource panel
has been renamed to application to
better reflect that this is now where
you go to look at things to do with a
web app this first panel is allows you
to debug your manifest so it lists what
the browser has correct as detected as
the name of the application what icons
to use what theme color to use and what
start URL is things like that and also
gives he is add to home screen button
allows you to trigger the on before
install prompt so you can test code to
do with delaying the install prompt
service work panel has been redesigned
to hopefully be a lot clearer the all of
the service work is for the current
application will be shown in a list
which I should probe got a screenshot
but there'll be less confusing about
which ones active and what you can
actually do to each of those service
workers it has all of the same features
that did it before but it has some extra
ones too so the top here there are these
three check boxes offline is a shortcut
to the same thing in the network panel
that says you want the network condition
to be offline so that allow is great for
testing the offline behavior of your
application and make sure that your
service worker is working correctly
updates on reload means that whenever
the the origin is refreshed it will
check for a new service work here and
potentially do an install if it's
changed do the whole service worker
install dance regardless of how long it
has been since it last checked and
bypass for network says that the service
worker should load the install and
activate events should happen it should
still be called for push and background
sync but the fetch event should never be
fired whenever any request comes in it
should not should not try the service
worker to resolve it this is good if
you've got your save and refresh
workflow going on for a resource that
would be cached for a long time by
Service Worker allows you to just go
back to your normal workflow in
development the clear storage panel so
as a consumer of Chrome you've probably
seen the feature of clear private
browsing data not allows you to get rid
of cookies and things like that for a
period of time you say I want to get rid
of cookie private browsing data from a
day ago of the last week or forever was
this as a bit more developer oriented
this is for the current origin only I
would like to clear these things and the
options that it gives you are things
like service worker
cash index DB and things like that a
developer might be more interested in
and I also want to call that feature
that's actually been there a while but
people don't necessarily know about just
down here is this cash storage viewer
the lets you see what things are
actually in the cache API cash that
you're using with your service worker so
this can help you debug issues with pre
caching or when a request is failing
something you think should be in the
cash so finally we I was going to talk
about the the question of is my thing
actually a progressive web app now I
don't think we can really answer that
question because it's a bit of an open
question but we can try and get a bit
further there one of the things that we
call here is if we had a button wicker
click that were just like tell me is is
it a progressive web app am i there yet
so the chrome team built one and we
called it lighthouse this is both a
Chrome extension and a node-based
command line tool which has a whole
bunch of different tests in it that it
runs on your site and gives you advice
and things that you might be missing and
it also has this very cool professional
looking logo so as a Chrome extension
you load up your page you click the
button and then it will reload the page
a few times connect with the the remote
debugging protocol gather a whole bunch
of metrics and then spit out this report
it'll give you a score which you which
will give you a vague idea of what it
thinks of your your application and it
will tell you anywhere that it thinks
that you might have missed something it
also has this best practices section
there's things that it's not going to
score you on maybe you don't actually
need to do these things but if you do
you should check on them just gives you
a bit of a guide you can also run it as
a command line tool just for anyone
who's thinking of typing in URLs they
see on the screen air horn
calm make some noise I gave this Tucker
I oh and about 30 seconds after the
slide came up so from the audience so
you run it on the command line and it
will output by default layout for pretty
printed at a console you can also output
Jason that you can pause yourself or the
same HTML that the extension gives you
and it's also require balazs a node
module so you can say lighthouse and
then the URL and then that returns a
promise which resolves with the JSON
that you would have got from the command
line tool and obviously the CLI and node
module we're both good ways of adding
lighthouse to your regular tests or
continuous integration I'd like to draw
attention to the big alpha in the corner
here I just want to be clear that this
is early stages none of the rules of
final I'm sure there's a lot of
discussion to be had about what the
rules say and whether they're good rules
if you would like to contribute to that
discussion or better yet contribute pull
requests you can find us on gab and it
also like to point out that this
currently only works in chrome 52 plus
which is currently in beta so to recap
progressive web applications are made
possible by the extensible web I made
practical by libraries and tools their
whole bunch of Service Worker libraries
out there from google and from others
with more coming chrome devtools is
awesome as always and lighthouse
attempts to tell you when you're done as
prey a bit too definite in this slide
okay thank you very much I hope that was
useful
