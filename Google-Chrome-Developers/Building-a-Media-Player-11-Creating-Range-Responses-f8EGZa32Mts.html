entry I talked about the idea of
chunking the Downloads as they came in
so imagine you've got the large video
the large audio file and you want to
tuck them up into bytes into like half
Meg jumps or something because we don't
want to be pulling out that entire video
however big it is from end to end just
to get a slice out of the middle does
that make sense maybe not well join with
join me on the journey through the range
request now in case you haven't seen to
this point when we make a request for a
video or part of a video we do a thing
called a range request which is get me
the bytes zero to a thousand two
thousand to five thousand whatever you
like and so in order to satisfy that we
actually have in our serviceworker
to handle the range response we need to
be able to take in a range request and
satisfy from the cache a range response
as such we don't want to be pulling out
a large amount of data just to get a
small chunk of it so the idea of
chunking the vials in the first place is
to make sure that we can pull out as
little information as possible
reasonably so and just get a little bit
we kind of need and pop that out now I'd
like it if the caches API actually
supported it but it doesn't so we do it
ourselves so as we left things last time
in fact let me show you where things had
got to last time we have a copy of a
video in the cache that looks like this
so 0 1 these are all the chunks for the
720p video let me show you what happens
when the Shocker player starts to
request video look at these guys a pair
of monkeys right let's have a look at
one of these requests maybe out the
header request that's the options we
don't need that we want mmm there we are
there's the range part of the request it
says he wants bytes two six one four
five zero three two four one five two
two four three nine okay so let's have a
look at the serviceworker this is the
fetch so whenever a request
is made by the page it's going to come
to the service workers fetch handler
which is registered here as on fetch now
the first thing I actually do is I say
given this request I hunt this off to my
arranged response class which is exactly
what we're gonna be looking in but a
moment and I ask it look with this range
request sir witness request that you've
got can you handle it and if it's not a
range of question it's gonna say no and
if it is a range request it's going to
start going wow I do I have enough bytes
to actually handle that particular range
because if I don't you should really
definitely fall back to the network so
we basically start with well can you
handle it if you can sure go ahead and
handle it if you can't just check to see
whether there's a match for the file in
the cache because I mean will be a range
request but it may be a request for
something like an icon or one of the
album arts or the post the frames in
which case that might exist in the cache
and we can just respond with it directly
from the cache without a range response
and then last but not least for
everything else that we don't have we
fall through to a standard issue go to
the network fetch it and then just bring
it back so all the interesting stuff I
think is happening inside this arranged
response class this is the range
response class and you can see that
here's the can handle and the first
question is is it a range request
because if it isn't we don't care so the
question is when we go to the request an
we look at its headers is there a range
header and if there is then great if not
there isn't and so on and assuming that
it is a range request the next thing we
do is we actually look for the URL so we
try and get we'd in theory we get the
the whole file from from the cache and
if we can just respond with that then we
would but the chances are in fact we
probably don't even need this code
anymore
I might just remove that because there's
it is a range request and so just
responding with the entire response
would be a bit bizarre so I might need
to drop that code so let's assume that
after this I will in fact
drop that code what will happen next is
that we go through and we say right what
is the range request and I ask for
things like the start and end so that
because that range request is a string
and it's like bytes this to this there's
a little bit of string parsing in the
get start and end and we can pull out
two values the start byte and the end
byte now if you remember I was chunking
the files up into I think it was half a
megabyte chunks and so what I do is I
say well look given the start and end
values which chunks do we need and I say
look do you have the file underscore say
nine and underscore ten which will be
based off these values and it might be
like nine through twelve and I assume
that if you've got nine and twelve
you've got ten and eleven in the middle
which is an assumption on my part but
there you go this is it works out fine
for me in my particular situation so
there we go and we basically say well
look do you have a response for every
single one of those chunks do you have
like nine and ten or nine through eleven
or whatever and if the answer is yes or
if the answer's no then we just bail if
the answer is yes then I have to start
diving in a little bit more and I have
to start looking in each of those chunks
and particularly the last chunk remember
perhaps in the the bit where we were
actually storing each of these chunks we
might actually have a partial chunk we
might not have an exactly a half
megabyte chunk at the end we might have
say 200 bytes and so I store this header
on the actual chunk size against that
chunk so later on I can say well look
get me what that actual chunk says is
because even if you think it's you know
512 K in my ocean be 200 bytes so I need
to know and what I do is I say what was
the byte range and what's the actual
final bite that I have stored in the
cache now if I've stored the entire
thing offline we're good if I've only
stored part of the file like in the case
of prefetching the first 30 seconds
eventually I'm going to run out of data
that I've prefetched and so that's where
this one really helps us out because
it's the it's the bit where we say we
definitely can or cannot handle the
range even if we got so part of that
data if we can do the entire byte range
we should say no
so eventually if the final byte in the
end chunk is less than the end we just
say no otherwise we say sure and that's
that's the bit way we're just checking
now can you handle this range response
can you create this range response from
this range request so that's that first
part then so there are a few helpers in
here and here's the other one actually
creating the ranged response so what we
want to do is we want to go through and
we want to if s it's in creators in it
yes create from it from chunks that's
the probably the more interesting one
you can have a look through all this
source code it is on github have a
proper look through this file to see all
the different things that I'm doing what
we do in the create from chunk so again
we've got like this video it's in loads
of chunks and we want to get just the
chunks we need and pop those together
and then use that to create our response
what we do is we go through and again we
do with the requests we find out which
indexes we need if the start and the end
index is totally the same then we can
just you know we can sort of shortcut
this this this next process because well
it's just one chunk so you guys will
just pull that one chunk out slice the
bit you need and send that back but if
you need to do multiple chunks that's
the next bit and there's just a bunch of
wrangling here which isn't all that much
fun but what we do that's are probably
of interest the least of me was copying
the buffer so we make one big buffer for
the you know the number of chunks that
we've got and we copy each of the
buffers in so now we've got one big
buffer with like all the bikes from the
chunks that we pulled out so like nine
10 11 let's get all those bytes and make
a and a buffer that's got enough space
for 9 10 11 shove them all in there
that's the thing we send across and then
we can create the ranged response from
that we go through and given the start
and the end and whatever else we slice
off the start and the end from that
particular buffer that we had and you
see that there's like an offset value
here because we've started partway in to
the file so if I say I need bytes
I don't know can't do the maths quickly
enough here but if I said I needed bytes
10,000 to 11,000 and I've only given you
an array of two thousand bytes because
I've kind of offset you by the number of
chunks that we've got I need to offset
you back so that your index is that
you're actually look looking for have
been offset by the number of chunks in
that we were yeah it's all wrangling I
tell you it's all wrangling eventually
though thankfully we can see that the
response comes back and we do have the
bytes and it all kinda does the thing
that we wanted it to do
so it does mean that we are responding
from the cache with the chunks that we
need and everything is working now what
else can I explain to you about all this
well there's one little thing that I
thought was quite interesting which I
didn't realize at all before I got to
this these video files as you'll see
they're coming from this storage dog
Google API Google api's com they're
actually being stored in a cloud bucket
a Google cloud bucket she's great
but it does mean that I'm making calls
requests because they're not on the same
origin as me they're not coming from
localhost:8080
and I have had a fairly troubled
relationship with cause it never seems
to sink in for me it's just one of those
things that I'm not very you know OFA
with I'll be honest with you and I was
used to the idea that you have the
access control allow origin and most
people put star if they're comfy with
that or they'll put in the specific
origin what I didn't realize is that you
also need to say whether the request can
be made with credentials so that's
things like cookies and whatever and the
headers that are allowed to be exposed
you can see here in the in the access
control expose headers one of these that
is the X from cache header now the
reason I do this I've got the X from
cache header in here because there's
times where I will need to know that a
particular chunk came in from the cache
why what
the Shocker player is one very good
reason for this is that it does its
bandwidth estimations based on each of
these responses coming back in cool okay
but the problem is if it comes from a
cache it's going to come back really
quickly and so it's going to estimate
that the bandwidth is super good doesn't
sound too bad and it's not bad if you've
got the entire video cached for offline
because it doesn't really matter what it
thinks the bandwidth is and it because
I've also locked it into a particular
representation of the video but what if
you're in the situation where you've
pre-loaded the say first 30 seconds of
the video and then you're dropping back
down to a network and adaptive later on
in that situation you can't get away
with that so what you have to do is you
have to say right first of all this
first 30 seconds ignore these for the
bandwidth calculations and that's what
the exon cache header really is going to
be doing it's going to be telling Shaka
don't include these chunks there they're
misrepresentative they're not actually
the kind of jumps you want to be a
counting for when you do your bandwidth
estimations but in order for that to
work in order for that header to be
passed through you actually have to say
it's a loud header it's an exposed
header and header you're allowed to
expose on the server side
why well what happens is this I make
from my page a request the request is
handled by the service worker and the
service worker is using the responses
for the videos and so on then it got
from the cloud bucket and so what it
does is it goes right which headers am I
allowed to send it I wanted to say well
it's it's an X from cache response which
you'll see in the code here this is X
from cache but if if the server side
didn't say that it was an allowed header
the serviceworker will go I'm just going
to strip out I'm going to filter out any
any headers that the server didn't tell
me that could go with this particular
response so even though I'm adding it in
the serviceworker if the server side
doesn't say you're allowed to put that
header on the serviceworker will filter
it out which makes sense
I can't just you know take
a cross origin resource add-on my own
custom headers and then expected to ship
out exactly as was I have to make sure
that the service said that those headers
were allowed to be added in the first
place so there you go that's something
that I found quite interesting I didn't
you know I kind of followed the chain of
logic to the end but it did take me a
little while to kind of go oh I wonder
if it's something I need to kind of
configure on the server side to say that
those headers are allowed if I was
looking at responsive doing those
headers are coming in but none of my
headers are coming in why would my
headers get filtered out and it turns
out yes if the if the server doesn't say
you're allowed to actually add them in
or have them there then the Service
Worker will let you add them but it all
then filter them out before it sends the
response back to the page so there you
go now we've all learnt something
thrilling nobody ever says that about
course you know what I did today I did
cause hooray
it's not a fun area but it's a very
necessary one for you know making sure
that resources are loaded correctly in
all the rest of it so I see its value I
just don't enjoy working with it it's
just one of those things anyway that's
the serviceworker side of things for
humbling the chunks and for putting
things back together into ranged
responses definitely have a read through
that code I've tried to make it as the
bose as possible so that in six months
when I look back at it I'm not I'm not
completely confused and hopefully that
will mean that if you look at it you
won't be completely confused either but
if you've got questions well you know
exactly where to put those down there as
usual and don't forget that you can
subscribe and say hello to me on Twitter
or wherever you like and I will catch
you oh yeah in the next entry I

enjoyed this video well you may enjoy
other videos that we make too so don't
forget you can subscribe and you'll get
notified when we push out a new video
and there's more videos over there or
