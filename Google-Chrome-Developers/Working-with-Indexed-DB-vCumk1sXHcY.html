applications we need to store more than
static assets we need to store data one
of the best places to do this is in a
database fortunately we have one called
index DB for example we might have a
database of musicians the table on the
screen lists the four members of the
Beatles
let's look at how we could put this into
a database let's start with what index
DB isn't it's not a relational database
and it doesn't use SQL you could build
these features on top of it but that's
not what you get right out of the box
index DB is an object store it holds
JavaScript objects you can store objects
strings arrays numbers anything that can
be cloned even files you can do basic
searching and sorting as long as you're
not writing a complex query it even
supports transactions when you open a
database you can add data to it directly
but you'll more commonly create an
object store and add the data there each
database can have multiple object stores
they're a little like a table for
example there could be a user's object
store containing user profile data while
the object store will assign a unique
key to each user object you can also
define indexes such as index by email
address we can then use the index to
retrieve the data in the object store by
the email as well as the unique key you
saw the musicians table earlier now
let's look at the musicians object store
we've defined a key to be the artists
name which we extract from the name
property in the object we could set
indexes on the other properties if we
want so here we're not it's time to look
at some actual code the raw index DB API
is a bit tricky to work with it's an
older asynchronous API that uses
callbacks and fires events to signal
completion and error to make things
easier we'll use the index DB promise
library a small wrapper around the index
DB API that uses promises this was
written by Jake Archibald here at Google
and is open source if you want to see
the
regional API mdn has an excellent
write-up we're going to follow the usual
pattern of opening a database and
creating objects tours will then
populate those stores with data
ID be open creates or opens a database
it takes a name version number and an
optional callback function to manage the
object stores it also returns a promise
while use a callback function here the
object stores can only be created and
destroyed during the open call putting
them in a trailing promise would be too
late the upgrade callback is only called
when the database is first created or if
the version number is greater than the
existing version number namely an
upgrade the next step is to create the
object stores before I show you some
code let's talk about what goes into
each object store you want all of the
objects in the store to have the same
format so you can index them some
objects may have extra properties but
you want the core properties to be all
the same now that's out of the way let's
take a look in the upgrade callback
inside the upgrade callback will receive
an upgrade database object we can then
create the object store by calling
create object store if we try to create
an existing object store we'll get an
error so remember to check the object
store names first like any other
database the object store can have a
primary key this is a value that
uniquely identifies each object in the
store if you want a primary key you need
to define it when you create the object
store you do this by passing an options
object after the name in the first
example we're using an email address as
the key the email address has to be
unique for each object the second and
third examples use a key generator to
assign a serial number to each object
the second example stores the number
separate from the object and the third
example stores at any object ID property
sometimes you want to search out
something other than the primary key you
can do this by adding an index for
another property indexing makes the
lookups faster but it also makes a
database larger so use these with care
to create the indexes call create index
on the object
door in this example we're adding an
email index to the store we can add the
unique : true option to make sure each
address is unique you can also add a
multi entry option for arrays
this chooses between indexing every
value in the array or treating the whole
array as a key now that we have a
database with object stores let's see
how to get data in and out indexdb
supports the usual crud operations
create retrieve update and delete it
also uses transactions to group these
operations together these operations
should look pretty familiar and get put
delete and get all do what you expect
cursor however is something different it
extracts values by index or key you have
to wrap the operations in transaction
this groups the operations together so
they happen as a unit such as reading of
value modifying it and writing it back
transactions help ensure the database is
always in a consistent state they're
also important if you have multiple
copies of your app running as they
prevent simultaneous writes to the same
data when you work with a transaction
you first open a transaction on the
database transactions may be read only
or read/write you then open any object
stores and indexes you will need finally
you can perform the operations it seems
like a lot of steps but it's needed to
preserve the integrity of the database
let's look at adding data remember that
we're using Jake's promise wrapper so
the database itself is delivered as a
promise we let it resolve create a
read/write transaction and then open the
object store now we can out our value
notice that we're returning transaction
got complete at the end this is a
promise that settles when the
transaction is done or has an error it's
important to wait for this winter
transaction changes the database getting
data is a bit simpler open a transaction
in the object store then call yet you
don't have to wait for the transaction
to complete as you're only reading
getting the data is a good enough result
by the way you may wonder when the
transaction closes indexdb manages
transaction lifetimes automatically you
can safely assume they're closed by the
next time the browser enters the idle
updating data looks just like adding
data except that we're using put instead
of add this could be made into a
read-modify-write operation by calling
it updating the object and then writing
it all in the same transaction call
delete to remove an item by now you see
the pattern since it changes the
database you need to wait for the
transaction to complete we haven't
talked about how to search yet indexdb
lets you get a block of data based on a
key or index
any fancier searching is up to you the
easiest way is to get all the data in an
array by calling at all since this is a
read-only transaction you don't need to
wait for it to complete another way to
retrieve all the data is to use a cursor
a cursor will select each object in an
object store or index sequentially
allowing you to do something with each
element once we get a cursor we need to
use it to read each element this is a
bit tricky essentially you want to loop
to get the value from the cursor exit if
the cursor is null and call continue to
advance the cursor this is one of those
rare spots where using promises makes us
more complicated this time we've given
our function a name so we can call it
from inside itself recursively to recap
what this code is doing we break out if
the cursor is null otherwise we get the
object from the cursors value property
and print it we then call continue to
advance the cursor and recursive our
function take a moment and breathe we're
almost done we don't have to get all the
data we can select a subset both open
cursor and get all will take an ID B key
range values to select a subset of
values you can specify any one of these
three lower bound upper bound or a plane
bound with a lower and upper value
there's also an only method not shown
here and here we are if we wanted all
products from soda and later sorted
alphabetically this is how we would do
it we create a range with a lower bound
and pass it to get all we're about to
get to the lab but first you may want to
check out some of these polyfills and
tools these make indexdb much easier to
use now it's your turn go to the indexdb
lab in there you will get to practice in
a
experiment with everything we've talked
about here have fun a good luck
we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
