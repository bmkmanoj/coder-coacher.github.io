the cornerstones of a good progressive
web app but not everything can be made
to work offline and letting you know
what they can and cannot do is important
for smooth user experience as a simple
example while the landing page of your
blog will surely be available offline
you probably won't have all your posts
cached some blog posts on the landing
page can be clicked while others cannot
to convey this to the user this simple
trick is to fade out the links of
articles that are not available when the
offline event is admitted you can
traverse all your links check if they're
in the cache by using the cache API and
set a style that saves the text out
additionally set point events to none so
that they become uncollectible when the
online event is emitted remove
themselves again and everything will be
back to normal and that's it a simple
trick with a couple lines of code to
make your UI respond to changes in
connectivity keep in mind though that an
online event doesn't actually mean the
usual house connectivity for example
they could be behind a captive portal at
an airport so life.i is a thing see you
next time
if you like supercharge you should
probably subscribe to this channel so
you know about all the new videos or if
you don't want to wait you can watch our
most recent live streams over there and
actually you should do both
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
