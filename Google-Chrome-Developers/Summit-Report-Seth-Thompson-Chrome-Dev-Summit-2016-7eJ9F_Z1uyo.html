2016 we're just chillin here on the
steps after lunch i'm here with Seth
Thompson part of the PM team that works
on web the web platform and you just
gave an amazing talk on v8 web assembly
a bunch of new features in the
JavaScript engine can be a little
overview what happened sure so yeah we
started with a sort of a state of the
union of v8 and some of the performance
enhancements we've been working on for
real websites not sort of the static
benchmarks then we converted some
promise then heavy code into a single
weight which yields a lot better sort of
readability and and then ended with a
web assembly demo that's awesome i know
i know you we've gone from like
callbacks to promises now to a sink in a
way which is synchronous code again but
it's still very async exactly and you
know you get the readability of
synchronous code but you don't block the
main thread it's still a sink under the
hood so that's really and when is that
landing in chrome stable do we know yeah
so it's actually in canary now and if
all goes now it'll be out in the next
chrome release awesome and so web
assembly i know for folks at home maybe
that don't know what that is or they've
heard of you know as amjad can you give
a little overview maybe the differences
between the two so web assembly is a new
open cross browser plugin free way to
run native code on the web and unlike
asthma jeff's before it it's designed
from the ground up for this use case so
it's a tiny binary format you get near
native performance and going forward
we're going to try to add even more
native features to web assemblies so
things like shared array buffers
threading and another features like that
let's can be so powerful for the web
awesome stuff to see be sure to check
out Seth to talk on YouTube join us on
twitter at hashtag chrome dev summit
we're gonna sign off for now join us a
little bit thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
