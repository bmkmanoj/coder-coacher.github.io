added images and CSS and now we have
something that actually looks like a
real block but also it's at this point
in development where you have to start
to worry about the weight of your site
because all of these images and the CSS
files add weight add file size that has
to be downloaded for the site to
actually appear as you like so if you
are developing on your big desktop
machine with a big screen and a good
network connection everything might feel
great and look great but if you surf the
exact same experience to a motor g4
phone on a 3G network it might feel very
very differently so we've already talked
about a bit how you can streamline your
loading to make it feel faster for the
user but another thing that you can look
into is caching headers caching headers
help the browser only down at the things
that have actually changed and I thought
that was very important and I wanted to
implement it correctly in my blog I've
already given some tips in the past on
caching headers in a microchip so I'm
gonna link to that one in the
description down below but let's do a
quick recap so the advice that I usually
give is to segment your files into two
groups the one group is the files that
are entry points to your app which is
usually your HTML files and the other
group is all the rests JavaScript CSS
images what-have-you for the HTML files
you always want to revalidate with the
server if the version that you locally
have is still the most recent one and
the caching header for that is called
must or evaluate so that means the
browser has to check with the server if
the version is still the most recent one
and if it is it doesn't have to
redownload so it doesn't really save you
time but it does save the users
bandwidth and that's already a win for
javascript and CSS you want to put the
hash of the content into its file name
and then set the caching duration to a
really long time so in this example I'm
going
choose max age and then something like
31 million
31 million sounds big and it is big and
it's roughly a year so I'm saying these
files are allowed to be served straight
from cache without checking with the
server for a year and that's okay
because if the file changed the file
name would change we put the hash in
there after all and that's why this
caching procedure works all these assets
will be a referenced by the HTML so the
browser will rivality the HTML with the
server but if that didn't change it can
just use all the other assets from cache
doesn't have to hit the network and that
will save us a lot of time so I said the
browser has to revaluate with a server
but I didn't really explain how that
works so in HTTP there's two request
headers that allow this mechanism one is
called if modified since and the other
header is called if non-match if
modified since basically means I have a
version cache that is from this state if
it has been changed after the state
please send it to me if non-match
basically says I have a version cache
that has this specific attack if the
current version has a different attack
please send it to me both of these
headers achieve the same effect in only
downloading something when actually
necessary just one a state based and one
is etag based I personally feel like the
date based version is a little bit less
robust so I prefer etags most of the
time but the problem here is that we are
running a blog that is written in PHP
and that means that most of our content
is dynamically generated so how would
you generate a hash of the content of
something that is dynamically generated
so it turns out there's actually a
pretty neat trick in PHP that you can
use to achieve that and I'm gonna show
you how so PHP has two functions one of
them is called OB start and the other
one is called OB get clean OB here
stands for output buffer and it
basically means that any output I
generate will be put into a variable as
long as it is between the
to function cults so that means instead
of sending the output straight to the
user to the browser
I insert get it in a variable first and
then I can use this variable to
calculate the sha-256 hash of the
content and this is the way how I can
generate an e-tag for the content that I
have generated the only thing left to do
is to do the matching myself if I
actually need to send the variable or
not so I grab the if non-match header
from the request and see if my content
hash and the one from the header match
up and if that's the case I just send a
three or four saying no change just
reuse what you already have and if they
don't match that's only when I actually
echo the variable saying now actually do
send the content to a client we can see
this in action in chrome dev tools in
the network tab so if we clear out all
the caches basically start fresh and
load our page we can see in the network
tab that we download about 300 kilobytes
and that all of our requests have the
status code 200 because the cache is
empty nothing can be reused but if we
now reload the page after our caches
have been warmed up as I say you can see
that pretty much every request turns
into a 304 meaning not modified and the
total download size went down to just
one kilobyte because we could reuse
everything that was already in cash and
didn't have to download anything new and
that's pretty good right I think being
mindful of your users bandwidth is
really important you know when you're on
this really bad hotel Wi-Fi on vacation
this is where all these techniques
really help and you wish every website
would use them next time however we're
going back to some more front-end decode
and we are going to build a Rooter you
know the thing it takes care of
transitions and making it all really
shiny so if you want to see that
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
