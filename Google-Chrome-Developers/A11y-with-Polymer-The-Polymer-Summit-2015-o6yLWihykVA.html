my name is Laura Palmeiro I'm the
program manager for accessibility on the
chrome team and I'm Alice voxel I'm a
software engineer on accessibility long
term great we're really excited to be
here today to talk with you all about
polymer one point no accessibility first
off when we say accessibility what do we
actually mean just adjust this so
accessibility refers to the design of
products services devices and
environments for people with
disabilities so one in six individuals
has a disability this is fifteen percent
of the global population about billion
users so this is a really substantial
amount of people a significant statistic
but disability really impacts us on a
very personal level to give you a little
bit of insight into my personal story
and my experience with disability I'm
what's considered to be a low vision
user or a legally blind person I have a
really rare visual condition called
choroidal stms essentially that means
that centrally my vision is very
impacted so if you can imagine
everything prefer Lee is quite clear and
I'm able to navigate around and walk
without assistance but everything that I
looked directly at sorry excuse me for
one moment thank you but everything that
I looked directly at and is really
impacted so it's a mixture of blur and
distortion almost if you imagine like a
funhouse mirror effect and then little
flashing lights the kind of pulse all
around and this happened really
unexpectedly when I was 14 years old
within one week I actually went from
being you know having 2020 vision to
being legally blind and and this was a
big shock to me it was a huge period of
transition for myself as well as my
family and quite honestly when I first
started I was ignores just about to
enter high school and all of a sudden I
was entering school again not being able
to read a blackboard or to read a book
or honestly too
distinguished face walking down the
hallway this was this was big this was a
big shock and I would come home from
school at night and my parents and
brother would literally read to me
because my materials weren't available
in other accessible formats at the time
my dad taught me all of my math classes
after school because the teachers
couldn't quite figure out what to do
with the student who couldn't visually
see the blackboard and in my opinion
this was the definition of disability
and dependence and I quite honestly
hated it because I was just a
fourteen-year-old girl i'm just trying
to fit in and be normal and this really
stopped me and I'm so overly thankful
for that amazing amount of support from
my family I don't know where I'd be
without them today but that wasn't going
to stain for me and that wasn't going to
be how I can move forward on my path so
over the next few years and my vision
kind of continue to shift a little bit
and I did recover a tiny little field of
vision in my left eye that remains
centrally I can see about three letters
at a time or so to give you a sense so
actually to give you a glimpse into my
world and what I see and I heavily rely
on using a mixture of all of my
different senses of vision whether
central with that tiny little field or
the peripheral vision to kind of piece
together every image in every
environment so if I wanted to take a
look at the beautiful canals in
Amsterdam for example I'm gonna go ahead
and pull this up on google image search
and my typical method here would be to
zoom in on the page really expand the
content and use that flexible you I to
be able to then use that little tiny
field of central vision that I have as
well as the peripheral vision to put
together the image the best way that I
can so you know we can all be looking at
this picture and not all of us are going
to see at the exact same way but the
really important thing is that the UI is
flexible enough to allow me to customize
it so that I can then see it the best
way that I can also to give you another
little glimpse this is how I use gmail
actually so I use a mixture of screen
reading support so text to speech
software and contrast adjustments as
well as magnification so I'm going to go
ahead and zoom on in
to the level of magnification that works
best for me and then I see an email here
from Alice so I'm going to go ahead and
open that and then I'm going to
highlight the text hey let's meet up
tomorrow and practice our talk I'll
bring those travels if you bring the
coffee then I can go ahead and respond
sounds great and now I can Jamie about
coffee so this this solution and this
assistive technology has literally
transformed by life and thinking back to
when we first kind of discovered all of
this when I was entering college we
would literally take physical books and
textbooks and strip their bindings off
we would high-speed scan the pages then
convert them using OCR software put them
into an electronic format and then I
could use this text to speech and
magnification to make it work for me so
by no means was this process pretty but
it completely changed my life and it
gave me that independence back and it
was at this point that I realized the
tremendous impact that technology can
have on people's lives and it has driven
my passion into accessibility ever since
so let's talk about some of the users
who might be needing assistive
technology or requiring accessibility
and design so we could be talking about
users like myself who are low vision and
more perhaps people who are fully blind
who rely on full screen reading software
or Braille we could be talking about
people with hearing impairments or who
may be profoundly deaf who rely on
screen captioning or sign language we
could be talking about people with motor
impairments or dexterity impairments
maybe it's hard for them to use a
physical mouse or to use a keyboard they
may rely on speech recognition software
or even a virtual keyboard or switch
controller or we could be considering
people who are neurologically diverse so
perhaps somebody who has dyslexia or
autism and maybe they need to have a
little bit more support on their screen
of keeping focus or maybe even using
text-to-speech software we could even
consider people in situational
impairments so for example somebody who
just you know broke her arm I can't type
for the next three months what do you do
then and lastly I'd definitely urge
everybody to think about the age
ulation as technology is more and more
heavily used in everyone's day to day
lives as people get older they may
experience some slight deterioration of
vision or hearing and they're going to
expect their devices are going to be
there to support them throughout their
life and throughout the phases very
seamlessly so this is a lot of different
different use cases and disability is a
really broad spectrum so when you're
designing by no means are we saying that
you have to individually test for each
and every single use case but we want to
kind of expand what we're talking about
here today and think about how we can
actually design for the most group the
highest amount of people at once so from
the from now on in this talk we're
actually going to focus our efforts on
talking about guidelines that can help
us through accessible design and we'll
also talk through the process that we
followed for enhancing polymer one point
of accessibility so for polymer one
point of the polymer team really wanted
to create a set of a set of elements
that they could stand behind in terms of
their accessibility and their usability
by a really broad range of uses so we
created a checklist that would allow us
to sort of capture a bunch of best
practices that we could run over each
each element and sort of give it a sort
of okay this is our best effort i'm
making this accessible and this
checklist is based on the web components
gold standard which is available
publicly on github the gold standard
actually includes accessibility just
generally throughout the checklist as it
makes the position that accessibility is
just part of any complete custom element
but we've just here pulled out the
accessibility related items and group
them into a few categories that we sort
of like keep in mind as we're going
through and sort of like make sense to
kind of bundle together great and to
give you a sense of our process that we
took leading up to the Palmer one point
no lunch we created this the spreadsheet
tracker and this is just a small
snapshot of it and we used these
guidelines that Alice just mentioned to
test each element individually and as
you can imagine leading up to the one
point o launch there was a lot going on
a lot
moving pieces and we had to figure out
how to prioritize accessibility within
this broader scope of work so we helped
to prioritize on two axes so first how
critical was the user issue and second
and basically how high traffic did we
expect that that element would be
comparatively great so to walk you
through our process that we took to test
for accessibility identify issues and
then resolve the issues we're going to
take you through a quick case study of
the paper check box element great so
let's start with the keyboard so here
good here we've got the traditional
experience with the mouse pointer so I
can go ahead and use the mouse pointer
to hover over these checkboxes to go
ahead and click to check or uncheck them
and I get a nice little animation it's
very smooth but now let's take a look at
the keyboard experience what if this
user can't really use a mouse they need
to use the keyboard only so in this
early demo I'm tabbing through but
getting no no sort of visual feedback so
i really don't know where i am on the
screen you may have heard some little
dings in there and that was me trying to
press ENTER to activate one of the
checkboxes and nothing was working so
major fail this is not going to work so
what actually went wrong here so we're
missing focus so we're also missing
focused visibility and it's not keyboard
interactive so I can't actually use or
activate the check boxes with just the
keyboard only so I breaking those items
down one by one taking a look at for
exhibit by comparison we have just a
native checkbox here a couple of native
checkboxes this is sort of trying to
recreate the experience where you filled
in a credit card for maybe a flight
booking if you're me you're going to go
through with the keyboard fill it out
really quickly not even touch the mouse
because I just yeah I know my credit
card details and will not get to the end
and I'm going to check the yes I read
and agree to the terms and conditions
checkbox because I've totally done that
and then I really need to make sure that
I uncheck this please spare me every day
a check box so I can move focus there
and uncheck it so very very simple
something we're probably all familiar
with but to break down those concepts we
have those checkboxes are focusable I
can move the keyboard focus there and I
feel like I'm sort of circularly
defining focus here but the focus and
the focus ring that you see there I kind
of a promise that you can do something
with this element using the keyboard so
in the case of like the credit card
field I could cut time I credit card
details into it once the focus moves
down to these checkboxes I can check and
uncheck them with the keyboard the way
that we make custom elements focusable
is by using the tabindex attribute so
techniques can take one of three sort of
ranges of values if tab index is 0
that's going to put it in the natural
tab order so following the Don traversal
so this is just exactly the same as you
would get with a native checkbox if tap
index is negative 1 it's going to be
programmatically focusable but you're
not going to be able to get to using the
tab key so this might be a piece of
modal UI or something like a menu item
where you want to actually have control
over when focus gets to it rather than
just having the user stumble across it
in the tab order if tap index is greater
than zero it's going to be in a manual
tab order so you get to specify any sort
of index in there all of those elements
are going to come before everything else
in the tab order this obviously makes
very little sense on the outside of a
custom element because you don't know
where your elements going to fall in the
page by definition it is scoped within
shadow Dom but if you don't know whether
or not you're going to be in shadow Dom
again it really makes no sense to use it
this is kind of something that you
really want to mostly avoid in the case
of paper check box actually making it
focusable is really straightforward
because we have this post attribute
object so host attributes is going to be
applied just after the element is
created but it's also going to respect
any value that the author the web page
over has provided for that value so in
this case we could take a paper check
box and I could say no I really need
this paper check box to be right up
front in the page give it a tab index of
one it's going to appear before the gala
rounds and tablet oh so that's working
as expected
so once you've made something focusable
it's absolutely critical to make sure
that you can tell when it's focused so
I've actually seen developers do all the
right things and add all of their custom
keyboard event handling and make things
for kissable and they have designers
come in and say we're not a fan of that
focus ring turn it off and what this
looks like to a keyboard user is that
they have just thrown the wonder of us
because they can't tell what's going on
they can't even tell that focus is
getting to the element that you know
that they may be able to do something so
it's absolutely mandatory to make focus
visible in some way so if you are forced
to turn off that focus ring you can
obviously match the focus style and in a
custom element you would probably want
to match that on the host or where have
you put the tabindex so in case of a
complex custom element which might have
multiple focus of all things inside of
it you would obviously match those in
this case I've just created like this
silly toy element with a star and I'm
going to say okay make the background
color for that star span this nice
polymer blue and yeah then I'm done with
that for paper check box it's actually
done a whole end round around the CSS
focus styling system and actually uses
its own custom paper in key focus
behavior which gives it that nice ripple
it makes it a really consistent
experience with using a pointer so it's
going to look just the same whether
using a pointer or focus it's going to
yeah you're really nice experience once
we've addressed the focus ability and
the visible focus then obviously we need
to fulfill that promise that we've made
by making it fixable by making it
actually do something when you use the
keyboard keyboard event handling in HTML
is not great but luckily polymer team
have provided our own accessibility keys
behavior which you can mix in through
this is going to abstract away all those
gnarly cross-browser differences and
legacy and spec mismatches and whatnot
and give you just a simple syntax for
defining key combinations and their
listeners so again with my wonderful
little star element we've got a import
for the iron accessibility keys behavior
behavior
we're adding it into the behaviour list
and then I'm going to add this key
bindings object which is going to define
which keys I'm listening for and what
happens when those keys get fired so in
this case I've left it up to your
imagination what's going to happen when
you press space or enter alright so
let's take a look at the fixed
experience now so now we're able to tab
through either using tab to go forward
or shift tab to go in reverse get a
really nice clear visual focus just that
grey circle and I can use the enter key
to actually check or uncheck the
checkboxes see that wasn't that hard
right alright so next we did extensive
testing with screen readers and
scrimmages are used by people with
visual impairments to navigate the UI
purely using audio and for the next
moment I'd like to invite you all to
just briefly close your eyes all right
so let's take a look at the paper check
box now using carbon uncheck checkbox
hydrogen check checkbox nitrogen check
checkbox great you can open them if you
choose so that was the smooth experience
of what what a user should be able to
navigate so basically this this user I'm
able to navigate using the keyboard
hearing the audio of what the checkbox
is actually or for what state they're in
and I can then infer that I could use
the enter key or the spaced key to then
change them to either check or uncheck
them this is great alright just to give
you all a sense of some of the free
screen readers that are available out
there and so voiceover is available on
OS X and iOS for free it's built in the
NVDA screen reader is free and open
source available on Windows we've got
the chromevox screen reader on Chrome OS
and we've got talk back on Android there
are plenty of others out there available
for purchase you may have heard of
zoomtext or jaws or others and we did
our testing for the polymer 1 point 0
lunch and beyond across multitude of
screen readers as well as browser and os
combinations because we wanted to make
sure to be as comprehensive as possible
so now let's take a look at an
experience that isn't so great
Group group Group group Group group
super helpful right so if your non
visual what are you getting from this
nothing I'd be really confused and
honestly just angry and I'd walk away so
what went round here so we have no
semantics that are properly declared and
we have no labels we have no clue what's
going on or what we can do with this UI
so taking a look at those are those
items from by 14 stop semantics so again
comparing and contrasting with a native
HTML checkbox we're going to get just
add a checkbox in the page and that
gives us this nice visual rendering
which to anyone who can see it gives you
some semantic use so we know for example
that this is going to be something which
takes a boolean type value its honor it
off it's probably going to be choosing
one in a list of options or it's going
to be answering question like yes please
family for the rest of my life we also
get this Dom object that allows us to
programmatically interact with that with
the element on the page what you
probably may not have seen before is
that it's also going to translate into a
node in the accessibility tree the
accessibility tree is what screen
readers like voiceover which we were
demoing to differ for or many other
screen readers or assistive technologies
actually interact with rather than the
visual UI which is painted painted on
the screen so in this case we have an
accessibility node with a roll of
checkbox and a value of one meaning
checked and some other attributes it's
got a roll description it's a which is
going to be localized it's got invalid
value saying it's not invalid it's not
it's not disabled so that gives us like
a bit of an overview of what semantics
we can actually express we can we can
give an element of role so this is
obviously really critical for any
interactive element we need to know what
type of interactions are going to be
able to do with it it can take a value
so is a numeric value or a text value it
can take a state so checked or not
checked but also things like disabled
has pop up and any other type of
properties so things like first slider
you might have a minimum
some value which is not really a current
value but it's just a property so going
back to our paper check box example
we've got just as we did with the native
check box we've entered the paper check
box on the page and you made sure that
it's checked just too with the native
checkbox we'd not get this nice visual
rendering which gives us some visual
cues as to its meaning and semantics and
just as with the native check box we get
this great Dom object that we can
manipulate programmatically because
polymer provides is really nice API for
us but the accessibility node that is
created by default from this element is
basically non semantic it has no meaning
the browser is just going to say group
so this is this is why in the demo a
moment ago it was just saying group
group that's the browser saying I don't
know what is it which is really not
great for accessibility the way that we
can address this in custom elements is
by using wa I aria which stands for
accessible rich Internet application
which allows us to specify those roles
states values and properties by a plain
HTML attributes so the way this might
look if we didn't build this into the
paper check box is that as an author I
could come along and give this custom
element a role of check box and Aria
check value of true so it's still going
to look exactly the same it's still
going to be have exactly the same API
but now to a screen reader or assistive
technology it's going to look at
identical to that native check box
because it's going to have the same role
and the same value in the same state
which is exactly what we want and again
this is very straightforward to do in a
polymer element so in the paper check
box we just add it into the host
attributes object again and again this
means that as a web page author I can
come along and say ok I know you say
you're a check box but I'm going to
pretend you're a radio button into a
screen reader would say ok yes great
that's already able and we're also going
to communicate going to give it a
default Aria checked value and then keep
that Aria checked value in sync with the
actual live element state great so now
we've declared some semantics let's take
a look at the experience now uncheck
check
check checkbox checked checkbox okay so
it's a little bit better I know if the
check boxes are checked or unchecked I
don't know that they are checkboxes but
what am i checking and maybe I really
want that spam e-newsletter who knows
all right so what do we do from here so
this is why labels are so important we
have a bunch of options in native HTML
for providing labels and wherever
possible we should try and use those
because they'll always provide sort of
extra benefits so we've got the label
element for anything which is label
according to the HTML spec we've got old
attributes for images and most things
can actually use their textual content
as and as a label as well Aria also
gives us some options for labels so our
a label will allow us to specify a
non-visible label for something like an
icon button where the the actual meaning
comes from the icon for a sighted user
then you don't need to provide an actual
text label but you can provide an
aria-label to replicate the experience
of the icon and Aria labeled by allows
you to take a visible piece of UI which
may not be part of your descendant
content and say okay this is acting as
my label so for paper checkbox we're
actually using the Aria label opportune
great so let's take a look at the
positive experience one more time Carbon
uncheck checkbox hydrogen check checkbox
nitrogen check checkbox as you all can
tell this is a vastly more accessible
experience for non-visual user all right
the third bucket of the guidelines that
we're going through today is making your
UI more flexible so three things that we
wanted to cover and are ensuring you
know redundant color sufficient contrast
and magnification so first redundant
color and did you all know that there
are 315 million people out there who are
colorblind that's roughly the same
amount of people who speak English is
their native language this is a really
large amount of people we need to be
considering them in our design so the
main purpose here is that we never want
to use colors a soul way to actually
identify key information so we're going
to take a look at the
and the gold email input element for a
quick a quick review of this so right
now we've got an email entered below and
which is basically an incorrect email
and right now in the early stage of the
demo the only way that this is signified
is by the red color and text and the
underline so if i were a colorblind user
or for me being someone who just has
difficulty detecting color this actually
looks just completely normal to me so i
might be going through and filling out a
form and just continuing to hit this
error hitting submit and getting really
frustrated because it's just not letting
me know so the polymer team then gave
one step up which is basically allowing
you to enhance the thickness of the line
just to say hey like there's something
wrong here but again if you can't say
that that thicker line is also read it
might just look like a styling change or
a formatting change so it's still not
overly clear to the user the best option
is to utilize what the polymer team is
provided in custom error messaging so
this way you can actually show whatever
whatever wording you need to show about
oh there's something wrong here this is
really clear to all users whether or not
they can perceive color or cannot and it
can be used as the label for the screen
reader to then tell a non visual user of
exactly what's going on so we can just
flash up the fully accessible version so
showing color but also the thicker line
and the actual wording so next up we've
got contrast and it's really important
to ensure that you've got sufficient
contrast between the text or an icon and
its background color so the wood KAG
accessibility standards basically say
that the absolute minimum contrast ratio
that we want to consider is 4.5 to one
the only time when this doesn't really
apply is if you're using large text so
size 18 phone or larger and this your
the minimum is actually three two one so
definitely want to consider these
standards across all of your design give
you all a real life example on my flight
over from San Francisco to Amsterdam
this was the screen that I experienced
on the plane so when I was choosing
movies and for me this was really
difficult I couldn't actually read any
of the texts so I wound up just fumbling
with my remote control
and i came across pitch perfect randomly
wound up watching it a few times don't
get me wrong pitch perfect is fine it's
cute but that was really unnecessary and
some of you we experienced out in the
overflow room with bean bags and we
notice that the the big beautiful
windows they're letting in a lot of
light and it's actually making that
screen a little bit harder to tell so
some of you may not even be able to see
the text just you know a real life
example of illustrating the point that
here we've got a contrast ratio of two
point nine to one which is far below the
four point five to one recommendation in
in guideline so in case you are not able
to calculate contrast ratios in your
head by looking at color pairs the
accessibility developer tools extension
which chris mentioned in his talk
earlier as well as allowing you to audit
for contrast ratio of text actually
provides a debugging tool as well so if
you can see it there is a extra sidebar
pain in the elements panel here and I'm
just inspecting some text on just a
regular HTML Google results website and
I found some low contrast text and the
extension is going to tell me its
current contrast ratios 3.95 which is
low and give me some suggestions for
darker shades of grey that I could use
and Chris also mentioned that they use
same audit rules that are in the
accessibility developer tools extension
are built into the polymer testing
library so I've got an example here of
some accessibility testing for the paper
check box no paper radio button element
so they've written some custom
accessibility tests but all of the
accessibility audit results there are
coming straight from the audit and it's
all of those passes mean that this check
was relevant to this element and it
passed so that's really great great and
lastly we want to make sure that
magnification is working smoothly so if
I need to zoom in on the page I want to
make sure that all of the content
actually still renders correctly so here
we can see the paper check box again and
I'm utilizing just the command + on Mac
or if you're on Windows or Chrome OS
ctrl + to zoom all the way in and I can
that you know the formatting still stays
really well intact I'm still able to use
the tab key the focus still remains it's
in the right place it's a really smooth
experience so we definitely encourage
you all to quickly check how how your
elements and how your sites and apps are
rendering when magnified or zoomed in so
that's about where y'all where to from
here if you're using the polymer
elements obviously you have the option
to use the paper elements which is going
to give you the full material design
experience and also the up-to-date
accessibility experience so the
accessibility is sort of sort of like
perpetual work in progress but it's just
going to keep improving its time goes on
the iron elements give you the more
basic behaviors so you can use the
reusable mixing behaviors so things like
the checkable behavior or even though
sorry the accessibility keys behavior
but also bare bones elements that you
can build on top of like there's sort of
a bare-bones list element that you could
use and if you're wanting to start
completely from scratch the polymer
library obviously gives you some
accessibility support as well with the
keyboard mix in the host attributes
object and the automated testing
building to the polymer testing great
and here are a few additional resources
that we recommend that you all check out
so first the gold standard accessibility
checklist that we mentioned available on
github the material design usability
guidelines really helpful and also some
of the automated testing tool so for
instance the accessibility developer
tools audit that Alice mentioned which
is available as a Chrome extension so if
you just do a quick search for any of
these terms and you'll be able to get
more information and learn more so to
wrap up the World Health Organization
made a statement that really resonated
with us so they said that disability is
really the interaction between
individuals with health conditions and
then their personal and environmental
factors so this is what real barriers
are set in place so if somebody's in a
wheelchair in this building and really
needs to get to the second floor but the
elevators are broken or thinking back to
my early days in my math classes where I
was sitting in class and just couldn't
get the actual context because there was
no other way of receiving that
information
aside from visually reading the
blackboard so the incredible thing about
technology and all of the advancements
that have been made over the last year's
is that these barriers simply don't need
to exist I think about how now I can
customize my entire experience really to
my needs and assuming that the site or
the app is actually built in an
accessible way Maya visual impairment
doesn't have to hinder my experience at
all and I can do whatever I need to do
albeit slightly differently so we hope
that you've all found this talk
informative and that you now include
accessibility in your design and
development and help to make it more
accessible world thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
