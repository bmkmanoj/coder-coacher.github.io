team Chris you're the author of poly mon
and a thing called neat scope I know
you're gonna be talking about these a
little bit in your session today or a
lot in your session today he's only a
meet scope what what exactly is that so
meet scope came about when I looked out
on the internet and saw a deficiency of
selfie gift apps so I thought I'll build
one of those okay and like uh what what
went into the making of meat scope what
makes that a unique special experience
you know there are a lot of really great
ap is for accessing input devices on you
know phones and on tablets and on
desktops and I thought we should really
take advantage of those and build a cool
app you can install to your home screen
to record selfie gifts right on right on
okay now for the folks watching how do
they get meet scope on their phone so
you can go to meet scope camera today
and install it to your home screen
awesome alright so I expect all of you

awesome selfie gifts tweet them at us at
