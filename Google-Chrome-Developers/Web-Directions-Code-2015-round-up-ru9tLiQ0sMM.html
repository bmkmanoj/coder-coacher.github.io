code where we're going to hear from a
bunch of hardcore front-end engineers
about best practices and techniques in
building web applications today I'm Alex
download I'm here with John alsip who
runs the web direction series of
conferences quite a while ago you wrote
a document called the dowel web design
how relevant is it to the web today well
I look I guess it's more relevant than I
thought it would have been in the you
two thousand it spoke a lot about the
kind of things that became responsive
web design as we now know it I reread it
the other day for the first time in a
very long time and typically I was quite
surprised actually by how how really did
foresee some of the things we're seen
even to this day this conference were
brought in Alex rustled who keynoted and
he also wrote an amazing document called
the extensible web manifesto how do you
relate to that document yourself really
where we saw the web driven for a long
time in terms of the development was in
two different ways so the underlying
platform was being developed very much
within the w3c always within
hermetically sealed units of working
groups and the lie and but a lot of the
innovation of the web was happening
outside doubt whether it was the likes
of jQuery whether it was you know the
innovations around the use of CSS
techniques and so what I think that
really did that particular manifesto was
bring together those two groups both
working for the development of the web
and to basically say well we should be
drawing from both those groups to drive
the web forward and I think some of the
great examples such as the responsive
image community group really developing
responsive images of any great example
of this kind of combination of the users
of the web bears in the web developer
community combined with the browser
developer community and the experts in
the standards working together to move
the web forward I've spent probably a
decade in w3c working groups working a
lot with SVG etc anatomy well it's
painful that one thing I do strike is
that I'm always asked about web
applications versus native applications
what's your take on the web versus
native application thing what should a
developer do I think that you are
purchasing various ways right one is
appealing from an economic perspective
on one level we have to feed our
families we have to eat and looking at
that
what is the better bet in terms of you
utilizing your skills to generate
revenue and I think Alex spoke very well
of this this morning in his presentation
to talk about how you know it's a really
hit driven business the app business
where you have a small number of very
successful financially apps and the cost
of acquiring users and so on being very
high when it comes to the native app
platforms whereas on the web using an
enormous amount of monetization around
things like e-commerce and ultimately I
guess who the opportunities to work for
clients if you're if you're in that
client services business as well or you
know I guess a lot of a so to choose the
where will as a platform to work on
because we believe in its values and we
believe that it's important platform in
and of itself and the fact that we can
also you know create good businesses
around it is is just multiplies them one
of the things I love about this
conference series as well I have to say
is that it brings together professional
web developers it's not academia its
people actually building commercial
sites building the big sites and so the
the group of speakers and delegates is
quite amazing how do you keep up the
energy to do this every year yeah look
it excites me to interest me I kind of
use this analogy I got this trs-80 back
when I was about 15 I guess and when I
see a picture of that Tara's ad which
was a really early kind of not even
personal computer when I see pictures
and I feel that in Simon enthusiasm has
a 15 year older now like more than 30
years later I guess I still have that
excitement and enthusiasm for the
platform I think partly because of the
values you know that the webbing bodies
and and and the positive things it does
for the world kind of really helps but
he's hard work and I guess sometimes I
think well it's it's our job as in web
directions in what we try to do is to
keep up with a lot of these trends to
help a lot of people out there also
building sites and building apps and
doing what they do help them keep up
because I don't know how people do that
to be quite honest while we're doing the
holding our full-time development jobs
and trying to keep on top of all the
technologies and all the changes and all
the innovations around the web exciting
times here alright thanks speaking with
me today John and um have to see if I
can run down Alex and get some more
insights
Alex Russell you authored a document
called the extensible web manifesto
could you summarize that in like 10
seconds browser vendors should attempt
to give you more power not less also
between the dowel web design and the
extensible web manifesto do you think
they're on the same path do you think
the web has changed in that period of
time I think we're demanding more of the
web and as a result the extensible web
manifesto kind of builds on that
capability by asking browser vendors to
return the power to kind of create the
new things that we need to extend that
path that we're already on to us browser
vendors have a poor track record of
inventing new stuff and the community is
really vibrant and the more we enable
the community to sort of figure out what
that new future is and then let us sort
of pave those cow paths after they've
already been laid I think the better we
go I think the better we do yeah like
I've spent a lot of time in w3c working
groups and one of the things I find
really difficult is answering the HTML
versus native app question I'm
constantly asked that like what's your
point of view users visit a lot of
websites even though websites are very
difficult to use on mobile devices
frequently and as a result it means that
getting to web sites has got to be much
easier than getting to apps and there's
an opportunity there for us to try to
make websites into apps not by
repackaging them not by turning them
into things that are listed in a store
but there's sort of upgrading them where
they lie and I think that's a better way
forward because it improves our ability
to turn the web apps that we've already
got into better things as opposed to
sort of contemplating some new
architecture one of the things that I
think is a really hugely positive thing
that's coming recently is serviceworker
so couldn't to the developers out there
could you summarize serviceworker sure
so service workers are kind of an
extensible answer to what would it be
like if you had the power to implement
app cache yourself right if we just gave
you the pieces the parts and let you let
you figure out how to handle the network
layer on your own without our
intervention what would that look like
and that's what service worker is it's
an answer that question it's an attempt
to give you
the power that browsers have had and
kept to themselves about mediating for
the network and they let you answer the
question of how does my application work
offline not because they are designed to
do offline per se but because they just
give you the tools that we already had
in the browser for making things work
when you're offline and another thing
I've also seen that a lot of people out
are really not aware of is things like
the actor home screen because now like
the mobile browsers lead you at add an
icon to the home screen let you do push
notifications for me that blurs the line
between native apps and web apps and I'd
like to like just get your insight into
like where you think this is going to go
further on in the future like what will
happen from here on we've sort of been
calling these progressive apps there are
things that begin life in a tab and they
sort of escape the tab and they turn
into real first-class applications
inside the OS that you happen to be
using and I think progressive apps are a
good response to the question of what
should the web become the web should
become first-class everywhere that you
want it to be and today that's been a
difficult challenge to try to overcome
because we've sort of always had to live
life in the tab and so these features
are specifically designed to give good
things that we know can be app like the
treatment that you would expect of
something that is a nap but only after
you've engaged with it for a while or
only after you've decided that it is
really app like and that you want to
keep it the conference sofa what do you
think this is an amazing conference I am
astonished by the kind of lineup and the
topics that John has gotten folks to
speak on here everything I've seen today
has been both straight up my alley and I
think indicates a deep understanding of
what it's going to take to build the
next generation of web apps great
talking to you Alex and as Alex token
Alex so with the two Alex's we're done
an array of inexpensive Alex's
i'm here with Jonathan Cronin from
atlassian of course atlassian zat I
Great Australian company that's built
some amazing web applications and
currently some of their production
systems are actually using web
components so can I just ask you what
made you choose web components web
components are fantastic because what
web components or specifically custom
elements give us is a separation between
interface and implementation in HTML in
the Dom so we can write a web component
which just has like the semantic intent
of a component like a header or a
drop-down or a dialog give that to
people it's very minimal it's very easy
to write and then will you know explode
the web component and render it that's
one of the things I found with web
components versus something like so
angular because in angular you model for
your application is in JavaScript and
then the the Browse is basically a slave
whereas with web components and custom
elements you can keep the model in HTML
and the normal DOM and that to me is a
very big difference have you found like
say for example angular the one thing
I've heard is debugging is really hard
like what if what's your experience I
think the first thing to get your head
around is the fact that the structure is
in the Dom you know when we first
started doing this and talking about the
api's people were kind of like all what
JavaScript methods I'm going to use to
change the content here in always like
you know no no it's it's the Dom you're
using markup here like you might have a
method which is unlike your custom
element right but that method would be
more something like ah what's a good
example like like show if you had a
dialogue show is probably a good method
right but you're not going to change the
content of the dialogue via a method
that's why the Dom it means that you can
use a templating framework and you'll
write your custom elements as part of
your template and then once that makes
it into the door more into the document
fragment or into the into the actual
document then at that point the the web
component framework will take over and
explode that custom element into you
know the stuff the user actually sees
got it and so a lot of stuff with like
the whole web components thing I mean
there's shadow DOM and right I
understand you're not using shadow Dom
at the moment I know that you know
chrome implement shadow Dom but there's
not great cross browser support the
polyfills today have been very heavy
weight what do you see is the future of
shadow Dom
as far as your applications or people
out there that are building web apps so
in terms of what we're using we're using
not much right so the web component spec
is you know custom elements HTML imports
HTML templates and shadow Dom we're just
using custom elements right so HTML
imports don't even know if they'll make
it in there hard to polyfill HTML
templates hard to polyfill there will be
a shadow Dom but we don't know how it'll
be expressed we don't know if there'll
be template elements that kind of stall
content elements sorry we want to start
using it now ah what's the shortest path
to doing that and so looking forward to
the future yes at some point we'd use
the shadow Dom I guess there's a couple
of tough questions there so the first is
would we use the shadow Dom before it's
available anywhere like if you're using
you know like shadow Dom in chrome but
not using shadow Dom in IE then that
kind of increases the scope of stuff
that could go wrong between the
different browsers and the scope of
cross browser coverage so you know
that's a question we look to in the
future when we can actually start using
it in chrome or something like that cool
anyway it's really great to see like
these emerging standards being used in
real production systems so like here's a
perfect example of success with web
components in general and production
things so like web developers out there
please use it and of course use all
lessons great stuff as well thanks for
talking to us today oh man appreciate it
thank you
I ended up going from cartoons from
making comics for teenage girls where I
was very successful she getting in front
end development around the time of the
the recession and while I was in front
end development I just threw myself
headfirst into learning JavaScript and
fell in love with CSS and many years
later I saw that you could do animations
with CSS and I started doing really cool
things combining some of my skills from
cartooning with CSS and I realized that
people just responded so much better to
learning how to make a cat run across
the screen than moving a box across the
screen so i ended up leaving my job as a
front-end developer to travel and teach
people more about animation now in your
talk you spoke a bit about the cortex in
the brain being like a GPU and the rest
of the brain being like the main thread
like what gave you that visual I
actually was just reading a research
paper about how the human brain the
mental models work when on task and how
dysfunctional it can be when trying to
interpret this completely foreign
interface if you look at how old
operating systems used to work how
things would just move from one place to
another from screen to screen with no
indication of where they were going it
looks very foreign compared to how
things move in the natural world so when
I saw that and they're talking about how
that kind of disjointed movement
affected kept bouncing things off of the
visual cortex onto the quote unquote
main thread of ha oh it's like a GPU oh
I get it and I just decided I had to
doodle it very cool so as you know I've
been involved in w3c standards for a
long time and being an editor on the web
animations spec so you've recently
become an invited expert working
directly with people like me so like how
do you find going from the more creative
side to these crazy standard Easter's
I'm still getting used to it if you've
ever seen a large dog being hugged by a
small child that's my face it's like
what is this it's very different
participating in all these email chains
an awful lot of responsibility but I'm
happy to do it cool also I just wanted
to mention to anyone watching that you
of course have started a web animations
newsletter which is something that gets
from people like us out to real
developers in the front end so like
would you just tell us what that's about
and how you get on to it absolutely you
can visit web animation weekly calm and
sign up and every week I send you all
the news that's fit for reading
regarding web animations from case
studies on big sites all the way down to
little tutorials and more specifically
important browser upgrades and spec
options awesome so pleasure talking to
you today let's make an animated world
i'm here with dominic de Nicola and he's
on the tc39 committee so could you give
me a rough overview of what that is
cease 39 is the the group responsible
for evolving JavaScript adding new
features tightening up the spec we
produce this back basically awesome and
I understand that you are heavily
involved in development of promises and
like promises are now everywhere in the
browser like give me a quick summary of
what a promise is so a promise is a
representation of a value that you might
not actually have yet so the value will
maybe come later or maybe it'll fail to
come and you'll get an exception a
rejected promise so it's it's a
primitive for programming asynchronously
okay so and today you were talking about
something that I thought was really
interesting which it cancellable
promises so like they're called tasks is
it that right yeah so tasks is kind of
the marketing name and we're still
figuring this out but basically the idea
is to evolve promises so that not only
do they represent the value they can
also represent like the the operation
that produces the value so then you
could take the operation and cancel it
if you if you needed to and if you have
multiple people who are looking at the
operation all of them kind of have to
opt-in to cancellation it should all
work out anybody out there that's a web
developer definitely use promises
because if you're using service walk
worker you have to and service worker is
awesome the other thing that you talked
about today which i think is really
exciting other streams like the iostream
so give me a quick rundown of those
streams are basically solving this
problem that we've had in the browser
for a long time where you can actually
read a large you know HTTP request or
response without using up all your
memory you know all the memory that it
takes to put that entire thing into a
string so with streams which are which
are shipping in in chrome 43 and and
mozilla is going to ship them soon what
you can do is you can just read chunks
at a time into memory and process those
as you need and then throw them away and
you'll only consume like a maximum of
however many you know 10 megabytes of
memory or whatever even if you're
consuming a gigabyte file at a time
awesome so if you use if you're doing
anything with streaming data like from
so video streams or audio streams or
anything like that look at the streams
API it's definitely cool and the thing I
thought was the best like and if you
agree but it's a synchronous effectively
it runs on a separate thread to the main
thread so you don't get jakes if you use
dreamed you can deal with tons of data
coming to your browser without worrying
about hearing the main thread and making
your whole site janky so anyway thanks
for talking me with you today dominic
and um look forward to all the new API
soda coming thank you it's great coming
home and being part of the next
generation of the web we've got
progressive apps everything is going
mobile I can't wait to see where the web
goes next
