our traditional setup of client and
server which exchange requests and
responses a firebase lives on the server
it's a server-side service managed
service for you where you have to write
no or very little server-side code to
get features like a database of
indication and so on let's have a closer
look so which services is firebase all
about its these core services here we
get real-time databases so manage
databases which you can conveniently
access why are the REST API or an SDK
which store and synchronize data and
where you don't need to write any
server-side code we also get
authentication as a service where we can
conveniently create users and add a user
log in we can use various providers like
Google Facebook or store passwords and
emails on our own we can access this
through the REST API or the SDK and here
we also don't need any server-side code
and if we use the SDK the front-end part
is also managed for us so storing this
token and so on now we also get storage
as a service so file storage where we
can manage file up and downloads use the
SDK to manage that no REST API and also
don't need to write server-side code we
also have analytics services where we
can keep track of the behavior of our
users and for example how often their
apps crash because there's important
firebase is a back-end service which you
can of course use with both web apps and
also mobile apps and there especially
such crash analytics might be very
interesting and finally we got cloud
functions as a big block now in all the
other services the big plus was that you
don't need to write server-side code but
sometimes you got that special logic you
wanna have you wanna write and you wanna
run on a server and you can then write
cloud functions which is just no J's
code that is executed on demand where
you only pay on the Mond it only runs
when it's needed and you can define when
it runs and what it runs therefore
the big advantage of firebase courses
that security and all these resources
are managed for you you don't have to
worry about that it's really scalable
therefore and you only pay for what you
need
that is firebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
