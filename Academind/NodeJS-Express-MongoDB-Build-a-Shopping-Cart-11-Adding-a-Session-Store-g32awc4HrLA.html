currently are or where we left our
project um with our product page
our working user management where we
were able to sign up and sign in and log
out and so on and that's all great then
I'll come back to all the user related
stuff later but I think now is the time
to actually get started with well the
shopping cart that is what the series is
about and yet right so let's make this
button work and let's add ad
functionality to well add items to the
cart as well as see the card so how do
we do this well there are different
approaches but I'm going to go with the
approach of storing the cart in the user
session which means that it persists if
we navigate across pages or even if
we'll leave the page and come back later
as long as the session is still well it
and the advantage of this is says it
that it will also work for anonymous
users so for users who didn't log in and
then of course as an important feature
because you don't only want to have your
shopping cart for logged in users but
also for locked out or well not signed
up users so ash based will be the
approach I'll follow and yet with that
I'd say let's get started I will get
started in my project here and the very
first thing I want to do is I want to
configure my session appropriately if I
go to the app the chess file you'll
probably remember that we already use
Express session we set it up here and we
also use it to flash messages until now
and that's all great but I need to do
some additional things I want to add a
session store due to it specifically
because the session has to be stored
somewhere on the server right and
currently it's stored in memory
now that really isn't something you want
to do in production as it has memory
leaks and it's not really optimized in
any way so we need a different store as
we won't store it memory
now which stores can we use let's have a
look I'll head over to the Express
Express session page the scat hub page
here and you're right at the beginning
you'll see a warning that we shouldn't
use the memory store which is to default
which is only good for testing or
development purposes but that we should
use the well one of the compatible
session stores so if I click this link
we see well a list of session stores you
may you may use only may install for our
session to work with as you can see we
basically got a lot of different
databases our answer on we could use now
since we already use MongoDB I think it
would make sense to use Mongo and while
we could either use connect Mongo or
connect MongoDB session well I'm going
to go with connect Mongo just because
well I know it and if I click on this we
are taking to the respective NPM page of
this package and of course we will also
find installation instructions here but
we also find instructions on how to
configure it and one important thing is
of course if you already do have an
established MongoDB connection our
application from Mongoose the great
thing with Mongo store is that we can
reuse this connection so we don't have
to open another connection therefore
have to open connections which doesn't
make any sense but we can use longus
connection to well for this store to
store our session in Mongo database now
since we're storing the session in the
Mongo database another question is how
does it get cleaned up for the expired
sessions right because we don't want to
crowd our database with old sessions
which are no longer valid
well the package answers this question
too if we scroll down we see this
session expiration part and we are what
we can read that expired sessions are
automatically removed with the TTL
collection feature of MongoDB which is a
bolt in fact feature
where we can basically specify when
certain records should be removed
automatically and this is all managed by
this Mongo's store which is of course
great and well makes it very good to use
here so that has been a lot of talking
let's install it so back in my project
I'll just open up a new terminal window
here and let me make this a little bit
bigger so that you can see it and then
I'm going to run NPM stall - - safe to
install it as a production dependency
and then connect Mongo is the name of
our store here as you can see on the
well on the page of this package so I'm
going to run this and with that
installed
I'll make this smaller again I will of
course use it here in my app chests when
I setup my session I want to use this
new store and I want to tell my session
that it shouldn't use the default memory
store anymore of course so in order to
do this I'll first add an import here
let's say right below the validator
whatever you want at the top important
part is that you do it after importing
your session here your session package
and I'll name it mongos store and I will
of course require connect Mongo the
package is just installed and this
basically exports a function - which I
need to pass my session like this so
with this I'm importing Mongo store but
of course I also need to configure my
session I'm doing this down here where I
will set up my session whiffed is
JavaScript object and I'll just
restructure this so that we can see this
a bit clearer since will add some
options here so this is how we currently
initialize our session and that's fine
but I need to add something most
importantly of course I need to add a
store with the store key here and here I
add a new Mongo store the package I just
installed and this store here also takes
configuration or options specifically
one important one is that I specify the
Mongoose connection key to tell it to
not open a new connection on its own
which you could do of course check out
the NPM page for more information but
instead that I want to use my existing
Mongoose connection which I can access
on my Mongoose object with the
connection property here instead I'm
making sure that no new connection is
open and then I'll add another option to
decision not to distort the session the
cookie I want to configure it
specifically I want to configure how
long it should live so how long my
sessions should live before they expire
I do this by setting the max age key
here and I will set it to let's say 180
minutes so I have to multiply this with
60 seconds and then with 1000
milliseconds since max H expects a value
in milliseconds so if that I'm setting
it to 180 minutes so 3 hours and of
course change this to your needs for
testing you might also maybe reduce it
to 10 seconds to see if it expires and
so on but yeah I'll go with with this
default value here and with that the
discussion has been configured
you are now storing it at MongoDB on the
server on the client of course still in
the cookie and will expire after three
hours I also want to do something else I
want to make my session available in my
views so that through handlebars I can
directly access my session and I already
have a middleware here where I make my
authentication status available and I'll
do the same for the session so we'll
address locals and then name it session
and I will pass the session object and
again this just make sure that I may
access session in all my templates
without having it to pass around without
having to pass it explicitly in my
routes file or in
routes functions so I can always access
the session variable now in all my views
it's okay that has been the basic
session setup but with that of course
the all the basics are done but we're
not able to do anything else than before
so that'll be what I will next have a
look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
