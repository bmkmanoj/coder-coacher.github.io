to re-render our you eyes and now that
we saw that this is the case by clicking
on this button now the question is how
does react.js
actually rerender the UI because it's
really important that we do this right
otherwise it will cost us a lot of
performance now what would be the worst
case the worst case would be that the
whole dong gets rear-ended upon every
state change in any component so I click
this button and boom everything gets
rear-ended that would be very bad
performance wise and fortunately that's
not the case react is actually uses a
concept called virtual Dom which means
it has a virtual representation of the
actual Dom now the actual Dom is
something we can see in the developer
tools here right so that here that is
the actual Dom created or rendered by
the browser
now the actual Dom unfortunately is
really slow and accessing or rendering
re-rendering the Dom is really slow so
that is why react.js created this
virtual Dom which is a Dom written in
JavaScript so it basically took the
whole Dom and wrote a representation of
it in JavaScript the reason for that is
that javascript is really fast whereas
the URI actual Dom is really slow so we
have this virtual Dom which you can
think of looks like the thing on the
right here just in JavaScript code and
again that makes sense since we in our
render function also write JavaScript
code just in a nicer representation so
we get the virtual Dom and now I click
this button what happens react is
actually kind of recreates the virtual
down a second time and it recreates in a
way that would look like after this
state change so it recreates it and sees
ok in the new Dom in the new virtual Dom
still the actual Dom hasn't been touched
the age is now 75 a then compares this
compares this new
hold on to the old words hold on and
creates a difference has a look if there
is some difference
maybe both dorms are equal because maybe
we changed the state but it doesn't have
any impact on the currently rendered
components in this case it would see no
changes okay I'm done finish actual done
never gets touched but maybe it sees
okay New Age is 75 old age was 72 I need
to change it now it still doesn't rear
end early hold on because of that change
instead it will only rerender this part
here only the part which gets affected
and of course is really fast because for
one it uses the virtual dolls for the
comparison instead of the actual Dom
which would have been slow to begin with
and then when it has to rerender
something it only renders the part which
changed and not everything and we can
actually see this if I go to my
rendering tab here in the developer
tools or here in your options and then
more tools and then rendering settings
you can enable paint flashing this means
the browser will now show you whenever
something the Dom updates and you see
this if I reload for example everything
flashed green because the hold on got
updated and they hover over home it
updates because while these style
changes and now watch what happens when
I click make me older do you see that it
only updates the row where the ages in
and of course this button due to some
styling stuff but it doesn't update
anything else because the rest of this
application is not changing there is no
need to update anything else I can also
show this by going back to my home
component remember I have the status in
my state too and then here in the
constructor for example I'll add a
timeout and I'll set this to let's say 3
seconds and after this time expired I
want to basically just call
this set state and this time change the
status to one like that so if I save
this you see that after three seconds
this got highlighted and change I'm
going to reload this and then click make
me older age changed age changed state
has changed each changed you see it
updates only what it needs to update
that is why react.js is really fast and
how it manages the updating and re
rendering off your page and that is of
course important to understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
