asked if I could make up with you about
my IDE phpstorm
and I think yeah why not hear us might
try to show you how I use it how you can
configure it and how you can generally
use it because one of the great
advantages of phpstorm besides offering
awesome auto-completion encoding support
is that as highly that it is highly
customizable and extendable and I hope
to show you this within the next videos
in this video we'll start with general
appearance and how you can manipulate it
change it and that's just it to your
needs so here I'm inside a random
lateral project and this is probably not
howdy editor looks like when you just
installed it but it isn't too far from
it and I will show you how I got there
and how you can generally well quickly
change the overall look and feel of your
editor or IDE so here you can see I got
this file browser on the left and I got
the code editor on the right this is a
bit more minimal than the layout ID the
IDE ships with when you installed it
this is because here under view I
disabled all these bars like the toolbar
here at the top with all these icons or
the status bar on the bottom the reason
is I don't use these bars anyway because
you're quicker with the keyboard and I
never clicked these items therefore I
rather have the space here now you might
have seen them in one of my or in my
earlier videos and this is because most
of the time I kind of switched it back
for the videos as I wanted to have well
not a too minimalistic style here but
now since I have that video I think I
will keep it a bit more minimalistic but
this is generally what I work with I
like this file browser on the left
though there are other ways to navigate
files too as I will show you in the next
video but this video is about the
appearance and now you generally saw how
you can
he hide or show certain bars or parts of
the UI what if you also want to hide
this file browser can you do this yes
you can you can click this button here
but now you can't bring it back here at
least however you can also toggle this
behavior by hitting command 1 on Mac at
least control 1 on Windows probably to
well hide or show this file browser and
this is a good way to quickly make your
editor bigger or smaller depending on
your needs however how is what's about
the general look of this IDE the dark
theme here for example the colors of the
code the font size can you change this
too of course you can and you can do
this in the preferences which you can
also open with command-comma by the way
and here you got your appearance and
behavior
well settings item as well as the editor
item the difference is in the editor
settings you can configure all kind of
things about your editor and this
includes the appearance off the editor
however appearance also means colorist
off certain keywords in specific
languages the appearance and behavior is
setting up here targets the IDE as a
whole and here for example under
appearance you can choose from the
default or dark color theme
whichever you prefer as you see you got
a lot more options here you can set and
this is what I meant you can really
customize any bit of phpstorm
and this is really great about it to be
honest many items you'll probably never
touch but some of them allow you to
really hand tailor the IDE to your needs
and the great thing is if you were not
sure where the item you want to change
is you can always go to the search bar
here at the top and like all three views
in the IDE in phpstorm
you can search for
let's say code completion and then it
will filter down to only the items that
contain something and it will also
highlighted about code completion and
that is of course a great feature which
allows you to quickly find and change
the settings you want to change so that
is one thing now let's go back to the
appearance here as you saw we could
switch between the themes here we can
also override the default fonts here if
you want but we can also do this in the
editor if we only want to override the
font of our actual code and not the
overall IDE as you can see you get a lot
more here you can change you can change
how the ideal phpstorm and the same is
of course true for webstorm behaves when
starting up or when closing you can
change to notifications you get and so
on so really a lot of things now let's
go to the editor the editor of course is
this part here on the right and here you
can not only change the appearance but
also how it can or you can generally
works how completion works how a line
breaks work if you see line numbers and
so on it really is a lot and I will not
go through all these individual settings
items because this video would take
about five hours and who wants to see
and remembers a list of setting items
gone through step-by-step probably no
one so what I will do is in all the next
videos in this series I will always
explain okay if you want to change this
or now I change this and I did this here
so I will show you where in the
preferences you can set up certain
things back to the editor if you want to
change the styling you can for example
do this here under colors and fonts and
here you got a lot more stylists and
just dark Hill on default this is the
case because these
cells don't affect the overall IDE but
only the code editor and well the dis
are a couple of more however if you will
let's say want to change the font of
dark EULA you're not allowed to you
can't change this this is the case
because PHP strong kind of protects you
from overriding the default setting and
then having no way back so if you want
to change the look and I did for example
for the videos where I increase the font
size you save this as a new version like
here I have dark Euler copy and in this
copy you are allowed to change things
because if you mess something up here
well you can always just go back to the
original dark EULA
now here you may change font size line
spacing and much more very useful are
for example the colors and you can
change the colors of keywords comments
and so on third language if you want
that so for example here for PHP if I
want you to change the color off this
function keyword I can either look it up
here or it just click on function as
preview here and I've already taken to
it so this is a keyword and if I want to
overwrite the look of this keyboard I
could remove this check mark here and
then I'm free to choose whichever style
or color I want as you can see the
preview here at the bottom automatically
updates with that so this is pretty
handy so that's how you generally can
manipulate the appearance of your editor
of the IDE change which bars or parts of
GI to e you see and as I said I would
come back to certain parts in future
videos but this is generally how I want
to start this off and how I want to
point you at the right preference items
to start playing around and change the
editor is such that it looks the way you
want it to look in the next video we'll
have a look at how we can navigate
around in phpstorm
and webstorm and all these are the
easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
