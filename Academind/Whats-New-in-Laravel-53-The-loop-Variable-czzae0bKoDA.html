you know where you are
that is why with lateral 5.3 we get this
new loop variable available in our loops
and with this variable we can always
know where in this loop we are so let's
have a look at it together
and sneak peak at least at some of the
ideas I have for some of that are more
than ideas for the near future of this
course but that's not what I actually
wanted to talk about I want to talk
about the new loop variable introduced
in level 5.3 that's the variable I'm
talking about
and well what is it about s tonight
implies you can use it inside loops here
I do have a loop actually I do have two
loops the outer loop and the inner loop
here and I'm just feeding some data to
this do you hear the data I feed is
basically well an array which is kind of
hard to read because I structured it
really greatly here but that's just an
array with some items and an array
inside of the array so like this that's
an extra rate inside of the array so I
have a nested array and in my view I
simply have outer loop and then I check
if the item is an array so this nested
array in which case I create another
loop otherwise I output the item right
away so far so simple now what's this
loop variable doing well this variable
gives us access to some nice utility
there variables or features we can use
inside of the loop for example here I'm
finding out which the current iteration
is so what's the number of the current
iteration the iteration starts at 1 so
not at 0 it's not the index
it's the iteration and I check if the
iteration is 2 then I want to gift this
item a class of highlighted because 2
happens to be the loop item here in the
array which I want to highlight because
that's this lecture
now besides iteration which can be
useful to find out where you're at in
this loop we also get index which is
almost the same but starts at 0 so here
I would have to change this to 1 to
achieve the same effect as you can see
well there are a couple of other useful
properties on this loop object for
example we get remaining now I'll simply
output this in the end of the death here
and separate it with simply a dash and
here our output loop remaining
I'll simply copy this to my operative
here too to see it in all cases now what
would you guess to do or what would you
guess that this does let's have a look
it prints as the remaining iterations so
here we have three remaining iterations
at the beginning of the list then two
then any nested loop we have six
remaining five four three two one zero
we're done and zero we're done with the
outer loop so you already see the loop
object always refers to the for each
loop it's in so to the inner or the
outer for each loop we got two distinct
loop objects here which is of course
great because this allows us to be much
more flexible regarding information
we're retrieving besides remaining and
I'll just edit them both at a time I
also get count now what could count be
let's have a look counter simply the
number of items or of iterations in the
loop so we got four items here in the
array well let's have a look if this is
true we get this one to ten-year a free
and then four and in the array we got
seven which is why we here see seven so
count is not changing it always refers
to the total amount of items in the
array but that can be useful if you want
to have some if-else check in your loop
checking if you're near the end for
example if you're over half the items in
the array or something like that that is
where a count could be really helpful
let's have a look at the next possible
or the next property we can retrieve
that would be first now what does first
do let's let's see it in action okay
it prints one and one so do you see what
it does it actually returns us true or
false if we are at the first iteration
so we are at the first iteration of the
outer loop here and on the first
iteration of the inner loop here
therefore we don't see any output in all
the other cases now when could first be
useful well basically first
and last which you'll also see that we
have are very useful properties as you
oftentimes want to do something special
right before starting or at the first
iteration or right after finishing or
you want to find out is this the last
iteration
really there is a useful feature and
with first and well I already mentioned
it of course we also get lost we get
very useful utility features here so
last will of course mark the last
iterations and again keep in mind we do
have two distinct loop objects for the
inner and the outer loop now what if I
wanted to access the outer loop from my
inner loop so I want to have access to
the outer loop object in my inner loop
well I can use the loop Here I am loop
parent property which gives me access to
the outer loop object so on this parent
I could then also access count for
example so all the properties you just
saw so if I do this well now we get four
four four four even though the count of
the inner loop would be seven as you saw
before but now we're referring to the
outer loop so we have this possibility
of referring to the outer loop variable
and we're not sticking or we don't have
to stick to the one of our inner loop
here the final property we have related
to this is the death property so I'll
add the death property to woops without
parent though to both the inner and the
outer loop or object and let's see what
this does if i refresh we see one one
and then two in the inner loop this
basically gives us the death of the
where this loop object is in for the
outer loop it's the well out of most or
or the most highest loop object we could
have it's in the outer loop so we have
one but then it's nested one level in
the inner loop which is why we have two
here if you would have an average loop
what we would have free and so on so
that can be useful to dynamically
determine where you are at in your code
or in which level of looping
you are at so that's the loop object
with all the properties just discussed
definitely play around with it
in the video description you not only
find that code but also a link to the
official description which lists all
these properties see you in the other
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
