able to add items to the collection to
remove them but now it would be nice to
have this on two separate pages instead
of one so we need routing we need the
angler to router nothing easier than
that let's start working on that the
anglican framework ships with its own
router so setting up routing is really
easy we don't need to pull in an extra
package or anything like this we already
have components and these components
will serve as pages using the router so
the missing piece is to add the router
and to add a header so that we got a way
to actually navigate and click some
links let's start by creating the header
so I will simply generate a new
component ng GZ and I want you to join
rated in the app folder I don't want to
create a new sub folder for this I could
add a 2d shared folder but here I will
simply add it to the root folder just to
show this as well I'll name it header
and now I'll add es or is to may use
inline styles I'll also add spec false
you saw that before and now I'll also
add minus minus flat which means don't
create a subfolder for it place it
directly in the folder so this command
will now give me these two new files the
header here now I don't need to do
anything in the typescript file you
could remove the constructor and the on
init method since we don't need that
here but you could also leave it here
but of course I want to work in the HTML
file in the template here I'll add a row
and then again some columns or a column
the bootstrap grid and then here I'll
add an unordered list with the class nav
and the class nav pills
this is SEM bootstrap code again to
create a nice navigation with some well
this pills look you will see it in
action soon in this list I want to have
2l eyes which hold a link created like
this with the Emmet plug-in and the
first one should say collection the
second one should say market I'm going
to hook up these links soon with this I
got my links set up but of course this
header is not really used right now so
to use it I also need to add it here in
the app module in the declarations array
also add the import and then in my app
component HTML file I want to add my
header here so I will add my app header
at the top like this and then let's say
a horizontal line with this in place if
we let this reload we should see the
header nice like this of course nothing
is highlighted right now and these links
also who don't work I'll work on this
next to make it work to make these links
work I first need a router with some
routes to which I can actually navigate
to create this I'll go to my app folder
and create a new file there I'll name it
name it apt or routing dot TS to
indicate that this file holds my routing
related logic now no worries setting up
routing is really easy you first need to
configure which routes you want to have
and configuring this is simply an array
with some objects where each object
represents a route so I'll create a new
constant here which I'll name a Prout's
for example name is up to you and this
will be of type routes now routes has to
be imported from at angular router so
add this import and then as I mentioned
it is an array of JavaScript object each
object here has a path property and path
now means the part in the URL so what
comes after this last year for example
it user would be a path here or market
would be a path you don't add to slash
though so here the first path I want to
have is the collection path in this case
I want to load my collection component
make sure to also add this import app
here
this will later on tell the router
whenever we visit our domain /
collection load this collection
component I'll duplicate it because I
also want to have over market route /
market in this case I want to load
market component also add this import so
we get collection market there's one
important route missing have a look at
our application where are we right now
you could imagine an empty string after
slash here we also need to cover this
route so I'll duplicate this one more
time and remove it so now path is just
an empty string which means yet this
route route where we are at the
beginning in this case I don't want to
load a separate component I don't have
one
I want to navigate to the collection
let's say so I can set this route up to
redirect myself here I therefore add
redirect to property known by Engla - of
course and then I want to navigate to
slash collection now here I need to
slash because this means it's an
absolute route append slash collection
after the domain if I would just have
collection this would be a relative
route which means appended to the
current path which could be localhost /
user and then collection now I don't
want that here I simply want to go to
the absolute collection route the second
one here I need to add one other
property path match full what this does
is it tells me that you only execute
this route only redirect myself in this
case if the complete path is empty if I
would not have this property here this
route would always be fired even if we
have slash market because you can think
of there is always an empty string
between the slash and D path so to avoid
this behavior we set paths match full
which means only if there is nothing
else then use this route so then we
would get redirected with
that we configured our routes now we
have to register them with the angular 2
router to do so we call router module
and you have to import that from add
angular slash router and then for root
which means register these routes as
route routes in the application known to
the whole application which of course is
important and here I pass as an argument
my routes now that alone won't do the
trick routing still would not work I
have to export a constant let's name it
routing which holds this configured
router module because this configured
router module now stored in the routing
constant has to be added to my app
module here in the imports array this is
where I add any module and router module
is such a module it's a built-in one now
configure with our routes but we have to
add it here by default angular 2 doesn't
add all built-in modules which is great
because if we don't need them this would
simply hit our performance and why do
that if we don't use it so here I'll add
routing and of course you need to add
the import from dot slash app dot
routing so this routing file this now
adds the configured routing module with
this we got routing in place now to see
it in action we have one missing but
important piece we need to tell the
angler to router where to render this
component or these components we tell it
to rendered collection component if we
visit slash collection and the market
component if we wizard slash market but
where should it render them thankfully
it's not by default overwriting our
complete HTML code instead we have to
give it a hook where to render this so
here I'll remove these selectors of my
components and instead set up this hook
the directive we have to use for this is
router outlet a built in directive
telling angular 2 this is the place
where you should render
components or the components who are
routing to with this if I let this
application reload we should already see
this in action it's loading collection
by default since we set up this
redirection and I can also go to market
cool the missing piece of course are the
two links in the header which don't work
right now so let's make them work to
connect our links here we need to
replace this ref attribute with router
link this is a built-in directive
English to ships with these square
brackets you see here indicate property
binding which is another form of data
binding angular 2 offers property
binding basically means you bind to a
property in this case to a property of a
directive directive and property here
have the same name the directive is
named router link and the property is
also named Roger link which is why
English you allows you to use both in
one assignment or one statement but with
these square brackets
we're basically passing some data into
this directive the data I want to pass
is an array this is how you set up
navigation in English you in this array
each element stands for one segment in
your path in the URL so if you have
longer path let's say slash user some ID
side and then slash detail then you
would have three segments user ID detail
now here we're only going to have one
segment the collection like this now you
can use a relative path like I do here
also with dot slash for example or an
absolute one with a leading slash this
one will always navigate to your domain
slash collection whereas this will
always append collection to the end of
the current path so if you're on slash
market and then visit collection without
a leading slash you would be redirected
to slash market slash collection
probably not what you want therefore
I'll add a leading slash to make this
absolute time to also set up the router
link for the market link here here I'll
also pass
arrey and navigate to the slash market
with this setup let's reload this
application and see if this works great
of course it would be nice to see which
navigation item currently is active so
to finish this application let's add
this functionality to add such a style
with normal CSS we could add a class to
the list item a CSS class of active
which is a class provided by bootstrap
and by adding a to the list item once
this reloads bootstrap will highlight
this is active of course this now stays
active even if I navigate away because I
hard-coded it into my header it would be
nice if we could conditionally attach
this CSS class to the list item only if
the nested link is active turns out we
can do that with angular 2 and it isn't
that difficult all we have to do is we
have to add the router link active
directive and here between the quotation
marks we pass active the name of the CSS
class we want to attach the cool thing
is angler to the router link directive
here automatically finds the router link
active directive belonging to it or
property belonging to it and is able to
work with it and use the CSS class we
specify here to attach it to our list
item do you now see my point of Anglet
you making many things very simple once
you master the initial well starting
phase this is one of the examples with
router link active let's also add it to
the other link we can now style these
links conditionally imagine how much
work that would have been with jQuery
and this is how easy it is now with
angular 2 and now you can see it
correctly switches I can items to the
collection add items to the collection
remove them from the collection add them
again and so on so this is our working
angular 2 application we bolt here with
a lot of
core features angle to offers covered I
hope you enjoyed it
I'll not be happy to see you in future
