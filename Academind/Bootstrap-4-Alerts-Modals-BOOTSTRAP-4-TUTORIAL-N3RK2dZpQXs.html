on board in this video I want to dive
into alerts and modal's so we will have
a look at how these work and not just
how we can add them which is really
simple but I'll explain this too but
also what happens behind the scenes and
how bootstrap makes sure that the things
we see here looked away they look like
so let's dive right into that
notice the pager the state with which we
finished in the last video now as I said
and these are at the beginning now it's
time to add some modal's and alerts now
one important information here this
won't become a real complete website
because I want to focus on the core
bootstrap features or some of its most
important features but if you like we
can always do another serious where we
add some back-end some server-side some
database and build an entire project
with that and with bootstrap so dad
might be a good alternative so with that
let's just dive into modal's and alerts
and let's see how that works and let's
start with the alerts now what is an
alert to begin with an alert simply is
an element which you typically only
display conditionally be that because
you're using a front-end framework like
react or angular or view and you render
it upon a certain event like a user
entered some invalid data into a form or
you display it because you use
server-side framework to render your
views something like Express or laravel
and so on and the user may be also
submitted a form or did something else
where you want to show a message to him
and want to inform the user about
something then you would render that
alert into your server-side rendered
code and send back an HTML file with
that alert in it so hard coding an alert
into a single HTML file as we're doing
it right now is rarely what you do but
in the NT code you will use is the same
so let's just add an alert in my HTML
file below the navigation I will add an
alert and an alert is simply an element
a div a block element with a certain
class so let's say add a div here and on
that div I'll add a CSS class and that
CSS class is alert now we can enter some
text between the opening and closing
tags like I'm an alert and we showed for
accessibility reasons also add the roll
alert here to inform screenreader sense
on what this element is about with that
if we save that and
we reload our page we just see that text
now I don't know about you but it's not
dead impressive though what we can see
if we open the developer tools and we
inspect this alert we can see let me
expand this the alert class here is
already doing some work it's adding some
padding some margin and a border which
is transparent now what's the sense or
the idea behind the transparent border
the idea is that we can now add an
additional class to that alerts div
which will simply set a special
background and border color to give us
an alert that looks a bit fancier now
why is the setup chosen like that
because there's more than one way of
displaying an alert sometimes you want
to display a info message which
shouldn't look too aggressive so you
don't want to use red or yellow as a
colour there sometimes you want to
display a warning but not an error so
maybe you want to use yellow instead of
red and sometimes you need that normal
alert which is red and sometimes you
even want to display a success message
it's also called alert here but it
obviously should have some green color
that is why you simply add a second
class to this div and this now defines
the kind of alert you want to show and
the class always has this pattern alert
- and then simply some special suffix
which defines what it's like you for
example have primary if you set this and
you reload you see we have this blue
alert here now it takes the entire width
of the page because by default is alert
if occupies the entire width typically
you would of course combine this with
the grid so you could add a container
here and then you could add your row and
in there your Col class like that and
now if we add our alert in that class
here we still have a column but due to
the container this is naturally centered
and in the middle of everything so if we
now inspect this we see here we got the
row doing work here we got the column
doing work and we got the container
which centers this so this is how you
would normally do that of course you can
also add
spacing to the top avert you to some
natural element which is added for
example we could have a number of class
here number row I mean and never call
them and in there an h1 tag where I say
alerts and modal's and percent of course
so so this is an example setup but back
to that alert
we added alert primary and as you can
see this is blue now we also can use
alert secondary if we do that then we
got the secondary base color bootstrap
defines and that's this grayish color so
that's kind of a neutral message you you
might want to display sometimes more
interesting maybe are the special
classes like success now as you might be
able to guess this gives us a green
alert so this is obviously a great
choice if you want to show some success
message to the user
besides success we also got danger and
danger will give the user a red alert so
this is what you want to use when
foreign validation fails something like
this we also have alert warning this
will give us a yellow alert so that's
interesting if you don't have an error
yet but you maybe want to notify the
user of something when at well give a
warning to him we also have info this is
again a bluish color so it's actually
the same color as primary hat
if you have a look at the color codes
there and now we add primary it primary
again if I reload a slightly different
color I guess it's a different blue but
it's also blue so primary or info would
be the colors though important the
primary color uses the primary theme
color and you can actually override
theme colors when you're building
bootstrap from source so to say when you
embed it into your build workflow
therefore primary is not always blue
that's important to keep in mind
now we also got light and dark light
will have a white background dark will
have a grayish background and this is
how you can work with alerts that's
really most important thing
to them now you can also add two special
things to alerts one is links you can
add links so maybe we add a link here
click me and let's have a look this is a
normal link leading nowhere in our case
if we save that and we reload it looks
like this like a normal bootstrap link
with that bluish color now maybe you
want to have a color that fits the alert
you are having and you can get that by
adding a special class to that link you
can simply add alert - link as a class
in there with that if you save that in
reload now you see it actually looks
different it now is a dark blue bold
text and if we change the alert - let's
say success you will see that this
doesn't stay blue but now it's dark
green so this adjusts the link to the
alert type which is very helpful of
course now you can also use H 1 and so
on text in there you can for example add
let's say let's say a h2 tag and you can
give this a special class alert heading
there you could say this is an alert and
then you could simply add a paragraph in
here with no class you don't need to add
classes here to use them and this will
now give you a special heading which
also takes the color of the alert and
then on normal text now important you
can of course use any HTML element in
there you can add lists and an alert if
you want you can add the margin helper
classes bootstrap offers so everything
you can use outside of an alert
basically can be used in there too of
course you always have to test if it
looks good and if it makes sense to be
inside of an alert now the last thing I
want to show you is that you can
configure bootstrap or add something
such that these alerts can automatically
be dismissed now you can of course
always do that manually with your
favorite JavaScript library or framework
but let's say you render this alert as
part of a server-side rendered page
which is returned by your Express or
level
in this case you typically want to or
you might want to be able to remove the
alert without adding a front and
framework though that is possible too
now to make this dismissible you first
of all need to ensure that you're
importing these scripts at the bottom
you need to bootstrap javascript files
and then you need to add something to
your alert and that's something first of
all is a button which allows you to
remove the alert
so let's simply add a button here
let's give it type button and let's then
simply add there's a cross in there
basically so we can do this by adding a
span and add the times character and
let's add Araya hidden here to true to
indicate that this won't be real content
now if we save that and we go back we
see that cross button here now doesn't
look too beautiful does it now what we
have to do is we have to add alert this
miserable to our alert here and to the
button you have to add a class to the
closed class now if you do that and you
reload you see that the cross is here at
the bottom now this simply happens
because the button of course is an
inline element we can position it at the
top of our alert though and now it's
here in the top right corner which looks
a lot better now one thing you'll notice
though is if you click that button
nothing happens because we haven't
really connected this alert in this
button to the bootstrap JavaScript file
we do this by adding a special attribute
to the button the data
- dismiss attribute this will be
automatically watched by the bootstrap
javascript file and we can simply add
alert as a value here and this will then
tell the bootstrap JavaScript code
essentially that whenever des is called
the alert will be removed with that if
we now reload now I can click this
button and remove the alert now as you
see it disappeared instantly we can
change this behavior by adding the fade
show classes here to the overall alert
so next to alert and alert success or
whichever you have and now it fades out
as you can see so this is how you can
make your alert dismissible without
adding any custom JavaScript code that
were alerts let's now move on to modal's
now what is a modal to begin with a
modal is this pop-up like window which
does not open a separate browser window
but which simply renders in front of
your other content on your page now
let's add such a modal to our page I'll
add it in front of my grid here it will
be in overlay anyways and how do we add
a modal well we simply add a div that's
always a good start when using bootstrap
I guess and then we need to assign the
modal class to that div now next we can
define some content inside of that div
we can also add some accessibility
values here you can always find them in
the details bootstrap documentation
you'll find linked in the video
description or below this video to be
precise so inside that modal div we now
have to define the content of that modal
and for that turns out that we actually
need another wrapping div for
positioning bootstrap tasks behind the
scenes and that should be modal - dialog
modal dialog now takes the different
modal components we have to be precise
it takes yet another wrapper needed for
the padding inside the modal which is
mole - content now we can finally start
adding content for example we can add a
modal header now a modal header is
optional you don't have to add one it
allows you to provide a caption a title
for your modal and also a close button
but you can close the modal differently
- so here is the modal header now let's
add h2 tag in there where we can say
please confirm and this h2 tag should
also receive a class the modal - title
class which will style this in a nice
way now we can add a button here as I
said which allows us to close the modal
it will again hold
span with that times characters with
this cross character we saw before
this button is a type button and it will
receive the closed class just as you saw
in the alert it basically is the same
but we add here now with that we got a
title here now if we save everything and
we reload we don't see a modal well
we'll come back to that in a second this
is our modal header now before we try
seeing it let's also add a modal body
now you always should have a modal body
that is the core content you display and
in there you can use the bootstrap grid
you can construct a form you can do
whatever you want
here I'll simply add a paragraph where I
say this is the modal body do you like
it and to allow the user to give us an
answer we can also add a modal footer
which is optional again now in that
modal footer we could add more buttons
and these buttons could also be used to
send data to the server and close the
modal just close the modal in case of a
cancel button stuff like that now
actually I'll dive deeper into buttons
and forms in the next video in this
series but for now let's simply add a
basic button let's add a confirm button
here it's the only button we'll have
let's say and that will also receive
type button which by the way is never
required for this to work just
semantically require or make sense and
let's give it a class of BTN and then
BTN secondary maybe now with that we got
a basic modal again more on buttons in
the next video now we still can't see it
if I reload that there's no modal the
reason for this is that the modal by
default isn't visible it typically is
shown upon a certain action now how do
we show it we need JavaScript for that
and you can always add the classes that
will show it manually we'll inspect the
modal to see which these are but for now
let's simply add a button to show it so
in my grid and I just recognized I am
inside my grid so let's add that modal
outside of the grid container it would
work otherwise cube but it's not read us
makes sense semantically so let let me
get out of the grid and in that grid
I'll now add a new row and a new column
and in that column I'll simply add
another button and for that button I'll
say show mul now to show that first of
all let's give it to type button tomb
now let's also give it some button
classes button button primary maybe to
give this some nice styling now to show
the modal I'll add another data
attribute data toggle and here I will
say modal this also is automatically
picked up by bootstraps JavaScript code
and it will recognize that when we click
this button we want to show a modal
however we also need to be clear about
which modal and for dad will give our
modal and ID so here on that div element
which has two class model I'll also add
an ID and you can set up any ID you want
like demo modal again you're totally
free to choose whichever ID you want now
take that idea and go down to your show
modal button there and on that button
you now add data - target this is
required by bootstraps JavaScript code
to understand which modal you want to
show or hide so now we simply add that
ID here with a hashtag in front of it
because we actually passed the full CSS
selector and now we can reload we see
that button if we click it we see our
modal and this is how it looks like now
if you click that button here nothing
happens if you click that cross nothing
happens if we click the back drop it
closes low so that's a default behavior
clicking the back drop removes the modal
now before we make these buttons work
let's quickly inspect this modal here's
our modal class or our modal div you see
the modal div actually wraps or spans
the entire size of your page which makes
sense you want to have it on your entire
page now they're on that modal div you
can also see that we got a show class
now we didn't add that if you inspect
the modal in our code there's just a
modal class no show class this is
actually the class which is added when
we run that JavaScript code when you
click that but
now this show class is part of what
shows the small modal besides the
display:block property if I uncheck
display block and I remove the show
class and set this play to non here ever
not just remove it set it to non
then the modal is gone and this is what
you can do with your own JavaScript code
to in case you don't want to use
bootstraps JavaScript package you can
add this class and set the style with
you react angular whatever you're using
or vanilla JavaScript know the modal is
still there as you can tell now this is
this modal backdrop diff which was added
automatically by the JavaScript code we
executed because we didn't add this here
we don't have the class here so you will
have to add a div with a class modal
backdrop and show manually - just in
case you want to rebuild this without
using the bootstrap JavaScript package
with that let's reload the page and open
again though would be nice if these
closed buttons would work now again you
could use your own JavaScript
implementation to manually set this play
to non and remove the show class and
remove the backdrop but of course we can
also make these buttons work and we do
so by going to these buttons and on the
button we simply add something here on
our modal we simply add data dismiss
again to our button and this time we
specify modal as a value here before we
specified alert to close an alert now we
want to close a modal and by the way you
can only have one mole at a time
multiple nested modal's are not
supported so with that we added this
dismiss trigger - well dismiss any mole
or dem modal we have let's also add the
same for the button in the footer and
now if we reload you see if I click
these buttons we close the modal and
again this could be done with your own
JavaScript - that is how the bootstrap
modal works in its core now in the
official Doc's you'll learn more about
what you can put inside of a modal that
you got alternative classes if you need
a bigger or smaller modal that you can
also create a modal with scrolling
content it will scroll automatically
then and that you can vertically Center
a modal now one thing I want to show you
right away now
is if we click that the motor just pops
up it's there it doesn't animate in and
would be nice if it wet and actually
that is a simple default behavior you
can add with just the addition of one
class on our mode layer besides just
adding modal you can also add fate and
this will make sure that the modal fades
in with that edit if we reload now
you'll see it slides down and fades in
and it always removed like that this
certainly looks nicer and therefore is
something you should consider adding to
any modal you display that's actually it
for modal's I hope this was helpful for
modal's and alerts I should say I hope
this was helpful and allows you to add
these features to your next project in
the next video of this series we'll dive
into forums and buttons and see what we
can do with these see you there
hopefully bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
