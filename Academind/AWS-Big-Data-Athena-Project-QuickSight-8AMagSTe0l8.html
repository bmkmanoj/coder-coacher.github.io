video of our Athena project in the last
video we learned how to use Athena so
how do carry data with Athena that was
stored before in s3
we didn't take a look so far as an
option how to visualize that information
actually this is the purpose of this
video we will take a look at how we can
connect quick side the business
intelligence tool of AWS to Athena
let's do this right now
one important information before we
start if you never work with quick sides
and you don't even know what it is just
take a look at another video that I made
in this video you will get an
introduction to quick side and see how
you can create an account as soon as you
get this account you cannot start right
here together with me so I am back in
the management console here and we want
to find quick side right now and
selected right here now we are in quick
side and as I said just make sure to
take a look at the other video to
understand what exactly you can see
right here to make it quick this is just
an overview of the existing analysis
that I have in quick side now before we
connect quick set to a phenom
we have to make sure that a quick side
has the right to access information that
is stored in Athena now to do this we go
to our settings right here and go to
manage quick side right there in there
we can go to G account settings right
here here you can find the account
permissions and if you click on to edit
awx permissions right there and right
here you can now enable quick side to be
allowed to access of Emma's on Athena
right here and also specify the s3
buckets that quick side is allowed to
access so make sure that you take all
these boxes to be able to really analyze
the data that you queried in Athena so
if you click apply right general because
it is totally fine
then we can go back to the main menu and
then we only have to make sure one thing
and this one thing can be found right
here in the regions we talked about that
in the s3 video and in the Athena video
but the important thing right here is
that the region that you select for
quick side is the same that you selected
for Athena because otherwise the data
that you have an Athena cannot be
accessed by quick side so that's
important keep that in mind before you
start working in quick side right now
now we made sure that we have the right
settings so it's time to kind of
retrieve that data now so to do this we
need a data set and we can find it by
going to new analysis and clicking onto
new data set right here now you can see
lots of different options where you can
connect quick side you but we only want
to take a look at Athena right here now
if you click onto that then you can
enter a name for the data source and now
I will name that YouTube population oops
Athena maybe and if you know click on to
create data source right here then you
can see that well quick side found the
database and I have to say that again
if the regions are not the same so the
region for quick side and for Athena
this won't work so make sure that these
regions are the same however we got our
database now and if you click on to
select right here you can see that you
can choose between the two databases
that we have so the default one and the
UT population is the one we need and now
you can specify which table that you
want to visualize in quick size out of
these tables that you have in your
database so this could be table 2 for
example now you have two different
options you can either press select or
edit preview data the difference is that
if you press select you will directly be
able to visualize the data and if you
press edit or preview data then you can
prepare the data before you actually
well load them into quick side and bite
it visualize them so let's press edit
preview data first to see if everything
is correct and here
now the data is loading yeah and I think
this looks quite nice as I said this
video is not about the details regarding
the functionality the quick side it's
more about the connection between quick
side and the fina an important thing is
maybe that you can specify if you want
to create the data in the finance
directly here or if you want to load the
data into spice this is the internal
memory or storage of quick side and this
means that quick side treats the
information in the Phenom as a database
that's important to know and with that
if you change the data source type to
spice then you would be allowed to even
join tables which are within the same
database in quick side well if our data
this doesn't make a lot of sense so we
cannot use that join feature right here
but what we can do is we can simply
press until safe and visualize right
there
let's click onto that now we see that
the information is imported into quick
side and by that into spice as I said
this is the internal memory click that
has and this may take a few seconds so
let's wait for that until the import is
complete now the import is done and as
you can see all data was imported
correctly so we can now close that
import complete method right here well
and now simply create a chart for
example let's create a bar chart
something like that maybe and drag the
time the x-axis and maybe the fuel
population right here and the male
population also right there you can see
this add symbol that here so we can add
the information well if we now close
that field well maybe or before we close
it let's open it and change the sorting
because it's kind of wrong so we can
change it right here like that and if
you now increase the size maybe like
that and also change number formatting
sorry for that but I don't like that to
be honest so let's change it right here
like that it looks better right now it's
good I think well then this is how you
can
now visualize information that you
stored in s3 that you queried with
Athena and that you then connected with
quick sides to visualize it and if you
now click right here onto this quick set
symbol then you can find your analysis
right here in this analysis menu and if
you go to manage data right here then
you can also find your data set right
here saved in spice and this is it
actually this is our afina project I
hope you enjoyed this project and I hope
that you saw how you can connect
different AWS Big Data solutions with
each other and how this whole workflow
makes sense in the end you have two
storage in s3 you have a Cena to query
the information and you have quick site
in the end to visualize the information
and everything happens in the cloud and
the calculation is not done on your
machine so with that the only thing I
can say right now is thankful for
watching this series and for being part
of it actually and I hope this helps you
to clear some things up when working
with some AWS solutions additionally
this might also be a big help especially
Athena if you have a big file that you
want to analyze so if this happens the
next time don't think only about Excel
maybe also think about solutions like
Athena because this can make your life a
lot easier sometimes and with that I can
only say thanks a lot for watching and
hope to see you in the next videos bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
