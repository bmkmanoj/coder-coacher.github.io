are going to create our very first basic
object in Adobe Illustrator I'm going to
build this speech bubble here and it is
certainly not the most complicated and
fancy object author in the world but is
very nice to demonstrate the basic tools
we have were how we approach creating
such shapes because in the end you will
recognize all shapes no matter how
complicated they look are most of the
time only composed of very simple shapes
and then cleverly combined and so on so
let's start with speech bubble here
let's just get this year out of the way
and now let's think about this object
here how could we compose it now this is
one object but in the end this looks
like a rectangle here i'd say so we
should be able to start for rectangle
for this part here we probably need to
pen tool we'll see how this voice and
these slides here well that are just
lines so let me start by dragging out a
rectangle i selected a rectangle tool by
pressing m and now I could evil directly
select a rounded rectangle tool if you
have an older version of illustrator you
do have to if you have a new word you
can create or use the normal rectangle
tool just drag out a rectangle here and
then you got these dots here in each
corner if you click one of the these
dots here and then you drag you create
around the corner as you can see now
this corner is surrounded now if you
have the whole object selected not
clicked on an individual bullet here and
then you drag you will route all corners
equally so just bring them in until it
looks nice yeah that should do the trick
so now we can already see the similarity
between this shape here and the shape
let's next work on this part here at the
bottom this well is this arrow pointing
to whoever is saying something for
district will use
hantu it's a breast-- p or click on the
pen tool icon here so now we want to
click here on this anchor smart guides
are guiding us click let's say till till
around here then create a nice little
curve click on this anger go up there
then click on this intersect smart guy
here and hold so that we can practice in
a little bit and well now we're just
able to complete the shape so now we get
the shape but yeah we got to shift you
want to have one therefore looks like
both shapes just click on both and down
here in the Pathfinder we got the
possibility to well add shapes I just
brought it up so here we can unite two
shapes I just click this now you can see
we got to one single shame so this Luxur
good but we get this little ass here now
you might like this way and I think you
could use a speech bubble like this it's
perfectly fine but if you want to get
rid of it and have this smooth
transition we have to manipulate this
anchor point here we can do this by
using the direct selection tool which is
this second error here on the left first
ones to selection who enters the direct
selection tool can also press a on the
keyboard to selected what's the
difference the selection tool allows us
to select complete shapes like if i
click on here I get the whole shape if I
have the direct selection tool enabled I
can also select chips but I can also
select individual anger points I want to
edit so in this case this anchor point
here I might just drag it out of it but
you see the problem persists this is
because this is a corner anchor point
because two kinds of anger points here
we got smooth ones those are these are
the ones which have the these handles
here ray can change the curve and we got
the anchor or the corner ones where you
will just make a hard corner if you want
to change this weekend
here in the top by clicking converts
like the angle points to smooth and now
I can see how we get this much smoother
curve here now we can again click on
this anchor and maybe bring it don't
like this change the curve a bit and
yeah I'd say does looks good i'll leave
it like this so we got this all working
the last thing i have to do is I have to
insert these lines here and this is very
simple I could just create rectangles
and fold them all lag but i will use the
line segment tool here and a way to use
tools just to click somewhere hold and
drag out the line you can watch shift to
make sure it's a straight line so once i
have a line i want you to placate it two
times and i got several options to do
this one is to just click on this line
drag it and hold alt while doing so
let's recreate a copy once and release
both keys i can also hold shift to make
sure that I stay in line and I don't
well drag it up into the right or left
so once i get this i can press ctrl or
command D to duplicate it and
illustrator will automatically duplicate
it such that it will keep the distance
to the last object so it's a very
intelligent duplication here and this
almost looks good but I want to align
them a little bit different so I want to
drag this down without holding old now
just holding shift to the bottom and
then I will shift and then I press the
up key one two three four times and this
will just move it in well bigger pixel
blocks I guess it's 20 pixels or so at a
time sailor that test yeah it gives us a
fixed dimension in which it will move
this element and I will do the same for
the top unit also four times and now I'm
sure that the top and bottom line are
equally distant too while the borders of
the shape now this ship in the middle
between these lines and the easiest way
to do so as select all lines by loading
shift by clicking on all of them and
then just hit this button here we're
we'll distribute century and this will
just well do what it said what the name
implies distribute them equally the last
fingers I'll again select them all and I
will just increase the stroke and now
i'm doing this here to write i could
also do it here at the top to let's say
four pixels may be free yeah no I
deleted them maybe free pixels yeah
looks better the very last thing is I
want to make sure that these are not
only in the center vertically but also
horizontally so in order to our ensure
this I will select them all then hit
command or ctrl G to group them now it's
one group if I click on one I select
them all I can ungroup them of course 2
and then I will select my shape here but
also clicking on it with shape-shift
selected some I i have my lines here as
well as the overall shape selected and
now if I click again on the overall
shape without having anything else
selected no shift north nothing just
left clicking you will see that it gets
this thick blue border so now its key
object and this means that not all
alignment options i take will be
relative to this object so if I now say
center horizontal you see these lines
move now in the middle of this if I
would do advise where is ur well now
let's try this the overall shape would
move to the left now the result is
obviously the same but just so that you
know that you can choose which elements
should be moved and which should be the
one acting as a key so now the speech
bubble is done and what it does not look
exactly the same it looks pretty fine
and say and I will see you in the next
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
