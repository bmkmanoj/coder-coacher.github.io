you here if it gets finally time for a
new bigger project and what I read a lot
in the comments and an idea I had to is
to go into the e-commerce direction now
for now I won't pull a complete online
shop which would in my opinion include a
back end for the owner of the shop to
create products create categories and so
on so that would be really a complete
content management system but for now I
want to focus on one of the most
interesting parts of a shop the shopping
cart the checkout process payments of
course will be included in that and
e-mail verification or email sending an
email to the customer once the product
is bought and purchased or paid for so I
think these are key features that are
really interesting and I really want to
do that and yeah I think that's a great
project now what hopefully makes this
project even better is that I will not
only build it with Larry will oh I
didn't mention it yet yeah is over level
will be one part but I will build the
same project with nodejs
and handlebars a templating engine so we
will have two different server-side
languages for this project and I think
that's a great thing to have so you can
directly compare whatever you like more
seasoned advantages/disadvantages how
certain things are done one language and
handled in another language so really
interesting stuff and I'm really looking
forward to that now one important note I
don't have this project finished right
now actually I haven't really started
with it so I thought it might be fun to
both this really together of course I do
still prepare the individual video
lectures bit at least but I think it's
interesting for you to see to how
something is both from the ground up
without having a finished product or
blueprint at hand because in real
projects you would have that right so
why not do it like this in these videos
and that was the talking
you will see the videos get uploaded and
I really really hope you enjoy it as
much as I probably will do see there why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
