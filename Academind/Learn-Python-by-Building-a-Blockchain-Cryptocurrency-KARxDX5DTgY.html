called learn Python by building a
blockchain
I guess the title speaks for itself it's
a Python course you will learn Python
from scratch no prerequisites required
you will learn all the core syntax
features like list comprehensions using
more complex data structures like tuples
or dictionaries you will learn
object-oriented programming with Python
by using classes and inheritance you
will learn how to spin up a webserver
and handle incoming requests with flask
you will learn how to send requests how
to work with files and so much more
so really a fertile Python course that
introduces you to the language and it
does so by building a real cool course
project a basic blockchain and your own
cryptocurrency now that sounds very
fancy well why did I choose that course
project well I chose to build a
blockchain because it turns out that we
actually can gradually enhance the
blockchain start very basic and then add
more and more core features off the
blockchain technology as we learn more
about Python so it's a really cool
project that allows you to apply your
newly gained knowledge and build
something realistic that's always
important to me I want to build course
projects that are connected to something
you know from real life that aren't too
abstract now the blockchain on the other
end is kind of abstract you hear about
that technology a lot and I'd argue that
most people don't really know how it
works and that's another cool thing
about the course whilst it is not a
blockchain course a it's not about the
blockchain only it's about Python but
whilst that is the case you will learn a
lot about the blockchain there you will
learn about the core concepts behind it
and therefore you hopefully understand
their technology a bit better too so it
really has these two parts Python and
the blockchain two very popular topics
now connected in one course which
hopefully allows you to learn a lot
about Python and also learn a bit about
the blockchain whilst you're going
through it I'd be more than happy to
welcome you in the course if you are
interested you'll find a link with a
nice discount in the video description
and I also attached a couple of lectures
at the end of this video to allow you to
see if that course is for you as I said
I'd be more than happy to welcome there
otherwise see you in all the other
videos on this channel bye
so what is - - is a programming language
which you can use for many different
things it's an extremely powerful
easy-to-use and object-oriented
programming language now what does this
mean it's powerful because it offers
good performance it runs on all major
operating systems so it doesn't matter
if you're using Mac Windows or Linux
it'll work on all of these and you can
use all of these for this course and
it's extremely versatile to be precise
if we have a look at its versatility we
can see that we can use it to build
simple scripts or programs running on
our desktop with or without an UI that
you can use it for web development to
run server-side code so code that does
something on the server sends back HTML
documents to your users and stuff like
that and another very popular way of
using Python is for data science and
after this course you will be able to
dive into all these different areas
because in this course you will learn
all the core basics about Python on
which all these pillars basically build
up now what do these pillars mean in
detail though well we can build scripts
and programs for example build a simple
calculator which we execute from our
system built-in command line we can
write simple utility scripts like clean
up scripts or scripts that save some
data to files of course we can also
build complex programs we can add a UI
to build real desktop applications this
is also something which is relatively
easy to do thanks to pythons rich
ecosystem another cool Pro argument
it has a broad ecosystem of third-party
packages and libraries you can add to
easily add new functionalities to your
programs when we have a look at web
development we take advantage of that
there are a lot of packages that make it
easy for us to write server-side code
and we're then able to use PI 4 as a
server-side language we're able to build
full stack apps where - takes in
requests and sends back HTML responses
or API applications where we also take
requests and send responses but where we
interact by just sending data and
no HTML code that could be rendered by a
browser this allows us to build web
applications to which other programs
could communicate and this is actually
also what we'll dive into in this course
but more on that later we can also use
frameworks like Django or flask these
are these for party libraries I
mentioned to make our developers life a
lot easier now when we have a look at
data science another very popular way of
using Python there we also have a rich
set of third-party programs that make
statistical calculations and working
with numbers very very easy we also have
easy ways of gathering import and
cleaning and using data and we can do
all kinds of statistical analysis
implement machine learning models and
use them in our apps so Python is
extremely versatile and therefore
learning it definitely is a great idea
and all these areas build up on the
basics you'll learn in this course but
Python is not just powerful and
versatile it's also easy to use it has a
clean and simple syntax no extra fluff
added to it it has a batteries included
approach which means that just after
installing pipe you already got a lot of
possibilities of using it you don't need
to import and implement third party
packages which you have to download and
install separately for many things you
can't just use what's built in that's
really great and it offers a great
documentation so if there is something
you're stuck with your you're not sure
you dive into the talks and you get many
examples there many ways of learning
Python in case you can't find other
resources which also help you because as
I said there is a rich ecosystem
offering many resources to it so that's
pretty amazing and now lastly it's
object orientated that is something
which will become clearer once we dive
into what this means in a separate
module in this course if you already get
some programming background you'll be
happy to hear that Python users classes
inheritance that it supports all these
features doesn't force you to use them
but offers the possibility and using
these features offers many advantages
and that makes the language even more
powerful and easy to use in the air
it's no wonder that python is very
popular therefore if we have a look at
this graph we see python is extremely
popular and it's gaining popularity
surpassing many other languages here and
it is of course doing that because it's
easy to learn it's very versatile and it
has this cool ecosystem with many
third-party packages and therefore it's
highly extensible so learning Python was
always a good idea now it's a better
idea than ever before so with that let's
just install Python and write our first
simple program with it
let's get started of using Python to use
it we have to install it first and that
is also true if you are on a Mac or
Linux there it typically is
pre-installed but also typically in an
older version so make sure to install
the latest one that's really important
and you do install it by visiting
python.org
and as I said earlier you can use Python
on Mac Linux and windows and you always
install it from that page on that page
choose downloads and then PI from free
dot whatever the latest version is when
you're viewing this in my case it's free
dot 6.5 now it's automatically giving me
the Mac OSX download here if you're on
Windows you wizard that same page and
you simply choose the windows download
there it should automatically offer that
on both operating systems simply click
and the download should start once the
download finished simply click the
downloaded file and the Installer should
open up now on Mac simply click continue
continue continue agree to the License
Agreement choose the place where you
want to install it click continue one
more time and finally install it now on
Windows the steps are basically the same
though there are two important things
make sure to select this checkbox where
you add pipe into your path variable
this is important so that you can later
execute it from within your command
prompt and then if you choose the manual
install option also make sure you
install python this pip thing here and
all the things you see checked here and
also make sure that here the environment
variable part is checked this is
important so that you can conveniently
execute Python from within your command
prompt later with all that set on both
operating systems you can simply hit
install and wait for the Installer to
finish once it's dead finish
open the terminal on Mac and Linux or
simply your normal system command prompt
on Windows now these are the tools we'll
start with in the course but no worries
later in the course we will also use a
real editor and work with real files
where we write our code and far later
into the course we'll also attach a more
beautiful UI so this is really just what
we're starting with
now I'm using a Mac here that is why you
are seeing a terminal but the steps are
the exact same if you're using Windows
in the command prompt after installing
Python simply enter pioneer as a command
directly in the terminal or command
prompt after you do this you should
enter this input mode here you see three
greater than signs on the left and this
now means you're now in the Python
console so to say this is called the
repple and i will come back to what
rappelled means in the next module the
cool thing is here you can now type 5
commands and directly execute them later
we will also store them in file so that
we can execute a whole file in one go
but here we can start simple and you can
for example simply enter 2 plus 2 and
get back 4
obviously it's more than just a simple
calculator though so let's build our
first simple program in the next lecture
so let's start building something more
exciting than just a simple calculator
with this rappelled thing and the steps
I show here are shown on Mac but they
are exactly the same on Windows so what
I want to do here is and once you get
some input from the user
store that in a file and then also open
that file and read what we stored there
and output it here in this command
prompt now to get input from the user we
can use a function pipe and ships with
the input function and you will learn
more about all the functions and ships
with and what exactly is happening here
throughout the course of course input is
a function you execute it by typing
input and then two parenthesis between
the parentheses you pass a so-called
argument that is something that function
will use and the input function is
defined by Python it's built-in to show
you the text you're entering here make
sure to use to put a sure marks and then
wait for the user to enter something so
here we could say please enter your name
colon and then a blank and if I hit
enter you see it's outputting that text
and waiting for me to input something
you can tell that it's waiting by the
fact that there are no three greater
than signs on the left so I can type max
here and if I hit enter it's outputting
it below that was the input it received
now that's nice but I want to store that
enough file right here we can use an our
concept variables something I'll also
come back to in this course and we can
simply add a variable by typing any name
you want like name but you could also
type my underscore name anything like
that and then an equal sign and then
input please enter your name what we're
doing with that is we're getting the
input and then we're storing it in that
variable so that we can use it later if
I now it enter I can again enter max and
now you don't see max as an output
instead now if I type my name here so
the name of that variable now we see the
output this allows us to now use that
value as often as we want and now if we
want to store it in a file we can call
Navarrete function pi from ships with
the open function which will open a file
for us
now I'll store the result of that
function in another variable named file
so file equals is whatever open returns
to us and now open needs two things it
needs to know which file to open and how
to open it do you want to read do you
want to write so I will open a file
which I'll name name dot txt and I'll
set mode equal to W 4 right and if that
syntax is a bit unclear well just make
sure to type it correctly here you will
learn what all these things are two
different arguments for one function
throughout the course no worries but
with that we're basically telling Pyfrom
to open that file and give us right
access to it and store that address or
that pointer to that file in that file
variable if I now it enter we can type
file here and this is this strange
output which essentially tells us that
it somehow worked and now we can say
file dot write my name and this tells
Pyfrom to write the content of my name
into that file if we now it enter you
can ignore that output we can now close
that file by calling file dot close with
parentheses and if you do that let's
quickly navigate into that folder where
you're executing your terminal or
command prompt in the finder or Windows
Explorer you can tell which path this is
running in on windows on the left side
of your terminal when you enter python
there you should find the path it's
currently running in Omak it should
simply be in your users main folder
there you should find the name dot txt
and if you open it you should see the
name you entered in there now of course
we can do something cooler than just
store the value there we can also read
it back into python we can use our file
again and call open again name dot txt
make sure to don't forget the quotation
marks here and now set the mode to R for
read if you now it enter your opening
that same file but in read mode and now
you can call file read and if you hit
enter it gives you the output of the
file here and that was
lot of new stuff a lot of things where
you might wonder what's happening here
and we'll learn all these things no
worries but I hope this gave you a first
impression of what you can do with
Python and how you can give your
computer instructions to execute which
in turn allow you to write more complex
programs as you can use these
instructions and way more other
instructions and commands in any
combination you want to build any kind
of program you want and we'll do this in
this course we'll build a block chain so
what is a block chain then
you probably heard about blockchains or
at least about Bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies in general Bitcoin is a
cryptocurrency and cryptocurrencies are
based on the blockchain technology the
blockchain technology can sound very
abstract but in the end a blockchain is
just a distributed data storage so the
same copy of the data is kept on
multiple machines which are connected
and each data storage so on a machine
the blockchain is just a chain a list of
data stores containers the so called
blocks which in turn are connected to
each other so the order of the blocks
matters and every block is read just
like a folder on your system which
contains some data it's not technically
a folder but you can think of it as one
so we got all these folders where each
folder knows about the folder before it
this builds up a chain so the order does
matter and then the whole folder holding
all these subfolders this is your
blockchain and what's inside a subfolder
that's the data stored in the blockchain
and the blockchain is not limited to
transactions as you learned the
blockchain is a data store and a single
block in the end can hold any data you
want this could be some text this could
be a number this could be a program you
can execute or as in the case of Bitcoin
it can be a list of transactions more on
that in a second we of course don't just
have one block we have multiple blocks
in a blockchain and the interesting part
is that they know about each other to
ensure that you can't manipulate data in
blocks because it's distributed across
multiple machines you want to make sure
that the machines can check each other
each block receives a hash or is hashed
a hash simply is some long text you
could say that is generated
automatically from all the parts that
make up the block so if you got a block
with the data hi I'm in a block and then
let's say you have some metadata in that
block like a unique ID for every block
then you could take both use some
hashing algorithm we'll use a plug-in
for that in this course
and then it spits out some text and
you'll always get the same text for the
same inputs and that hash as it is
called is stored in the next block so
whenever you change the previous block
the next block will detect hey the hash
I stored doesn't match the recalculated
hash for the updated data because same
input yields the same output if you
change the input you change the output
and therefore the next block which
stored the old hash for the old input
would recognize did something went wrong
that is an important security mechanism
and that is how the blockchain is built
you got all these blocks and the next
block always knows about the previous
block now that's a lot of theory what's
a cryptocurrency then because a
cryptocurrency is the most prominent use
case of a blockchain and a
cryptocurrency is really just something
which uses the blockchain technology if
the data you store in a block is a list
of transactions and a transaction is
basically just a piece of information
where you say who is sending how much to
whom these free things are important if
you get a list of such transactions in a
given block you obviously can take
advantage of the security mechanism that
these transactions can't be edited
without the next block recognizing it
and therefore now you have a
cryptocurrency you have your own
cryptocurrency managed in your
blockchain which is distributed across
many machines and which is therefore
secured and that is what's used by
Bitcoin aetherium ripple and all the
cryptocurrencies you know so back to the
picture from before our data now simply
is that list of transactions it's that
simple
and what are the coins then well the
coins is just something you come up with
you can give the things you're
transferring in the transactions
whichever name you want coins are
transferred with transactions that's all
you have to from and how much the how
much that is your coins and you can name
them whatever you want
the coins normally can't be changed to
our real currencies unless you find
someone of course who says hey please
send me some coins and I will give you
this amount of US Dollars or this amount
of euros this is how it works
the worth of the coins is really just
what people think it is
and this is how it works for all these
cryptocurrencies that also explains
their high volatility
it's a new market and the true value of
these things is still something we have
to evaluate and finally coins are
created with mining because of course we
can send them around but this doesn't
create them mining is a crucial part and
mining is how new blocks are added we
will have open transactions where you
want to send something to someone and
for that transaction to be confirmed it
needs to be included in a new block
which is added at the end of the
blockchain people who are adding this
are doing the so-called mining because
this process actually takes a bit longer
they have to solve a complex algorithm
and they get some new coins out of the
system as a reward so if we want to
summarize it in a big picture this is
how a blockchain looks like it actually
runs on multiple machines so called
nodes you also might have heard of the
term wallet a wallet in the end is just
a note that is a simplification we'll
use in that course a wallet in the end
is what enables you to send and receive
coins it's a piece of data which allows
you to identify yourself you can say and
then you can send coins fruit
transactions to our wallets and if such
a new transaction is created it's
broadcast to the nodes nodes also
distributed across the whole node
network and they will verify a
transaction while doing so to make sure
you have enough funds and to make sure
that you really are who you claim to be
and once a couple of transactions have
been collected one node will eventually
bundle them up in a new block and then
inform the other nodes about that new
block so that it is added to the block
chains of all the nodes and all the
different computers only after this new
block and the whole chain that belongs
to has been verified but all the nodes
of course so that's the blockchain in a
nutshell as I said I'll come back to all
these core concepts throughout the
course in the end it's a distributed
secure data storage where each block is
a folder with some content some data
inside of it and it's a cryptocurrency
if that content is
transaction where we send coins from A
to B
so now that we had a first look at what
pipe Ness and what the blockchain is and
that we installed Python and wrote our
first program let's see what the course
as a whole has to offer for you
we're almost done getting started in the
next module we'll dive into the core
base syntax of Python and regarding our
blockchain we'll start building a simple
chain a simple list of coins for now a
coin will just be an amount just a
number but it will be a great start
thereafter we'll dive into loops and
conditionals useful constructs that
allow us to execute code either multiple
times or only under certain conditions
regarding our blockchain we'll be able
to then verify our blockchain and check
if the previous block is still the block
it was when we added its next block so
this connection between blocks we can
start verifying it here thereafter we'll
start working with more complex data
structures because thus far we'll only
have had a look at numbers text true and
false so called boolean and lists now
we'll get into more complex data
structures which will then also allow us
to work with real blocks and
transactions which is more than just a
number we'll dive deeper into built-in
functions so functions pipe and ships
width as well as text so called strings
and will be able to then calculate and
output the balances of the different
users of our blockchain
well thereafter have a look at the so
called standard library this is this
batteries included approach I was
referring to the many packages - already
has built in we'll have a look at them
and some selected ones in this module
and therefore we'll be able to start
creating real hashes and the so called
proof of work an important blockchain
concept will then learn more about
reading and writing files something we
already did in our first pipe nap here
at the beginning of this course but here
of course we'll dive into it a bit
deeper and learn more about what's
happening there and how we use it and
how we can do different kinds of reads
and writes regarding our block
we'll finally be able to store and read
our blockchain in files and not just in
memory
we'll then also have a look at what we
can do with things go wrong how we can
handle errors how we can debug our code
and find problems in our code this will
allow us to make our blockchain more
robust and more secure more safe will
then also have a look at object
orientated programming with classes this
is super important it's a cool feature
of modern programming languages and -
has it - even though python is actually
a bit older but - has that - it allows
us to write cleaner code I'd argue
easier to understand code and we'll use
it on our block can to improve it and
also to finally add a wallet this
identification data which will in the
end be super important for sending and
receiving funds once we're done with
that it's time to dive deeper into
modules and packages we'll see how we
can install third-party packages and
split our code over multiple files
regarding a blockchain we'll be able to
sign transactions an important security
mechanism and then we're already nearing
the end of this course but we already
learned a lot about the basics but we
won't finish the course before all the
diving a bit into HTTP and how we can
handle incoming HTTP requests with
Python and the flask package for our
blockchain this will mean that we can
control our blockchain with a nice web
UI and therefore leave that terminal
based UI we will have used until then
and thereafter we'll also have a look at
how we can not just receive requests
with - but also how we can send them and
therefore how we can communicate between
different Python programs we'll also use
that in our blockchain to simulate
multiple so-called nodes so servers
running on different machines which now
can communicate with each other to
broadcast new transactions blocks and
all that stuff and there after we're
done but of course I'll also let you
know what possible next steps are where
and how you can dive deeper and what you
have learned in this course so a lot of
cool content in there
all the basics you need to know about
Python and I can't wait to dive fully
into it with you just a couple of other
things about Python which you should
know before we do get started
there are many good reasons for learning
a language like Python I already
mentioned a lot it's versatility ease of
use and what you can do with it I guess
that's the worst Atilla t you can build
all kinds of things with it but of
course there are other languages than
Pyfrom - there is C++ for example this
awls is an extremely powerful language
and it also can be used to build all
kinds of things but it's a bit more
complex than - you write things more
from scratch than with Python it has
less things built in you have to solve
more problems on your own I'd say so
it's a bit harder and we mostly use it
for desktop apps it's very popular for
creating games for example but they're
also often it just runs behind the
scenes and you use some framework some
engine that builds up on it so you can
absolutely write C++ code but it's a
complex language and often you have
other languages you use instead and for
example PI from the version we're using
builds up on C which is not exactly the
same as C++ but generally related to it
and Python is an extra layer on top of
that you could say which is more
accessible we also have languages like
Java Java is also very versatile app
which we can use to build desktop apps
web apps and even mobile apps with
Android
and speaking of Android we also have
things like Swift or objective-c which
you use to build iOS apps or Mac OS apps
we have languages like JavaScript which
run in the browser or also can be used
on the server so which you'd only use
for building web apps PHP would be
another example a language you really
only use for building websites and web
apps and then you will again have Python
which is very versatile which used for
data science desktop apps utility
scripts and web apps so which one should
you choose why is Python the right
choice it obviously depends on what's
you're building the cool thing about
versatile languages like Python is that
if you learn it you are basically free
to build whatever you want at any given
time in the future there are some
languages like Java
the script in the browser where do you
have no alternative - can't be used to
run in a browser - you build the front
end of a website so to say and - all who
can't really be used to build mobile
apps but Python can be used for a lot of
things that happen on a typical computer
or when we talk about web development to
build a web server and therefore this
versatility really is a huge plus in
case you're starting off and you're not
100% sure where you want to go or if you
know you want to go into a direction
where Python is really strong like
server-side web development or data
science it's all important to recognize
that only the two languages here on the
right
Swift and JavaScript in this example
here have a UI attached to them by
definition these allow you to build
things where you see something with a
nice UI relatively fast because you're
either building mobile apps or you're
building websites and both lead to
things you can see you can touch you can
use other languages like Python C++ and
Java are more on the built the logic
part less on the presentation part and
therefore you can add you eyes to them
and we will in this course but the core
of Python and so on is really just the
logic that runs on your machine which is
all that the reason why for the majority
of this course we will work in the
terminal and execute our code on our
computer because it's doing a lot of
logical work which of course is the
driver of any important application the
logic that happens in your program not
the presentation but as I said we'll add
the presentation in this course to
now to come to an end in this module
let's have a brief look at the Python
history and more importantly at the two
important versions that exist we get PI
from 2.7 and free Dex currently free dot
six is the latest version soon it will
be free dot seven now what's the
difference
Q dot seven is an older version it's the
legacy of python learning it right now
is not really something I would
recommend or anyone would recommend
there are some very very very niche
cases and if you need to cover them
learning the more modern version free
Dex is still a better choice because it
will then make it easy for you to learn
in 2007 anyways but generally you don't
need 2.7 free dot X is the future so
whichever version of free is currently
the latest one this will be the future
of python eventually we'll probably also
have a version 4 but for now we have
version 3 and that will stick around for
quite a long time version 4 is not even
something that is known when it will be
released right now
so that is version 2.7 versus version 3
dot X 2 dot 7 was released in 2010 and
will be supported in 2020 so in case you
need to use it you got two years to go
but as I said free dot X is the one
which is currently still active under
development 2.7 is the last 2 dot X
version there will be no 2.8 free dot X
is still under development still gets
new features and improvements it is the
future of Python this is why you should
learn it 2.7 has a slightly different
syntax most is the same but there are
some differences because free dot X
added a lot of improvements and
additions to the language made it better
brought some things in line which
previously behaved a bit differently and
strange so it really added a lot to the
language there still are some very few
libraries that only work with Python 2.7
but the vast majority of all third-party
packages you might want to use have been
ported to free X so this should very
rarely be an argument for picking 2007
and therefore learnfree X it's all the
diversion we're using in this course for
that reason
it's the future of Python and of course
you want to learn that future in this
course
so we're pretty much done getting
started in the next module we'll dive
into the base syntax of Python but I
won't go there without letting you know
how you get the most out of the course
because that is really important to me
you get the most out of the course by
watching the videos now that seems
obvious but there's more than one way of
watching videos make sure to watch them
at your speed if I'm going too fast you
can use the controls in the udemy player
to slow me down if I'm going too slow
you can use them to speed me up also
pause regularly if you're coding along
which I strongly recommend you might
need to pause a video so you can catch
up with me because if I take too long
breaks everyone who's not coding along
will have a hard time and will get bored
so I'm trying to find the right balance
and therefore it's important that you
adjust the speed that you take pauses
and also that you sometimes rewind the
video if there's a concept which is not
clear it's on the montt course so take
advantage of this this is really how you
get the most out of that so code along
that is something I do encourage you to
do do the exercises I offer in this
course they are great for checking
whether you really understood a certain
concept the things taught in a certain
module and of course use the course
resources so all the source code I show
is attached to this course and not just
one code attachment per module but most
of the time I have multiple snapshots
per module you'll find them attached to
the last lecture of each module and
download and compare them to your code
if there is something which is unclear
if you're facing some strange issue then
my code is really there to help you the
same goes for links which you find in
the last lectures of each module there I
provide useful links to other resources
which allow you to dive deeper learn
more or look things up so definitely
take advantage of this too now sometimes
you just get stuck though or there is
something you you don't fully understand
ask in QA I'm happy to help there I do
read a reply there regularly so I do my
best to provide quick help in QA but if
you can help our students that's even
better not
because you're helping me but because I
really mean it like that this is the way
how you learn the most I guarantee you
that this is an awesome way of learning
way more because asking it's super
simple but answering solving a problem
that's difficult and I can only
encourage you to do that it can be
challenging to go out there and put your
opinion out there and solve a problem
and potentially be wrong but what could
happen you're wrong
so what then you get corrected and
you'll learn again so definitely give
that a try and answer in the Q&amp;amp;A section
you'll find a lot of problems there and
solving them that is something where you
can learn a lot and at the same time
also help other students this is how you
will get the most out of the course
follow these steps and you should have a
more than solid knowledge of the Pythian
fundamentals and core concepts and how
to write Python programs by the end of
the course and a nice side effect you'll
also have a very solid understanding of
what the blockchain actually is and how
it works so with that let's finally dive
into the next module and start with the
base syntax of Python
so let's start diving deeper into - now
that we played around with it a bit in
the command line and did we learn the
basics about what a blockchain actually
is it's time to learn the base syntax of
Python its core features and of course
also to start building our basic
blockchain in this module we'll
therefore have a look at the rabble so
this command line again and we'll also
explore how we write a real Python
program outside of this command line
with normal files and an IDE and
integrated developer environment now
that's of course just the setup part
thereafter we'll dive into the Python
language and we'll start working with
variables and see which data types we
can store in these variables and of
course what variables are to begin with
now we'll also see that with variables
alone we can't do that much so we'll
also have a look at operators will
understand what operators are and which
operators exist and how we can use them
now we will build a block chain in this
course and as the name suggests a block
chain includes that chain part so
multiple pieces of something therefore
in this module we'll also explore what
lists are in how we work with lists in
Python and you round up this module and
write a program that is a little bit
more useful than what we had thus far
we'll also dive into functions a very
useful language construct which we'll
use quite a lot throughout the course
now that's the Python part you could say
what about the Plock chain well
regarding the block chain at the end of
the module we'll be able to manage a
list of blocks and each block will
actually contain some data or a list of
data so we will start working with our
coins in the section even though our
block chain won't be finished by the end
of it of course we'll be able to add or
mine data to our block chain and we'll
also be able to output our block chain
so that we can see it so with that let's
get started and let's dive right into it
before we start setting up a local
environment let's go back to that
command line approach I called it the
rebel now rebel stands for read eval
print loop the read part is basically
the part where we enter something into
the command line like two plus two
evaluate or evil is the next phase where
Python analyzes our command once we hit
enter now once it's done analyzing it
prints the result for in this case and
the L part the loop is basically where
it well goes back to start and waits for
the next input that is why we refer to
that command line interface to the rebel
it is an interactive shell where we can
just issue commands and let - do the job
it's not really helpful for writing big
Python programs but it's a nice
interactive way of working with Python
and great for simple calculations and
practicing so let's go back to the
wrapper
before we actually set up a real project
with an IDE of course we'll go back to
the rabble to start working on our block
chain and for that let's leave out the
node and transaction part and let's
focus on the chain of blocks which
contain data now that of course means we
have Q essential parts we got the data
and we got the chain now for data in
this module we'll have a look at which
types of data we can use in Python
because no matter which Python program
you're going to write if it's a flight
booking system if it's your own search
engine or if it's a block chain you will
work with data all the time
data your user enters data you read from
some file anything like that and for
data we can basically work with numbers
strings which is text or boolean and
we'll have a closer look at what this is
and what all these data types are in
just a second we also have more complex
data structure said which we'll have a
look at later in this course now the
chain in the end is just a list a
special type of data in Python as you
will learn now let's go back to the
basic data types
boring and boolean numbers are divided
up in integers which is basically a
number without a decimal place and
floats which is a number with a decimal
place and we have both negative and
positive values for numbers we obviously
work with numbers a lot in most programs
be that your accounting software you're
creating where users might enter their
data which typically would be numbers or
be that your plug chain where a user
sent money around most programs work
with some kind of numbers we also get
boolean stowe and boolean are two kinds
of values true and false now this might
not look super useful if you're brand
new to programming but actually being
able to tell if something is true or
false is very useful if you're working
with conditions something we'll also
dive in in the course sometimes you want
to check if something is true if a
certain condition is met and then
execute a certain part of your code and
execute a different part of your code if
something is false and therefore boolean
are a great way of handling that but of
course again we'll see how we use them
in practice throughout this course and
strings are just texts well just like
numbers working with text is obviously
something you do in pretty much any
program again be it as your accounting
software where you enter the name of a
certain transaction which is going on or
be that your blockchain where you enter
the sender and receiver of a transaction
which might have a unique name or
something like that now strings in
Python can be written with single or
double quotation marks and you should
simply pick either of the two approaches
whichever you prefer
and then stick to it they are exactly
the same
now finally I already mention it we got
complex data types like dictionaries and
objects will not worry about them right
now we'll come back to that later in the
course now with that let's see what
exactly numbers are and how we can use
them in a typical Python program
now to work with numbers I'm back in the
rabble or right now it would be precise
only in the terminal or command prompt
of my machine we entered the Python
rebel by typing Python assuming that
Python was installed which we did in the
first course module now once you hit
enter you're in the Python R Apple and
you can always quit it by hitting ctrl
set now let's get back into it though a
number is simply something like this -
if I enter it just basically prints out
what I entered now often you work with
data so not just with numbers but also
with strings and boolean by storing them
in so-called variables variables are
data containers you could say which you
define so you could create a variable by
simply typing a name for it which could
be age the name is totally up to you and
then the variable only becomes useful if
you store a value in it so you can think
of a variable as an address like the
number of your house you then store
something in there by adding an equal
sign and on the right side of the equal
sign you write what you want to store in
that address so in that variable for
example 29 which would be my age if you
had entered here in the rebel it will
not output anything but if you now just
type H it will print out the value you
stored in age now this already is a very
useful and important part you gotta
understand we will work with variables a
lot in this course any program uses a
lot of variables because as the name
suggests they allow you to do dynamic
calculations you cannot just hard-coded
value in there you can also manipulate
that value whilst your program runs for
example here if I type age again and
again prints 29 cost test value which we
stored and it keeps that in memory it
does not clear it after we output it one
time and if we now for example set H
equal to 30 and a type age again it
changed it it overrode this we could
also write H equals age minus 1 so now
we would take the Privy
value which restored in age deduct one
from it and store that new value which
is calculated on the right side of the
equal sign back into the H variable if I
hit enter and type H again it now
outputs 29 for that reason and this is
the usefulness of variables we can do a
lot with them we can run all types of
calculation store in between results
which we might need at a later point of
time in our program and of course also
output them to the users and thus far in
this case here we only work with numbers
with integers to be precise with numbers
that don't have a decimal place of
course you can also store floats in a
variable like here now it's not 29.5 and
if I output this we see 29.5 and
obviously you're not limited to numbers
you can also create a variable which
isn't is old the naming convention here
by the way in Python is to name it like
this if you got one variable that
consists of multiple words you cannot
write is old with a blank that's invalid
it has to be one word but you still make
it easier to read you use underscores to
separate words so you got all lowercase
names with underscores between the
different words this ensures readability
and this valid Python syntax but back to
what I originally wanted to say you can
store for example true in here
that's a boolean do you remember that
slide true and false now you got is old
in here and with that you can of course
also output that and later once we learn
about conditional checks you can use
that cue check if is old is true because
let's say that is calculated dynamically
and then run a different code if that is
the case instead of running the normal
code which you might run if is old is
false the last but not least let's also
have a look at strings if I enter name
the important part here is the quotation
marks so single or double quotation
marks both works and then the text in
this case max make sure to also closed
equitation marks now if you output this
you got the name printed here so these
the free core values or datatypes with
which we work in Python numbers where we
have integers and floats boolean swear
we have true and false and strings which
are just text enclosed by double or
single quotation marks
now that we had a first look at the
important data types and how we use them
with the very important concept of
variables let's have a brief look at
what exactly can be done with numbers or
some important information you should
have on them so we got integers and
floats that's no news to you here are
examples for integers and the important
part here is an integer in Python can be
as big or small if it's a negative
number as supported by your memory and
operating system because 64-bit systems
for example can leverage more of the
memory than 32-bit systems that's why
the operating system also matters but
the important part is this is the only
limiting factor there is no built-in cap
or limit so if you want to store a
really big number in the variable you
can probably do that if your memory
supports it now another important piece
of information sometimes you have some
data in a different data type let's say
you have a valid number which for some
reason is stored in a string so text
let's say you have the text 10 you
recognize that it's text because of
these rounding quotation marks but you'd
like to do a calculation with it now let
me show you how this would work here's
an example let's say I have my age which
is 29 but notice the surrounding
quotation marks if I now output H +1
here you see I get an error that this
must be a string not an integer because
H is a string but 1 is an integer so
what would work is H plus 1 and now we
would have 291 because it's now not
doing the arithmetic addition where it
adds 1 to 29 it's just concatenating the
two strings and creating one word out of
the tube now this is of course fine if
you had something like hello plus world
and you wanted to create one combined
string but it's not what you want if
you're working with numbers and to fix
this or to have a solution for this case
2 there is a helpful function int
if you wrap a string or a float with
that function it actually converts it to
an integer which you can of course then
use as a normal integer because it is a
normal integer so back to the example
here we could say int age and this would
convert the age string which is 29 Q an
integer plus 1 and now we don't get an
error anymore so this error from above
is gone but now we get Ferdie as a
result no as a side note if you wrap
something which can't be converted you
get an error if you wrap a float you get
the well rounded integer to be precise
as you can see with 1.8 it always rounds
down so it basically creates the floor
of it it cuts off the decimal place and
if you wrap true for example it gives
you 1 and in false would be 0 that's
also an interesting convention to keep
in mind true converted to an integer is
1 false is 0 and of course we can also
do these conversions with negative
numbers as you can see there it all just
cuts the decimal place so this is the
int function for floats we also got some
examples here it's all important to know
that your memory and operating system is
the limiting factor when it comes to the
size or the biggest number or the
smallest number you can store and just
as with int you got the float function
to convert our types to float here's
another example let's say H is 29 as a
string again now we can also output
float H and we get 29.0 because it's
converted to a float so to a number and
as a special number a float therefore
float H plus 1 would give us free dot 0
if we said float true or if we write
this we get 1.0 and float false is what
would you guess it's 0 dot 0 so it's
basically the same result as with the in
function but always attaching a decimal
place so just a Stian function this is
very you
if you got some data in the wrong data
type but with a value which you know
that it can be treated as a number and
then you got an easy way of converting
that data type to a number now one final
piece of important information I want to
share with you both integers and floats
can also be written like this year at
the bottom you can add underscores to
make long numbers easier to read so
let's say if I would store the amount of
fans I got where it certainly is 1
million then I can of course do it like
this there's a bit harder to read though
so what I can do is I can also write it
like this
the output fans I still get the outer
format because that's the number with
which Python will calculate but when
assigning the value this clearly is
easier to read if I output fans +1 I
still get the more unreadable output
though because again internally there
only is one type of number this
underscores syntax is only there for
improved readability
we had a closer look at numbers now
before we have a closer look at boolean
x' and strings let's have a look at
something where we already used one part
operators now we already use the plus
operator to add two numbers I guess it's
pretty clear what the plus operator does
it's called operator because we perform
an operation with it we add two numbers
in this case now of course Python has
more than the addition operator we can
also do subtractions for example we can
simply take two numbers and subtract
them from with Java now of course we're
not limited to that we can do all the
basic arithmetic so we can also multiply
numbers we can also divide numbers like
this and here the important part just is
here note that we're dividing two
integers 5 &amp;amp; 10 but the result by
default actually is a float so Python
does not give us an integer something
like 0 maybe because it cuts off the
decimal place but it does the conversion
to a float for us and gives us that
float result now if you want to have the
other behavior though if you want to get
an integer as a result you can use the
double slashes that is the floor
division operator here for the same
operation with the double slash operator
we get 0 as a result because it
automatically cuts off the decimal place
we also get two asterisks which would be
the power operator so if we got 5 to the
power of 10 for example we would get
dead result here so this is really just
allowing us to do some exponential
calculations now last but not least
whenever a core operator we gotta know
is the modulus operator we can use it to
get the remainder of division so in this
case here 5 divided by 10 we can't
divide this 10 doesn't fit into 5 one
single time so the remainder is 5 and
that would be the result now one
important note about these operators
plus operator all that works with
strings as you already saw you can
concatenate two strings
and to multiply the multiplication
operator also kind of works with strings
but only if used correctly let me show
you what this means if we got a string
like hello and another string like world
if we add the plus so the addition
operator - will concatenate both into
one string so if we create a greeting
variable and we store that hello world
text I just created and we are for
treating there after then we just get
hello world here so one string now
that's good to know I also mentioned
that you can multiply strings now what I
don't mean is that you can do hello
times world if you try that you'll get
an error because this is a type of
multiplication Python is not capable of
doing what you can do however is you can
take a character or also some text like
hello and multiply it with a number like
10 and then Python will repeat that text
10 times and concatenate it into one
string this is often useful if you
create some kind of graphical output
with let's say some separation you want
to create a horizontal line well you can
do it like that
this is what you can do with strings the
other operators which you use just with
numbers and that includes both integers
and floats should be pretty clear and
simply play around with them to learn
more about them
with these very basics about numbers and
operators out of the way you're probably
wondering how we'll use that in the
blockchain well we'll use that data to
store it as data in our blockchain so as
the amount of coins we're sending with a
transaction for example but before we do
that there are two important things I
want you to understand about numbers
because you might encounter it and then
it might look strange
one is you can also write longer numbers
in an exponential notation like 1e 10
that is a valid number which pipe will
read and store as this number so this
year would be 1 million for example and
as you can see it automatically stores
it as a float and the even more
important part is if you do something
subtraction like 1 minus dot 9 what
would you expect as a result well you
clearly would expect 0.1 right but if
you had entered you actually get a value
close to 0.1 now this clearly is not the
value we expected we expected 0.1 as a
result now the reason for this
strange-looking result is dead as you
might know computers work where zeros
and ones they work in the binary system
therefore any floating-point number is a
challenge for them and that's not just a
case for Python but for any programming
language the reason for this being a
challenge is that anything which is a
decimal place no matter if it's 100 dot
1 or 0.1 is lower than 1 so the part
after the dot always is lower than 1 per
definition now values lower than 1 are
difficult because they only know 0 and 1
so values lower than 1 have to be
reflected as a fraction of 1 and when
doing these fractions they run into
problems if you're working with values
which are hard to devise by 2 so if it's
not a binary fraction and 0.9 isn't then
you'll have a problem for there
reason one Minister five actually leads
to a clean result because dot v can be
written by the computer or understood by
the computer as 1/2 now 0.9 cannot be
written like this because there is no
integer by which we can divide 1 which
will lead to dot 9 hence it will
actually chain a couple of divisions and
that would really be too complex here
which leads to the computer getting
closer to 0.9 but it never fully reaches
it and therefore 1 minus 0.9 actually
leads to this strange output and
therefore even if you type 1 minus dot
nine minus dot 1 you get a value very
close to 0 but not exactly zero so this
is a limitation or a certain missing
precision you have to be aware of it's
not really an issue in your day-to-day
life because these approximations
actually give you a very close
approximation but it is something to be
aware of and most of all I don't want
you to wonder if somewhere in the course
you see a value like this it's coming
from that missing floating point
precision which is inherent to computers
and also therefore to Python it's not an
issue of pipe though it's something the
computer basically well has its issues
with
now let's also have a brief look at how
we work with strings strings are
generally really easy to use as you
learn you create a string and store it
in a variable for example by using
quotation marks either double single
quotation marks with your text in
between or double double quotation marks
with the text in between either of the
two can be used you can't combine them
though so you can't open with a double
quotation mark and close with a single
one or the other way around so you have
to stay consistent the advantage of
double quotation marks is that there you
could also use the single quotation mark
as part of the text like in I'm pretty
cool
where is for single quotation marks this
will fail I am pretty cool there still
is a way around this with single
quotation marks Q you can escape that
character and I'll again dive into
escaping later in this course but you
can add a backslash in front of the
character you want to escape and now it
is accepted and if you output the string
you see now you just got the single
quotation mark and double quotation
marks around it but there are your
options double or single quotation marks
now if you've got a longer text you also
sometimes want to have multi-line text
and you can create multi-line strings by
using three double quotation marks
opening and closing and in between you
can add your text which can also span
multiple lines as you can see here if I
don't close it but just open it you can
add your text then you can't continue
typing on the next line which can span
multiple lines and close it with three
double quotation marks once you're done
and then you're a longer text is
actually in line if you output it with
another special character in between for
the line breaks backslash n marks a line
break but this makes entering it much
more convenient since you can really
type it across multiple lines too now
we'll come back to working with strings
and escape characters like this later in
the course for now it's important to
know that you can have single or double
quotation marks or for multi-line text
also triple
double quotation marks
enough about the basic datatypes we want
to build a blockchain we've had a first
look at the data we're going to store in
that blockchain so in the blocks of our
blockchain and later in the course we'll
of course refine that data to reflect a
full transaction and not just one word
or one number but for the blockchain we
also need to chain part and for that
we'll use a list a list in Python is
created with square brackets you might
know it as an array in other programming
languages a list holds different values
they can be of the same type so it can
be a list of numbers or text but it can
also be a mixed list like this one this
list has text a floating number boolean
and even a nested list which in turn
holds some text and a number important
the elements in the list are separated
with commas and a list in Python has a
certain length which we can get from it
in this case but before it this gives us
the information about how many values
are inside of a list now typically we
don't just want to have a list to look
at it we also want to be able to access
the elements in our list and change them
or output them and for that we'll need
something which is called the index each
element in the list has its own index
and here's something very important
which is something you have to memorize
the index and pipe lists starts with 0
so we get 0 1 2 3 we've got 4 values but
the first value has an index of 0
therefore the last value in this case
has an index of 3 and accessing values
by their index is actually super simple
we take the variable name in which we
store the list let's say it's my list
and then we use square brackets and the
index to output or to access the value
stored at this index in this case it
would be some text let's have a look at
this in practice let's say we're
creating our block chain and therefore
all create my block chain variable
and this holds a list as I said we
created with square brackets where we
now add values now we obviously are
building our coin in this course here so
let's say our values are the amounts of
coins we're sending with transactions
right now we unfortunately have no way
of storing the sender and receiver of
the coins we'll do that later in the
course of course once we had a look at
more complex data structures but the
amounts is something we can already
store so let's say in the first
transaction we send one coin in the
second transaction it's 8.6 coins in the
third transaction
it was 5.1 coin of course no one's
stopping us from also adding some text
here so this is really something you as
a developer set up so this is our
blockchain obviously with hard-coded
values no chance for the user to input
his own value if I hit enter and I then
output blockchain like this here is our
list now let's say I want to have a look
at that second transaction only then I
can access it with blockchain and then
here what one because remember the index
starts with zero so the first element 1
in this case has an index of 0 if we
want to access the second element 8.6
it's in X 1 and correctly we get 8.6 as
an output here now we can also use these
values in operations let's say we're
some kind of hacker and we're changing
the amount of coins sent in these second
transaction so we could say blockchain
plus 2 if we enter this we get 10.6 but
interesting enough if I then output the
blockchain list again you see here the
value is unchanged
now why is that the reason for this is
that with blockchain 1
we're basically copying the value out of
the list we're not setting up some live
connection to the element so if I add 2
here I'm adding this to the copied
element
and hence if I do add this here we
correct to get 10.6 because we copy 8.6
out of the list and then we add too but
the original list as you can see is
unchanged
now that copying part is actually
something which will become important
later again once we also work with more
complex data structures because there I
will show you how you actually have to
differentiate between different data
types whereas some are copied
automatically whilst others are not but
for now with strings numbers and boolean
it works exactly as I explained it here
typically you're not looking to
hard-code your array and then leave it
like this you got certain circumstances
where you want to do something to your
list at certain points of time in your
code let's say we want to add an element
now our list is set up up there and of
course we could add an element by simply
redefining the entire list like this and
now we add ten as a new element and if I
output blockchain we correctly see the
new list this is very cumbersome though
manually recreating lists all the time
not really something we want to do
thankfully there is a special function
or method we can use now I'll dive
deeper into what functions and methods
are in just a second but for now let's
simply call it by adding dot append
after our list
that's a built-in method shipping with
Python and add parentheses here now if
you add free here and you then output
the blockchain again you see that free
was ended at the end so whatever this
method or function is again we'll have a
look at this in just a second it seems
to take that value we pass to it between
the parentheses and in the case of the
append method added to our list now we
also have a different method which we
can call and there are more methods than
just these two by the way
pop and this will actually return a
value instantly free which was the last
value on our list and if I now output
the list you see the last value is
missing so pop is actually removing the
last element of the list outputs it or
it gives us a chance to store it in a
variable if we would use blockchain pop
on the right side of an equal sign where
we store it in a variable and then it
manipulates the original list and
removes the element from there so that's
a first glimpse at functions something
we'll dive on in in the next lectures
and this is how we can in general work
with the list and how we can start
building our blockchain and actually
whilst this blockchain is very simple
is how we will work with it throughout
the course we'll manage our blockchain
in a list and later the things we'll
change is of course how we work with it
how we manipulate it how we verify it
and check if it's valid the type of data
we store it'll be more complex and of
course we'll also learn how we store it
in a file so that it's not lost if we
restart program because right now if I
quit here and I go back into my
rappelled mode the blockchain is gone
this variable does not exist anymore
because it basically resets the old
state whenever we restart this so that's
all something we'll fix throughout the
course once we can store that in files
so we got the very basics about Python
out of the way
to learn about the core data types and
how we store them in variables however
thus far we did everything in the rattle
now we'll switch to a real development
environment and to a local IDE and we'll
continue building our blockchain in the
end we won't ever chain which will be a
list which holds our blocks of data and
here's something new I want each block
to be a list on its own on itself and in
that list of data basically so inside of
the block will then store our values and
for the first block it might be one
value but the important part is for the
other blocks in the blockchain each
nested list will actually always contain
the previous values to kind of simulate
that part which I mentioned early and
the course where each block knows about
its previous block by its hash now we
won't hatch it here because that
requires some knowledge we don't have
yet but we'll kind of fake it
by ensuring that every block is just a
nested list which contains the previous
values as well as the new value so it's
basically like that game where you're
packing your bags for leaving and you
name one word like toothbrush and your
partner then has to name your word
toothbrush as well as a new word towel
and then you say a toothbrush towel and
let's say a comp and that is basically
what we'll do here each block contains
the old data plus a new one and this is
something we can totally build with the
knowledge we already have and of course
we don't want to use random data we're
going to build our own coin so let's
start by storing transaction values and
obviously we'll refine the values
throughout the course now as I said we
won't do this in the rappelled l will
use a local IDE and a more elaborate
setup which you typically use for any
bigger project you build
to work locally we'll work with text
false and we want to write code in these
text files which is easy for us to write
and to understand and for this we'll use
an IDE an integrated development
environment which is a tool basically a
text editor with a lot of additional
features which make writing code more
fun and easier because we'll get
suggestions errors will be shown to us
automatically we get different colors
for keywords and so on it's more fun to
write code with an IDE
theoretically you can't use a normal
text editor like the one shipping with
your operating system though for this
course I'll use Visual Studio code it's
a free IDE and you can download it from
code dot visual studio comm make sure to
choose your version for your operating
system and simply download and install
it there should be nothing complicated
about that now they're all just an
alternative which I want to bring to
your attention
it's called pycharm and you can simply
google for it and click on that link you
should find there and whilst there is a
paid version of pycharm there also is a
free version of it you simply have to
scroll down a bit and then pick that
pycharm Community Edition can download
that for free and use it for free and
this is a different idea
all the bringing the advantages like
color coding and so on which you can
also try out however I'll go with Visual
Studio code once you installed Visual
Studio code you can open a folder which
you should simply create in your Mac
finder or Windows Explorer where he will
store your project so that's blockchain
project simply create a new folder
somewhere on your machine for that an
empty folder then you pick open folder
and simply navigate to that folder here
I selected my Python blockchain folder
and I'll click open and now it is opens
the folder in the IDE I'll let me hide
this here and now if your installation
looks a bit differently I simply entered
presentation mode here and remove the
toolbar at the bottom for example and
what I also did is I switch the theme to
dark you can do that from the menu
by clicking on preferences color theme
there you have two choice of different
built-in themes and I simply choose dark
plus this default dark theme this is my
setup here now to work with Python we
also want to install some extensions
that make that a bit easier for this you
can simply go to view and then
extensions or if you didn't remove that
sidebar you'll also have an extension
buttons here on the left
but view extensions will always work and
in there you can search for Python now I
already installed it but this first pipe
package here is the one I recommend
installing as I said I have it installed
but you'll have an install button here
simply click it and restart the IDE when
prompted to do so now additionally in
this course and this is totally optional
all you see material I can theme here
which simply changes the file icons
which will be displayed in this project
you can all install that but again this
is purely optional the PI flex tension
is one you should install though
thereafter you can go back to view
Explorer now in here you can create a
new file by clicking this new file
button or a new folder with that button
or with command N and here I'll add my
blockchain file the important part is
since we're working with Python it has
to end with dot P why this turns it into
a Python file now let me quickly switch
to my uber icon theme yeah I prefer that
so this is my blockchain Python file and
this is the file with which I'll work
for the next lectures now obviously you
might be wondering how do we execute
that file now and the answer is from
within your terminal in Visual Studio
code you can also go to view integrate a
terminal or use the shortcut which is
displayed there and this will open your
normal operating system command prompt
or terminal automatically navigate it in
to your project folder and there you can
run Python and then a blank and then the
name of the file like blockchain dot PI
people
in this case and it'll execute that file
and in this case it does nothing because
there's nothing in the file but if I
were to for example use print function
which output something to the console if
you're not using the repple you'll have
to explicitly tell python to output
something so if you use print and you
output 2+2 for example and you save the
file don't forget that if you run the
command again you see 4 down here so
this is how we work with files and how
we work with visual studio code as our
IDE and with that let's continue and I
mentioned print is a function right and
we saw that append and pop function Q so
let's dive into functions next because
this will allow us to create a better
block chain
what are functions if we use built-in
functions we get some utility out of the
box some magic happens behind the scenes
which we don't know but which does good
things for us typically but of course we
can also define functions for our
ourselves and function simply allow us
to define code which is executed later
and possibly multiple times and we of
course define when it's executed a
function in Python is defined like this
we use the DEF keyword then the name of
the function then parentheses and then a
colon if you're coming from a different
programming language like JavaScript you
would have the function keyword and
curly braces now Pi uses Def instead of
function and colon instead of curly
braces and now that's very important to
understand it then uses indentation so
some white space to the left you should
use four spaces here too from white or
write the code that will be executed
whenever you call the function now
calling a function of something which is
done like that or like that this is the
multiple times execution I'm referring
to when you define a function so the
first part nests box nothing will happen
Python will recognize that but not run
the code in there as soon as you call it
though by using that function name with
parentheses it will execute the function
and run the code that's in there now
regarding the syntax also note that in
Python not only in functions but
actually entirely in Python you don't
use semicolons at the end of the line
and again you don't use curly braces you
use indentation and you should use for
spaces instead of tabs here however the
good thing is in ideas like visuals to
you keep code you can't actually hit the
tab button and it will enter four spaces
for you so you get that convenience back
to the functions though this is a simple
function here it simply outputs
something now let's actually use that in
conjunction with our block chain let's
start building our
blockchain with the help of functions in
our blockchain dot py code here I will
first of all recreate my blockchain
variable and also as a side note unlike
in other languages you don't have a var
or something like that in front of that
you just type the name of the variable
and this should be a list and actually
it's an empty list at the beginning now
we obviously wanna add values to that
list and for that we can use a function
so we define a function here and I'll
name it ad underscore value this again
is that naming convention which also
applies to functions where you write an
entirely lowercase and you separate
words with an underscore now important
when the finding a function you have to
add a pair of parenthesis and then a
colon and the nice thing is you can
already see the color coding here in
Visual Studio code so Dada support for
the keyword which is marked blue and
your own name which is yellow
if you hit enter now you see it
automatically indents this line so it
helps you with that that's part of the
reason why we use an IDE now here we
write the logic we want to execute when
we call this function and this can be
more than one line by the way now here I
want to add a value to the blockchain
here we see an a variety II feature we
get suggestions on which methods we can
call on a list so it detects that
blockchain holds a list and helps us
with working with it now what to call a
pen here now we also get some
information about what we can do with a
pen and I want to append a value now
let's say we append 5.3 I will now also
add a second line still in that function
I would be outside of the function if I
remove the indentation but if I keep it
I'm inside of the function body and here
I will use a built in function shipping
with Python which is print print is a
function which allows us to output
something to the console and here I
simply want to output the latest version
of my blockchain now we can go down and
I simply enter an empty line to make the
code more readable
and I removed the indentation by using
shift and tap and I can now simply call
add value by using the function name as
well as the parentheses like this if I
save that file and I go into my terminal
I can now execute my blockchain dot py
file with the Python command and as you
see it outputs my list here now if I
execute it again I still only got dead
list so it's not storing that list
between executions because basically our
program runs and then it's done and it
loses its state thereafter if you want
it to persist it you'd have to store it
in a file something we'll also do later
but of course we can go back and we can
replicate or call add value multiple
times and if we do so and we execute
this again
you see our chain grows now right now
we're just storing float values there
though if you remember that slide from
earlier I said that I want to store
nested lists in there which have the old
transactions as well as the new one for
this back in our function I'll actually
append a new list here and that list
holds the new value but I also want to
hold the last value so the last value of
my blockchain here to do this all
reference blockchain as a first value
however blockchain should not be entered
entirely just the last value we have in
there so we need to access a certain
index now index zero would always be the
first value if we do that and we save
that file and I execute Python
blockchain we actually get an error
because we try to access a value which
doesn't exist at the beginning right we
try to enter blockchain 0 when it is
empty at the beginning if we start with
a value of 1 let's say and I reacts
acute this now it works and you see
we're growing and we always have that
value in there but of course we always
refer to the first value now there is a
convenient trick about indexing which
helps us get that last value
so we start working with functions and
we start storing data in our blockchain
by appending a new value and also
referring to the old value now right now
we're always referring to the first
value though which always is a 1 because
that is what we start with if we want to
get the last value of the blockchain
list we actually can use minus window
that's a convenient trick they'll trick
sounds like it's some workaround it's
actually a built-in functionality which
simply X's us to blockchain from the
right so 0 is the first element from the
left but minus 1 is the last element
because we start accessing it from the
right and why not - 0 because there
exists no such thing as a negative 0 so
minus 1 we could also use minus 2 to use
the second last element but minus 1 will
actually now give us the last one if we
save that and I run that code again you
see now what we have is we got our
blockchain here in the last line where
we have 1 and the new array with 1 &amp;amp; 5
free and then we're nesting this fervour
and fervor as you can see because we're
always referring to the last element of
our blockchain and the last element will
always be a nested list now actually for
that reason we should also wrap that
starting one with another pair of square
brackets so that this is a nested list
too now with that if I clear this to
make it easier to read here we see how
we now execute our code we always add an
additional level of nesting because if
we access the last element in the second
add value call we get this result
because here the last element actually
is this list so when we append a new
value to our blockchain we take the old
blockchain which is this part and then
we append the old last value so this one
we appended as the first element in that
new array we're adding remember we're
adding an array here
square brackets this is what we append
and then this new array where this new
list actually also has this value here
at the end and for the last add value
call this is the part we're starting
with and then we're appending a new list
hence the outer squared brackets here
and in that new list we have 5.3 as a
new value this.value but then we access
the last value of the old blockchain
which is this value here and this is why
you now see this value with free opening
and one closing square bracket in here
so this is the same value as this up
here and that simply is added because
it's last value of the old blockchain so
this is the logic we have right now each
new block we add contains the old data
as well as the new data the problem we
of course is the new data always is the
same
it never differs it's always 5.3 so it
would be nice if we could actually
manipulate that and tell the function
here to use different values
we learned how functions can work in
general one nice feature of functions is
they can do much more than what we
previously did they can receive
arguments this means that in our
function we can expect arguments
parameters between the opening and
closing parentheses next to the function
name and we can use these arguments
inside of the function like that if we
then call the function we have to pass a
value for that parameter and this is
then dynamically injected into the
function so this would actually print
hello max here now let's apply this to
our block chain in add value we can add
an argument and you can name that
argument whatever you want like Val or
value or transaction amount something
like this and you can use that value
inside of your function body not outside
of it it's only known inside of it so we
can use that like a variable name here
and add it here instead of 5.3 and we
could have Corozal use that in
calculations or in any operations we
perform on it so this is my transaction
amount here and now if I save that and I
clear that just to make it easier to
read if I execute the file we get an
error we get an error that add value is
missing one required positional argument
transaction amount and we also see in
the IDE we got these red squiggly lines
the reason for this is obviously add
value requires this data to work
correctly so we have to pass it can pass
to dot nine ten point eight nine for
example and now if we save that file
again and we execute it again now this
works and now you see that our values
are indeed inserted 20.9 10.8 nine this
is now taking advantage of the fact that
you can pass arguments to functions and
if you have a look at this append
function the strange thing
stillest that we call it on a list well
that is something to do with objects and
methods we'll have a look at this later
in the course but in that score is a
function and there you can see we also
pass an argument right we pass the
argument we want to append so append
actually alters a function that takes
some input
we already learned some nice things
about functions but they can do even
more than what we learned this far they
can also return values and what does
this mean here's an example we got our
sum function here and as you can see
this function takes two arguments but
any function no matter if it takes any
arguments or how many it takes can also
return a value with the return keyword
if you use that inside of a function
whatever comes after it is returned
which means that whoever called that
function will get that return value as a
result in this case here we call sum
inside of the print function which will
output the value returned by sum we
could of course alternatively also
simply store the result of some in a
variable by using the variable name and
then an equal sign and then the sum
function call now let's also apply this
to our block chain right now we get one
function which does two things actually
it gives us the last value in our block
chain and then it appends this value as
well as our new transaction amount Q the
unique block chain let's actually split
it into functions so all define a new
function with the DEF keyword and lamÃ©
it get last blockchain value now that's
obviously a pretty long name you can
shorten it but one idea behind Python
really is that you write code that is
readable readable code is really a core
value of the Python community so using
function names like this is actually
perfectly fine this function will not
take any arguments still requires a
colon of course and what we'll do in
here is we'll return blockchain minus
one so this will do the extraction for
us what this simply means is that in
this function here we can call get last
block chain value now arguably that got
longer but from a code reusability
perspective here we got cleaner because
now each function has only one chopped
extract
and a pent well actually this function
still all the prints it but besides that
it only has this one job and we can
remove that print statement of course
and simply print the blockchain at the
end once we're done so with this we got
two functions now and now it's all the
convention that we should have q empty
lines between our function definitions
this is something from the official code
style guide I will tell you more about
that guide at the end of this module in
visuals to your code you all's got a
nice tool if you go to code preferences
keyboard shortcuts and there you search
for format you will find that format
document shortcut find it to anything
you want
and with that shortcut you can
automatically format your code in a way
that it follows the official style
guides so that's a very convenient so
now we got two functions here if I now
clear the console and execute my script
again you see we get an error here but
the reason for this simply is that I
accidentally deleted the opening square
bracket I need to keep this because that
last value I'm extracting should still
go into a new list so if I save this and
we now execute this again now we only
get one output because I only got one
print statement now but here you see
it's still extracting the old list and
inserting this here and then also this
one into here so this is still working
but now split up over two functions with
the help of the return keyword
returning values is pretty neat now
let's go back to arguments though you
learned how you can use function
arguments when additional nice feature
is the fact that you can also use
default arguments this means you can set
up a default argument which will be used
if you call that function without
passing the data for that argument
remember previously we got an error in
this case with default arguments this is
actually something we can do without
errors here's how it works
we get a function definition with the
greet function this case again and now
the H part here actually is a default
argument we provide a default value for
it 29 then we use it in our function and
the interesting part of course is when
we call the function you see I actually
don't pass a second argument without a
default argument we would have to do
that otherwise we'll get an error but in
this case it works fine without it
let's also use that in our blockchain
example we have a good use case for that
with our starting value here let's go
back to initializing the blockchain as
an empty array now clearly if I now
clear that and execute my code we get an
error because with get last locked-in
value we try to extract the value which
doesn't exist now let's fix this by
using a default argument here an add
value I'll use my or my add my last
transaction value and this is now
actually what I will append as a first
value in the new block last transaction
now what I can do is I can of course
pass that as an argument to my add value
call now I do that by for example
passing get last blockchain value get
last locked-in value and don't forget
the opening and closing parentheses now
if I do that what we provide for the
first add value well I can provide my
starting array here so what we
previously added
directly to our blockchain definition up
here with this code if I run it it'll
work fine and it'll give me the exact
same result as before but we're not
using default arguments here and
actually we can improve our code by
doing so the default obviously is that
we want to get the last blockchain value
so it would be nice if we could still
use add value like this but obviously if
this gives us an error as my IDE shows
so what we can do is we can go into our
add value definition and add our default
argument by adding an equal sign after
the argument name and then the default
value in this case this function call to
get last blockchain value if when I
always save this and I execute the file
again this unfortunately doesn't work
the reason for this is it still executes
that even if we do provide a value and
therefore it still executes that for the
first add value call where we have no
last value so we'll have to fall back to
the second pass solution will provide
our one here so this one array as a
default value so that we can omit it
here for the first add value call and
unfortunately we'll have to use the
longer wish for the subsequent add value
calls but still we now got a different
way of making sure that we don't run
into this below error and we're taking
advantage of default arguments something
will of course also see a lot throughout
the course so now with that if I clear
this and now I execute that file it
works again the second best solution as
I mentioned but also just one of the
many examples you'll see throughout the
course
now we're almost done with functions but
here's one last nice feature you should
be aware of and Dad our keyword
arguments no what's that again it's
actually not that difficult
we got a function with two arguments
name and age here's what happens in the
function we just output it and now with
keyword arguments we can actually alter
call a function like this in our
function call we use the name of the
argument name and H and an equal sign
and then the value we want to pass
normally if you don't refer to the names
in the function call the position
defines which argument receives which
value the first data you pass goes into
the first argument the second day that
goes into the second argument of course
with keyword arguments you can switch to
position or also omit some argument
after which another argument comes which
you don't want to omit for example now
let's also add this to our course and
let's take advantage of positional
arguments by simply reversing the order
for this second add value call so Onam
use get last blockchain value as a first
argument now of course I can switch it
like this I'm not using my names here
and if I execute this on the first sight
it looks like it worked but of course it
didn't work we're actually now adding
our values incorrectly for that second
add value call which is the reason why
here we have 0.9 as a first value and
the old blockchain as a second value
instead of the other way around which we
normally want if for some reason we
wanted to call it like this however we
can do this with the named arguments or
with keyword arguments how it's
officially called we can say or we can
pass that information to the function
which data should go into which argument
so I could say hey this should actually
be the last transaction by using last
transaction equal and then the value
that should be put into it and this on
the other end here
is the transaction amount although with
a equal sign and now with this if we
repeat that it still works but you can
already see there's a difference this
now is the correct blockchain again and
not the wrong one so here we're now
taking advantage of keyword arguments
and this is everything you need to know
about functions right now how you define
them in general that you can pass
arguments that you can return data that
you can provide default arguments and
that you can use keyword arguments which
simply means you use the argument name
when calling the function and you got
greater control over which argument
receives which data therefore
so we're working on our blockchain it's
slowly taking shape but wouldn't it be
nice if the user could actually enter
the values we want to append so let's
add a functionality for that we can't
get the user input with the help of a
special built-in function the input
function this now allows us to provide a
string remember that's a different data
type some text which is presented to the
user and then the user enters something
in hits enter and whatever the user
entered is put back into our code so to
say so we could say your transaction
amount please like that and we could
store that in T X amount DX for
transaction now we could then use T X
amount here as the value we store please
note that I don't replace it for the
outer function calls for now if I now
save this and I execute this file you
actually see down there the execution
stops it's not printing the final
blockchain instead it's executing this
code where we're prompted for the
transaction amount now I can enter 5.99
if I hit enter the execution continues
but you now see that this was entered as
text though because and that's something
you have to memorize whatever you pass
into your code with input is treated as
text and we learned how we can convert
it to a number do you remember you can
wrap it with int to convert it to an
integer but obviously we want to support
floating-point numbers so we can wrap it
with float and now we're able to handle
user input with just text as a float so
if we repeat this and I now enter 5.99
again now you see there are no quotation
marks anymore now it's really stored as
a number now obviously we don't just
want to execute this once once you
execute this before every transaction
here so before every add value call
for this we fetch a new input before
every call with the input method and we
store it in the same variable all the
time and of course we should then use
that variable in our add value function
so now if we save that and clear and I
execute that file again I am asked for a
value like 100 then 99.9 and 4.8 and
once I'm done you see the 100 also
present in the old value of course the
99.9 and for the date they're all stored
in our blockchain now we're doing one
thing here which we should avoid though
the one thing we're doing which we
should try to avoid is we are actually
always repeating ourselves we're calling
that same code we're executing the same
code three times here now we should try
to minimize the code where we repeat
ourselves and to be honest this will
become easier after the next module
where we learn how to loop through code
and therefore repeated automatically but
one thing we can already do is we can
define a new function with the DEF
keyword which is get user input
I don't expect arguments here and then
the function body I'll simply execute my
input statement and already converted to
a float like this now obviously the
value we get here is not useful inside
of our function so what can we do we can
return the value and by doing so we can
simply store it in T X amount thereafter
get user input like this we're still
repeating ourselves to be honest but
again this is something we can fix after
the next module but at least it's
shorter code now and we outsource the
core functionality the input and the
float method here into you a separate
function which we now call and where we
store the result which is returned with
return in a new variable which we then
pass to add value and with that we can
execute that file and we're again
prompted for some input here and as you
can
see this still works ass before but we
get leaner code we're repeating
ourselves less and that really is
something you should take with you try
to minimize or totally avoid repeating
yourselves and we're again using a
function this time again with the return
statement
we're almost done with the module we
learned a lot about functions and now
also how to handle user input there's
one important concept which we already
used but which I want you to understand
though and that is the scope of
variables and what do I mean with that
we get global and local scope now what's
global scope if we define a variable
directly in our file so on the root
level so to say not inside a function
like here then we can use that variable
anywhere in that fall we can use it an
agreed function and we could also use it
outside of there a local variable on the
apprehend is a variable only available
inside of a function this would include
function arguments or variables which
are defined inside a function like the H
variable here using this variable
outside of that function would actually
fail let me show this to you back in our
code we get that block chain variable
here we define it at the very beginning
of our code and most importantly we
define it outside of a function doesn't
matter that we define it here at the top
of the file well our our code wouldn't
work but theoretically it would also be
a global function if we define it down
there however the important part is as
you can see we can absolutely use that
variable inside a function because its
global we can use it outside of it as we
do here when we are printing it and we
can use it inside of a function like
we're doing here
now on the other hand local variables
are seen here for example transaction
amount and last transaction now these
are obviously arguments of our function
but in the function we use them just as
variables if we try to output our
variable outside of a function though
that won't work so if we try to output
transaction amount here after our first
add value call so it certainly is
populated with a value if we do that if
I execute the file and I enter 10 you
see thereafter I get an error that
the name transaction amount is not
defined the reason for this is that is
indeed is not defined because it's not a
global variable it's not defined in the
file itself it's only available in that
function the same would be true for the
user input by the way if we create a
user input variable in which we store
the user input and then we simply return
that here this will continue to work
we're just using an in-between step
maybe to make it easier to read but if
we now output user input here well
you're probably already guessing it but
if I repeat that execution and I enter
some value I also get an error on that
name user input is not defined because
it's a local variable only available
inside of a function this is a key
concept you also have to be aware of
variables defined in a function be that
by doing it like this or as the argument
are only available in that function or
the other hand global variables are
available everywhere
in your entire file here now there's one
important thing you have to know about
global and local scope and I'll show
this in the repple first of all we can
define a function there too with the DEF
keyword like print name colon and if you
had enter you see three dots at the
beginning you can now hit tab to indent
and write your function body here and
here we can of course use a local
variable like name Max and thereafter
indent again print name and we can
obviously as you know you get out of the
body here by hitting Enter twice you can
now call print name like that and you
see max
now that's not that new now let's say we
have a name here again max and this now
is a global variable because it's not
defined inside of a function then we
define a function maybe get name and
here we're prompting the user for input
and we want to store that input in the
name variable so name input your name
like that so this will store whatever we
enter in the name variable and
thereafter
outside of the function I first of all
execute getname to get that input and
after executing it I'll print name so
first of all let's hit that and let's
enter Michael so a different name then
is stored up here so Michael my case and
then I'll call print name if I hit enter
we see max the reason for that is that
if you use a variable in a function and
you assign a value to it and that always
happens if you use a single equal sign
like this so variable on the left and
then equal sign and then whatever you
want to store on the right if you do
that inside of a function it will always
by default create a new local variable
it will not store it in the global
variable even if such a variable with
the same name exists if you want to
force python to do that so if you want
to force it to actually restore this in
the global variable instead of creating
a local one there is a special keyword
you can use and you have to use so if we
quit this clear on the windows this
would be CLS by the way and then we run
Python again to go into the rabble let's
again try this named Max global variable
and then let's self define our function
get name like this indent and now the
special keyword is global and then the
name of the variable name and just like
that you don't immediately assign a
value but you just tell - hey there is
this global variable please if I use
name in this function use the global
version of that of course if no such
global variable exists you'll get a
problem so let's now enter and indent
again and now we can again use name
input your name like that and now this
will actually use the global name
variable because we're telling it to do
so here so now if I hit enter again and
I quit this function if I now call get
name here and I enter Michael now and I
now print name you see now it's Michael
and not max anymore because thanks to
global name
this actually targets the global name
variable instead of a new local one
who we covered a lot of ground in this
module you learned a lot about the core
basics now we'll continue diving into
the basics a great place for you to all
to dive deeper are the official docks
which you can find on python.org make
sure to pick the dot free at the free
dot x docks and there the tutorial is a
great place to learn all these basics
again numbers strings lists these are
things we learn about now if and so on
these are things we'll learn about in
the next module so you may jump ahead if
you want but there actually is no reason
to do so something important or
interesting I also want to show you from
the official docks are deep apps though
but what's that if you go back to
python.org and hover back over
documentation and you go to Pep index
you'll find a list of all the Python
enhancement proposals these are
basically documents articles giving you
hints about how you can write your
Python code how you should write it new
developments in future pile versions
things like that now if you scroll down
you'll find the index of all the peps
and you'll find a title about well what
is covered in that pet now very
important tab is this one here pep
number 8 contains the style guide for
Python code click on it you find useful
information on how you should style your
Python code now you don't need to learn
that by heart but scanning through it is
definitely recommended you'll learn
things like that there should be two
empty lines between function definitions
that you should use spaces instead of
tabs which visual studio does by default
and how you should name your functions
and variables that lowercase thing with
the underscores between the names
I'm already teaching you a good style in
this course but there also might be some
features we just don't use in that
course or which you're not sure if you
remember them correctly so therefore
pepp 8 is a great place to dive in and
learn more about these styling d our
paths can be interesting but I recommend
not going too deep into them they can be
really confusing and they're not
official documentation they are req
nations they are proposals if you want
to learn the chloral C language watch
the scores of course and fall back to
the official Docs for deep dives
now one thing you'll also find mentioned
in the paps is how you comment your code
and that is something we didn't have a
look at yet you can create comments in
Python by using the hash symbol like
here we could say initializing our
blockchain list comments should be used
to improve the readability of your code
but one core principle of Pi in all's is
that your code should be readable on its
own so you should have clear function
and variable names and your code
actually shouldn't need too many
comments I'll still add quite a lot of
comments also outside of these videos
for the code which you can download so
that it's easier to understand for you
but in general not many comments should
be required this however is one way of
commenting a common technique also is to
sometimes comment out a certain value
like this if you just want to test
something without that being defined now
here it just doesn't make sense but
you'll see this occasionally throughout
the course there also is a other way of
commenting it and that are so-called
dark strings these are essentially the
multi-line strings you learn about with
the free quotation marks you use them
for example at the beginning of own
functions like this free opening and
free closing quotation marks and
in-between you comment your function
like returns the last value of the
current blockchain the cool thing here
is most IDs actually picked this up now
by default this would be a normal Python
string it's not an official comment but
it also doesn't do any damage to your
code it kind of emerged or it simply is
the case now that we use this syntax to
comment our own files or our own
functions so we can reuse this and add
this to a function and now when we call
get last blockchain value or if we use
this in the IDE we actually get support
as you can see if I hover over this here
you see the text which I entered above
so that's very handy especially if
you're writing code
shared with other developers and this is
a good practice to comment your own
functions like here append a new value
as well as the last blockchain value to
the blockchain and docstrings are
typically all written in a way that you
have a first summary sentence and if
it's on a function like here you then
all doer should add something like
arguments and the exact style is up to
you I'll use digital arguments then I'll
use a colon but this again is really up
to you and the name of an argument like
trends action amount and then a short
information about that argument the
amount that should be added and we get a
second argument last transaction the
last blockchain transaction we can also
add default 1 now the advantage of this
clearly is that whenever we use add
value we get that information and if
we're not the creator of that function
this of course is very helpful when it
comes to us understanding that syntax
and this is also why we get highlighting
for example for input here we also get
some help in the IDE well because the
input is implemented like this and
because it also has a dark string
now let's therefore complete our
commenting exercise here but also adding
something to get user input returns the
input of the user new transaction amount
as a float try to be as precise as
possible so that if our developers were
to use your code they can understand
what's happening so these are comments
added for general readability and to
help our developers as well as
docstrings also added to help other
developers but also as a general good
practice to make your code easier to
understand and read
now when working with Python you
sometimes end up with code that's
relatively long now for example this add
value line here is a bit longer or this
talk string here now for the dark string
you can easily add a new line by simply
hitting Enter because you can write
multi-line text with triple quotation
marks so that's no problem with our code
so with non common code you also can
break lines if you're in a list like
here the arguments you're passing you
can add a new line by hitting enter
after the comma and this will still be
valid code now I press the autoformat'
button in my IDE you can find it in the
key bindings under preferences keyboard
shortcuts and there if you search for
format it's this format document
shortcut and then you see it ordered
this a bit differently it made sure that
the arguments are beneath each other it
would work otherwise too so if you have
it indented like this it would still
work but that's easier to read hence
that's the formatting it applies but
this is something you can do if you want
to structure your code in such a way if
you want to avoid long lines which you
should in this course though I will
typically try to put expressions and
code into one line because once this can
lead to you being required to scroll to
the right a bit I believe it helps
understanding what belongs together
which expressions work together so that
is why I tend to use one or two lines
only instead of splitting everything
across multiple lines but you can do
that so that's just a side note so that
you don't wonder why I use relatively
long lines we're scrolling can be
required you have the opportunity of
splitting that across multiple lines if
you want to
so that's actually it for the module we
learned a lot about Python we learned
that we structure our code with
indentation and colons for block
statements like functions we'll all to
learn about different block statements
in the next module we learned that we
create functions with the special death
keyword and we learned that in general
we should follow PAP eight when it comes
to styling our code from a feature
perspective in this module we learned
about the core datatypes
numbers which comprises integers and
floats strings as well as boolean s-- we
also had a look at operators we can do
some base or medic with plus minus times
and by dividing values but we also have
the modulus operator which allows us to
get the remainder of the division we got
the floor division which always returns
an integer instead of a float we got the
power operator to calculate the power of
a number to some other number and it's
important we all learned that strings
can be added and multiplied
multiplication only works with one
string and one integer though it also
doesn't work with floats by the way we
had a look at lists and we learned how
we can create lists with T squared
brackets that we can add items with the
append function that we can access items
with their index which starts at 0 and
that we can use minus 1 to get the last
value and that there are other list
operations like pop and so on we saw
them blink up when we used the list in
the IDE for example now also important
we had a look at functions we learned
that indentation and colons define the
function block that we can use arguments
that we can return values that we can
also use default arguments which allows
us to omit arguments when calling the
function and that we can also assign
values data to arguments by their names
so called keyword arguments where we can
reorder arguments or skip them provided
that they have a default value now last
but not least we also had a look at
scope there
is global scope for variables defined
outside of functions and local scope for
variables to find inside of functions
and this is actually it now what about
our blockchain status
we got a chain of data we got a list of
data of course only a basic
implementation it's no complex data yet
but we'll refine this throughout the
course we're able to mine new blocks and
that of course is also something which
will improve throughout the course but
now mining is a big word for asking for
a user input and additionally all in a
basic way we're able to hash our blocks
we always got this previous data in the
next block now we're not really taking
advantage of this we're not really able
to analyze our data based on that but
it's a nice first step and this of
course is all something we'll improve
now there also are some things we
haven't even had a look at but hey it's
still only the first real module of this
course so let's continue to the next
module and learn more about the
blockchain and of course most
importantly about Python
