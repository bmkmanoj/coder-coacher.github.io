set up the CSRF protection which is a
very important piece of our application
but now I really want to create a new
user so let's get started with that I'm
in the project where I left the last
time and I will handle all the user of
indication so sign up and log in with
another package called passport passport
so I will install this here also if the
save flag passport and I will need two
other packages I also need a package too
and crypt my password so I will use all
with the safe flag bcrypt no chase for
that and I also want to add a package to
have flash messages and abled in my
application which are basically messages
stored in the session which are then or
can be shown in the view and their after
they are deleted from the session so
like if you were watching my lateral
videos you know it from the validation
errors which are displayed in the view
if we got any and well otherwise they
are and so this possibility to attach
messages to the request to render them
in the view the package I'll use for
this is the connect flash package and
with that I get quite a lot of packages
installed I'll go to my app J's file and
work with these packages for example
Passport I'll require this here this
again is the package used for really
user management user authentication
login SIA and sign up and so on and also
the flash package from connect flash and
then in the middle where initialization
process here after initializing the
session here and the ordering does
matter
I'll initialize flash which
needs the session to be initialized
forest since user sessions so that's
important and thereafter I will
initialize passport with the initialize
method and I will also set it to use
sessions to store the user so there for
this reason this also has to be after
this session initialization and with
that I'm good to go and use passport
with these flash messages however this
really is only the first step
because passport doesn't ship with all
functionality we need here out of the
box box because it doesn't know which
fields or user has email and password or
username and password or whatever so we
have to implement a strategy for
passport to use now there are packages
with predefined package predefined
strategies where we then only have to
adjust certain parameters or define how
the user should be created but the
general strategy has been laid out so I
will use the local strategy in this
application which basically means
locally on this server that's where the
name comes from stored the user so
created with email password whatever you
like but store it on this server other
strategies could be Facebook so use
facebook login or anything like that
there are tons of strategies available
and if you want to learn more about them
simply google for passport strategies
strategies and here in the documentation
of passport you may go to strategies
over here and there you see a bunch of
strategies you may choose so as you can
see there are a lot however I'm going
with the local strategy as explained
earlier so back in my project I will
install it or on the NPM install save
flag pass
word local and this allows me to
configure this strategy to my needs to
configure this I will create a new
folder in my project which I will name
config and in this config folder I will
create a passport JS file and this is
the file where I want to set up my
passport and the strategy I use for this
I will first import passport here too
and now here's an important thing to
understand if I require passport here in
this file and I pry relie set it up in
this app chase file here of course
currently I'm not requiring this config
file anywhere but this will follow but
if I you import passport in two
different files the configuration I
apply in one file for example here in
this app.js file where I initialize it
and so on will be available in the
availab file so I'm not setting up two
different instances or anything like
this I'm working with the same one that
is important to understand in passports
case here so back in the config file I'm
importing passport I also want to import
my user model so I will require this
models user and then I want to import
this strategy just local strategy so I
will require this passport local and
then here the strategy object okay
so this is the setup are the imports I
need and with this I can configure
passport now the first configuration I
want to use here is the Syria lies user
function which will basically tell
passport how to store the user in the
session so this takes a function
with the user as an input and then the
done callback which password will
execute once it well is done and in here
I will use I will simply return done
null and then user ID which basically
means whenever you want to store the
user in your session serialize it by ID
so use the ID of the user which of
course can be retrieved I also need to
define the opposite that I want to
deserialize the user I'm missing an eye
here here I'll also pass a function as
an argument with the ID of the user
which I know is the argument or the arm
user property by which I'm serializing
the user and then I can say user using
the user model find by ID so in the
Mongo database here using Mongoose then
pass the ID which is stored in the
session and then I have my normal
callback where I either get an error or
I find the user and I want to return
both things here in the done function so
the first argument when returning done
is of course always the error case
therefore I'm setting this to null here
when I'm serializing the user and here
I'm even returning the error in case I
got one or well the user if this was
done successfully so this allows
passport to store my user in the session
or store the ID in the session and
retrieve the user whenever I needed
through this stored ID so that's a key
part but we're not really creating users
yet right so let's do that for this I
will create a new strategy and I will or
a new middleware for this I will do this
using the use method on passport and
then I will name this local sign up so
this will be my sign up strategy which I
use when I want to create a new user I
will create a new local strategy for
that
this local strategy here this
constructor takes two arguments the
first one is some configuration in form
of a JavaScript object and the second
one will be a callback so the
configuration first I want you tell this
local passport package that my user name
field and these are of course keys this
package expect it expects to get so by
which I configure this package so that
my username field is email in my case
this could of course be username if you
were using that but I'm using email and
my password field is password I also
want to pass the request to recall back
so pass request to callback true which
means that in my callback here I first
get the request so that I can use it
there too I also get the email and
password entered and then this done
function again which I can use in the
end to tell password hey I'm done
everything's working hopefully so in
here I can then use my user model to
find the user or basically with that I'm
checking if the user already exists and
I try to find the user by email by the
email field which should be equal to
this email provided and then here I'll
have a callback with either an error
error or the found user now if I got an
error then I want to return done with
that error so I'm not successful if I
don't get an error but I find a user
well then I'm successful with this query
with this database query but it's not a
good case because then I'm trying to
create a user which already exists or at
least with an email address which
already exists so in this case I will
also return done with no error since
nothing went
on here but of course also not with any
retrieved object but instead with as
aford argument a message where I say
email is already in use this later be
this flash message stored in the session
which I can output in the view so here
I'm by setting this to false here I'm
not telling passport that this was
successful I'm telling a dodn't that no
error appeared but it's also not
successful instead here is the reason
why it was not successful this message
so if we pass both checks so we didn't
get an error and the user does not exist
yet then I can create a new user by
using my Mongoose model and I will set
the email address of this user to email
and the password - now here's the
interesting question - password I could
do this but that would not be encrypted
certainly not what I want so this is
where I come back to the part I was
talking in an earlier video about in my
user model I want to create some helper
methods to allow me to easily encrypt
the password for this I will first
import bcrypt which is the package I
installed a couple of minutes ago which
allows me to easily hash my password and
then I add some methods to my user
schema using the methods object here and
then I simply come up with some names so
I will name my first one encrypt
password and this will be a function
where I expect to get a password and
inside of this function I will simply
return the hashed password using bcrypt
than the synchronous hashing here and
I'll pass the password into this
generate the salt for this um hash so
generate this synchronous two and I will
use five rounds of salt creation here
and null as the last argument and with
that I'm creating a encrypted password
and I'm returning this so I can use this
encrypt password method to get and
encrypt the password and I will also set
up another method here so also at this
two methods named valid password where I
will also pass in a password and this of
course the method with which I want to
be able to check if a password matches
the hashed password so for this I will
also use bcrypt since I can't just
rehash it and then compare both hashed
password because they will differ that's
the idea behind this hashing here but
bcrypt can use the knowledge that knows
T algorithm used and so on to check if
the two technically different but still
the same passwords are equal so then I
can use to compare method here compares
synchronously if this password matches
this password and this year of course
refers to the password of the current
user on which we're running this so this
refers to the user on which this valid
password method is executed and you will
see this later so with these two helper
methods in place I'll go back to my new
user creation and I will replace
password here with new user and crypt
password password
I can then save this new user and I will
provide my callback here and if I get an
error then I want to return done with
the error but otherwise I will return
done now so no error and with the new
user so that has been quite a lot of
work but with this the user is finally
created with the strategy I can create
the user now the question that remains
of course is how to apply the strategy
so in my index.js file in the route here
and the post route where I create this
user I will no longer redirect to my
route route to my slash route instead I
will replace this whole function here
with passport and then authenticate and
this middleware which will take a word
or request takes the strategy at chest
you find local sign up of course this
one year and then some configuration or
JavaScript object where I can tell
password password that I want to have a
redirect in the success case so if we
are signing up successfully then I want
to redirect to let's say slash profile
otherwise I want if the failure redirect
I want to be redirected back to sign up
and I also want to flash a message here
so fade your flash true and this will
flash the message I'm setting up here
using this connect flash package I just
installed a couple of minutes ago
so if that that is all set up but how
does password
know this strategy because I'm setting
it up in this password chess file in the
config folder and I'm nowhere importing
this folder the simple answer is
password doesn't know it so currently
this would not work
back in the app chairs file I will write
after initializing Mongoose therefore
required this package so config password
and I don't need to bind it to a
variable I simply want to load it which
will automatically run through this file
and give me this configuration set it up
so execute all these methods here and
there for setup password of course I
could copy all that code here and just
dump it into my app chest well but that
would quickly blue or bloat this this
file and I don't want to use that there
from outsourcing this in this file so if
all that in place I will restart my
server oh and I want to want do one
thing before I do this I want you add
the profile route here so that I can
actually get redirected to it if I'm
successful
so router get profile and here I simply
want to render this profile page and
just to see that this works output user
profile on that page so now for restart
this I'm getting an error as I can see
let's see what is this passport is not
defined well that's certainly sad to
hear maybe I should do this
so passport require passport and also
I'll reorganize my imports to have my
own files or my own yeah imports you're
below the packages so with that if I now
restart my server this should hopefully
work and let me reload go again to the
signup page and I'll try this the
problem of course is that I should
redirect to users sign up and user
profile here so restart this again
so so user signup let's try this again
and I get redirected redirect to user
profile but I can got a note found error
because this route here is false so if I
do this and now I reload this would work
so as you can see the sign of signup
would have worked just a little routing
error here and you can also verify this
by going to your um
Mongo pin folder here and run the Mongo
shell client then I'm using my shopping
database here and if I go to my users
collection show all users you can see
this newly created user I just created a
couple of seconds ago so the user signup
is working what's not working is if I go
to my signup page again outputting
validation errors so let me quickly add
this here for this I'll go in my next s
file to the get user signup or out here
and I want to extract possible messages
I would could have by using a request
flash so possible reflash messages
stored in my request through this flash
package and then they would be stored
under error if they come from Passport
so the message I'm flashing here is not
stored under message but in status is
just telling passport that this is a
message I want to pass but it is stored
under error so I can retrieve this like
this from this flash package and then I
can also pass this to my view so
messages should be messages here in my
view I can then simply go here where I
have my validation errors placeholder
and enter handlebars here so little if
statement check if we have
masa Ches but how can I do that well
back in the index.js file I also need to
pass another field here I will name it
has errors since in handlebars template
that can only check on single properties
I can't specify equality conditions for
example so here I will pass has AZ
errors if messages length is greater
than zero otherwise we don't have any
messages so we have no errors so if we
do have errors I will go back to my
setup page I check this by running if it
has errors this newly created variable
I'm passing to the View and then inside
of this if condition I'll create using
bootstrap a little dev here and inside
of this div I want to loop through all
my error messages I might have of course
I will only have one here but I think
you get my point
and I simply output it here so with this
if I restart my server reload the page
here test which is a take an email
address you see a mail is already in use
so that's not happening that's taken
care of
however we still would be able to create
a new user with an invalid email address
like this one and I'll take care of this
in the next lecture see you there
