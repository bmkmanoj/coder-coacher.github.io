going to connect our angle Q or view
chess front-end to our level back and
see how level and what your view chess
can work together now we created our
level back end in the last video now
it's time to create our angular 2
front-end and to connect it I got a
brand new angle to application created
with the CLI I only removed some content
in the app component which we have there
by default a daddy dave here with the
idea app and stat and then the
index.html file I added this import you
get bootstrap to get some basic styling
now with that what I want to do is I
want to start by creating a couple of
components so I'll use the CLI for that
and generate or just G a new component
or just C and then we'll need a quote
component for an individual quote in our
list of quotes so that's something I'll
create then I'm going to create a quotes
component holding that list of single
quotes and I'll add a new quote
component to be able to create a new
quote guess what so that gave me those
free new folders there I'll quickly
remove these spec files could have also
just a TC like command but whatever and
with that we get our base well skeleton
aware the files we need for now let's
fill them with some life
so in the app component HTML file I want
to use the bootstrap grid and for that
I'll create a new dev with the class
container then row and then call XS 12
to have a 12 column broad well column e
or I guess a full-screen column
basically on all devices on all screen
widths and in there I want to place a
router outlet that we haven't added the
router yet we will do so there soon so
this will be the place where I want to
render already quotes component with all
the quotes or the new quote component
and for this to work I'll copy this row
here at a horizontal line and in the top
row I won't have the router outlet here
when I want to have some links instead
so here I will have a link which leads
to the quotes and one which allows me to
add a new quote so to switch between
those two pages all set up so there I
will add your router links as soon as I
created the routes that is my first page
here didi app component for now and in
the CSS file
I also added this app or this this
little style here for the wrapping
container with the idea of app to give
it some margin to not sit on the edges
so this is the app and just as a side
note I will of course also add the
finished app as a download to this
project individual description now with
this setup let's go to the code
component to create a single quote here
I'll add the panel class which trip
gives me and then also the panel default
class to make a default panel to just
have this quote well stand out a bit and
just have a nice border and so on and in
there I'll leave the LED panel body what
I want to output the quote content well
quote is some object I haven't treated
as a property yet but I will do so in a
second and I will have a panel body
there too now in the panel body and
these are all just bootstrap classes
keep that in mind
in the panel body I want to have a
couple of links to added save and so on
but I'll come back to this let's work on
the quote here I'm referring to some
quote property which I haven't added yet
and this quote property seems to have a
content property so it seems to be an
object because it makes sense I guess
we're creating quotes each quote will
have an ID and a content so why not pack
it into an object and for this I will
create an interface to have some kind of
blueprint of how a quote should look
like in my angular 2 application so I'll
create this quote
face dot typescript file in my root
folder and in there I'll simply export
not a class an interface which will then
quote and here I'll define that I will
have a content of type string and an
idea of type number that's all this is
my quote interface and this now allows
me to go to my quote component add this
new quote property which will be of type
not quote component just of type quote
self this newly created interface
therefore I also need to add the import
up here so this gives me the code object
code property here in the individual
quote component of course I want to have
more than one quote I want to loop
through all the quotes so time to go to
the quotes plural component here to the
template of that component to be precise
and use our app quote selector the
selector of this single quote component
as set up here and loop through it so
add an NG for loop do you loop through
all the quotes we got here referring to
the quotes property which of course I
haven't created too so let's add a 2d
quotes component here simpler quotes
property which is of type quote also add
the import here but not a single quote
instead a quote array so now the quotes
component get a property called quotes
holding an array of quotes following our
blueprint as setup in the quote
interface now if that I can live through
all the quotes outputted here and well
therefore create a couple of quote
components one for each quote we're
getting from the server talking of
getting well let me also add a
horizontal line above the list and a
button which will receive the button
button primary classes bootstrap classes
to get quotes and here I will call a
method called on get quotes once you
click on it this will allow me to reach
out to the server and fetch all the
quotes well now with that we get the
basic setup for
adding quotes and keep in mind we
already get one code in our database
because we created that quote in the
last video when we created the backend
so no need to hook up the added delete
and cell buttons and the the add new
quote page that's not needed instead
let's see if that works
as it should if we're able to get quotes
now for it I will still need to set up
the routing though because I already
want to set all the pages up as they
should be in the end or at least the
structure of the pages so add a new file
the app dot routing dot TS file and in
there I will treat a new constant named
app routes this name is up to you which
will be of type routes holding all the
application routes here and this is just
an array of objects as you probably
learned in one of my other videos or
some other resource in the internet and
here I will have a path and I need a
empty path for my route route for the
default route and here I wanna load the
quotes component and I will add a second
route don't forget to add those imports
by the way the second route will lead to
the new quote path and as the name
suggests he rebel load the new quote
component also add that import and of
course also make sure that if you're not
using the CLI you manually add all your
quotes to the app module to the
declarations array so with that the
routes are set up now let's export the
router the router module here import
that from angler router to for route a
Prout's to make them available and go to
the app module and add it here in the
imports array routing great so make sure
to add the import to your app routing
file to with that routing is set up and
with that we would always be able to see
that but right now might change again
I'm not sure I also need to set the type
for this exported cons there in the
routing file and this is of type module
with providers which
needs to be imported from at angular
core I'm not sure if this is intended
because normally types could should be
able to infer this from well there's
Roger module for root method but right
now I need to add it to not get an error
so after saving this should now
recompile I got these server already
running and now we see looks good this
is the get quotes component of course
you don't see any quotes because we're
not reaching out to the server yet this
is what I want to work on next so to
reach out to the server I will create a
new service for this I'll name it quote
service
it'll also place it in the root file
root folder excuse me and export this
quote service class I'll add D at
injectable decorator here to make sure I
can also inject services into this
service because I need access to the
HTTP service to default angular to HTTP
service which are there for import from
at angular HTTP now I will add a get
quotes method here and simply return
this HTTP GET and now my URL which is
either localhost if you haven't mapped
it to a different domain or since I did
map it here on my system it's level ng
to - view death / API / quotes this is
the API endpoint we set up in the last
video in this series on our level
back-end to get all the quotes I also
want to map the response to transform it
and for this to work I need to import
rxjs /rx to unlock this map operator
here I know I get a response of type
response responses imported from at
angular HTTP and then I can simply
transform it so here I want to return
response dot JSON and now if we have a
look at the
response we got back when using our
level back-end or our API endpoint with
postman let's have a look here you see
we get back this javascript object where
we then have a quotes property which
actually holds the array of quotes and I
just see we did delete it so we will
have to create one to see it again but
the issue or not the issue but the
important thing to recognize is we're
storing the quotes under a quotes
property therefore here when we're
extracting this and mapping it
I should access dot quotes on the
extracted body we're extracting the body
with the JSON method but then again
quotes to really get that array of
quotes and return this and the map
method so with that I'm getting all the
quotes now it's time to go to the quotes
component here where I loop through them
and create individual quotes and somehow
hook up this get quote or get quotes
button so on get quotes was the method
name I set up there so let's add this
let's also inject our quote service so
private quote service of type quote
service here also add the import and
also of course added to the providers
array in the app module quote service to
make sure it is available the angle to
injector can create it and with this
setup back into quotes component with
the service injected in on get quotes
which is fired when we click that button
I want to reach out to my quote service
get quotes and this of course is an
observable so I'll subscribe to it and
here I know I either get my array of
quotes this is when we have a successful
response and I'm mapping it so here
quotes whoops this is just quote of
course my blueprint here and then I want
to use this array of quotes and we could
either also log it to the console or
simply set our quotes property up here
equal to the quotes we're getting back
and we could also of course get a
response which is an error type response
which our import here from a Tingler
HTTP and well here I simply then want to
lock this to the console so that we can
investigate what's going wrong so
omelette code quotes is hooked up in the
best case we're fetching the quotes and
populating our quotes property we're
then looping through all those quotes
and replicate the single quote component
but there's one important thing missing
we're not passing the quote to that
single quote component in that quote
component we have a quote property but
this can't be set from outside so may
let's make it settable by adding at
input here at input in front of it
import input from adding lock or now we
can bind it from outside and now in the
quotes component here in the template I
can bind to quote with square brackets
using property binding and I want to
bind to quote I'm looping through here
so now quote here between the square
brackets refers to quote property in the
quote component I'm sorry I know there
are a lot of quotes and the shouldn't
here and D quote here between quotation
marks in my quotes components of plural
refers to be quote in the loop so if
that I'm looping for all the quotes and
passed individual quotes a quote to the
single quote component here and with all
those quotes going on we should be able
to now see that in action now since we
deleted all quotes in the last video
let me quickly create a new one by
sending a post request with postman as
shown in the last video to D slash quote
API endpoint make sure to set the right
headers here content type application
jason and body raw here let's quickly
create a new jason document content will
be some quote so let's send it
quote was created indeed so let's get it
here we see it here now let's see it now
running application well we don't even
see a running application do we this is
an issue kind of related to this issue
with the routing where I needed to add
module with providers I'm not sure if
this will stay or will be fixed if it's
a bug or a feature right now in the code
service I need to be very explicit about
what this get quotes method is returning
and this of course is observable
wrapping anything so you need to add the
import to observable from rxjs and make
sure to be explicit about what you're
returning here this generally is a good
practice but again since we are
returning an observable here normally
type scripture be able to infer this but
I'll add it here with this save we
should see that our application now
loads correctly and now let's hit get
quotes well I don't see any quotes let's
open up the console and here we got an
error that no access control allow
origin is present what is that this is
something which is a security feature in
general it's called cross-origin
resource sharing we're having two
different servers talking to each other
here our angler queue application here
runs on localhost 4200 as you can
clearly see and our back-end clearly
runs on the lateral ng to view death
domain which is a different server this
is not the same it's both on localhost
but localhost for have 4200 using port
4200 actually it's a different domain
then localhost whatever port dis uses
behind the scenes so both runs locally
kind of well this even runs in vagrant
here so it's kind of different but even
on the same machine a local host with a
port is not the same as localhost with
no port or some other port so two
different domains and this is a typical
problem you'll encounter in such
application
where your front end is served from a
different server than your back end
normally it's not allowed for both to
communicate because it's kind of fishy
if some other fronted at some other
content wants to access your back-end
but we're living in 2017 now and there
this is absolutely normal because we
have a lot of applications which simply
expose some API endpoints for different
apps to connect to them and therefore we
can fix this and we will fix this in the
next video because fixing this setting
up the ability for our front-end app to
XOR back it up when we have different
servers is such a key thing that we
definitely need a separate video for
this as it's very interesting and
something you will need in a lot of
different and every use case is to so
see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
