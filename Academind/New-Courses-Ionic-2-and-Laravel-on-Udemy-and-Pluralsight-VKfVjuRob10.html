now I'm not going to lie this video is
basically a promotion for my new udemy
course and my Pluralsight courses I do
of course believe that those courses
aren't that bad and might be beneficial
to you and that is also why I did place
a link in the video description which
gives you a significant discount on the
udemy course which is about ionic 2 now
ionic 2 is a pretty hot topic because it
allows you to create an app a web app
with angular 2 and then compile it to a
native app running on real iOS or
Android devices though natively on those
devices which means you install it there
it's not a web app anymore this is the
new udemy course and I will also cover
ionic 2 on this channel starting in a
few weeks probably a few very few weeks
so there we will have a basic course if
you want to dive super deep into it
right now this course is for you it has
more than 14 hours we're going to build
for relapse and with real I mean more
than just a to-do list we're going to
use the native features of a device like
the camera or getting the current user
location the device storage we will see
how to handle user input how to use all
those beautifully styled components I
only choose ships with which allow you
to create beautiful apps and much more
so I really believe it's a good course
would be great to see you there
totally different topic if you're not
into ionic to not entering or to but you
are into you'll arable well obviously we
got a lot of content on this channel on
bearable and I think this content is
really good to get you started if you
feel you need even more and you already
are on chloral side or you plan on
taking a plural side subscription my
getting started with lateral courses
here the basics course auntie models and
data course here might be very
interesting to you i'll soon also
publish a course on authentication now
i'm not going to lie you can basically
get most of the information i have
condensed in those courses from all the
videos across my account or across this
youtube channel i should say but these
courses are very to-the-point and they
use the latest version of level so if
you already are employers that why not
have a look now enough of the promotion
if you stick that long
also happy to again highlight or
emphasize that I am going to create
content on ionic 2 on this channel soon
that before doing this I will finish
this serious about level and angular or
the UJS and then I will also add
authentication to this serious though I
might start with the ionic 2 app kind of
simultaneously in a few days or weeks
we'll see and that is really I think a
lot of content which I find very
exciting and I'd be happy to have you on
board
so hopefully see you in those courses if
not that's totally fine see you in all
the other videos I got coming up on this
channel then and those videos as always
are not taken from those courses they
are produced brand new for this channel
which is really important to me so see
you in those videos or the courses bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
