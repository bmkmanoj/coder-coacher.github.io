series on my channel this series is all
about react.js and after this series
I'll have a second series which is all
about reactions and redux so I hope
there's something for everyone let's
start right away with the very important
question what the heck is react Cheers
why would we need it and yeah what is so
awesome about it well what is react is
as the name suggests it's a JavaScript a
library or framework you might say and
what can we use it for what's the
special thing it offers us well let's
think from a different direction how
does a webpage you look like it probably
looks a lot something like this it has a
lot of components on it and components
are something if you will following my
channel well you know it from angular 2
right there are a lot of components
there too and the reason for this simply
is that webpages can be split up into
components really well you might have a
header sidebar main area and in the main
area you might have a list with several
list items and so on and react.js takes
this concept or builds up on this idea
of splitting your webpage into
components and allows you to build such
components with JavaScript reusable
components which you can then use
throughout your webpage and which for
one hold the HTML code but additionally
in that of course is very important and
why this ks's at the end it not only
holds the HTML code but also some
JavaScript logic which allows you to
listen to user actions to display
content dynamically to update the UI
whenever you need to update it without
having to reach out to a server and
fetch a new view therefore react.js is
often used as the V in an MVC pattern so
ask the view and it is a library for
creating user interfaces that's what the
official page says and that is what
really is true
that's react.js
a JavaScript library which helps you
create user interfaces well I mentioned
angular 2 before what's the difference
between react.js
and Englert you do they do the same
thing and it's only app 2 stylistic
questions or whatever you like more to
to decide what to pick well there are
differences as I mentioned a few seconds
ago react.js is a library for building
user interfaces views angular 2 on the
other hand is more than that angular 2
is a JavaScript framework which allows
you to build single page applications
and the question of course is what's the
difference the difference is angular 2
out of the box has a router supports for
invalidation and so on angular 2 is
there to control the complete user
experience to control the navigation
between pages to control everything the
user does so with angular 2 you build a
single page application your server only
sends one view and angular 2 takes a
word and handles everything react.js on
the other hand can be extended to build
single page applications and there
certainly is nothing wrong with that in
that case it has really a lot of
similarities with angular 2 but you need
to import some extra packages it's not
all built into core react is because
core react is is about building views or
parts of views single components or
widgets which you can then dump on to
your views so react.js could be used in
let's say a level application since I
have a lot of lateral content on my
channel and Elara Balazs you are aware
you have multiple views in most
applications at least and you could
still have multiple views and use
react.js on all these views because in
one view you need that wicked witch yet
let's say a tap widget and on the other
view
you need a number widget or another
component so then you wouldn't have a
single page application but you would
still use react ES and angular 2 on the
other hand would be kind of difficult to
use in such a setup because that really
isn't what it was made for so that was a
lot of talking but it is so important to
understand what reactions can and cannot
do and where the difference is to let's
say single page application frameworks
like angular to lie with all that theory
out of the way time to continue and
actually start coding right away and
build up a workspace in which we can
work with react.js and then of course
I'll guide you step by step through
react.js and show you how to use it so
