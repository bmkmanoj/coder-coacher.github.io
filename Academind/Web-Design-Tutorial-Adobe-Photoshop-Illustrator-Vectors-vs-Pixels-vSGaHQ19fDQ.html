talked you into this video and explained
why I like doing stuff like this and
mixing it up let's have a look at
Photoshop and illustrator and where
would we use one to will buy the other
and how do we use them we'll consider
all these questions in this in the next
videos and in this video we'll start
with what is Photoshop one is
illustrator why do we use one over the
other now to give you a definition right
away illustrator is for working with
vector graphics whereas Photoshop is for
working with restaurant graphics or
pixel graphics that is the definition
what does this mean let's have a look at
this graphic here it's a green box in a
white box not too fancy but good enough
for this example if we create this
graphic in Illustrator we're trading a
vector and this means we're describing
this graphic programmatically well we're
creating it visually in Illustrator but
will be transformed into code basically
it's very basic code describing this
image now how can you describe this
image well let's start with the green
box we have a starting point which is
described by x and y coordinate so we
have two information blocks here we need
x and y and then we got two more
information blocks we need we need to
know how wide is it and how high so the
length of both accesses so to say and
then we got this shape here which you
can then programmatically complete
because what we got all we need to know
we can't create a rectangle from knowing
two sides right that's basic math so the
computer code is therefore able to
complete this graphic and create the
screen box and the white box is
basically created in the same way
therefore this is a very simple way to
describe this graphic and this
brings us several advantages we'll have
a look at later now let's look at the
same graphic in Photoshop if we're
creating it like as let's say a PNG
image our normal image well before we
had four points if you want to say that
the beginning point described by two
points and then two end points of our of
our accesses now in this case we will
have a lot more points let's say this
graphic is 250 times 250 pixels well
then we would have 250 times 250 pixels
of separate individual pixels we have to
prescribe each individual pixel here
we're not using any math to tell you
okay you start here you end here and
make up the rest yourself
no we're describing each individual
pixel now I think it's not very
surprising that therefore normal images
or raster or pixel images are much
bigger than vector graphics because for
vector graphics we basically only got
four things to remember starting point
described by two points and then where
each of our accesses ends now obviously
it depends on the shape but for a
rectangle only four points and this is
against when using a pixel graphic 250
by 250 points and as a side note I'm
using the word points here even though
technically points it's not the same as
pixels but you get my point I guess so
this is a huge difference in there for
the file size is also vastly different
indeed it is four times bigger for this
simple graphic when using a pixel
graphic instead of well vector graphic
it also brings another advantage to use
a vector graphic it's not only smaller
but we can scale it perfectly because if
we scan risk a graphic app which we
created as a vector graphic let's say
this envelope I can here if we increase
the son size as raster image as a image
using pixels only pixels well then you
will see that it will get blurry and it
it's not looking sharp anymore
now it makes sense that it gets this way
because when we're increasing the size
so the amount of pixels in our base
image to a bigger image that doesn't
increase the size of pixels we have
available we still only got our let's
say 50 times 50 pixels which described a
small image if we want to scale it to
100 times 100 all these new pixels have
to be full somehow but we don't provide
the information on how would you fold
them so the computer has to figure out
how to fold it and basically it does
this with linear interpolation and
therefore it looks this crappy that's a
downside a vector graphic on the other
side doesn't have this problem because
we have our starting point our end
points and so on we describe everything
with a few points and therefore we tell
the computer how to fill out the space
between this we provide a blueprint
which is applicable for tens times 10
pixels images as well as 1000 times 1000
pixel images therefore when we scale up
a vector graphic it looks the same as it
looks when it's smaller we can scale it
perfectly so we get file size and
scalability as huge pros on the vector
side why would we use Photoshop at all
well because of pretty much the same
arguments yeah it might not be scalable
and yeah it might be have a bigger size
but why does it have this because each
pixel is described individually is this
a disadvantage result at all times
no because if we have a complex image
like say a photo we take we need to
describe each pixel we can't describe a
photo as a vector or like you can do but
it probably won't look like a photo we
really take so a real image in our real
life does have thousand shades of
different colors and we need to describe
each pixel independent independently to
really depict this image correctly
therefore pixel images allow us to
create very detailed and colorful and so
on images which vector graphic graphics
are enable to do additionally if
Pixlr is described independently we have
a very fine control over it if we would
like to change one point in a Vectra
graphic we can't do that directly we
have to create that point separately in
a raster graphic we have all the points
described in the penalty anyway so we
can easily change individual points so
we get a much finer control over our
picture and our pixels so in that
development I typically use illustrator
to create assets icons fun show stuff
like that that well is well described
with vectors that needs to be scalable
and so on and that all fits this
category perfectly on the other hand I
use Photoshop to create designs of
websites before I actually coat them
with CSS HTML I set this up in Photoshop
because I like to find control I got
there and overall I find it a little bit
nicer to work with when designing a full
website instead of just an icon or
something like this in this series we
have a look at both we will create our
own assets icons and so on we will of
course to learn the basics about
illustrator and Photoshop for web
development
I'm not going to into yeah this is how
you draw this very great picture that is
not what we are doing here but we will
have a look a very detailed look at all
these things that concern about
development and we'll have a lot of
examples see you in the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
