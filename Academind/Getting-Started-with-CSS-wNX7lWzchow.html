about CSS cascading style sheets we use
CSS on every web page we built and still
a lot of people use things they learn on
Stack Overflow and so on they don't
really know why they're doing something
in a certain way and that limits your
capability of solving problems and
implementing styles you haven't
implemented before this video is a
thorough introduction to CSS and it's an
excerpt from a udemy course I created
together with a colleague of mine in
that course we dive much deeper into CSS
we also dive into topics like flexbox
CSS grid CSS variables fun stuff like
that but this video here already is a
four introduction which probably also
includes some things you didn't know
before so I hope you like it if you
wanna join the full course I'll link to
it with a huge discount attached to it
can be found in the video description
welcome to this module so let's dive
right into it and let's get started with
the basics of CSS to be precise in this
module you will learn how you can add
CSS to HTML to really ensure that your
page looks good and which different
options you have when it comes to that
we'll then dive into how you may set up
CSS rules so after you learn how to add
CSS how you actually write CSS code to
well change something on your page
well then dive deeper into selectors
properties and values because these
things turn out to be important when it
comes to writing CSS rules and finally
besides a couple of other things that
are related to the previous topics we'll
also have a look at how we can actually
resolve conflicting styles so a lot to
cover let's get started
so to get started attached to this video
you find the following false the
index.html file and T favicon dot PNG
Val
now the favicon is only there so that we
have it it's not related to CSS the
index.html file is the important one
it's the first piece of the course
project we're going to build if you open
it with your favorite editor or IDE I am
using Visual Studio code here then you
can see that we get a normal HTML 5
skeleton inside of that file
I got a doctype we got the HTML opening
and closing tag then we get a head
section where we set some meta tags as
well as a title and since we're building
a fictional web hosting company or the
website of this company we named it you
host and you have the body tag now the
body tag of course holds the content of
our web page and right now it is really
it's just a main tag a section tag and
in there this h1 tag so not too exciting
but we'll add more and more throughout
this course of course this is already
some great code with which we can get
started though which is the reason why
it's there now all these things here are
default HTML selectors and now if we
open that web page if we double click on
that index.html file and we open in the
browser therefore we should see
something like this the exact thing you
see here might differ depending on which
browser you use I'm using Chrome I
strongly recommend using Chrome because
of its developer tools which we'll all
see you later
but this is what you should roughly see
just some text which has actually some
styling it's a bit bigger than the
default text would be it is fat but it
doesn't look super great and there
certainly is more we can do with it so
this is our starting set up and our goal
is to turn this into this
so as you can see what we have here is
some background color of the surrounding
element as it looks like and the text is
then inside of that background and also
looks a bit differently this is achieved
via CSS not wire HTML because HTML leads
to what we see here it's about the
content and the struck
of our page in the end and we got all of
that we got the content there we can
read it this page although it doesn't
have dad many features right now is
fully usable this is super important to
understand it's fully usable so what we
can out do is we can make it more
beautiful and for that we can use CSS
now in the next video we'll dive into
using CSS and I will show you three
different ways of adding CSS code to
this page
so let's add some CSS to this page and
as I mentioned there are three different
ways of adding CSS the first way you can
use is inline styling now let's say we
want to style this section here we can
add an inline style by adding this style
attribute to the section tag DS style
attribute is a normal HTML attribute
which you can actually add to pretty
much any HTML element now you can simply
set a CSS style by now applying a so
called CSS declaration inside of that
style attribute or inside of that string
you pass as an argument I could say
declaration simply means that you define
what you want to style and how you want
to style it now the what is called a
property and here we could say we want
to set the background of this section
now how do I know that there is a
background property as you will learn
throughout the course there first of all
is a list of some properties you
commonly use so you will really see that
you reuse the same set of properties all
the time and it will all show you a
complete reference of all available
properties so that you can really search
for that single property you need for
your case but back to the background as
you might be able to guess the
background property Styles the
background of this section and we could
set it to a value now this is the part
where we say how it should be styled we
assign such a value by adding a colon
after the property and then the value to
which we want to set the background now
which value you use here depends on the
property so for backgrounds for example
we can assign a color there also are
other options like images which I'll
also show later but for now let's use a
color and you can either assign a color
like red just by typing this there is a
set of predefined colors so to say but
behind each such predefined color there
really is just a hex code you can use
and if you directly assign a hex code
you can actually mix or blend any color
you want a hex code is assigned by
adding a hash tag and then the hex code
value for a given color I will show you
how to find out the hex code value later
so for now let's simply add one and I
prepared one which has the hex code ff1
b68 this is a nice reddish color now if
we save this file and we go back to the
page and reload it you should see that
this section now has a red background
and that already is your first CSS code
this is how you can change the style of
an element in this case off the section
now this was achieved by creating a so
called inline style inline because we
use this style attribute directly on the
element where you want to add it and you
would write all styles if you have
multiple ones you can separate them with
semicolons in the same line now this
approach is actually not recommended
because if you create a bigger page with
many styles it quickly becomes very hard
to understand and read your code because
your style is always applied to the
element you want to change if you ever
want to change the style you have to
find that element in your document flow
and this is really hard to debug
additionally if you add multiple rules
let's say you have like 10 different
properties you want to change you get a
very long list of properties you assign
here and that also is hard to read so
there is a better way of writing CSS and
that way actually uses so-called
selectors let's dive into that approach
and then the two remaining alternatives
of including CSS code in the next video
so since we learned that inline styles
are bad let's find a better alternative
I removed the inline style and the first
alternative I want to show you uses the
head section there you can add a special
style tag so it's a normal HTML tag with
the name style and between the opening
and closing selector you can now write
so-called CSS rules now a CSS rule in
the end includes the same property value
assignment we used on the section it
just adds one extra thing because if you
just write background and then your
color here like ff1 b68 of course CSS
would have no chance of knowing what you
want to style with that color you don't
attach it directly to the element so
what you need to add is a so-called
selector selector simply is an
additional piece of information that
tells CSS to which element in your Dom
so inside of your body and the body is
also treated as an element by the way to
which element you want to assign this
declaration so where you want to change
the background in our case you add a
selector by simply typing the tag name
without the lower than and greater than
signs so just section our case then you
add opening and closing curly braces too
now mark the part where you will set up
the rules or the declarations for that
given selector because you can of course
add multiple selectors for different
elements on your page so in our case I
would grab that background code and put
it inside of these curly braces and now
I'm telling CSS and CSS executes
automatically it's run by the browser so
to say I tell it that it should look for
all section elements on the page we only
have one but it would actually use all
and apply this style to all found
instances so to all sections on the page
so if I now save this and I reload the
page we don't actually see a difference
which makes sense because we still style
this element but now no longer wire
inline star
but by directly adding a style in our
template or in our head section like
this now as I mentioned this applies to
all sections so if you add a second
section and we'll need one in our
project later if you add a second
section here and let's say in this
section we have a number h1 tag where we
say choose your plan because later this
will be the part where users can select
their hosting plan if we do this and we
save to file and we reload you see both
sections actually have that style you
also see there is some white space
between them and around them I will come
back to why that is the case later but
now you can already see that selector
doing work you write the rule once and
you select all sections that's another
advantage compared to inline styles
where you would have to add this
declaration to each section separately
and if you ever changed the color you
would have to change it in all these
section styles so that is the better way
for many reasons now there is one other
way of including styles though and that
is using an external stylesheet so let's
do that now for that I'll add a new file
to the project you can create it in your
Windows Explorer or Apple Mac finder of
course or directly in your IDE as I do
and in that new file we will store the
CSS code
hence the file should end with dot CSS
because it contains CSS code the name is
up to you I will name it main because it
refers to the main page of our web
application of our web page but you can
pick any name you want now in that file
you write your CSS rules remember a rule
is this part which is composed of a
selector a property and a value so you
grab that rule and then you put it into
that CSS file without the style tags
that's important we're not an HTML file
so we don't need style tags with that
added we can remove the style tags from
the index.html file and now we can save
both files so we changed index.html file
and a new main dot CSS file if we then
go back to the running page
and we reload it you see the stars are
gone and do you have an idea why this is
happening it of course happens because
in our index.html file we never specify
that we want to use or include this main
dot CSS file and how would our browser
know it doesn't automatically scan our
file system and include every file it
finds so we have to explicitly tell it
to use the main dot CSS file and we do
so by adding a link element so normal
link element as we use it for the
favicon with rel set to stylesheet to
inform it that we're including a
stylesheet here and then you hyper
reference added with the href attribute
should point to that file if that file
would live in a subfolder then you would
add subfolder slash file name but since
it's in the same folder here we just put
the file name so main dot CSS if we now
save that index.html file and we reload
the styles are back because now we're
including the styles through our file
here and with that you learned the third
way of including CSS this actually is
the recommended way because by using an
external stylesheet you can have a clear
separation of your HTML and your CSS
code which is especially useful as your
CSS code grows and would blow to your
head section at some point and
additionally if you use the same
stylesheet in multiple pages let's say
then your browser can cache the
stylesheet and doesn't need to
redownload it for every new page whereas
if you include your Styles in the head
section you increase the file size of
your HTML file and the browser needs to
redownload it since it's part of the
HTML page for every new page which can
be slower that is why in this course we
will use an external stylesheet even if
we only have one rule as in this case
we added the first stars to our website
and this already improved the look a
little bit at least it did something on
the screen but beautiful still is
different I'd say so for one we should
start things like our font we use I
don't think this font is very beautiful
and maybe the color of the text as well
and the positioning of the text in this
surrounding area maybe is also something
we can change so these are the next
things we want to do additionally I also
don't want to use the same styles on
both sections because both sections will
actually have very different purposes
and stalls in our web page so these are
the two things I want to focus on next
how we can change different things than
just a background so how we can for
example change that text inside of that
background or in that element having
that background and how we can apply
different styles to different sections
so let's start with the different styles
thing because that instantly yields a
nice effect let's say we want to change
the font family so the way the font
looks like as well as the color of this
h1 tag now for this what we can do is we
can add a new selector to our CSS file
and in this case it would be the h1
selector because we want to change the
text in this h1 element so I guess it
makes sense to use that h1 selector now
we again add the curly braces and now we
did change the background in the past of
the entire section actually now I want
to change things about that h1 tag about
the text itself and the two things I
mentioned were the color and the font
family now let's start with the color
you change the color of the text with
the color property and again if you're
wondering how I know that by experience
because as I mentioned you work with the
same set of properties a lot and it will
also show you that reference I was
talking about but for now let's just use
color here and let's set a color of
white for now if we save that and we
reload the page
we see all so both h1 tags turned white
which again makes a lot of sense because
with the h1 selector we select all and
not just one h1 element so this is for
now at least one change we did set the
color to something different to white in
our case but there still is more we can
do I was talking about changing the font
so for this we need to change the font
family so you can go to that h1 tag and
add font - family as an additional
property this changes well you guess
that the font family of this texts or of
this h1 tag and now here you got a
couple of choices you can use a default
font family like San serif this is a
special keyword which will use the
default setup in your browser if you
reload the page you see indeed the style
did change now where is this coming from
now for this we should open our browser
preferences in these preferences and
that of course depends on your browser
but in Chrome you get the customized
fonts area and each browser should have
something like this if you click it you
see some custom settings about your
fonts and now here's the interesting
part you also see a standard font which
is used by default that was the font you
saw at the beginning times in my case
then you got a fond with serious if you
are saying I want a serif font or if you
want a censor font it'll use Helvetica
in my case and that of course may differ
on your system fixed width is an
additional default which you often use
for code snippets you always see a
preview of the font below the drop down
at least in chrome so these are the
default settings and you target them by
even not assigning a fun family which
will use the standard font by setting it
to serif to send serif or here this
would be mono space actually but more on
this in a special section later in the
course so for now what we did is we said
to send serif and hence in my case it
uses Helvetica and therefore we get a
different look already now you're not
limited to using
font families included on your system
however send cereth cereth and mano
space are always great values because
they will use the browser default so you
can rely on these keywords picking a
font that looks at least to some extent
in the way you want because you can
ensure it's a sensor for a serif font as
you fall back to the browser defaults
for that kind of font sometimes you want
a specific font though and you can't
rely on that fund being installed on the
machine of the user so to include a font
which is not necessarily installed
already you can use a tool called google
fonts if you search for google fonts you
should find this result here fonts
google.com and on this page you can see
a lot of fonts which you can easily
include on any web page now i already
found one which i want to use for this
project so let's search for anton and
here anton looks like this now you can
add it to your project by clicking the
plus which will open this part here at
the bottom and if you expand this you
see two things an import link which you
need to add to your HTML a head section
and the rule by which you can apply this
font so let's grab the import link let's
go to our index.html file and add it
above our main CSS import here so that
we can use that font in the main dot CSS
file and thereafter let's use font
family look so let's copy that rule and
in our main dot CSS file let's replace
this font family declaration here with
that so if we now save that and we leave
google fonts and we reload the page you
see that the font changed once again
because now we're using that externally
imported font and since we're
dynamically importing it with that link
you can rely on it being loaded on any
machine for any of your users so this is
how we change the color and the font
family this in my opinion improved the
look though it would also be nice to
have some spacing inside of that box and
on the other hand maybe get rid of that
spacing around it and it would be nice
if we didn't share their styles between
the two sections because as I mentioned
they
should look different so that's a lot of
work let's start with the different
styles for the different sections
we took our first steps when it comes to
styling by assigning properties and
values for the properties now the next
step is to ensure that we don't apply
the same Styles all over our page
sometimes you want this sometimes you
want every h1 tag to look the same for
example when it comes to its font size
that's a pretty common thing but
sometimes like in this case you don't
want that semantically we got two H ones
two attacks but they should look
different here now right now we always
like the same section and the same h1
tag thankfully we have more than just
two tag selector switch we're currently
using in CSS so let's see which our
selectors we have we did have a look at
the so called element or tag selectors
there we set to equal styles for all
these elements and it looks like this in
HTML we get a couple of elements and the
h1 tag here would have a red text
because of this rule we select the h1
tag and we assign a color of red now
that is what we saw thus far but there
is more
for example we also have class selectors
classes are something you might have
never heard before because they are a
concept strongly connected to CSS with
classes we can define a style which we
then apply to all elements that have the
same class and a class is added to an
element in HTML by adding the class
attribute as you can see here in this
snippet all the elements actually have
the block post class now the blog post
class is not something which is
predefined by the browser you define
classes instead in CSS the code would
look like this please notice that this
selector is a bit different than the tag
selector it starts with dot and then
your class name and you're free to
choose any class name you want here the
color is then also set to red that's the
declaration and that rule and therefore
all HTML elements that have this class
will get the red text color now
sometimes you also want to set a certain
style for all elements on the entire
page and in this case you have the
universal selector so here's an example
where we have one element without a
class and one with a class and let's say
the top two rules
exist so the only rule B could then add
to turn everything red would be this one
with the star selector you style every
element on your page
and to be honest you rarely use this one
the reason is you rarely want to have
the same style on every single element
on your page there is one specific use
case we'll also have a look at later
though where this makes sense now we're
not done yet though there are two other
kinds of important selectors ID
selectors for example allow you to
select elements by the ID they have and
then apply a style to that one specific
element since an ID only exists once on
a page we only apply the style to one
single element in HTML it would look
something like this here we have an h1
tag with an ID main dialer in this case
the idea of course can be anything you
want and then in CSS you are targeted by
adding a hashtag in front of the ID name
and then again you define the rule so
did declarations for that rule to be
precise and this would turned this text
red in this snippet here now the last
type of selector of main selectors you
have art attribute selectors there you
select HTML elements by the attribute
they have and this again can select
multiple elements
unlike the ID selector which only
selected one here you set the equal
style to all elements with the same
attributes in HTML here we would have a
button with the disabled attribute
standard HTML button attribute you can
set and in CSS you would select all
buttons or all elements with the
disabled attribute by enclosing
the attribute name in square brackets
that's just the syntax
CSS uses and then assigning your
declarations so this CSS code would
assign a red text to all elements no
matter if they're buttons or not which
have a disabled attribute this is a
little bit of theory we will see all
these selectors throughout the course
thus far we only use the element
selector but maybe one or multiple of
the other selectors can help us with our
problem of styling the things we have on
our page right now differently
so back in our code right now we only
use the element selector section edge 1
these are element selectors now I said I
want to have different styles so for
example what we could do is we could
assign IDs to these sections we could
add an ID here to the first section and
maybe name it product - overview the
name of the ID is totally up to you now
IDs are not an attribute which you only
add because you want to style the
element IDs also allow you to add a hash
tag at the end of your URL and the
browser will immediately jump down to
that element in the page so it will
scroll down there so to say but they can
also be used for styling as you will see
let's also assign an ID to the second
section maybe let's call this one plants
because I plan on adding my plans here
so the plans to use remai choose from so
now we got two IDs and this allows us to
adjust our rules instead of selecting a
section and setting the background to
this color I only want to do this for
the first section which has the ID of
product overview so let's copy that ID
name and let's replace this section
element selector here with the hash tag
product overview selector if we now save
both files so CSS and HTML and we reload
the page you see the second one seems to
be gone but actually the text is just
white still so we don't see it but the
first one now is the only one with the
reddish background this already shows us
a big advantage of using different
selectors the ID selector only matches
elements with that ID and semantically
an ID should only occur once on a page
so it only selects this section and
therefore only applies to styles there
now if we want to have a different style
for the second section we could of
course targeted with that plans ID
however for the second section for now I
actually don't want to change the
section as a whole
adjust the h1 tag now there are actually
multiple ways of getting access to this
h1 tag in the second section one way we
can do it is by adding a class to the H
Tagg so let's add a class by adding the
class attribute and let's name it
section - title again the class name is
up to you though I do recommend that you
pick class names which first of all use
the cap up case so where you have lower
case names where the words are separated
with dashes this is important because
CSS is case insensitive so something
like section title written like this
which is readable to humans is the same
like section title like this and
therefore it can be harder to ensure
you're not overwriting class names
hence cap up case is recommended and the
second thing which is important about
classes is you can reuse them unlike IDs
you don't just use them once you can add
them multiple times and a class is
always a good choice if there is a
decent chance of you reusing it
otherwise an ID might maybe be better
though you can always use classes if you
want here I defined my class the name is
up to you and with that we can go to the
main dot CSS file and I'll leave that h1
selector for now but I'll also add a
third selector now with a dot at the
beginning and then the class name this
is a so-called class selector and then
in the rule set I'll add a declaration
where I set the color to another color
here I'll use hash tag to DD f5c and now
recolor I picked an advanced it's a nice
green which will be our main theme color
of this project if we now save both
files CSS and HTML and we reload the
page now we actually see that the second
h1 tag has that green color because we
did use a different selector now on the
slide I showed you there were average
selectors too and we will encounter
these throughout the course too but for
now this is a great first step when it
comes to ensuring that our things look
differently these selectors will use
right now the ID selector the tag
selector and the class selector are
already free very important selectors
which you will see a lot in your CSS
code
in the last lecture we had different
selectors to ensure that our second
section and h1 tag doesn't look like our
first one now maybe there's one thing
you did wonder about we do is set the h1
tag to have a quite color and then we
set the section title class to set a
green color now actually both selectors
here match our second h1 tag we still
have our h1 selector in place here so it
still selects the second h1 tag too it
doesn't stop selecting it just because
we added a class and then the class
seems to override this now you could
argue this happens because the section
title class is to find after the tag
selector and as the file probably is
parsed from top to bottom which it is
this simply overrides the previous rule
you would not appear entirely wrong by
this though actually if you switch the
order just for demo purposes here and
you reload the page you see that these
styling still applies so the class still
overrides
the h1 text style on the other hand if
you quickly assign the h1 tag again and
set the font family back to serif and
not to enter and now you save and reload
you see the h1 tags get changed so the
font did change so the order does seem
to matter but only if you use the same
selector the class still overrides the
color so that's really strange and
there's one additional strange thing if
the class somehow overrides the styling
for the h1 tag so if it still sets the
green color why doesn't it also clear
the font family now we set it back to
serif manually here with the second rule
but even before we did this and it
becomes clearer if we set this to sin
serif like this now it's change to
censor style but not back to anthem now
you can still see this section title
doesn't seem to clear the font family it
clearly overrides the color but it
doesn't reset the font family so it
still keeps that style around so two
things are going on here
multiple rules seem to affect the same
element and additionally the different
rules here seem to have different
priorities because otherwise how would
we explain that this section title class
override z' the color even though it
comes before we set up the other rules
now let's explore what's going on here
and for that we'll use the developer
tools you can open the developer tools
by pressing command option and I on Mac
or f12 on Windows or you open it from
the menu of your browser here I'm
talking about the chrome developer tools
by the way now indie developer tools you
get a couple of options in case you
never work with that if you click on
elements you see your HTML code so to
say and you can select elements by
expanding and clicking there and then at
the bottom you see which Styles are
getting applied to these elements you
can also select an element from within
your page by right-clicking on it and
choosing inspect this also works if the
developer tools are closed they will
open then if they are opened it will
just jump to that element and selected
as you can see here and you can also
pick Dada tool here on the top left of
the developer tools and now click on
element in your Dom to also quickly
inspect it now if we do that on that h1
tag in our second section and we bring
this up a bit here we can actually see
which Styles are getting applied and the
list here has to be read from top to
bottom with the topmost style taking the
highest priority now there you see a
couple of styles are indeed getting
applied if you scroll down these are all
styles that are applied to that h1 tag
you see the topmost is actually an empty
style that would be the inline style if
you add this style attribute to the h1
tag because it turns out that inline
Styles have the highest priority or this
concept is also called specifically to
be precise but then you see that the
class selector section tile appears so
it seems to have a higher specific than
the h1 selectors which are coming below
it you see two h1 selectors because we
got two in our CSS code and if you watch
closely you see the second one
with just a font family since serif has
a higher priority or specific than the
first one simply because it comes second
in the file and the file is parsed top
to bottom but again as already
recognized the section title class
override stem both even though it comes
early in the file but internally by the
CSS specification it seems to have a
higher specific and it does if you
scroll down further there also are some
browser defaults for that element and
these have the lowest priority they do
apply though but you can override them
and that is something we will also do
later so these are the styles which are
getting applied the fact that we have
multiple rules affect the same element
is the cascading part of the name
weirder of the feature we're using here
CSS stands for cascading style sheets
and cascading simply means multiple
styles can be applied or multiple rules
can be applied to the same element now
these rules may lead to conflict though
here for example we got our color setup
in the h1 tag and any section title
class now to resolve such conflicts CSS
knows a concept called
specific and there are clear rules
included in the CSS specification that
define how such conflict should be
resolved and which type of selector has
a higher specific now here's an overview
as I said cascading means multiple rules
are applied to the same element specific
resolves conflicts arising from that
fact and specifically then simply has
the following ordered the tag selector
and also pseudo element selectors which
we haven't had a look at yet but which
we will see in the course have the
lowest priority at the lowest specific
well actually the universal selector
that star has the lowest priority but
you rarely use that so tag selectors
have the lowest one then a higher
specific is assigned to class and pseudo
class as well as attribute selectors so
these free are all in the same level and
if we then have two conflicts here
simply the latter one in the same file
wins just as we had it for the two h1
tags
see us as fall now pseudo-classes are
also something we'll see later in the
course this is something like
controlling hover effects on an element
so if you mouse over it a higher
specifically is assigned to ID selectors
so if an element has attack a class and
an ID selector and they all set the
color of that element the ID selector
would actually win no matter where it is
positioned in the CSS follow the highest
priority however is assigned to inline
styles we saw that earlier but we
shouldn't use them but if you add them
they will actually overwrite all other
styles they have the highest specific
now there are more rules connected to
specific some advanced things connected
to things like inheritance which we
hadn't a look at yet but these rules
here are important to keep in mind
tag selectors have to lower specifically
inline styles have the highest now this
doesn't mean that you should always use
inline styles it just means you should
be aware of this and you should style
your page cleverly by actually using all
these types of selectors maybe without
inline styles though and simply be aware
of how they overwrite each other and
it's actually not hard to work with
these correctly and we will do it
throughout the entire project so there's
a lot of space for you to practice it so
back to code then let's see how this
actually has an impact in reality and
what else is connected to this concept
so we explored specifically in the last
lecture you had that slide where I
showed it to you and with that it's
clear why the second text is actually
green and why it is sent cereth now
let's get rid of that sense serif style
here eh one tag we don't need it I'll
comment it out and if I now reload it we
got Anton back we still have the degree
color because of that specific thing now
there is something else related to all
of that and this is called inheritance
now inheritance means that an element
also inherits some styles of the parent
element we don't use inheritance in our
project yet so let's add it to the
project and let's add it by setting a
global default font so that the text in
our project has a global font I actually
don't want to use ant and for all the h1
tags and therefore to ensure that this
and other texts on the page and we will
add more text have a different font we
should set up a global rule now for one
we could of course add the star selector
to give any element a certain look there
we could set a font family of sin serif
like this and if we save this and reload
well you would see we still have ant on
here because the h1 tag comes second so
let's move to star selector after the h1
tag and save and reload and we still
have Antin because if we inspect it we
see the star selector has the lowest
priority now this actually is something
which would not be the problem here the
problem with the star selector is that
it's very inefficient the way CSS has
now to parse all our elements on the
screen so we will use it but not for a
global font family for Dad you instead
typically use something different you
style the body keep in mind the body
wraps all your other content so if you
set a certain style on the body maybe it
will also change the style of your other
elements so for the body we can set a
font family
and actually I don't want to use sensors
but another Google font so let's quickly
head there and I want to use Montserrat
simply click on the plus again then
expand this and here I'll quickly also
go to customize and add the bold version
of the font by clicking bold and if I
now go back to embed here's the adjusted
import simply grab that link go back to
your project and add it below or in
front of the upper font import and now
we can use that font family or hue so
let's copy that rule
let's close the tap and in main CSS I'll
assign this to my body now if we save
this and reload again no change however
this is a better way of doing this
because it's more efficient and
theoretically it would get applied to
that h1 style here if you scroll down in
the applied styles and you go below the
browser default you will actually see
that inherited from body section and
elements inherit styles from their
parents direct or indirect parents and
not just from the body the body clearly
is no direct parent of h1 but it is a
parent in the chain of elements here and
therefore some Styles not all there are
exceptions but we'll dive into this
later some styles especially the font
related styles are passed down to
Charles
however inheritance has a very low
specific inheritance always comes at the
bottom even below the browser defaults
put in our words styles that are applied
because an element is selected directly
beaded through an element selector a
class selector an ID selector the
universal selector an attribute selector
whenever you directly select an element
this has a higher specific than
inheritance where you don't directly
select an element however if we were to
add a paragraph here in the index.html
file maybe in the second section below
the h1 tag where we say make sure you
get
the most for your money if we add this
and now reload the page and we inspect
this paragraph you actually see it does
have that style being applied it's not
strike through it's not overwritten and
therefore montserrat is applied here and
you can check this by quickly ticking
this style off by clicking the check box
now it changed back two times to the
browser default and now it's back to
monsura so inheritance is an important
concept for passing styles down without
explicitly selecting an element and
especially for things like font sizes
font families this is extremely useful
because you typically want to have one
at the same style for the majority of
your text on your screen and therefore
setting this up in the body section is a
great way as it will then make sure you
can use inheritance again that's not
limited to the Pali section it works
with any parent but if you want to have
it for the entire page the body section
obviously is a great place important oh
inheritance works but any direct
selector has a higher specific a and
therefore will overwrite your
inheritance if it defines the same
property as we do here with the font
family anton on the h1 tag
so we saw the concept of inheritance in
action how can we now ensure that our
choose your plan h1 tag actually doesn't
get the same style as the h1 tag in the
first section in the product overview
now we get that same style we get aunt
identical white color which we arrive
with the class but not the fun family we
get it because of that h1 selector we
can verify this if we inspect that h1
tag the green one here you can see the
h1 selector is passing this font family
I don't want that I want to use the
default one since I want to use to
default there are Q ways of solving this
the first one is that we also go to
section title and set font family to
inherit this is a special keyword which
simply means please use the inherited
style basically you can think of that
increasing the specific off inheritance
for dads specific property only though
this will work since we have section
title on the second h1 tag so if we save
this we can reload the page and now I
actually get a different style here if
you inspect this now you see font-family
inheritors taking effect and that
actually is montserrat as you can see if
you tick it off even though dad seems to
be not used it actually is because of
the inherit keyword but this is not
necessarily the best way if we ever have
another h1 tag which maybe has a
different class but also should use the
default font family we have to add font
family and Herot on that class too would
be nicer if we could do the opposite and
simply say hey this h1 tag in the first
section that should be the only one that
gets this font family instead of all h1
tags by default so instead of excluding
anything that does not get it we should
simply only include this first h1 tag
now of course one way of doing that
would be to simply assign a class or ID
to that h1 tag so we could name this
first section title but that's a really
class name because it's probably not
getting reused so a class might not be
the best choice and if we ever add a
first section we should rename the
second section as it wouldn't make sense
otherwise now we could turn it to an ID
and now the reusing thing wouldn't be a
problem and ID wouldn't be super bad
here but we already have an ID on the
section semantically maybe we don't want
to add one here and still we have the
naming issue so one other thing we can
use as a so-called Combinator a
Combinator allows us to combine multiple
selectors to be more precise about what
we want to select we can add a
Combinator to that h1 selector to narrow
down which type of h1 text we want to
select we can say we want to select any
h1 tag that is inside of an element with
the ID product overview so in our app
that is inside of that first section we
add such a Combinator by or we combine
the selectors so to say by adding the
average selector that matters to us in
our case this ID selector we added in
front of the h1 tag so this can be read
as any h1 tag inside of product overview
and actually h1 doesn't have to be a
direct child
there could be elements in between so
you could have a wrapping div that would
still work I'll quickly add one for demo
purposes if you save this now and you
reload the page you see you got the same
styles as before even if you go back to
main CSS and remove the font family
inherit property declaration from
section title so even if you remove dead
and you reload the page you will see the
second h1 tag still has a different font
because now if you inspect the first one
only this one gets the font family
anthem because now here we have a
selector that only targets h1 elements
that are nested somewhere inside an
element which has the product overview
ID which of course only stick' is for
our first section in our app here now
again the
davia was only used to demonstrate that
it doesn't have to be a direct child we
can remove it and it will of course
still work and what we're using here is
a so-called Combinator because we
combine multiple selectors as a side
note if you use combinators you also
create a higher specific e so if you
still had h1 tag after that let's
reintroduce the old one with sans-serif'
then you should still see that anton
gets applied let me show this to you by
reloading the page if you inspect the
first font here the first h1 tag you see
we still have font-family anton because
our hashtag product overview h1 selector
has a higher specific e as you can tell
by the order in the developer tools than
just the h1 tag even though the h1 tag
comes second
so it comes later in the file but and
that is the last important piece about
specifically the rule with more
information to itself to say and this
has more information because we'd narrow
down which h1 text we want to style the
rule with more information like this one
wins over rules with less information
like this one so the more specific rule
has a higher specific makes sense I
guess also don't mistake this with
inheritance
we're not inheriting a style from
product overview here we're setting a
style only for h1 tags that happen to be
inside product overview it's not the
same as inheritance because this is not
passed down automatically we're
explicitly selecting h1 tags here so
this is the last piece about
specifically and this is what
combinators are now there are more
combinators let's explore them in the
next video
in the last lecture we had a first look
at combinators add one Combinator to be
precise now there are more combinators
for very important ones to be precise
now combinators allow us to be more
clear about our rules and select
elements by passing more information to
the selector now you can combine
multiple selectors not just two as a
side note and as I mentioned you can
combine them with four important types
of Combinator's the first one is the
adjacent sibling Combinator the second
one is the general sibling Combinator
then we have the child Combinator anti
descendant Combinator now how do they
look like
here are some CSS snippets the first one
the adjacent sibling is added by adding
a plus between the selectors you want to
combine and again these could be more
than two you could add more to this list
so it could be dev plus P plus a2 select
anchor tags that are well connected to
the paragraph div but how are they
connected that's something we'll explore
in just a second general sibling uses
the tilde sign here between these
selectors we want to combine child uses
a greater than sign and descendant uses
a wide space this is the one we used in
the last lecture now what do they do in
detail the adjacent sibling selector
simply is to find like this again you
could as for all selectors combine
multiple ones and it simply assigns a
style as shown in this example here we
set a red color it assigns it to all
paragraphs that directly follow a h2 tag
which is why the first and last
paragraph gets the red color here and
the second one doesn't because the
second one follows H free tag which is
in between the h2 tag in the paragraph
and therefore it's not a direct sibling
of the h2 tag the plus requires a direct
sibling ship so to say though and
therefore only direct siblings get the
red color now if you were to combine
more than two selectors so h2 + P + a
then only anchor tags next to paragraphs
that are next to h2 tags would get the
red color so elements have to share the
same parent here that's also an
important
keep in mind they have to be on the same
level and the second element Orford or
whatever you're selecting has to come
immediately after the first or a second
whatever your selecting element the
general sibling selector is connected to
that but more flexible it looks like
this this is the syntax and here's a
code snippet here all paragraphs get the
red color even though the second one
doesn't directly follow h2 tag for the
general sibling it's only important that
there is a h2 sibling doesn't have to be
directly in front of it just a HQ
element on the same level as the
paragraph in this case this is the
general sibling so important thing here
you have to have the same parent and the
second element comes after the first one
but doesn't have to come directly after
it the child Combinator uses that
greater sign and that rule would change
the following HTML code to have a red
color on the first and last paragraph
but not on the one which is nested
inside the article because this child
Combinator says any paragraph that is a
direct child of a div should get dead
style now again you can use multiple row
here not just two you could also say
anchor tag inside a paragraph inside a
div where each element is a direct child
of the other should get a certain style
and that allows you to be very precise
about which choice you want to target
this is not the Combinator we used in
the last lecture because there I showed
you that it doesn't matter if you have a
direct parent or not so this only apply
Styles if you are a direct child of an
element the last one which is the one we
used as the descendant Combinator just a
white space and here the level on which
you are doesn't matter here in this
example all paragraphs get the red color
no matter if they are a direct child's
the dev or not simply because here it
just matters that there is a div
somewhere above them in the Dom so to
say doesn't have to be a direct parent
so the second element is just a
descendent of the first element not a
direct child now this probably is the
Combinator you use most often important
about Combinator's definitely use them
if they allow you to be more precise but
you should be aware that direct
selectors without Combinator's are
showing a little bit of a better
performance that being said it's not
like combinators are super bad and it's
all the matters on what you combine in
our code for example this Combinator
here has a pretty good performance
because we're very clear about the
element it would be worse if we had to
star for example and we're then using an
ID which has awesome performance because
there aren't many IDs on the clinic page
by the way performance for classes is
also pretty great so classes IDs these
have great performance Combinator's
which use them also tend to do pretty
good
so combinators can be really helpful
this one is probably the Combinator you
use most often and they allow you to
really ensure that you only style the
elements in the parts of your app where
you want to stall them so let me comment
this out again and let's continue
in this course module we set some
important foundations about the way CSS
works and we worked with selectors
properties and values now just to bring
this back into memory selectors are
things like div class blog post id main
title the disabled attribute or the
universal selector properties are things
like background color we haven't seen
that we use background it's connected to
that of course though with color margin
display here are also a couple of
properties we haven't used before we
will use them throughout the course
values 10 are things like red
percentages colors and hex codes pixels
or clearly defined values like block
again these are things we will also see
throughout this course now if you're
wondering how do you know which
properties and which values exist let me
start with the properties if you google
for and the end CSS reference or you use
the link you find in the last lecture of
this module you will find this page
where you got a basic explanation of the
CSS syntax and where you then got this
keyword index here you see not just the
properties CSS knows but all the things
like all pseudo classes and elements
something we hadn't had a look at yet
and this is a great way to finding that
specific property you're looking for or
finding more information about that
property you found in the solution on
Stack Overflow but which you don't fully
understand now please here's one thing
you should not do don't learn this list
by heart it's way too long there are
properties you don't use at all and in
the end once you made it through that
course and once you start working on
project with CSS you will see that you
use the same set of maybe 20 properties
all the time and it's really hard to
memorize these so this is a great
reference but not something you should
start learning right now just want to
point you to it so that you do always
know where you can look things up now
what about the values though from one in
the reference I just showed you if you
click on a specific property you also
see how you can config
which values it will accept because
values are tightly coupled to specific
properties you can roughly categorize
the types of values into four categories
though there are a bit more some special
cases but here are the four categories I
came up with you got properties that
simply use predefined options something
like display:block we didn't learn about
this property yet but this simply is a
property it doesn't use a hex code it
doesn't use a number it just accepts a
couple of predefined values overflow
order would be another example then you
have colors they work with red hex code
or a shorter version of the hex code and
also some special color functions
something we'll also dive in later then
we got length sizes and numbers
something like pixels or percentages or
just integers again all these properties
will see them a couple of times
throughout the entire course and last
but not least we got functions something
like a URL where we seem to be using
something different than just a color as
a background or transformation functions
where we can scale or rotate elements
something we'll cover in the
transformation module and of course
there are more values again the
reference holds them all and you will
see way more in this course just wanted
to round this out by letting you know
where you can find more information and
how it is generally works
so that's it for this module here's what
you learned you learned that CSS works
with rules which look like this you have
a selector a property and a value for
the property you learned that there are
different types of selectors element
selectors like age 1 class selectors
with custom created classes attribute
selectors which we haven't used yet but
which we at least touched on ID
selectors with custom IDs and the
universal star selector you learnt that
there are many properties and values
that you can find a complete list on the
Mozilla developer Network mdn and there
are different types of values and we
will explore way more properties and
values throughout the course we had a
look at selectors and combinators so
that you can combine multiple selectors
to be more precise about which element
you want to select you learned about
these four and you learned very
important about inheritance and
specifically you learned that parent
styles are generally inherited though
there are exceptions you learned that
multiple rules can apply to one at the
same element and that specific is used
to resolve conflicts arising from this
multiple rules thing you also learned
that the inheritance defaults can be
changed by using that inherit keyword
that inherit value you remember when we
set font family to a value of inherit
then we override the general behavior
that we would not inherit because of
specific e and we did inherit so dad is
something which can be changed this is
what we learned thus far
now we'll dive way deeper into all of
that and we'll continue working on our
webpage which still doesn't look super
amazing I'll have to admit but these
were very important foundations on which
we can now build up to dive deeper into
the internals of CSS and see how it
works and then also to well continue
working on our webpage so let's continue
welcome to another module let's dive
deeper into CSS and if we were to give
this module a different title it would
probably be working with boxes and after
this module you'll also know why
specifically we'll dive into the box
model a core part of CSS really easy to
understand thankfully but really
important to know to you so that is what
we'll start with well then have a look
at how we can actually change the height
and width of elements we'll have a look
at the display property which helps us
with layouting our page and positioning
elements next to each other for example
and we'll also dive into properties
worth - remember I mentioned that there
is this complete reference of properties
and CSS features which you can always
consult if you want to dive deeper but
they're always a common set of
properties you work with a lot so I want
to share some of the properties I
personally find to be the most important
ones and finally we'll have a look at
these pseudo classes and elements I
already mentioned in the last course
section now we'll learn what they are
and what you can do with them so with
that let's just get started and let's
continue working on our webpage
so let's continue working on this
webpage and I want to continue with this
red block right now it doesn't look
super impressive would be nice if it
were a little bit bigger had more height
maybe some spacing inside of it and also
that white space around it I want to get
rid of that too until we add a
navigation bar this red block should be
the very first element on our page
without surrounding whitespace now we
can achieve this we can add all these
things we can control how the block is
designed or how much space it takes up
by working with the box model now what
do I mean with that every element in
HTML is interpreted as a box by CSS and
you can see that box and the chrome
developer tools if you inspect that
element and again you can really select
any element so here I selected the h1
element now let's pick the section
element but again any would do it and if
you then at the bottom scroll down below
your styles and the inherited styles
you'll see this box this is how CSS
thinks about an element every element
has a content that's the blue area
that's really what's inside of it so for
this section the content actually is th
one tag for the h1 tag the content is
its text so we got that content the blue
area and then we can add a padding now
we got nan here indicated by that - but
we could add a padding which is some
internal space within that section
element from the content queue the next
part the border we can add a border to
each element now we don't have a border
here so we'll add all these things are
just a second of course a border
surrounds an element and directly comes
after the padding which in turn comes
directly after the content now finally
we sometimes also want to have some
spacing around an element and that would
be the margin it's not part of the core
element that and
with the border including the border but
it comes after that it's the distance
you have between that element and its
next sibling for example the h1 element
has a margin by default it's set by the
browser you can see this if you scroll
up to the browser defaults there you
have that strange margin before and
after thing well that's just default
browser margin and there you can see
this element happens to have a margin of
19.9 two pixels to the top and bottom
that's this orange area which is also
indicated on the top-left corner
so here in the loaded page as you can
see already the margin goes outside of
the surrounding section container
because it's not part of the element
which in turn is the content of the
section
now since the margin is no part it's not
part of the content and therefore not
part of the section this is the box
model these layers the content the
padding the border the margin every
element is interpreted as such a box in
CSS now there are two different types of
elements then block level and inline
something I'll cover in this module to
where some of these things will differ a
bit but I'll dive into debt for now
let's simply keep in mind that every
element has these layers now let's work
with that
we had a look at that box model and
theory let's now work with it and let's
work with it by going to our product
overview selector here the ID selector
where we have the background and let's
add a padding of 20 pixels for example
so pixels is a unit you can use in CSS
there are other units like percentages
and font related units too but for now
let's stick to pixels since they're very
easy to understand so if we add this and
save that file we can reload the page
and now we see that there is some
spacing around the text if we now
inspect that section again we can
already see it on the left if we hover
over it that there are different boxes
now and if we now scroll down we indeed
see there is a padding and this time the
padding is even around the margin of the
h1 tag which can look strange at first
since this wasn't considered previously
it's just that if you add a padding then
the content of the element is to be
considered the content plus any margins
it might have because padding and
margins shouldn't overlap hence the
padding is added after the margin of
child elements so here we got our
padding added we can hover over it in a
box model to see it highlighted on the
top left and of course we can also add a
border now let's add a border let's add
five pixels black and solid now this
value might look strange at first to
this way of writing a value we have more
than one value this is called a
shorthand
I'll also dive into this in a second
this is just a shorter way of writing
border-style:solid border color black
border with five pixels but you could
use this notation too if you add this
and reload the page you see a black
border around the element and if you
again scroll down to your box model you
see the five pixels here and if we hover
over it the border gets highlighted in
the top layer
so in the loaded page to finally let's
add a margin to complete the box model
if we add a margin here let's say 20
pixels and we save that and then we
reload the page one more time again if
we scroll down we can see that margin
here and if we hover over it we see that
orange margin around our blocks we still
see some white space to the left and
right and that is something I'll revisit
very soon too but with dead we see all
layers off the box model in action now
there are a couple of special things you
also gotta know about the box model and
default styles of the webpage so let's
dive into these things step by step over
the next lectures
we had a look at the box model basics
with padding a border and a margin and
all these things are of course optional
you can have a padding in a margin
without an border you can't have a
border without a padding and margin so
that's all totally optional and it leads
to that result
now I mentioned there would be a couple
of special things now let's dive into
these special things step by step the
first special thing can be seen if you
inspect the section there is some white
space to the left and to the right so
after the orange margin this is coming
from the body actually if you hover over
the body you can see the body also has a
default margin here rd8 pixels that is
simply coming from the browser defaults
here so what we can do to well prevent
this and to make sure that our elements
go directly into the edges of our page
we can set that margin to zero with that
margin zero command if we do that and we
reload the page you see now the body has
no longer a margin and therefore if we
inspect the section you indeed see the
orange area around it so it's margin
directly connects to the edges of the
page which means there is no additional
space in between so that was the first
special thing that the body has a margin
another special thing can be seen if we
inspect the h1 tag in our second section
in the plans section you see this has a
margin to the top and bottom the default
margin every h1 element has we can see
here it's orange now the interesting
thing is if we also inspect the section
above it so the product overview section
do you see that orange margin at the
bottom of it keep in mind where it was
if I go back to the h1 tag it overlaps
with that section from the product
overview container this behavior is
called margin collapsing it simply means
the following if you got two elements
block element with its box model the
margin is the orange part here if you've
got two elements next to each other then
margins but
Windom are actually collapsed to 1
margin the bigger margin wins this is
not a buck this is on purpose
this is dare or this is enforced by CSS
to ensure that you don't get Q big
distances between the elements now you
could argue hey leave that up to me I'll
take care about that but that's simply
not how CSS works so it is something to
be aware of to work around this it's a
good practice to use either margin top
or margin bottom unless you don't worry
about this collapsing occurring which of
course also can be the case so in our
case we got some collapsing it's not
really a problem because we've got a
fine distance between the elements I
just want to highlight it here so that
you don't wonder what's going on here
now that we had a look at the box model
we also implicitly got a first glimpse
at shorthand properties to be very
precise we already used shorthand
properties since we first started using
background shorthand properties are
simply normal properties that combine
the values of multiple other properties
in a single property the so-called
shorthand property here are some
examples we got some separate properties
let's say border with style and color
this is what we already saw and style is
either dashed or solid let's say now of
course there are other ways to like
dotted you can always find all available
options in the reference in the amnion
reference for that property but these
are the individual properties that allow
you to construct a border if you only
set two of them and omit one the default
for that property will be used which
could lead to no border being displayed
or the border being solid even though
you want it to be dashed well if you
don't specify that the default will be
used there is a shorthand for this
because it's of course a bit more
cumbersome to always define a border
like this for the wave style color
that's a lot to type therefore we got
short hence and the shorthand for border
would look like this it's just called
border and then we simply assign the
values for the different sub properties
so to say the order here doesn't matter
as long as the sub properties don't use
the same type of value which isn't the
case for border for our short hence it
will be the case and I will highlight
this and tell you how to circumvent this
once it is the case so for border we
could mix the order of the arguments
here of the values in whichever way we
want the core is that this will be
interpreted in exactly the same way as
it is on the left another example would
be margin we didn't even use that
notation until now we use the one where
we just had margin colon and then 20
pixels now actually the margin has a
couple of short ends it's always just
margin but you could write it like this
and this would read as top right bottom
and left
so this is a shorter way of setting the
margins for the different directions if
you want to set top and bottom and left
and right to the same you could use this
notation the first value is then set for
the top and bottom margin the second one
for left and right and if you want to
use the same margin on all sides as we
did it then you would use margin with
one value now this will be applied to
all sides these are short end properties
we use a lot of short ends in CSS and I
will always mention them once we use one
or once we can use one again we already
did it for background I'll dive deeper
into what background covers or which our
values are part of background later in
the course once we also add background
images it's important that you should
use short hence if you have the chance
to do so simply because it's cleaner and
shorter code but you can always use the
longer version and what you can also do
is you can define a shortened version
and later let's say in another class
with a highest passivity you could
override one part of that if you for
example want to keep the border color
and only change the width you defined
the border shortened first and then in
the overwriting rule you just define the
border width it will still take the old
set up from the short end and then only
overwrite that single part of it so
that's also a nice way of working with
short ends but again this will all be
something we see in the course
let's quickly see shorthands in action
then as I said we already use shortens
the backgrounds are shortened the
padding actually is a short end it works
like the margin margin is 1 here we use
the longer form now we can get rid of
that and instead simply use border 5
pixels solid black or any other order of
these values the margin here of course
is a shorthand and with that let's
inspect that in the developer tools and
see how they can help us with that if we
again select the first section where we
have padding border margin and
background so where we already have four
short ends in the developer tools you
can always click this tiny arrow here to
see which long form properties are
combined and here you see all the
properties that make up the background
again this is something I'll dive into
later this is simply a very complex way
since you can also use background images
which you can then position with the
various sub properties for solid colors
they don't matter but there you see we
implicitly set background color by
assigning a color to background so this
would be the long-form property named
background color for the padding we see
that this could be split up into padding
top right bottom and left and it works
as I said just like the margin and for
the border we see actually we got a bit
more we don't just have border style
color and width we can even set long
form properties for the different sides
so for the top border we could style
that differently than the bottom border
so this is how the short ends are
combined here and this is just something
to be aware of you can always use the
long form and if you just want to set a
margin top for example it's better to
just set margin top Robert and margin
with the four value syntax and then set
free of them to zero but you can always
use both and behind the scenes this is
what will get rendered
enough about the short ends let's go
back to code I will remove the margin
border and for now although the padding
of the product overview so if we save
this and reload we're back to where we
were well with one difference we no
longer have the margin implied by the
body that white space to the top is
coming from the h1 element now we can
also set something different we can set
a width and a height so on the product
overview we can set the width to 100%
for example to tell it to take the full
entire width of this page now if we
reload we don't really see a change
because that was its default behavior
anyways because sections like divs or
like h1 elements are block level
elements now this is some HTML feature
not related to CSS but it's important to
keep in mind block level elements unlike
inline elements like anchor text for
example block level elements always take
the full available width by default so
with 100% actually doesn't do anything
if we set it to something different than
100% though let's say 250 then we can
see that if we reload this shrinks our
blocks to 50% off the width of the
surrounding container here it looks like
50% of the page width and it is the case
but that's simply happening because the
surrounding container is a main element
which alters the block level element
which therefore has a width of 100% so
50% of the surrounding container which
has 100% of the page width yields 50% of
the page width here cube but the main
element had a lower width - then the
section would only get half of that
so width can be used either with
percentages or of course with absolute
values like 300 pixels this is also
possible and the shrinks the box if I
increase that to let's say 700 you'll
see it gets bigger like that so this is
the width we can set and this will
become important throughout the course
because we don't want all elements to be
100
of the page-width we can also set the
height of course now for the height is
tricky
if you said height 100% and you expected
to now get the height of the full page
well you're going to be said as you can
see it now only got a little bit bigger
the only thing it now does is it
includes the height of the margin of th
one element the reason for that is that
100% refers to the available height
given by the parent container now if you
hover over the main container you could
see well the blue area is much bigger
than the tiny bit our red box grow by
but that area that height of the main
element is calculated dynamically by the
content it holds so it's only as big as
its content requires it to be now that
of course creates kind of an infinite
loop if we say a part of the content
should be 100% of the size of the main
area and the main area says I'm only as
big as I need to be then e1 her sent
basically has no effect if you wanted it
to have an effect you would need to
change the height of the main area too
so if I do this here in the developer
tools which only will change it
temporarily until we refresh the page I
could set the height of the main area to
let's say 500 pixels and if we do that
you can inspect the section here and you
will see on the top left you can see it
that it now has a height of 500 pixels
exactly height we set on the main area
so if we give this an explicit height
then the child if we use percentages
will again refer to that just as it's
the case with the width if we set the
height of the main area to 100% we're
now referring to its parent which is the
body and that again is only as big as it
needs to be so we get the same situation
as before so only if we set the body to
a height 100% - and we do the same for
HTML which is the parent of the body
which is only as big as it needs to be
so now if we set this to 100% on HTM
- now we finally get a red area that is
just as big as our page because now
starting at the HTML element which now
refers to the overall window if we said
hi to one hunt we pass the relative
height of 100% down to that section so
if you ever want to style the height of
an element relative to the height of
your page you need to create such a
chain where you pass the page height
down in the dimensions and units section
later in the course
we'll also learn about a different more
modern unit which allows you to achieve
this a bit easier with words browser
support though but for now this is a
cool trick to keep in mind how you can
set the high to 100% now this is not
necessarily what I want to do here
though I can simply set this to an
absolute value for example we could set
this to a value of let's say five
hundred and twenty-eight pixels if we
now reload disss the size our red area
has I'll also set the width back to 100%
though I could omit this because that's
the default anyways but for now I'll
leave it here so that we have that for
reference so that is how width and
height work in general we can use them
with percentages or pixels or other
units which we'll cover later but
there's actually a bit more to width and
height especially if we consider the box
model let's dive into that in the next
lecture
so in the last lecture we worked with
height and width well that's all nice we
changed the height and width of the box
unsurprisingly but what exactly did we
change when we set the height and the
width that we set the height and width
of the content of the content plus the
padding of the content the padding and
the border or of the content the padding
the border and the margin well let's
take a look let's take a look by
inspecting that section where we did set
width and height there if we scroll down
to our box model what we can see is that
in there we set the width and height of
our box here I'd say the width is
calculated dynamically as we increase
and decrease the page width because it's
set to 100% and the height is to 522
pixels we added in our code but let's
now quickly add some padding back to the
party let's maybe add a padding of 10
pixels a border of 5 pixels solid and
black and a margin of 10 pixels if we
now save this and we reload the page we
can already see one strange thing it
shifted a little bit to the right the
100% width leads to our red element to
go out of the right side of our page and
that doesn't change if we decrease and
increase the page width because it's
already set to 100% so something seems
to be wrong with the width if we scroll
down to our box model again we now see
something strange the height really is
528 pixels for the content the width is
100% of our content Q but now the
padding border and margin add up to that
so what we actually now got is a total
width and height that's bigger than what
we specified and we can see the total
values if we simply hover over it we can
see that the actual width of our element
is 937
and that the actual height is 558 now if
we go back to our box model here in the
developer tools the height was 558 well
if we add up
that's 528 plus 10 plus 10 so 548 plus 5
plus 5 so we set the height and width of
the content and padding and border is
not included into our calculation or is
not part of what width and height target
it is what the browser in the end adds
up to it though which leads to our
element being positioned incorrectly
this happens because all elements by
default happen to have a certain way of
calculating width and height which is
called content box we can set this
behavior by adding the box
sizing property to the element where we
want to change it and as I said the
default here is content box this means
if we set a width and height we set
width and height of the content not of
the entire box including padding and
border we can set it to border box
though now width and height include
padding and border they don't include
the margin and we can't make it to
include that with that set however if we
save the file and reload we still see
that the element goes out of the page
because the margin is not included in
the calculation but if we go down we see
that actually it now only has a height
of 498 because now if we add 10 times 2
for the padding and 5 times 2 for the
border now we end up with the 528 which
is our height which now again targets
content plus padding plus border and
that often is the setting you want to
use it's actually so common that you
often overwrite the styling for all your
elements to always use box sizing
border-box because it's more convenient
to think of the height and width
referring to the entire box without
margin than to just the content now as I
said more
is never included so to avoid that
effect where your element is moved to
the left you simply have to remove the
margin which I guess makes sense if you
want your element to sit right on the
edge don't add a margin off to your
element it makes sense that this is not
part of the width and height so box
sizing border-box
really really useful and as I said so
important and useful that it's often
used as a default style for all elements
anyways and this is also what I want to
do here so we could add it to body and
if we do that and save and reload the
page and go back to the box model hmm we
see we're back in content box world the
reason for this is that we're now
inheriting the box sizing setup but
actually we don't see it here as a
browser default style but because it's a
block level element here by default this
is overridden automatically so actually
our nice inheritance doesn't take effect
because the browser sets its own box
sizing because section is a block level
element therefore what we have to do is
we have to use the universal selector
and that is one of the rare cases where
you really use it if you want to reset
all elements to have a certain behavior
like using box sizing border-box then
you use the star the universal selector
because this is now not using
inheritance it's not using the same
mechanism as setting this on body a head
it's really targeting every element on
its own hence overwriting inheritance
and also overwriting browser defaults
and sets the box sizing to border box
and I will leave this for the entire
course project because I always want to
target content padding and border when
setting width and height so with dad
added if we now reload and go back we
see we're back in a world where our
content is only width and height without
padding and border so that if we set a
width were height we actually include
padding and border in the calculation
so with all that fury out the way it's
time to continue working on our course
project and make sure we take the next
major step when it comes to that and for
dead I'll first of all get rid of that
ugly border get rid of that March and we
don't need and yeah I'll leave the
padding for now I guess so if we save
this and reload this is what we end up
with looks a bit nicer now I want to add
a navigation bar too and for that I
attached a file where you find some HTML
code which will now add to our
index.html file there above the main
section we'll paste in the code you find
in that attached file which is a header
element with some different side of it
with a nav element which then a turn has
an unordered list with list items that
should become our application navigation
this is some typical markup which you
might see in there's four more slight
variations in your webpages here are
some links they all won't work for now
but we'll add these pages throughout the
course and if we save that and also
safety updated may not CSS file of
course and reloaded we got this ugly
part at the top now our goal for the
next lectures will be to turn this into
a non ugly part so we'll add our header
and we can start by simply selecting the
header element itself now of course what
we can do is we can now simply add
header like this we can target the
header element by the element selector
the downside of this is that we might
use multiple headers in a webpage it's
not limited to the navigation the header
element actually can also be used within
a section for example so therefore using
header here is not really the best way
would be better to define our own class
so I'll add main - header the class name
is totally up to you but it should be
descriptive and here I named it main
header because I believe this clearly
indicates this is the main header of our
page not some section header or anything
like that
now this class of course needs to be
attached to the header element then so
let's go to the HTML code and add the
main header class so now the main header
is defined such that we can start using
or can start styling it now which Styles
can we attach here of course any styles
you want but I want to create a header
which spans to full width which has a
green background color as this will be
kind of the main theme color our
application we'll use of course you're
always free to choose a different one
and I also want to give it some padding
so that the text in the header or the
content of the header doesn't directly
sit on its edges now that is a good
practice for you the goal is to add a
background color to add some padding and
set the width to the full page width
these are all things we already
practiced so here's your chance to pause
the video and then do this on your own
and after your unpause we'll do it
together
were you successful let's do it together
to set the width to 100% we simply add
with 100% and this is kind of optional
because block level element it takes to
full entire width anyways but it's still
something we can zit up especially as we
later in the course we'll revisit this
and style this differently where this
will actually become important now
besides that we want to set a background
color
now I mentioned I want to use a green
and maybe you just used green which is
fine but I prepared a special hex code a
nice green I personally like and it's 2d
df5 see of course you're free to choose
any green you want it's the same green
we used for the section title though
finally some padding now here I'll add
up heading to top and bottom and left
and right but I want to use different
values I want to use the same padding
for the top and the bottom and the same
padding for the left and the right but
not the same padding for top bottom left
and right so what we can do is we can
use this Q value shorthand i'b showed
you in an earlier slide and I'll set the
padding to top and bottom to 8 pixels
and to left and right to 16 pixels like
this if we now save this and we reload
the page we got that green header we
also see that our text doesn't directly
touch the edges anymore from a styling
perspective we can still improve this a
bit in my opinion though for example
this unordered list doesn't look that
great and by the way if you don't like
that color edge here we'll also replace
the red color with the image later on so
let's continue with the header though we
made a great first step but the list
items positioned like this that's not
really helpful we don't want to have
lists rendered like that we just want to
use a list semantically but from a
styling perspective all these list items
should sit next to each other not on top
of each other now to achieve this will
actually need to dive into a new
property the display property
let's explore it in the next lecture
I hope you liked the video of course it
ends rather abruptly that is because
it's a course excerpt if you liked it if
you want to learn more out of course be

whether huge discount attached to it of
course and if you already are a CSS pro
I'd be more than happy to welcome you in
