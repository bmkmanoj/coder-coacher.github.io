with this very basic HTML page here
which just has a heading in some text
and in this video now I want to guide
you through the most basic HTML tags
remember this is a tag an opening tag
and a closing tag they always come in
pairs I will guide you for the most
basic tags you need to create a website
from the HTML site remember we also get
CSS and optionally some JavaScript but
we're lonely looking at the HTML outside
and therefore you need to know some very
basic HTML tags you will encounter in
basically every web page you'll gonna
create so I think the best method to get
these tags into your happened - to
structure this is to think about what
kind of things which things do you
encounter on the websites you're looking
at every day so we get some here you're
seeing headings may be of different
sizes so not only h1 tag which is the
biggest heading available but you might
have an H let's say an H free tag so
this is a smaller heading than the h1
tag which might be a subtitle and then
an h6 tag which might be a very small
subtitle just you throw it into the room
so we get some headings the text h1 h2
h3 h4 h5 and h6 we also got text on our
websites we certainly do so yeah we
might use some paragraphs which just
enclose tags plain text longer text
we definitely got some links and now
here we'll have a first example where we
will mix the tags where we will have a
structure consisting of several tags
let's look at this text that's this
paragraph here
let's say we also got an L link save it
and reload our page so we get our h1
heading our h2 heading h3 and here a
link now obviously this isn't a link yet
because all we did is write a link which
is plain text now to make it a link we
need another HTML tag specifically we
need the a tag so oops slash eight this
creates a link opening and closing tag
if we now take a link cut it and insert
it between we almost got a link but we
need one more thing to make it a link
because if you look at it now what
what's missing to make it a link
obviously dine at the destination we
don't specify anywhere where this link
should lead to therefore we need to
define an attribute now attributes are
something we haven't discussed yet
attributes are additions to our HTML
tags to give them additional
configuration and it depends on the HTML
tag which if any attributes are
available for example the a tag has this
wrath attribute for referral which
allows us to tell where should this link
go to now to be able to create an actual
link I'll just use an Internet address
you could also insert or use a local
file so let's say we would have file
indexed
dot html' and we could just enter index
do two dot html' here and if we would
click you click this little link would
be taken to this document but we don't
have it so let's just use a web page and
I'm just gonna use google.com
save it and now reload this page and now
you can see we got a link which is
automatically styled such that is blue
and has an underline now keep in mind
styling can and will be changed by CSS
cascading style sheets and that's why on
most pages you don't see something like
this but a certain corporate identity or
a just a certain way it looks and we
will get into this but for now this is
our basic style I can only repeat itself
so we get this link and if we click it
while we're taken to Google awesome so
we get having's paragraph and a link and
if for this link we had to use an
attribute which is called H Rev and
attributes in HTML are either of this
kind like we have some attribute equals
something between quotation marks or
standalone just attribute without
anything behind it these are the two
possible ways attributes look like and
if you want to know which attributes are
available then really this is your
reference here so if you were to click
on the ADA tag here well we can see the
ref attribute here and it is set here to
the most important attribute of the a
element is the ref attribute but all
attributes can be found here as you can
see there are a lot more than Chester
href attribute but to be honest most of
them you don't need and I will focus on
the most important attributes for now as
only focusing on the most important text
- and I don't want us to get too
complicated and as you can see for
example here quite a lot of these
attributes say not supported in html5
by the way when we're looking at this
this is important thing when you see
something where it says not supported in
html5 that does not mean that if you
were to use something like this it won't
show up in your browser or it would show
up wrong in your browser because the web
consists of a broad variety of websites
and not all of them are written in
perfect HTML
some of them might leave out this
declaration of the document type some of
them might be using all the versions of
HTML some might be declaring that it is
html5 but they're using semantically
incorrect syntax but the browser is able
to cope for all of that because browsers
are written in a way that they are very
error forgiving they can render a broad
variety of older or semantically
incorrect tags as long as they are
actual tags so if something has been an
HTML tag in the past chances are quite
good you could use it today as well even
though it is not supported by html5
which basically just means you should
not use it but it does not mean you
can't use it at all
but you have to live with the
possibility that browsers will drop
support and someday it will break your
your your layout or your website so you
might ask okay well what happens if I
use some made-up attack like if I say my
own tag right I could write something
like this and as you saw my ad idea even
autocomplete did it for me so save it
and reload this page what happens
nothing as you can see it doesn't appear
it's not written as out as tag
and it's not changing anything because
the browser sees that this looks like an
HTML tag but it doesn't know what to do
it with it and that means it just leaves
it out if I have some text between it
text in my own tag this text will still
get rendered the text as you can see
here will not be left out but instead
only the tech doesn't have any effect
that is mostly to the reason that the
web is currently developing in in kind
of the direction that you might be able
reroute some extent are able to define
your own tags and tell the browser how
it should render these tags but that is
far too advanced for for for the moment
and as of now the only thing you have to
remember is if you write anything which
does nexus between dt technical it is
smaller and bigger than sign the browser
doesn't do anything with it it doesn't
print it out a test text but it doesn't
break anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
