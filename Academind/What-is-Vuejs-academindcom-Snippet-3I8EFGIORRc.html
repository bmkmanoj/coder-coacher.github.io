JavaScript framework that makes the
creation of JavaScript driven web apps
running in the client in the browser
easier let's take a closer look we have
the client we have the browser we have a
server we send a request we wizard a
page and we get back some HTML pages
with the content of the page now if we
don't think about the client here as a
desktop but as a mobile phone and we
consider a real mobile app downloaded
from the App Store what do we know we're
recognized about there it's highly
engaging because it has near instant
responses and no page reloads everything
happens really quickly
now what be nice if we could bring that
feeling to a web app queue and there is
one part where you chase can help us to
be precise with just JavaScript you can
already start enhancing the views the
HTML pages you're returning from the
server javascript is the only language
running in the browser after the page
has been loaded so we can use it to
control parts of the page and change
them after the page has been loaded
without sending a new request which
gives us a nice user experience we could
for example control the image carousel
there to swap out images without sending
new requests and UJS can help us with
that that is its main goal it makes it
easier to build these things and we can
also build so-called single page
applications with UJS there we only
return one HTML page from the server and
we use JavaScript to control everything
about that page re render everything as
needed even handle URL changes beauteous
helps us with that and makes that easier
so beauty is is about simplifying stuff
it's a collection of tools and it allows
us to react to events handle user input
update the UI dynamically rerender parts
of the page or the entire page as needed
to output different content if the user
tapped somewhere for example give user
direct feedback and so on it allows us
to create an engaging front-end with
JavaScript without any problems that's
important though for
talking about the front end not the back
end it doesn't run on the server now
speaking of the server we got that HTML
file and if we need to exchange data
after this first file we do this via
Ajax requests behind the scenes and we
could also do this with our servers so
view chess is really there to make our
life easier it's a collection of tools
like jQuery we could do it all with
Anila JavaScript which is the language
we use but UJS makes it easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
