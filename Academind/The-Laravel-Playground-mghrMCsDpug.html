serious just finished the next one is
about to start I would call it lateral
playground because what I will do in
this serious is I will play around with
level do all kind of things it's not a
single project starting at some point
and finishing at some point but this
video format here shouldn't able me to
show you all kind of things you are
interested in so please post your
suggestions in the comments and I will
do my very best to well show you how to
do certain things so if you have
questions like how do we build a comment
section for posts this is something I
could do in a series if you suggest
something like build an Amazon clone
that's probably not something I'll be
doing in this series because that is a
complete project but all these tiny
things you have questions about you're
not sure how to do it you'd like to just
see how someone else does it post it in
the comments I'll have a look at it and
as I said I'll try my best to do this so
I'm very interested in all suggestions
you have see you in the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
