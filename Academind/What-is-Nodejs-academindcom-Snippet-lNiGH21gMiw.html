we have our typical set of a client so a
user using as browser twins our web page
and our server the server and the client
exchange requests and responses for
example HTML pages sent back to the
browser to render and nodejs comes into
play on the server
it's a server-side language based on
JavaScript essentially you could call it
JavaScript for the server side that is
what node.js is you use node.js to work
with files to access a database for
example so connect to database send data
back and forth or in general for your
server side business logic so any logic
you can't or don't want to run in the
clients browser where you of course have
less control and less security so no GS
compares directly to Ruby on Rails PHP
asp.net or Java for example so to all
these other server-side languages you
could choose instead it does not compete
with javascript in the browser because
both uses JavaScript but no J's really
just runs on the server you execute
different things with it you run
different code as you saw in the
previous slide so why and how would you
use nodejs then well for the Y we get a
couple of reasons
first of all you use JavaScript anyways
you use it in the browser because there
is no alternative to it there so why not
also use it on the server and learn some
new things and set off everything
additionally it's really fast and
scalable a lot of big companies use
node.js and we get a vibrant ecosystem
with a huge community in there for a lot
of third-party packages and so on how do
we use it well you can use it standalone
just start writing some notes a s code
it's really simple but of course you can
also use a framework like Express j/s
which gives you a little bit more
helpers and tools to build awesome apps
and in general it's also something you
want to have a look at you can use
next-generation JavaScript features
for writing this note J's code because
you're not dependent on the users
browser and data is what nodejs
is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
