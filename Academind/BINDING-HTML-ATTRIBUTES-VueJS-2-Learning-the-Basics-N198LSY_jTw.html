is awesome because view GS is great in
this video we're going to have a look at
how we can dynamically bind attributes
of elements and we'll also have a well a
little addition to events let's put it
like this so let's dive right into it
this is the application with which I'll
work a very simple application it has a
div with which holds my app with the
idea which I control with this view
instance this view instance only has one
property in the data object which is
named CSS class and an empty string
initially and then I'm outputting this
string up here in my template and I have
an input field where a listen to the
input event but I'm not doing anything
up on well typing the first thing I want
to do is I want to store it text the
user enters into the input in this CSS
class property here I can do this by
setting CSS class equal to well to what
I somehow need access to the value of
this input well in JavaScript whenever
the input event gets fired or whenever
any event gets fired we get a default
event object passed to the event
listener that's nothing view J's
specific that's just JavaScript and how
the Dom works this default event object
we get has in the case of the input and
many other events the target of this
event so on which element was this event
executed for example the target of an
input event would be the input element
where we type something in so we need
access to this target to get access to
the value of this input element now for
that we need access to this default
event object and it turns out in view
che as we can access this data which is
passed through an event like this
default event object we get
automatically by accessing dollar sign
event here between the quotation marks
in our Veon directive now here's
something which is really important it's
not called dollar sign event because
we're accessing this
fault event object the other sign event
is simply a local variable kind of
created by view chairs which gives us
access to which ever data our event
gives us automatically now this data we
get helps to be the event object in this
case but as you might know you can also
create custom events and view chairs
something I'll also cover in another
video now in such a case you can pass
your own data and you would still access
this own data through the dollar sign
event very variable here because again
dollar sign event really only refers to
the data passed by the event to which
you're listening so here this happens to
be this built-in event object and
therefore we can access the target of
this event target is a property D
default javascript event object has and
then the value of the target value is a
property and input element has in
JavaScript so normal Dom property of a
input element and well we know that
event target is an input element so this
gives me access to this value and this
means that now if I type something here
like test we see it appear down there
this is great but do you wonder why I
named it CSS class well because I want
to style this paragraph dynamically I
want to allow myself to input the CSS
class which I want to attach to this
paragraph so I want to choose something
like this I do have my class attribute
and there we could have let's say our
double curly place braces and then CSS
class and now if I had here in the top
right corner in these CSS part if I add
let's say a red class I want to set the
background color to red and I also want
to add let's say a blue class that we
have something to play around with so
here we want to set the player not the
black ground the background color to
blue and what I want you to happen now
is that if I type something here like
red the red class gets attached here but
if we inspect it well oh in
that we got to double curly braces so
somehow this does not work in the same
way as it works here when we use it in
normal text and not inside of a CSS
attribute well that's just how futures
works we can't and we must not use curly
braces here when you well when accessing
a normal attribute when accessing
something else then just plain text as
we do here we instead need to bind this
class property or attribute here
dynamically and we can do so by passing
and it as an argument to a directive UJS
knows it's kind of the same as with the
event here we're passing the default
input method or excuse me event which
exists in JavaScript and in the Dom
we're passing this event as an argument
to devient directive now I need to pass
the class attribute to another directive
this directive is called we bind and I
pass it with a colon and with that I'm
telling view chest
I want to bind some attributes
dynamically on this paragraph item and
the attribute I want to bind directive
dynamically excuse me as class now this
allows me to simply output the name of
the property the value to which I wanna
bind between the quotation marks here
and this of course refers to my CSS
class property in the view instance now
if we reload this watch what happens if
I type read it becomes red and if I type
blue it becomes blue because if we
inspect this we see that as I type here
the CSS class which is attached to the
element changes and this is how you can
bind attributes of elements reactively
with the bind telling view chest
yeah please attach the normal class
attribute that shouldn't change but the
value of that attribute that is dynamic
from now on and we achieved this with
rebind here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
