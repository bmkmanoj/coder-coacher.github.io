on board a few days ago I published a
video where I try to walk you a bit
through that jungle of web technologies
but ultimately I couldn't pack detailed
explanations of all of them in one video
so in this video I wanna share some
sources where you can type in if you
want to learn about something specific
or if you just want to stay updated
about upcoming or future or current web
development trends so let's dive in
together so how do you learn web
development how do you learn about
certain features off the web the first
resource I want to share Rd mdn web
talks MD n stands for Mozilla developer
Network and it's a page not only
maintained viral Siller
but actually the big browser vendors are
cooperating on this and are trying to
make this a really good resource for
learning web development but also for
having a look at that special feature
you just wanted to dive in and it really
is a good resource if you are on that
page you can find a lot of tutorials and
references and dive into certain
technologies now it's mostly front and
orientated here though they have some
noches content too but if you are
looking for resources about HTML
Javascript and CSS this really is a good
page you can check out some basic
tutorials where you can really get
started with web development and this is
a nice way if you like reading through
that they are very detailed and really
good and then you also get references
and you often find this why I googled
Hugh here on the references you can
really find about find information about
all these CSS properties and selectors
about all the HTML text you have
available how that works and a for
example I will actually search this
through their search because they don't
know where to find it if you here search
for HTML elements then you should find
this HTML element referee
so this is just one example a really
good one there you find all the HTML
reference and you can say all the HTML
elements and there you can say hey
what's up with this h1 to h6 tag you get
some information about it here's some
examples and you can always type in
deeper find out what the browser support
is down there and much more so I
strongly recommend playing around with
mdn it is a great resource for not only
learning web technologies but also for
diving deeper refreshing some knowledge
and getting a full reference now it's
not the only resource of course though
if you want to stay updated
I can recommend Twitter now this is my
Twitter account and I'm following a
broad bandwidth of opinion leaders or
people working in the web development
industry
I might not follow all relevant people
but Twitter is a really good channel to
follow people working on certain
open-source projects almost any
JavaScript framework nowadays has a
Twitter account you can follow these
accounts to get the latest news and
updates to be amongst the first to learn
about an upcoming feature a new release
which was well released and so on so
Twitter really good for staying updated
for getting these tweets about new blog
posts which might cover a very
interesting aspect of that framework you
were using over the last days and so on
I got a lot of inspiration from Twitter
and I can only recommend using it now
another great channel is well YouTube
and you already are on the right page
obviously but as great as this channel
is it can't cover everything and it
might not cover what you are looking for
the good thing is YouTube obviously has
loads of channels and besides all these
other tutorial channels which are all
really great all the major frameworks or
tools like firebase or Chrome as I have
it open here also have their own YouTube
channels and you can dive into these to
optionally you subscribe
or you just check out their videos from
time to time and for example here the
Guru Google Chrome developers channel
hosts all the videos from the google
chrome dev summit which took place
well actually still takes place at the
point of time recording this now here
you can get all the talks from the
conference to again learn about upcoming
features or some best practices other
people are applying and get new ideas
and so on
so there is a great source tool and of
course as I mentioned chrome is not the
only channel we have channels for AWS
for firebase for all kinds of things
simply search on YouTube for what you
want to learn chances are you find
abundance of tutorials and also these
official channels and then you get an
average great way of staying up to date
getting some expert in sides getting
some real case studies and getting some
good ideas on how you want to progress
on your Learning Path so this is another
thing I can only recommend YouTube and
as hard as it is all the YouTube outside
of a catamite now besides YouTube mdn
and so on we got so many our great
resources on the web and the best way to
find them is of course by searching so
Google is your friend obviously and here
it really is if you search for something
like here I searched for react
animations you find the official Docs
you find some nice open source projects
I'm gonna get on github and you find
plenty of blog posts all these ran the
blog posts are great resources to learn
things to dive into specific problems
and case studies to stay up to date at -
and there is no single blog I would
recommend here I would really recommend
searching for a given problem or
technology instead and then you will
find fitting blog posts anyways so this
is an hour resource which unfortunately
often is underused but googling for
problems googling for technologies
yields so many great results dive into
these blog posts dive into the official
documentation these are all great
learning resources
together with video tutorials like this
one or courses on udemy or Pluralsight
or anywhere else you got a really broad
bandwidth of tools which are not really
alternatives to each other but which
work great together with each other
you can take a udemy course to learn the
basics to have a guided approach to
learning something and then you can
combine this with you also diving into
mdn reading blog articles and therefore
getting a broad understanding of the
topic you're learning so these are the
things I also use and I hope this was a
bit helpful in helping you
choosing the right source to learn
something and to get an idea about what
you want to learn let me hear your
thoughts on this video in the comment
section can't wait to read them so with
that have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
