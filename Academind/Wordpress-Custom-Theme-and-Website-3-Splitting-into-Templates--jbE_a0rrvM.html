next part of this video series in the
last part we stopped at this point where
we were able to output our posts in a
very simple way just lining them up
beneath each other and now in this video
we are going to add a dummy navigation
bar and it's used Eiling a little bit
and then we will make sure that we
organize our files and our templates a
little bit better so let's get into it
back in our editor you can see the point
where we left and what I first want to
do is add dummy
navigation bar or more the space where
they actual navigation bar will live in
the future at the top of our body
section therefore I just add menu div
some menu links so there won't be actual
links as of now but don't worry we'll
get there soon and now it's time for
some styling therefore let me just add
another section to this document the
main section where our posts
will live working let's do it this way
you don't dis soda to this
well-organised and now it's time to go
into our style of CSS and actually write
some CSS code instead of just our theme
description so first I'll style the body
section a little bit I'll remove all
padding and margin it has by default
I'll set the fall family to take my
vertical area and so serif us last fall
back except the font size to 16 pixels I
wanted to change the font size of our h1
and h2 tag so h1 will have the font size
of let's say 28 pixels and h2 will get
26 I want the main section to have a
margin of 32 pixels to all sides and the
menu bar for the moment will only
receive like background color so that we
can clearly see it background color of
light blue and it should also get some
padding so let's say 16 pixels from top
and bottom and 32 pixels from left and
right we might think we could do is add
just this line of code adding our
stylesheet saving it and then refreshing
our website but as you can see nothing
changed and this is the reason because
in this view here it seems like all we
would have to do is refer to style of
CSS as it's in the same folder but you
have to think of it in a different way
when WordPress displays of hue it uses
our theme but the actual directory it is
in is another directory because
we're running the wordpress application
all we're going to do is fetching some
PHP files but our links here which are
relative links might and will not be
correct there anymore and therefore we
have to use a different technique and I
will use one where we create an extra
file the functions to PHP this is the
file we will need anyway and it's a good
technique to load resources we need so
how am I going to do this I'm just
creating a function within this file
function load the resources and PHP okay
function load theme resources and inside
this function I only call one built in
WordPress function which is wp4
WordPress and queue style now the name
of our style of CSS style of CSS we
leave out the CSS part and then get
style sheet URI so what this line of
code will do is find a style sheet added
to the Hat of our WordPress site and as
we add it is hook here it will get
injected into all sites or pages
provided by our theme so that we have
our Styles available on each of them
okay
now this won't load the function or the
style yet because the function is never
called so we have to do this and
therefore we have to use the built in
WordPress effect on add action which
basically says add this action to your
Kube actions and executed whenever
you're you're there but definitely
before the page is loaded is
she takes is the parameter of the type
of action and it should include and the
strip doing hue is the load theme
resources function now with this we're
ready to go and when we now refresh our
site we should see that the layout has
changed or the styling yeah looks nice
okay now to wrap this video up I'm going
to do something where important I'm
going to reorganize our our skeleton
here are a template that index dot PHP
is our template where we display the
data because right now we got everything
inside index for PHP but we will have
soon but we will soon have different
templates for different parts of our
page for example for our about Us page
you might want to use a different
template then for our block index and
this might defer from our single blog
post template and every we need to split
this app so we have reusable code and
don't have repeat ourself everywhere
therefore I'm going to create free extra
PHP files right now the header dot PHP
will hold our header including the
navigation the footer the PHP will
obviously hold our photo and the content
dot PHP will hold our post content here
and how am I going to do this it's very
very simple actually first I'm going to
copy or cut the part of the content and
insert it into our content dot PHP yeah
now that lets
you define that a little bit fair enough
okay so this is our content dot PHP and
inside our in extra PHP we now have to
tell what press okay the content is in a
different file go fetch it
so in our index that PHP we now have to
tell WordPress where it finds our
content and we do this in AM WordPress
PHP function which is get template part
and we want to get the content because
the files content of PHP and if we now
refresh our web page we will see that
nothing changes and this is good because
actually the content didn't change we
just restructured it so we don't want it
to change right and now we're going to
do the same for the header and the
header will not just include our
navigation yeah but everything of the
beginning of the index dot PHP file so
just from the Declaration of our HTML
tied until the end of our navigation bar
and the footer is just our WP footer
function and I'm going to outsource this
to into a footer that PHP file
so inside our index dot PHP file we now
want to add a PHP function at the top
which is called get Heather don't
mistake that for WP hat this is the
function get header which will
automatically load our header of PHP
file into this file and therefore
obviously it's important that you keep
the declarations
you can't rename your files whatever you
want because WordPress is going to look
for them in a specific order and
specifically header and footer should
maybe should be named header and footer
dot PHP so here we have to get footer
equivalent and again if we reload
nothing should change cool so now we get
this very simple template but I just saw
this should also be part of the footer
because it closes the document so let's
do this
and then reorganize it okay now this is
the state where I'll leave you and I
hope you'll find this interesting to it
in the next video we're going to
actually provide a real navigation bar I
hope to see you soon have a nice day
this is max</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
