in this video we'll actually match an
email address we learned enough to do
that we learned how to construct
patterns how to make sure that we match
a full word and how we create patterns
from left to right so keeping the order
of characters in mind all these things
are important for matching email
addresses so let's dive into matching an
email address in this video
so the goal is to match the email
address I want to match addresses like
test at task.com but also test server at
test comm or something like test tester
at test.com and also with our words so
like test server farm at test comm so
all that should be matched is these are
all valid email addresses now we learn
about the various features for building
regular expressions and we learned that
we read it left from right so that it
left to right so that is parsed left to
right and also that the order of the
rules we add here is important it's from
left to right so we have to order it
from there so let's start by parsing
this simple email address besides the
obvious regular expression which looks
like this which is not useful at all
what we want to do in the end is we want
to allow something which has text at
sign more text a dot and then more text
this is a basic email address rule we
could start implementing and then we can
find unit to also be able to handle
special characters like the dash or
numbers or stuff like that so let's
start with just text for this we can
treat a range and say age you said and 8
you said capitalized should be allowed
as a valid email address now obviously
we want you group multiple individual
characters together so by adding a plus
we're saying there should be at least
one character and then as many
characters as you want we can't use a
star here because that would mean if
it's no text at all it's also valid and
that's certainly not the case we want to
have at least one character now we can
also say this is the first part of our
email address we certainly also want to
be able to handle the @ sign then and
after the @ sign there should be room
for more text so we can basically copy
that first range with the plus and added
and now we're saying any regular
expression which has text and then at
and then more text is treated as valid
now as you can see we should all
consider that dot here and then the
domain at the end now to take care about
the dot we can simply add dot but that
would actually mean match any character
the dot is a special rule so if we
really mean the dot and not any
character we have to use backslash dot
to escape it
which means escape the default meaning
which is any character and use the
original meaning which is just a dot and
then we want to well have more text for
the domain I guess so let's again copy
in or paste in the rule we had before to
match any character so this would be a
basic matching rule as you see it
matches this email address if I remove
the dot it's not matched if I remove the
ad it's not matched and if I remove this
text here it's also not matched we also
see that it doesn't match this and if we
tell it to actually match a full word of
it would actually not match this to you
because there it only matches this
portion well it should match the full
part though so this is not a perfect
regular expression for matching email
addresses because there are a lot of
cases where this will basically treat
something as incorrect even though it is
a valid email address still we are using
the things learnt as far ranges ordering
to build a regular expression from left
to right we just need to find unit for
example here before the @ we want to
allow special characters like the dash
and we also want to allow the 1 so we
want to allow numbers so we can add all
of that to the range 0 to 9 for example
now all of a sudden this is treated as
valid and now let's also add special
characters like an exclamation mark a
hash tag the dollar sign the ensign the
underscore the dash the star all that
stuff you can of course also add the
question mark the Caray
the curly braces the tilde is it cold
like this in English Tildy tilde I don't
know it's dis sign here all these things
well the - we learned that should go at
the end though because otherwise it's
treated as a range generator and now you
could add more special characters but
now you see this also is treated as one
match and as a valid email address for
removed yet here it's no longer treated
as such
so this is already looking good there's
still as some refinement needed though
because if I copied that email address
and now also have maybe test solutions
here it's no longer a valid email
address because we only allow special
characters and numbers in the part in
front of the @ sign we also want to
allow it after the @ sign though so that
we also could have test solutions 90-89
well if we're dead we can of course copy
our updated range from before the @ sign
and replace the range after the @ sign
to target this area so everything in
front of the dot which separates the
domain ending we can simply paste it in
here and now this is all the treat that
as a valid email address if I remove the
dot it's not if I remove the domain
ending it's not to remove the @ sign
it's not so this is already a much
better regular expression because it has
clear rules like yet sign in between
them to domain ending at the end but it
also allows for a broad range of
characters being used which you can use
in reality in email addresses
now this patter still has some flaws
though what if we have this email
address but we don't have test - server
but test dot server which also clearly
should be a valid email address this is
then treated as incorrect it's not
grabbing this part in front of dot and
therefore if we would say hey it should
have we one single string which is
completely matched this would fail so we
need to include the dot and we can do so
in our first range which allows
different characters by adding a dot
here inside a range we don't need to
escape it
if we add a dot inside the range it's
not treating this as any character but
as the dot character itself the dash is
the only special character inside a
range which has which has the special
meaning of creating a range here so now
it's matching this with the dot the
problem just is if a remove test here
it's still matching this so an email
address starting with a dot would also
be matched and you can argue that this
should not be the case that valid email
addresses shouldn't start with a dot so
therefore this is not the way we should
do it
we shouldn't include the dot into our
entire range here instead what we want
to say is the email address should start
with any character any special character
that is not a dot then it may have a dot
and then it may have this dot followed
with any other character actually if we
have a dot that shouldn't be right in
front of the outside even at sign either
so a dot should only be allowed if it is
preceded and superseded by characters
and should never be allowed directly in
front of the @ sign or at the start of
the email address for that we have to
find you in our rule in front of the @
sign a little bit we basically want to
add the dot here now here out sort of a
range we have to escape it to take the
dot itself and then we could again use
our any character rule to allow for a
dot in the email address like here test
server farm it's now allowed again the
good thing is the rule down there with
the dot at the beginning is not matched
and that's exactly what we wanted the
problem now is all the average email
addresses are also not matched now why
because we basically say the dot here
it's not inside a range it's not one of
many characters you may use it's outside
of a range so it has to be there you
have to have a pattern where you have
some characters a dot and more
characters just as with the @ sign which
we also place between two ranges to say
the @ sign
has to be present now for the @ sign
that's correct for the dot it's not so
therefore the dot should be optional
now we could add a question mark to make
it optional and now with that we have a
valid email address here with the dot in
between but a wrong email address here
with the dot at the beginning if I add
the dot right in front of the @ sign
it's also not a valid email address so
this is a good thing because here we say
the dot is optional but it has to be
followed by more characters so that's
exactly what we want here so with the
dot added it's working fine but if I add
more dots here you see we have to issue
that it only fetches the one dot in
front of the @ sign and the part in
front of it but if we then have more
dots and parts in front of these dots -
it's not fetching this because our
pattern is saying a valid email address
is any character of this range a dot
which is optional though and more
characters and then the @ sign but only
one dot is included in our range now we
could fix this by adding a star which
says serum or more but then still we
have to su that the whole group here of
dot followed by text and preceded by
text still a may only occur once so we
need to find you now rules let me delete
the star let's instead create a group
which includes backslash dot and ends
after the plus in front of the @ sign
making this whole part here so there dot
and then this range a group now with
that group we can say this whole group
so this whole pattern of dot followed by
characters is optional by adding a
question mark or better by adding a star
saying it may occur is 0 or an infinite
amount of times so it's not just
optional which would be 0 or once but
it's optional in both directions may
occur not at all or may occur as often
as you want and with dead a dot at the
beginning still is invalid dot in front
of the @ sign still is invalid but if
you have
groups so text the dot and text and dot
in front of the ad sign this may occur
as often as you want with this set up so
this is a better solution to allowing
dots in front of the @ sign now what
about the part after the @ sign if I
have test dot servers com now you see
it's also not treating the whole string
as a valid regular expression it's now
omitting the domain ending for a single
reason the pattern after the @ sign says
there should be a dot and after the dot
there should be some text the domain
ending but if we have multiple dots with
text separated in between our part
between the @ sign and the domain ending
then this last group of dot followed by
text is actually treated as the domain
ending and this of course is incorrect
so we need a different pattern after the
@ sign too and here we basically need
the opposite of what we used in front of
it there we said we need any character
followed by maybe multiple occurrences
of dot with characters now we want to
say we clearly want to start with a
character after the @ sign but then we
also may have these groups of dots and
texts but in the end we definitely need
to dot something so what we want to have
is any character after the @ sign at
least one character and after that
character before the dot which marks the
ending of our regular expression I want
to have something optional so I'll group
it I want to have a range where we allow
a to set and 0 to 9 let's say we
probably also should tweak that range
and only allow a to set and 0 to 9 for
the domain name so that is the range
after that first part so here that's off
the @ sign and then that's what we just
created with the parentheses here with
that range in between and that range may
occur as often as you want so not at all
or an unlimited amount of times but
important this part is now grouped
together with the dot
and the part right after the add sign
now with that we're saying the add sign
should be preceded by at least one of
these characters and then optionally buy
more characters which are followed by a
dot now we just have to allow this
pattern one or multiple times by adding
a plus and now you see that the domain
also is in again and of course one thing
I need to fix is that this group here so
the part after the first characters
after the add sign should allow a dash
so that these are valid email addresses
again work that this is a valid email
address again here now with that we've
got a pattern which looks good to me we
are making sure that we allow a lot of
characters and dots in front of the @
sign that we allow dots arc the @ sign
but that we also a require at least one
dot so this would not be a valid email
address if we remove to calm a dot at
the end although is not valid we need to
have one character after it at least a
dot right after the @ sign all is not
treated as valid but all these our
combinations are valid so this is
looking good to me now a finished
regular expression could say of course
the full input should fulfill this
pattern so we start with this career and
we end with a dollar sign and now if we
get rid of all the other inputs here you
see this is matched this is matched this
is all matched here this is looking good
to me this is how we build such a more
complex regular expression really by
thinking logically about it and then
testing some edge cases some special
cases and you might also find some room
for improving this especially email
regular expressions can get very complex
and long if you want to consider all
possible combinations oftentimes though
you just want to do some rough
validation on the client side so you
don't need the perfect rule in the end
email should always be validated by
sending an email there from your server
side but this is how we build such a
regular expression
the idea behind it can really be hard to
get if you just looked at the entire
pattern since it looks very intimidating
but if you build it up step by step and
think about yeah I want to allow this
and I definitely need a character in
front of that then it should be much
clearer so let's dive deeper into more
regular expression features over the
next videos ten</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
