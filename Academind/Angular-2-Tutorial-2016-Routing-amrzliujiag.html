basically did some tidying up added some
nice styling and edit our two-way
binding to all our fields in our
contacts now in this video I will dive
into a new topic I will talk about
routing in and I'll show you how routing
works we'll start with a basic routing
example in this video but we will get
more complex ones and sub routing in
future videos let's dive right into this
to get started I obviously first need a
second route at the moment I only have
one page here now I want to create a
like a little header here where we get
the possibility to either have our
contact list here where we link and
click on our contacts or go to a create
new contacts ID we will not actually
implement the create new contact method
or functionality in this video we will
do so in a future video don't worry but
I want to get started with routing with
this nice little example the first very
important thing for a working routing in
angular 2 application is here in our
index file in our index dot HTML file we
need to set this element here base wrap
and then slash that is very important
for your URLs and your routing to work
correctly in your angular to it if you
do have any errors you absolutely can't
explain with all the other possible
sources have a look at this one this
might help you
the next place where we will start to
implement our routing is our boots TS
here we are bootstrapping our app
component and since we will set up the
routing in our app component as our root
component I will need to add something
here in a suit strap method if we have a
look at the arguments we can pass then
we have optional argument of custom
providers so providers this app
component might need this will be an
array and I definitely
need to pass the router providers
providers so as of as in the other
videos phpstorm
automatically imported them from for me
and this is an absolutely necessary
thing for routing to work because this
will enable our app component queue do
routing to get the router service so to
say injected now in our app component
here I will first set up a little header
up here where we will then do our
routing so the navigation bar so to say
this will be a very simple one as of now
but be fine and I also will get rid of
this contact list here because we will
replace this with something different in
a second now what I will do here is in
my navigation bar I will create two
links because I will have two routes now
I don't need the anchor it created here
for me instead I will use a custom
angular 2 directive here the router link
and this takes an array it is quotation
marks here where we then have again in
single quotes don't forget this the name
of our route now as if now we haven't
set up any routes but as I will do this
right after this we can as well start of
that so the first one will be the
contacts route which will just display
the list of contacts and the second one
I will just copy this second one will be
the new contact route which will enable
us to create a new contact now if I save
this we get this loading sign your this
loading text stack because actually at
the moment our app is broken because
we're setting router links which our app
component doesn't know yet and if it
were to know it well we would be using
routes it doesn't know
so first let's fix the thing about
router links here in my directives I
will import another directive the router
directives so just as we had the router
provide us here now bootstrap method
where we inject providers into our app
component we will also need our right
router directives here for these yeah
router directives to work and as you can
see our app is no longer broken even
though it doesn't do anything and yeah
doesn't look that great so next thing is
I will set up these routes and therefore
I have to add another decorator with
some more metadata to this class this
will be the route config decorator and
again I always stress this because this
is a easy error source in my program
here everything will be automatically
imported for me you definitely have to
have to import the router directives and
around config now in the route config we
will pass an array so no object as in
the component decorator but an array
instead and in this array then we will
pass the Chava script objects and each
object represents one route each object
then has several properties the first
one being the path this is what a URL
will display so the first one should be
slash contacts we will have a name well
this should match our name we set up
here so we will have contacts as our
name and I forget a t here just saw it
so next it will be the component which
is responsible for rendering or handling
this route so the component will be our
contact list component here remember
that I just removed the contact list tag
selector here that is why it is display
here anymore and in order to be able to
load it again well we have to tell our
router where to find the content it
should fetch and which is duplicated
route and create a new contact route
here
currently I don't have a component here
I will take care about this in a second
now at the moment when we would load
this application here so if I save this
and we get it reloaded we still don't
see anything here now I can click on
this and this won't work because I
actually have no hook where content
should be displayed so this will be here
in our main div where we previously had
the outlet or the tag to our contact
list component I will now create a new
tag or a new directive which is the
router outlet this is a built-in
directive of angular q and it comes into
the router directives import here and as
you can see this now works again now if
I remove this in the URL and go to this
page we don't see anything if I click
here we'll see it but it would be nice
if it would automatically load this page
if it would automatically load this page
when we enter our root directory so to
say therefore I can add an another
property here which is use as default
and this is a value of true and now you
can see that it already loads this
website when we enter it on its main URL
so this looks pretty good but I still
got the second component which isn't
available now as you can see nothing
happens when I click on it because
currently I have the contact list
component set here so I will create a
new component here a new contact
component and oh yeah I'll just copy
this here entered here get rid of all
our text in the template get rid of the
styles as well don't need them here
don't need the input
don't evenly the selector as we're using
a router III could by the way I could
remove this selector here as well but it
doesn't really matter if it's there or
not I won't need to contact service and
I want D to contact so very very lean
component here and I have to rename it
to a new contact component and just to
see that it works
I'll output some text here create a new
component the actual logic of creating a
new component you contact not component
the actual logic of creating a new
contact will be added in a later video
back in our app component here I will
then replace this component here of the
new contact component again import
automatically done for me and now you
can see this works and I can switch
between these two routes now the last
thing I'll do is I just fix the styling
of this header here give this a nice
look and I will go to my app CSS file
and first of all I want to navigation in
the header also to be centered and then
I will just reform reggie's links a
little bit so in my navigation the links
should let's say have a color of I'll
just pick the color I got here that's
dark blue I really like that and they
should have no text decoration so no
underlining is here I will also make
them bold and now when we hover over
them or if we do have them active they
will change in color and yeah that's
like give them this color here so the
save this and as you can see the snow
works so we got our basic routing going
on here it was really simple to set up
here in angular
as I said I will have a look at more
complex routing with SAP routes and so
on the future videos and we will
obviously also take care about the
ability to really create a new contact
but routing is a really a core concept
of all web applications so as you can
see it's easy to wire up there are few
key things to watch out for like setting
this base tag here and also injecting
our router providers in the boot good
method here but overall really nice and
handy thing to set up see you on the
next video is fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
