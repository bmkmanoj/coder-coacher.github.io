library that allows us to build engage
in client-side web apps so web apps
running in the browser but let's take a
step back we have our client we have our
browser we're sending a request to a
server we get back HTML pages this is
what you know this is how the web works
now let's leave that web world for a
second and let's consider a mobile phone
with real mobile apps so not web pages
but real apps if you think about these
apps they're highly engaging we can tap
around and we get a really engaging user
experience with near-instant responses
no page reloads and so on now react
helps us to bring parts of that
experience or the entire experience to
the web we can use react in two
different ways the first is to enhance
some things of some of the HTML pages we
actually can do this with just
JavaScript we can execute some code
there because it's the only language
that runs in the browser after the page
has been loaded - for example swap out
images on a HTML page to create an image
carousel without loading a new page for
every click which is far closer to the
mobile app experience and react helps us
with that it gives us a lot of helpers
that makes writing this code much easier
than with vanilla JavaScript the second
option is to create a single page
application here we get rid of two of
the pages and we only have one left
which is sent back by the server and on
that page we again use javascript to
re-render everything as needed to really
give the user an instant response
because we never load a second page any
data we need to send from the front end
to the server would be done behind the
scenes here again we can use react to
make that easier so that's the main goal
of react make things easier that we
could all to do with normal JavaScript
react allows us to react to events
handle user input update UI dynamically
re render parts of the page or the
entire page
and make all these things easier gift
user feedback and so on it allows us to
power the entire front end without
problems and that's important though the
front end doesn't run on the server it
runs in the browser
speaking off servers we'd return that
HTML page for a single page application
if we want to exchange data we do this
via a checks request and we can also do
this with a totally different server
react therefore is a collection of tools
like jQuery it makes the development
easier for us that's its main goal we
could do it all with when a lot
JavaScript but it would be harder but at
the end we use JavaScript with these
extra tools</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
