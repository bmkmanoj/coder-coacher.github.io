the last video we had a look at ranges
and quantifiers now once you build a
pattern with that I want to match a word
which looks like that
any amount of lowercase characters then
digits and then uppercase and then one
and only one exclamation mark how can we
match this exact pattern the following
word shouldn't match for example so here
I also have the same elements in general
digits lowercase characters special
character one exclamation mark to be
precise still the first should match
this one shouldn't let's find out how to
create such a pattern in this video
so I want to match exactly that pattern
where we have lower case than digit then
upper case then exclamation mark we can
create this match with ranges and
quantifiers actually the simplest way to
match this word is to copy it and put it
in there but yeah
that's probably not that helpful so
let's find a more regular expression way
to do that I want to match any word
which starts with lowercase characters
that's the first part we can agree on so
let's add a range with any lowercase
character let's now add a plus to say
there should be at least one lowercase
character but it may be followed by any
amount of lowercase characters humanly
possible so let's add a plus you see
I match this part I also match this part
here on the right so let's now build on
in this expression now I want to have a
word which starts with that obviously it
should be followed by another set of
digits so 0 to 9 and that also may occur
as often as possible or as wanted but at
least one time now let's say I then want
to have uppercase characters at a
minimum of one character but then any
amount of uppercase characters and
finally it should end with an
exclamation mark now if I add more to
this first word it is met or matched up
to this exclamation mark the second word
isn't matched though because it doesn't
fulfill this pattern it does contain a
portion which is lowercase characters
followed by a digit so this part up
until the plus after the digit range
would be met but there after we require
a range of uppercase characters and
exclamation mark and both is missing
here it starts with that but that
doesn't matter because we're not looking
at anywhere in this string no this order
is the right order we expect to have and
this order is a must it's not option
regular expressions are read from left
to right and hence the order matters
there are ways to kind of still write
expressions where the order doesn't
matter but for now let's stick to this
single the truth is simpler expression
here
now one thing on one issue we have is if
I add more characters to the first word
this doesn't match the full word and it
shouldn't because the word should end
with an exclamation mark but if I add
more characters I don't want to have the
word match this at all I don't want to
have to pattern match this word at all I
should say it shouldn't match it up
until to that point it should find no
match and kind of similarly if I remove
that uppercase and exclamation mark
part here it also matches the lowercase
a number part in the second word now I
set the order matches but that simply
means it looks for disorder anywhere in
the string I also want to tell it the
word should actually also start with
that and it should end with what comes
at the end of the regular expression to
do this there are two special characters
at the beginning of the regular
expression we can add this Caray symbol
or caret what is called caret car a
circumflex I don't know so there's
assembly the character we need and it
should end with a dollar sign
now dollar sign here has a special
meaning it doesn't mean the word should
end with a dollar sign
it simply means what's contained between
this career carrot and this dollar sign
what's contained between them that
actually is the full word this is why we
don't have any match here anymore if I
add my previous rule set of a two set
and then an exclamation mark we still
have no match if I remove that extra
part at the end of the first word though
and I remove the second word too now we
have a match though because now the full
string which you passed is exact
a word with that order of characters
anything thereafter and even if it's
only a blank space we'll break it and
this of course is often needed behavior
think about passwords which you want to
validate or email addresses
especially in email addresses you want
to have some text at sign some text and
a domain ending you can't mess up the
order a word has to contain all these
things in exactly disorder and this is
what we enforce with this strange
character and the dollar sign everything
in between has to be included and
included in this order this is what
we're saying not more not less so this
is how we build such patterns from left
to right potentially with these special
characters at start and end to contain
it and one word and respecting the order
here in the matched result - if you omit
the dollar sign at the end and decorate
Caray whatever at their start then it
also respects the order but it matches
anything which fulfills this criteria no
matter if something comes thereafter or
if something comes in front of it this
is a key takeaway here this is how you
build such patterns with the tools you
have you know the next videos we'll have
a look at matching email addresses and
how to build such patterns because for
regular expressions a lot of
understanding really comes by practicing
it and seeing how things to work
together so let's have a look at this in
the next videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
