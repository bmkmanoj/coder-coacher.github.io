you here my name is Maximilian and in
this video I want to get you started
with AWS ec2 what is that actually how
can we use it and how does it work let's
take a closer look
on my channel I already got some videos
on AWS and there we mainly used elastic
beanstalk a service provided by AWS to
quickly get started with hosting web
applications behind the scenes and I did
mention that in these videos elastic
beanstalk spins up some virtual servers
using AWS ec2 easy-to stands for Elastic
Compute cloud and what this actually is
is a service by AWS which allows you to
bring up your own servers you could say
now not of course complete machines
though you could rent complete machines
too but typically smaller fractions of
these machines virtual machines running
on the physical servers though and
that's important each virtual server you
bring up is totally isolated from all
the other software basically all the
other machines are running on the same
physical machine and that is of course
key from a security perspective but
let's take a closer look on the AWS
console we can find ec2 under the
compute section the constants we launch
our own server our own machine are on
computer basically we can of course do
all sorts of calculations or
computations on it so let's click ec2
here and we're taking to the ec2 console
now this console can be overwhelming the
first time you view it you get a lot of
options here on the left but the most
important option for us is to launch
instance button here so let's click it
because here we can bring up a new
virtual machine a new instance as it's
called which will be like a computer or
a machine old bus just sitting in a
cloud on some other physical machine the
first thing we have to do here is well
the same you have to do on your own
machine in your own room if you get a
new computer and want to set it up you
need to choose which operating system
and which software to install on it and
you do this by choosing an Amazon
machine image as they are called there
are loads of images to choose from
different operating systems and
different packages of software which are
installed right from the start you can
choose Linux and
for an Linux distributions you can
choose Windows now I'll choose the first
image here the MS Linux distribution
which already includes the LDS
command-line tools pipes in the Ruby and
packages we can install for PHP as on so
let's click select now and what we're
telling AWS hey we want to launch a new
virtual machine running Linux with the
other software which was mentioned here
now we need to decide which kind of
machine do we actually want to run
because of course we can decide how
powerful it should be and there are
loads of options to choose from as you
can see from this list now there's less
the next step where you can get
overwhelmed what is the right choice for
you now basically all these versions all
these instance types you see here differ
by the power they offer but not just by
the power in terms of memory or CPUs but
all the in the relation these different
components have to each other so for
example we got the M instance type here
all these instances starting with M and
for in this case these are the general
purpose machines you could say
multi-purpose M stands for multi-purpose
indeed and here we got this ratio of
four-to-one so 16 gigabytes of RAM and 4
V CPU cores and V CPU is a workshop CPU
core because of course you don't have
the real physical machine you get a part
a portion of that CPU which is actually
installed on a machine assigned to your
machine so you get that and other
machines have a different ratio for
example there are machines which are
optimized on memory these feature much
more RAM compared to the CPUs they have
and that basically is a difference that
also leads us to that strange naming
which kind of tells you which ratio you
have between the different assets or
factors on each machine I already told
you that M stands for multi-purpose C
stands for compute so these feature a
lot of CPUs as you can see the CPU to
RAM ratio is different than for the M
instance family that by the way is how
it is called this first letter describes
the instance family which in turn
describes how RAM and CPU and SSD
storage or storage in general is related
to each other so we got C instance
family instances which are more heavily
focusing on CPUs M which is really
multi-purpose has a good relation for
all kinds of different tasks and then we
get our machines or other instances like
for example storage optimized ones so
where we have a lot of storage on these
machines like up to here 8 x q terabytes
of SSD storage almost and here you can
really choose which type of machine you
need for which type of task you want to
run on this machine do you want to run a
web server of a web host or do you want
to host your website on the machine
basically well then multi-purpose all
these T machines here actually might be
interesting the key instance family
stands for burst and this actually works
a bit different there you can basically
earn bursts credits at times where the
machine is not utilized that much and
then you can pull or use these credits
if you got spikes traffic spikes which
makes this reusable for spikey
application spiky web applications M as
a said multi-purpose all the good web
server a storage optimized one probably
not so much might be bare is better for
our test where you need a lot of storage
temporary storage may be or might be
better or other machines like with a lot
of CPUs or RAM or GPUs optimized
machines are existing too which are
better for big data analysis and machine
learning these are all things you have
to decide when picking instance now all
go with the web server is approach and I
also want to stay in the free tier which
allows me to use this instance for one
year all the time running for one year
for free and check the free tier
information on the alias pricing page to
learn more about this this is only true
if you have one of these instances if
you launch ten of them well only one
three so I choose to keep you micro
instance which has one V CPU one
gigabyte of RAM no special storage
attached to it does have internal
storage but we would have to add another
service to get persistent storage which
isn't removed once we shut the instance
down and that basically is it we could
already launch it and just to review the
other configuration but to really
understand what ec2 is about we should
go through the configuration so let's
click on configure instance details on
this page we can now decide how many of
these instances do we want to launch
I'll go with one we could add more and
we could automatically put them into
your auto scaling group which manages
the amount of instances depending on
incoming traffic and so on we could
request the spot instance and there's a
different pricing thing or a different
way of of paying for them you could say
of getting the instance to normally what
we're doing here is on the Mount
we're bringing the census up it is
available is always available and we
paid a fixed price which you can see on
the AWS pricing page however there are
two other pricing options you could
reserve an instance which means you
can't shut down or you can shut it down
but then you will still pay for it which
you don't in the on-demand
usage we're setting up here so you could
reserve it which is a bit keeper but you
always have to pay it or use the spot
instance here which means you bid for
instances which are not required right
now but you only get them if the price
basically approaches your bid price and
you're not guaranteed that this instance
will stay can stick with you you can
also lose it again so this might be good
for tasks which are not really time
critical you don't need an instance
which is up all the time but you
occasionally ritu need to run some
calculation then this might be an option
so there's the pricing what else do we
have here a couple of network settings
and I actually will have a separate
videos on V PC and what that this is
about generally this is your own network
in the cloud you'll launch your instance
into you you can that also specify
subnets in this network and that is
what's happening here you can also
assign a
public IP and use the subnet subnet
specific settings here or you could set
this to enable directly to make sure
that this instance does receive a public
IP it of course needs one if you plan on
reaching it from the web otherwise if it
doesn't have a public IP no way of
reaching that instance you can assign an
I am role I am as this instance and
access management thing on AWS and with
the role you can control what you'll be
doing or what you'll be able to do from
this instance so for example if on this
instance you run some code to access
another AWS service you need to give
that instance to permission to do so and
you can do this by assigning the right
role shutdown behavior well what do you
want to do if you shut instance down do
you want to stop it which basically will
not remove it or do you want to
terminate it which removes it from your
instant list you can serve some
monitoring details and you can move on
to storage now here is some storage
which is automatically attached to the
instance this uses AWS EBS and our
service and then some storage which will
also be available if you shut your
instance down the instance itself is a
virtual machine and therefore it also
has some internal storage some internal
hard drive storage but if you ever shut
the instance down that will be lost too
and therefore attaching some external
storage to it also makes sense because
if you want to save some data which you
want to keep even in the case that you
shut the instance down you need that
extra storage and here is one storage
device with eight gigabytes
automatically attached to it you could
add more volumes but you're going to pay
for that queue and check out the AWS EBS
pages pricing pages to learn more about
that you can also learn more about
storage options here on that page next
you can assign some tags which allows
you to trace your instance feed on the
build so basically to manage your
instance and then we have to configure
the security group and that's important
of course the security group decides
which kind of security rules are applied
to the instance and you have to attach
security groups to each instance now
here we can create a new one or choose
an existing one I already got a couple
of
as you can see basically what you do in
a security group is you decide which
traffic is allowed to enter the instance
in which traffic may leave the instance
which kind of requests so security group
is a firewall basically you can decide
which ports may be accessed from the
outside and which traffic can well as I
said leave the instance for example here
what we're setting up as a rule is that
we can SSH into the instance so we use
port 22 the SSH port and then which
source may do that not that strange
notation here basically is a range of
IPs
I'll come back to that range of IPs in
the V PC video what this means here is
everyone the entire internet is able to
SSH into your instance and you don't
want that you don't want to get the
entire internet access to your instance
yes there will be a password protection
but still this is extremely dangerous
so instead choose my IP to get your IP
automatically entered into this field
and now only your IP will be able to
access this instance and no one else and
this of course is super important
because now only you from your machine
can access the instance now if your IP
changes and isn't static you ever need
to adjust this every time you want to
access the instance you can adjust it
after the instance was launched or you
need to set up a range here which
basically is the range of IPs you might
potentially get now setting up ranges
here you can simply google for it Sider
CIDR translator or tool and you will
find a tool or you can enter IP ranges
and get the right side or block again I
will explain this in DB PC video so with
that we can now review and launch this
so let's clip a glimpse over the details
here again and launch this instance and
we're prompted to Eirik use a key pair
or create a new one now this key pair is
required for us to log into the instance
we can't log into it without a keeper so
make sure to download it and store it
safely if you ever lose it you can't get
it again and you'll be locked out from
your instance that's super important
you know so here I will create a new key
pair and now give it a name demo easy
too and download it again you need to
store this I already got this so let me
name it demo to you I'll save it here
and now with that saved you can now
launch the instances with the instance
in this case now this will take a couple
of seconds you can go back to the ec2
console and actually see how it's
getting launched here under running
instances you see oh it's already
running so that was really fast you
might still see pending there but it
really launches fast and this is your
instance your own virtual machine
running in the cloud now that's super
awesome but what can we do with it well
we can do anything we want with it you
can install whichever software you want
to install on it you can turn it into a
web server it does have a public IP as
you can tell down there this is its
public IP and that is what you can do
with it now of course if you take this
public dns here which is like
automatically and automatically
generated to main you may also use if
you enter this into your browser you
actually will see that nothing happens
and that makes sense because we have
that able port 80
we only enabled port 22 on that security
group so we're not actually able to send
HTTP request to that instance but it
does have a public eye view so turning
it into a web server is only one thing
though you could run big data analytics
on the instance you could convert your
vacation images into different file
formats you can basically do whatever
you want the only limitation of course
is you won't have a desktop you will
have to connect to it over the command
line over SSH or use some other tool for
doing that connections like putty on
windows which takes us to the next step
let's connect to this instance here now
how can we connect
I just set it over a command line over
the terminal on Mac or Linux basically
so let's open it and make sure to
navigate into the folder where you
stored this key file you just download
it because we're going to meet this now
I want to connect to this
instance Oh and as a sign of course
store just keep on a secure location on
your machine and don't delete it don't
accidentally delete it so now I want to
connect to the server to that instance
and on Mac and Linux is super easy you
can use the SSH command on your command
line on your terminal on Windows you
don't have that now in Windows there are
other options and I actually have a link
about connecting to it on Windows in the
video description you can use or it can
install OpenSSH to always be able to use
SSH from the command line and or you can
use a tool named putty to also connect
via SSH to that instance so it's super
easy to connect from Windows to so with
that here we always no matter if you're
using Windows or Linux we need to pass
some information cue our our instance
basically we need to has the user with
which you want to connect and AWS
automatically created one for us and the
password for this user now the password
is our key file here this top temple
this is our key pair we have for
connecting to the database at three
instance the username depends on which
kind of image you chose for MSN Linux
it's going to be easy to user now the
exact command to connect is the
following SSH as you see - I then the
path to your key pair so in this case in
some is the same folder it's just the
name of the keeper but it would be the
full path to that keeper if you execute
this command from outside this folder
then your username easy to user for the
MS gnu/linux distribution at and then
this Public DNS we already copied and
then this is actually it now if you hit
enter you can click or enter yes here to
confirm the fingerprint of the instance
and now you see that the private key
file was unprotected and therefore we
weren't allowed to connect to the
instance this is a security mechanism we
can't connect as long as our key falls
this top temple is not protected so as
long as everyone can basically over
now you can change the permissions of
that key file to read only to change
mode command chmod then 400 this is the
the shortcut for read-only and it is
totally new to use some research for
change models for chmod and you'll find
detailed descriptions I'll also put a
link in the video description and then
the file name so demo to ezq p.m. now
again for Windows users there also be a
link in the video description about how
to connect to the AWS ec2 instance with
that file here at adjusted now we can
now rerun this SSH command connect to
the database and now you should
successfully connect to it and now it
might look just like it did before but
actually you see here this is now a
different user this is a different
machine this is us on our own ec2
instance if you will list this you see
in that directory we doesn't don't have
any files but if you go to the root
directory off the machine you see there
are a couple of folders and files here
this is definitely not my machine I can
tell you that this is this Linux insects
we're running in the cloud and we were
able to connect to it because we opened
the 22 port for our IP now this is the
instance running and we are connected to
it and as I said you can now do whatever
you want to do it is like our own
machine you can install whichever
software you want to install run
whichever code you want to run it is
your machine now at least until you shut
the instance down and you can turn it
into a simple web server convert any
images to smaller images there do big
data analysis whatever you like now in
the video description you'll also find a
link how you could turn this into a web
server it's a process which involves
multiple steps you have to change some
permissions but this is something you
can do might be a nice next practice
this is how you can log into your ec2
instance now let's go back to that
management console here we see all
running instances the one we just
launched is the only one I have here
actually what about all these settings
here on the left though well you
basically
some rumors reserved instances and spot
requests these are the different pricing
options I managed I mentioned you see
some general Vance tagged some logging
information about your running instances
here is a section about all the images
you might add to your own image
collection so the image we used or
setting up this just instance basically
we can manage our block storage tests
businesses EBS serve as I mentioned
regarding the storage we have attached
to our instances there's only this one
volume we did attach to the instance
we're running right now we also have
this security group setting which is
about all the security groups and this
is what I actually also want to take a
look at right now here this is the
security group we created last and if we
increase this here in size with a short
description which isn't too meaningful
there is this VPC thing but I'll come
back to we've receive a separate video
as I said and then here inbound and
outbound is interesting especially
inbound inbound is how you manage what
is able to access your instance and this
should be as strict as possible of
course here only SSH access is possible
you can't access this instance from the
web for example and even the SSH access
is restricted to our IP here this of
course should be as secure and as strict
as possible to protect your instance the
outbound rules on the other end are very
relaxed here all traffic is allowed to
access anything you may restrict this to
but in general this is not as critical
here and we definitely want to give our
instance here access to the Internet in
some way of code at least because we
want to ensure that we can update
install updates and so on this is our
firewall the security group attached to
our instance and definitely port
definitely important to understand that
inbound rules should be as strict as
possible elastic IP it here are an
interesting concept your instance here
if you have a look at it click on it
does have a public IP address here now
this public IP for address here changes
each time you shut the instance down and
bring it back up so you can't rely on
getting the same in IPA
and of course if you have a website
where you route your traffic to that IP
that might not be the behavior you want
actually as long as you stay in AWS
world there are ways you work with
dynamic public IP SKU but it might still
be something you want to look into
elastic IPS even though the name is
deceiving elastic sounds very dynamic
but actually these are fixed IPs you can
allocate to your account and you do have
to allocate them because ipv4 addresses
are a rare resource it's changing with
the ipv6 of course but we're running out
of ipv4 instance a IPS so you can
allocate some to your account only a
limited in limited amount and then you
can assign these IPS which now really
belong to you to your account two
instances and even if you shut the
instance down and bring it back up you
will still get the same elastic fixed IP
address so that is really an interesting
concept and really something you have to
keep in mind if you are running
applications web applications on these
instances now a load balancing and auto
scaling is something I already touched
on in my elastic Beanstalk video
basically it allows you to distribute
incoming traffic across all instances or
bring up or shut down additional
instances as to traffic changes and then
you get some well advanced management
options here to get an overview over
your instances and so on so I won't go
into too much detail here this is what
you can do with ec2 now I'll conclude
this by shutting this instance sound by
clicking on it and then either
right-clicking instance state terminate
you could also just stop it
which won't get rid of it or reboot it
but I want to get rid of it
so terminate would be the right choice
or if you just select it and click on
actions and then you have the same menu
instance eight-state terminate now we're
warned that the EBS volume is configured
to also be shut down you could now
change this but I will also shut down
the block storage which means of course
that everything I stored there is lost
everything here is lost
instance will be removed and I can't
exercise anymore this is how you bring
it down and I hope that in this video I
could give you a brief introduction
relatively brief introduction qec to how
to work with it again we already worked
with it indirectly through elastic
Beanstalk in an earlier video but it is
really important to understand what's
happening behind the scenes and I hope
that this works with this video see you
in other videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
