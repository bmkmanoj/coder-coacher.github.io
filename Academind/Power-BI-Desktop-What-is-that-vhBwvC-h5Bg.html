channel business intelligence or bi in
case you're not sure what bi means the
eye is simply the process of collecting
data analyzing the data and finally
visualizing the data so you turn data
into information actually the great
thing is that for this purpose multiple
tools are available on the market one of
these tools is Microsoft's power bi and
power bi is actually not a single tool
it consists of multiple connected tools
so we will take a look at one of these
power of the eye tools which is called
power bi desktop before we start one
quick note if you want to know more
about power bi I would be really happy
to welcome you in my udemy course which
will give you a complete introduction
into this power bi universe you can find
the link to that course down there in
the video description and a special
discount price if you're not interested
into that no problem let's take a look
at power bi desktop right now so as I
said power bi is not a single tool the
power bi tools are power bi desktop
power bi service and power bi mobile now
why do we have these tools well power bi
desktop is a local application which you
can simply download in this application
you can connect power bi to different
data sources then you can analyze your
data and visualize your data in charts
for example after you finish your local
work you can then publish your project
to power bi service this is a cloud
application well and as your project is
now in the cloud you can use power of
your mobile a mobile app to access your
projects and the data in it from mobile
devices of course these tools have a lot
more functions but this is the general
idea behind that we will focus on the
local application power bi desktop and
the great thing is that the download of
power bi desktop is for free as long as
your work stays locally if you want to
have increased sharing capabilities we
power bi service then you have to buy
power bi Pro but for all purposes we can
use the power bi free version however
there is one thing that is not so great
power bi desktop is only available on
Windows that's just the way it is but if
you are still interested in to power bi
desktop and don't have a Windows
computer just keep watching the video
and see what great things you can do
with power bi desktop so as we now know
if you have to download power of your
desktop let's see where we can find the
download link Here I am on the official
power bi home page well and we won't
power up your desktop so we simply go to
products up here and go to power bi
desktop right there here you can now
find the download button and the
advanced download options I would use
the advanced download options because
this allows you to specify the language
you want to download power bi desktop in
so we click advanced download options
and if we now scroll down you can select
the language I would stick to English
then we simply press download and here
you now simply have to select which
platform you have so 42 bit or 64 bit
and if we then select our platform start
the download and follow the installation
guide then we can start power of your
desktop now and see this for the first
time now the sign-in option in the
center is not important at the moment as
we will work in power bi desktop locally
we don't need to sign-in or to create a
power bi account one thing that is more
interesting at the moment is this get
data button however in this video we
wanted to download power of your desktop
and get a general overview of it this is
what we did so if you want to know more
about the get data button and what we
can now do with power bi desktop I would
be really happy to welcome you in this
video because right there we will import
data analyze that data and finally
create a visualization hope to see you
there and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
