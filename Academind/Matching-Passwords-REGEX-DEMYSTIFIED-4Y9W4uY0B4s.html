to will some more regular expression
demystifying in the last video we had a
look at groups capturing groups and
positive look Ahead's it can be hard to
grasp the concept if you don't apply it
to a real use case so in this video
we're going to do that will match a
password which should include a special
character a number a pro case and a
lowercase character and maybe it should
even be at least 8 characters long let's
do this together in this video
so the goal is to match a password the
following password should be treated as
correct so we should completely match it
let's say we have HG uppercase T one age
one exclamation mark question mark s
this should be a valid carrier password
this or this or this should all not be
treated as valid this has eight
characters it has a pro case and lower
case character it has a number and it
has a special character and it may have
more than one of each of these
categories but it has at least one now
how do we start with matching this how
do we start with this regular expression
well we want to allow lower case upper
case special character in digits so we
can create a range with lower case
whoops lowercase uppercase digit and
some special characters like the
exclamation mark in the question mark
and you can't add more and now we got a
lot of matches now if we add the plus
sign we're also saying this should at
least occur once or more often we can
also say it should be at least eight
characters long by using curly braces
and one comma nothing is just a
replacement for a plus it also means
from at least one match to as many as
you want
therefore eight comma means only match
patterns where we have at least eight
subsequent characters from that range
and then as many as you want so now all
options except for this second one are
matched well that's the exact issue we
have here though the third and fourth
pattern are also matched because they
are long enough and that you use a lower
case or at it yet but we're not
enforcing that there should be at least
one lower case at least one uppercase
character and we can't enforce it with
the range alone now obviously you could
refactor this and say H is said at least
once followed by uppercase H who said at
least once and so on and then you could
kind of group that but the problem is
due to the pattern here being parsed
from left to right
passwords which started with a lowercase
character and then are preceded with
uppercase characters are marked as
correct so a a a a a and I should remove
that because otherwise you would have to
repeat that pattern a times that would
be matched but the problem is this is
not what we want to do we also want to
allow a AAA or uppercase characters
mixed in so this is not what we can use
we should go back to our previous
solution of having one big range which
should occur or where each character or
where any character off the drain should
occur at least eight times but we need
to fine tune the fact or the pattern to
take care that we also have some minimum
rules we can do that with look Ahead's
so let's add some look Ahead's to our
rule here we're now saying any character
from this range and at least eight of
them let's now add a positive look-ahead
after that with question mark equal sign
at the beginning of the group and now
let's say it should at least have a
lowercase character so eight you said
like this now we see something
interesting only the first and the
second string are matched well almost
the last character is submitted the
reason for dad is that whooped up look
ahead we're saying match any string
where this first rule is correct which
basically is followed or where the
result of this first rule is followed by
a single lowercase character and that's
the case for the first and the third
string here now I don't want to have it
being followed by a lowercase character
I just want my whole string to include
at least one lowercase character but
that should be matched in this first
part here for that we can set D or put
the positive look ahead to the beginning
of the word this kind of makes it like a
minimum requirement now we're matching
anything which has a lowercase character
at least one and fulfills this role too
with the 8 characters
therefore the just digit string is no
longer matched because it has no
lowercase character now we can add
multiple look Ahead's I can add another
look ahead in front of it four digits
let's say so 0 to 9 we might have
expected that now all the previous
strings and the digit string is matched
instead none of them is matched anymore
because with that it's basically looking
at the start of our strings we want to
match and looking if it starts with a
lowercase character and add it yet of
course it can't start with both we have
to be more flexible we have to add
something to our positive look at we
should say yeah we want to look if there
is a lowercase character but we don't
care about the position as characters at
so there may be any character in front
of the lowercase character and to any
character that's the dot and this dot
doesn't have to so this any character
it's not the dot that's any character
doesn't have to appear but it may appear
so the a or the B or whatever is
included in this range may be at the
beginning of the string but it doesn't
have to so let's add a star after the
dot to say yeah there may be any
character in front of this rule and the
same for the digits there may be any
character in front of digits and now we
get a match for this mixed string
because now we're saying only a string
which includes lowercase characters and
numbers is treated as valid and that's
only true for the first string if I add
a lowercase character to their fourth
string this is also treated as valid and
now we can simply repeat this positive
look ahead one more time for uppercase
characters so that now only string
switching also include an uppercase
character are treated as valid therefore
the 4th string is not treated as valid
if I only at a lowercase character I
also have to add a uppercase one to make
it valid and now we can repeat this one
more time for special characters for the
ones we also then accept thereafter so
here I want to allow exclamation mark
and a question mark
and therefore only do first stringers
matched again because it includes one of
them
if I remove both it's not treated as
valid anymore this is how you construct
such a password validator look Ahead's
allow you to ensure that a special
character occurs at least once but that
the position doesn't matter and then you
have to set of allowed characters at the
end where you define how often or how
many of them should be included so that
you can also check the quantity this is
password validation and this is where
positive look Ahead's can be very useful
if you want to look at the complete
string and see if it includes something
at any position with the dot star here
and then you proceed this match with
your rule of how often should something
occur this is how we match passwords
this is a typical pattern you would use
and I hope that with that positive look
Ahead's became a bit more useful and
clearer they are great to define minimum
requirements so character which should
occur at least once for example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
