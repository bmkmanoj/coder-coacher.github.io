desktop in this video I want to show you
a quite nice function the column from
example function let's take a look so I
prepared this query right here with 4
different columns so we have one column
with different car manufacturers one
column with the headquarters of this
specific car manufacturer the number of
vehicles sold in 2015 and when they
published that information now this is
interesting but the more interesting
thing is that column from example
function I just talked about because if
you look at the different columns right
here you see that we have some problems
in the first column for example I would
like to exclude the second word so I
don't want to have folks wagon group but
only for clogging the same thing is true
for Nissan and Renault so to do this we
could now simply use a function like
extract we talked about that in our
initial project video however with the
column from example function we can do
that really easily so the only thing we
need to do is we need to select that
column right here now go to the add
column ribbon right there
and now select column from examples
right here if you click it in the lower
part right here and then simply select
from selection so only the selected
column then and preset then this menu
opens well and with this menu we have a
new column right here this one and in
this column I can now type some text one
example could be Toyota right so the
content of the first column in this
first row if a temperate centre like
this then I see that nothing changed
right so we still have folks walking
group right here we have to miss some
Japan and Renault France but what if I
now write Volkswagen in that second row
and press ENTER again then it gets more
interesting right because now power bi
understood that I only want to keep the
first word so basically the text that is
left of a specific
in our case to space but nevertheless if
we now press ctrl + Enter then we
created a new column which contains
exactly the values that we want to have
now as I said we could have done that
with an extract function for example so
there are more ways on how to get that
result but we can do more with the
column from examples function let's take
a look at the second column now this
headquarters column so in this column we
have the different countries but Japan
right here France right here and Germany
there are some problems with this
capital letters in it I would like to
get rid of those and to do this I could
for example simply replace it so I could
simply replace the capital letters right
here with the replace function or I can
again use the column from examples
function let's try it out again so be
again select column from examples from
the election right here and now we
simply click right here into this row
that we have that mistakes in the way
Japan is written and if we now write
into this column Japan the way we want
it to be and press ENTER now then it
gets more interesting right because now
probably I understood that only the
first letter should be a capital letter
and it also applied it for France right
here like this and for Germany down
there if we now press again ctrl + Enter
then we see that we have this new column
again now with the countries written
correctly so we now saw that we can use
this function for specific delimiter
operations and also on text specific
topics like we saw it in this column
let's take a look at another example we
have that published column right here
let me select it again what if I want to
know on which they this data was
published let's again select the column
from examples function and again from
selection and now I know that the 11th
of May 2016 was a Wednesday and if I
write Wednesday right here
oops like this and press Enter
then you can see that power bi
immediately understood what I want to
display right here and based on the
information it has in that column so the
date it was able to now retrieve all the
corresponding weekdays of the remaining
dates this is also nice right so we can
also use the function on date operations
let me show you one last example where
this function might be a big help to you
so what if I want to combine two columns
let's say you want to combine the part
of manufacturer column and the
headquarters column well to do this we
simply again select column from examples
but now we could also select from all
columns like this if we do that we now
simply need to look for a value in a
column that we want to start with in our
case I would for example use Misun
because this is something that we
corrected so we have missing right here
in the corrected form and right there in
this incorrect form so if I now refer to
listen right here then power bi know was
that deep manufacturer should be
retrieved from that column so let's go
to a list and then and right Misun like
this and now right the headquarters
Japan press Enter and again you can see
that this worked perfectly and if I now
press control enter we have an
additional column so we also know that
we can combine columns with that
function but I want to combine that
columns even better so let's select it
one less time so the column for example
function and from all columns and now
select this one right here and right in
this Sun and now I will simply add is
headquartered in Japan so we have Nissan
which is an information we have in this
column we have the headquarters which is
information of this column and is
headquartered in as a simple text if we
now press Enter
we can see that this also works and if I
now press control enter again
we also have this column created so this
is it this was just a little example on
how to use this column from example
function so maybe this helps you
sometimes when you work with power bi
desktop and the only thing I can say
right now is thanks a lot for watching
and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
