tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
have a look at how routing in view chess
and a view chess application works for
that I'm in a brand new application
setup here and I created it using the
view CLI you can find a video on how to
use the CLI here on this channel
now I basically created a plain vanilla
very simple application with my app that
you follow I only say let's go somewhere
in the template this is what you're
seeing here and I do have two other
templates here too I guess so you can
see it home and users and in both I only
say I'm home and users overview but I
think we can easily imagine that we
would have some users in there or
generally some different components you
want to load conditionally through
routing now why would you want to use
routing in the first place there is the
if and so on if you want to
conditionally show certain components
right well routing is of course useful
if you want to create a single page
application that means the only page
ever getting served by your server is
the index.html file this file here now
in this file we're loading the beauteous
application but in this application we
maybe want to recreate this application
like feeling this website feeling where
we do have different routes now here
though the routes will not be handled by
our server we're not sending the
requests to the server we're not getting
back multiple pages or reviews from the
server instead as I just mentioned we're
only getting back this index.html file
but we still want to handle their friend
routes and turns out we can do that with
the view chess router a nice little
package we can add which allows us to
parse that URL and load different
components as pages so to say depending
on which URL we're visiting now in this
video we're going to have a look at how
we can set up this router how we can
configure our basic routes and how we
can go there in the next video I'll take
a closer look at how we can navigate
around and especially important how we
can pass data when switching your route
so enough to talking
let's start working on that router I
only get my development server running
here and I'm going to cancel by hitting
ctrl command a control C excuse me and
then I want to install that view router
that's an extra package it's not
included in a default view J's package
and we can install it running NPM
install - - save - save it as a
dependency new package J's file the
router this will pull down the router
and make it available for us to use in
this project
now with the router installed here we
can go to the main dot J's file which is
our route entry point for that
application as you learn in this CLI
video if you watch that on this channel
and here I can now import the view
router now I can give it any name I want
here but I have to import that from view
router like this so now this will give
me that router and in order to be able
to use it here in this application where
I'm using webpack to bundle everything I
have to take my view object which I'm
importing from view so this route view
not instance this view object really
from the view package and executi use
method there this enables plug-ins which
I can use and the router is just such a
plug-in so by calling view use and
passing the view router I'm making sure
that routing is now actually enabled and
will work so dad now gives us X to the
router but we haven't got any routes to
navigate use to navigate you right we
get the app excuse me we get the home
and user took view file but how do we
get there well we need to set up our
router so let's add a new constant QT
main dot J's file and let's call it
routes to set up some routes first now
routes is basically an array of routes
this of course leaves the question how
does one individual route look like well
one route is simply just a JavaScript
object so we configure a route by adding
a chava script object to this array now
that array is not getting used and you
were but we're going to change this soon
so in order to set up a route here we
now need to define a path and puff and
this is important
refers to the part in our URL after our
domain so here the domain is localhost
8080 and the path would then be for
example slash users that would be a path
slash users so let's say we want to
handle the slash users path so we add
slash users here and then we need to
specify which component should get
loaded
so component now here we can define
which component we want to load if the
user navigates to localhost 8080 slash
users now if that shall be the user is
component from the user study view file
we need to import that so import users
from users dub view and here I simply
set us up as a component then users this
gives me the users path now let's add
another one let's add a default pop
shall we so that we always load the home
component if we're just at localhost
8080 so for dad I will just enter an
empty pop just slash and here I will
duplicate this and I want to load the
home dot view for the home component and
therefore here the component is home now
with that I got two routes set up users
for slash users at home for just slash
for localhost 8080 in this case here so
we kept the routes is certainly great
but how do we get the routes into our
application now while nothing easier
than that we simply create a new
constant let's call it router and router
now uses the view router zoom new view
router here and we pass an object to
that constructor in this object I simply
pass routes and I could say routes :
routes but since I'm using es6 here I
can take the shortcut and just say
routes and es6 will automatically expand
this to routes routes so that's just a
shortcut in a case where the property
name and DD well name of the eval
or the variable name opt where which
holds the value are equal so if both are
equal we can leave out the value name
and just put routes here this creates
the router and now we have to add this
router to our route view instance by
adding router : router or again using
the shortcut just router and let it
expand automatically with that the
routes are set up the router is set up
the routers also added as a plugin to
view che s almost everything has been
done now we need a place to load these
components at because right now yeah we
get slash users and slash registered as
routes but we don't have any place to
load them right so let's go to the app W
file and here in that template we should
define a place where view chess should
render the routes we're navigating to
that is done by adding a router view a
router view is just a reserved component
you should say it looks like a component
right and it will be recognized by the
view router and then it will take this
place in our template and put the
component which gets loaded
conditionally and this place so let's
run the server again by running NPM run
def here and we should have working
routing now if we go back to the
application looks pretty good already
we're at I'm home just by well loading
our page and we do recognize this
strange hash tag here right well I'll
come back to this in a second
let's try slash users here first looks
good to me so that's getting loaded
though what is this strange hash tag
here doing why can't we just wizard
slash users why is it always putting
this strange hash tag here now it looks
even weirder what's that
well this hash tag here which gets added
automatically is kind of the way how we
did routing a couple of well years ago
one or two years ago even it basically
means the part in front of the hash tag
this part here gets handled by the
server because this is important
and every route or and every URL you
enter up here and when you hit enter
gets of course sent to the server that's
how the internet works right it would be
bad if it would be otherwise where the
workout would work otherwise but here
our routes are set up in our view choice
application which of course runs in a
browser so how on earth should our
server know that there is a slash users
route in our client application in our
review application the answer is it
doesn't and this is where this hash tag
here comes in the part in front of the
hash tag is sent to the server and the
server tries to find a fitting route the
part after the hash tag is ignored by
the server and instead handled by the
client by view che s this is why here we
can enter slash users and we do layout
this route because the server loads this
part here gives us the index.html page
the view chase application starts up and
then this part here is sent to our
front-end application to JavaScript and
this is able to handle it because we
register this route now that's nice but
you probably noticed if I delete the
hash tag and just enter slash users it
now puts T hash to here after users well
that is because our test development
server here is already configured in a
certain way where it will send all 404
errors so every router doesn't find on
the server automatically to the client
that is a cool behavior which you see a
lot nowadays and you want to configure
your server in this way chances are high
you want to do that of course it at
least
because if you do it like this if you
ignore all not found 404 errors on the
server you can always pass on unfound
routes to the client and let the client
handle it which is what we want to do
here our server only has one route just
the root route this one here so it
should not even bother with any other
routes so we don't need the hashtag we
can tell it well please always send all
requests to the client now as a set does
develop
server is already configured in the way
your server on the server you want to
use for your application has to be
configured in such a way that it always
sends back the index.html file if that
is the case we can get rid of the hash
tag by going to your main J's file to
the router which you configure here and
adding the mode property and here we
want to add history history basically is
the shortcut for the history mode that's
just the name of that mode where we
basically use just a / - put it in
easier words - where we don't use the
hash tag so now if I reload this you see
now we don't have an hash tag and if I
just enter slash users it stays at slash
users but nonetheless it loads my users
component so now we're using this nicer
URL mode to load that that was a lot of
talking but now in this video you saw
how to install the router how to add to
the application how to set up route how
to load these routes by entering them in
the URL and how to change the mode to
have nicer URLs now have another video
on this channel the next video in this
playlist where we're going to have a
look at how we can navigate between our
our routes by using links and how we can
pass data around see you there hopefully
