nice-looking page here with our dummy
thumbnails and what I want to do now is
I will stick to dummy data for now or it
with seated data to put it this way but
I want to use the data base I want to
introduce MongoDB and actually seat data
there so that the data we are seeing on
this page here on the index page
actually comes from the database and
it's not hard-coded into what the HTML
code the first step to do this of course
is to download and install MongoDB now I
already get a video on that and you will
find a link in the description
nonetheless to quickly get you started
the first step is to head over to
MongoDB and there you simply want to
press this download button here and then
just choose your operating system and
click this download link now if you were
on Mac like I am then you will have a
little package you simply have to
extract and then just move to extract
that folder somewhere on your machine if
you're running Windows then you will
find an installer for which you run and
where you specify where this should be
installed the next step is to open up a
terminal or command line and then simply
navigate into your MongoDB folder so
where you moved that extract or
installed folder once you navigate it
into that folder navigate into the bin
in the binary folder and then you run
your MongoDB server by just running dot
slash Mongo D on Mac or Linux or on
Windows you may simply double click on
it and Explorer or just type MongoDB in
your command line and that fires up the
MongoDB server which hosts the database
and of course we need that server to
work with it so that's the quick
installation and in the description of
the video you will also find a link to
the official manual which detailee
describes how to get mono DB installed
and running on different operating
systems so with that out of the way it's
time to configure it and to use it in
the shopping cart application in order
to do this I'll open up in new terminal
and the first thing I will do here is I
will install Mongoose no Mongoose is
basically a noche Express package which
makes what most mom would be very simple
now we could use the official MongoDB
client and that would work fine too but
Mongoose offers a little some nice
extras basically it allows us to define
schemas it has validation built in and
you can work with the data in a very
intuitive way and this is why I prefer
it to the normal MongoDB driver to
install Mongoose I just run NPM install
- - safe to also create an entry deep
package.json file and then Mongoose and
this will go ahead and quickly install
Mongoose on my machine and once this is
installed I will head over to my apt J's
file where the requests are handled so
to say and I will important lose by
simply typing requirements here and I
will need to connect my app to the
Mongoose server or to the MongoDB server
I do this by using Mongoose and then the
connect method and this connect method
expects an input and the argument we
have to pass here is the path of our
server now my case this is of course
localhost
then port 2 7 o 17 and you can find out
this port in the console where you start
at the server and of course you have to
keep this terminal window open disk this
service running here wants to start up
you will find this starting info where
you will also see the port number and by
default it's 27,000 17 so 2 0 17 that is
why I entered this port here and then
with a slash I define the database I
want to use on this server because that
is only the path to the server until now
but the server might hold multiple
databases of course and I want to use a
database called shopping now you don't
have to create the database it will be
crypt automatically for you if it
doesn't exist yet so all you do is
basically just add slash shopping to use
that
now if this mongooses setup were yeah it
setup and we are connected to MongoDB
however we also need some way to
actually create a seed data so the data
which is in the database and right now I
won't provide a way for the user to
create new products or something like
this so how could we do that we'll have
a look at this in the next video see you
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
