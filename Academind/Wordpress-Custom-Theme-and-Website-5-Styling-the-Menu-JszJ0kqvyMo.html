had our top navigation or bottom
navigation don't be irritated I just
added one more item to it and yeah okay
we got navigation but doom to be honest
at last it doesn't look too fancy does
it so let's change something about this
now first thing is I'd like you to add
one additional item to your footer
navigation as well and if you forgot how
this works
you just go to your menus option here in
the appearance section of your on your
dashboard you either create a new for
our menu if you don't have one yet where
you edit it by just selecting the menu
to edit in my case I already have one
footer menu item air links and then you
just want to click one of these pages
here and add to menu until you have at
least two that hit save and you should
be on the same line how games YUM I'd
like to have some various changes to to
our navigation first I don't want these
bullet points I want all the links to be
lined up next to each other both for the
top and bottom navigation so let's do
this so in our style of CSS we got our
currently menu class styling with the
blue background color and be aware that
the menu class is not added to some div
around our menu but to the unordered
list which holds our menu links and
therefore if we want to style this
unordered list all we have to do is to
write unordered list dot menu with no
space between so that only unordered
lists which have a class of menu are
targeted because we don't want our menu
styling to apply to every unordered list
we might have anywhere on our site so to
get started
get rid of the padding and a margin of
the unordered list also we don't wanna
list I so this style of non should be
good if we refresh ok we can see that
the background is gone because I deleted
it but also the bullet points and and
also a gap so next step is to align
those item apps and I'm going to do this
by targeting unread listed menu done
space Li for the list items within this
unordered list and I'll set some padding
here of 0 from top and bottom but 16
pixels left and right
and I also want to get a set display to
inline block so that they appear in one
line okay so now we get our spaced out
links but obviously we want them to
align here we won't have some spacing to
the top and so we basically need to wrap
them in a container
so let's inspect if you already do have
in a container here and we do have a
container of menu menu one container and
in the for its menu footer menu links
container and we can't really use these
containers because the names of the
containers are actually the names we
provide in our dashboard and we can't
know them and at once because that's
something the user sets so we can't work
with that what we can do is go to our
header of PHP
and at one additional argument here and
this argument is called container class
which says add a container to our menu
and add this class we specify here so
I'm calling this menu header and I want
the same thing at our footer container
class will be menu fuller and now we can
style our two menus independently and
also independently of which names the
user might set so let's begin with the
header menu header and menu footer so
what's wrong we're beginning with both
should have a padding of 16 pixels from
top and bottom and 32 pixels from left
and right just like our main section
does also have a margin of 32 pixels so
if you refresh now mmm looks better but
now it's too much to the right it's not
aligned on the left edge now this comes
because here we specified a pairing of
16 pixels to left and right on each menu
item here so first thing I'm going to do
is actually just setting this for the
header menu and I can directly target a
list item within this menu header or
class because I will do it differently
in the footer later so let's remove it
here and I also want to make sure that
our last our first of nation not fist
first of type item will
no petting left and symmetrically I want
the last of type item to have no padding
to the right so if we now refresh we
will see that this helm item moves to
the left and perfectly aligned to the
sash there we go
and the same goes for the footer because
we just removed to the padding overall
that's why as we only set the 16 pixels
in the header this is much closer to
each other
then the header navigation links are
okay so we're we're getting there now
what I also wanna do is I wanna increase
the font size of our header navigation
items menu header will have a font size
of let's say 28 pixels where is in the
footer I want to have them smaller than
the rest of the content so I'm gonna set
font size of 14 pixels now let's refresh
again and now we got this much bigger
navigation here and a smaller one here
okay now these links look ugly let's do
something about this menu header a link
and menu error
oops a wizard will have style of let's
say we add a nice read and I got one
prepared here
this is a if 15.5 and we don't want any
text decoration
okay now everything's ready now this is
wrong
all right I want this different mm-hm
where's it went is for hover and active
so there I want the color of a one five
and text decoration of non two and here
I think a dark gray will fit better so
now everything is great but if we hover
over it we get this nice red now I think
it would also be cool to set all items
to a phone weight of bolt yeah I think
this looks cool so we're getting there
now I also want to have some border at
the bottom of our navigation here so I'm
going to go to menu header and set
border bottom off let's say two pixels
also dark grey oh and it is a solid
border
mmm-hmm doesn't look too shabby mmm I've
also think the webpage were currently on
so in this case the home page should be
highlighted in this red by default
now what press makes that easy for us
because it automatically adds a class of
current menu item as you can see when
you inspect it current menu item here to
the menu item of the webpage you're
currently on so we can just style this
class current menu item will have a
color of our red here oh not the item
itself but link current menu item okay
so now we've got this in red by default
and still get our hover effect so thank
this looks a lot better already
maybe add some shadow to this border
back to this class box shadow vertically
maybe to pixels syrup pixels
horizontally a little bit of spreads and
also it was a dark grey
mm maybe this should be one pixel in
don't think this looks better don't use
this white pixels here yeah that looks
good
now add the footer menu we also have got
some work to do now and one reason links
to be in dark gray every time even if
you are on the page and I want to have
some vertical lines between them now
there are different ways to achieve this
but I'm going to show you a pure CSS one
so first night let's make sure that all
links in the footer are Rea all the time
so at the bottom who has started CSS I'm
gonna add menu folder a link and menu
footer a where the third is how the
color of the dark gray if you hover over
them however I also wanted mice rats
however and the active will get a color
of a of 15.5 oh and also let's make sure
that we don't have any text decoration
text decoration of non no underlines
mmm-hmm that looks good now let's add
these vertical lines I'm going to do
this by selecting menu folder Li after
this is absurd a selector of CSS and it
says enter some content after the
selected item so therefore we provide
the content property and quotation marks
we will basically write the text which
should be appended to every selected
item in this case all li items in the
menu Fuller class so we'll have space
then pipe space and this should also be
in dark grey if we now refresh we get
these nice pipes here but obviously we
don't want to have one after the last
menu item so we're gonna remove this by
writing menu footer Li last of type
after to select the last menu item in
the bottom four and for our navigation
and here we're gonna set content to
empty quotation marks so that nothing is
added okay cool so this looks the way I
want now I also want to style our posts
a little bit nicer and we will work in
increments and all the next videos on
this but when I want to do now as let's
add at least a horizontal line between
blog posts but not after the last one
now to do this we also need to wrap our
blog posts in containers and you might
think that we could add some argument
with some add class stuff again but we
don't have to do this because we already
are in full control of how our post
content is displayed and we got our
content onto PHP where we actually
render
our blog post so all we're gonna do is
manually add a div item here with the
class of let's say blog post and mine
doesn't like Dash's blog post and copy
all of our code inside it so nothing
changes as of yet as we just said in the
intuitive or more syntactically correct
let's use an article element I think
that's a semantically the better way
nonetheless let's get into styling it as
I said it would be nice to have a
horizontal line at the end of our blog
post so something like a border bottom
when pixels solid and then maybe some
gray and I left this along with you
because I've seen it's interesting as
you can see it looks good but we only
have it after the last post at not
between two posts this is because I
didn't look at this code long enough
it's wrong to wrap this whole code into
our class because this code contains our
loop where we loop through all blog
posts so if we do it this way we're
wrapping all of our blog posts into a
container however we want to wrap every
single one into a container this is
where we have to add our article tags
between these loop controls here so like
this so that's the way to do it and if
we now refresh we will get an additional
line yeah like this now if you remove
the last line which we don't want we go
back to our style.css and you already
know this trick blog post last of type
will have a border of Nan now if we
refresh we don't have a border at the
last blog post anymore
now maybe let's try this a little bit
more here's a little best little ass
margin this in a different color we get
a margin here of 32 pixels and we got
one here so back to our style of CSS the
main section has a margin of 32 pixels I
think I want less to top and bottom so
16 pixels should be enough here and if
we refresh yeah that looks better and
now that's also style our h1 tag
differently I wanted to have a color of
dark grey and a different font would
also look great I think so I'm over at
Google Fonts and I've looked around a
little bit and I think this XO font
wouldn't look too bad just bleak just so
together we just click here on quick use
and I want it in the ultra bold version
I think just as oh okay and then we just
copied this link here go back to our
editor to index dot PHP excuse me -
header dot PHP and inside our head
section right above the W PDF function
which is pasted in this link and now we
can use our font and it's important
please notice to paste it in above this
WP head because if we were to paste it
in below our style of CSS file which
gets inserted here you through this hook
would not be able to use to phone if
this one
would be above this link because the
link would get loaded after our statute
would get loaded so let's set a font
family of EXO and the full Bank of San
serif yeah
maybe a little bit bigger let's leave it
like that for the moment so in the next
video we're going to do something about
these posts shall I show you how to
create an index page where we just got
summaries and single pages when we click
on a post where we got the whole post
itself and we also tuned this styling a
little bit more so I hope to see you
soon leave some feedback if you want and
have a nice day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
