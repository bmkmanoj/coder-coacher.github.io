talk about form validation with
JavaScript for that we will work on this
form right here at the moment we don't
have any inputs and we have this grayed
out button down here and if I click on
to it well nothing is happening but we
want to add code javascript code which
allows us to achieve the following if I
enter a value any kind of value into
this name field could be a single letter
or my name manual for example and an
email a valid email we will talk about
what is valid throughout this video so
let's say test at tesco maybe and then a
message so again just a single letter or
word so if I enter an age for hello for
example then you can see that the submit
button down here immediately changes its
color if I was for example delete the
name right here it would be gray again
so let's add another letter and if I
would delete D add for example from the
email it would also be gray and the same
thing would be true if I delete the dot
for example now that's the one thing we
want to make sure that the button
changes the color once we have valid
inputs for our fields but in addition to
that if we then click this activated
button then I want to log out submitted
right here to our console this means we
will prevent the default behavior the
default behavior of a form would be to
send a request a get or post request to
a server so we also want to prevent this
default behavior and console lock
submitted right here
that's it let's see how we can do this
now
now this video is about the form
validation in JavaScript but what if you
never heard about forms before
well a form generally is something like
that
it's a page that allows a user to enter
information but to also submit this
information to a server this works with
a request a get or post request by the
way now in case you never heard about
these concepts before make sure to have
a look at two articles you can find a
link to the articles in the video
description by the way the first article
is this one right here it's this your
first HTML form article on the MDM if
you have a look at this article you will
find out all the core concepts we have
when it comes to creating forms in HTML
also very important you will also find
out more about the form element right
here this special element we use to
create such a form and about the
elements inside this form D so called
widgets for example this input or this
text area element but here so definitely
make sure to check out that to
understand the general concept of a form
in addition to that also make sure to
read through this article sending from
data as I said this will talk about the
submit event so this event that happens
once we click on to this button and also
about this get and post requests because
the information will be sent to a server
now if these things clarified let's now
think about form validation in
JavaScript now if these things clarified
let's now go back to our page and add
the form validation with JavaScript for
that we have two goals the first goal is
as we saw it in the intro to make sure
that the button changes the color once
all our inputs are valid and the second
goal is to make sure that this button is
clickable and that we also output this
submitted text to our console let's
focus on to this changing background
color thing first because for that we
need access to these two fields this
text area and the button and then we
have to tell our code basically when the
puts into these fields are valid and
that the button should change the
background-color so basically our button
needs to be able to understand what
happens to our fields right here for
that let's go back to our code and let's
have a quick look at the HTML code this
is our form right here and as we can see
the first input right here has the ID
input name then we have the second input
this male input with the ID input male
the third one our message has the input
message ID and then we have our button
with the submit button class right here
so let's first get access to all these
elements for that we go to the main
choice file and now we simply apply
concepts we know from the previous
videos in this series so we declare a
variable which we could call input name
for example and let's now add document
get element by ID so we will use the ID
selector this time and I forgot the ID
to be honest its input name so let's add
input name right here and now we can
simply copy this two times actually
three times and now change name to male
like that and also input male right
because that's what we want to access
right here and then we have the third
one which is message it should also be
input message right here and for the
last variable we want to access our
button so let's maybe name the variable
button and I will use the fury selector
right here like that and now we will
access the submit button class right
here this one so let's add it right
there and don't forget to add dot to
make sure the class is selected
correctly so now we can select all these
elements and now we have to define a
function and in this function we simply
want to check if our fields have a value
as an input and if the fields have a
value then the background color of our
button should change now let's do this
step
step and let's start by creating our
function and this function could be
called check input maybe as you prefer
and inside this function we now need to
check if the inputs are valid as I said
for that a so called if statement
definitely is not the worst idea so
let's add it let's say if and now we
need to specify a condition so what
should happen to our inputs to make sure
that this if condition is true well
actually it's quite easy we simply have
to say that our input name this object
right here so basically our field
well this fields input name this fields
now we need to access a specific
property because this fields value right
because that's what's interesting if
this field contains a special value then
this if condition is true and actually
we do not have to specify a special
value because we could just think about
it the other way around because we could
either check if this field contains any
value or any specific value or we could
just say that if the value of this field
is not equal so this right here this
comparison operator
exactly checks that so is not equal to
what - empty because if it would be
empty then it would not be true but as
soon as we enter any value into this
field this should become true that's
maybe not the perfect solution for that
but I think it's a really nice approach
to understand the basic concept behind
this validation logic right here so with
that we said that if our input value is
not equal to Mt then this is true that's
the first case so what should happen if
this is true well then we want to access
our button and what do we want to access
we also learned that for this series we
want to access the style property
specifically this time we want to access
the background color and whenever this
condition is true
then the background color of our button
should change to let's say F a 9 to 3 F
like that so that's the first condition
so if this condition is true then this
should happen but what if this is not
true so if we don't have any value in
our field well then we have to say else
well else it's pretty easy right we
simply have to add button style
background color once again and now we
could set it equal to the default color
so to this gray right here and this can
be found in this style CSS sheet right
here in the submit button selector so
this code right here including the hash
and we can simply paste it right here
don't forget to add the semicolon and
with that we actually defined that
function already we only defined it for
the first input field input name though
but the general concept is finished the
only problem we have though is that well
this function doesn't get called at the
moment so we didn't tell our code when
it should execute this function the good
thing is that we have a really nice
approach that we can use right here
which allows us to execute or access
this function whenever we add any kind
of input into our name field this can be
added by simply going to the HTML file
and now we go to our input right here
the second one with the ID input name
and now we simply add the on input
attribute right here this attribute well
as the name actually indicates simply
reacts to any kind of input that we have
for our input field right here so in
easy words whenever we type anything
into this field so this on input can
react to these values we enter and how
does it react well it reacts by calling
a specific function and as we already
defined a function this one right here
our check input function I think it
might be good idea to simply add
this check input function right now for
this on input attribute so check input
important also add the parentheses
because you really want to call this
function we don't want to point to this
function we want to call and therefore
execute it really important to add this
right here but with that we actually
have a nice structure right we made sure
that we have a way to kind of listen to
events so to this input event right here
whenever we type anything and once we
enter a value we will execute this
function right here which hopefully then
changes the background color of our
button let's see if we reload the page
if this works so if I enter a for
example right here yeah as you can see
once I enter a value the background
color of the button immediately changes
this also works if I enter multiple
values of course it stays orange but
once I delete the values the button gets
grey again we do have one issue though
because if I just enter a space now the
button color also changes that's
probably not what we want at the moment
because we only want to change our
buttons color if we enter any value but
not a space so any value different from
a space a white space basically the good
thing is that we can easily trim our
function with a method that's well
actually called like that the trim
method so if we go back to the code and
now simply add after the value property
this trim method like that including the
parentheses again like that well then
the value will be trimmed this means any
white space to the left or to the right
of our string will be deleted basically
now what does this mean if we save that
and go back then if I would add a space
now the button color doesn't change but
if I type space hello it will change
again so that's basically how you can
easily get rid of such white spaces to
the left and to the right of your
strings so that was the first step we
made sure that the
name field now is I feel that our button
recognizes and that he can react you but
we also have the mail and the message
field let's quickly add the message
field first because the logic is exactly
the same and then have a look at the
mail because for the mail I want to make
a more specific a more tailored check to
see if the mail is really valid now
let's work on the message and as I said
this is quite simple actually because
it's basically the same code right here
the only thing we have to changes we
have to change input name to input
message so we can simply take this part
right here like that and now in a space
and copy it right here now we change
name to message right because this is
the variable name we have right here and
now this won't work because we have to
add a specific operator a so-called
logical operator to our code because
what we want to tell our if statement
right here is that it should check if
this condition right here is true the
first one and that's important thing and
the second condition should also be
checked and we should see if this is
true or not and as I said the logical
operator we need for that is the end
logical operator and we simply added by
typing and this end symbol two times and
now the if statement will check if the
first condition right here and this
second condition if both are true and if
that's the case then this code right
here will be executed
however we can save this but we also
have to add our own input attribute to D
message of course because otherwise the
event that we type a value into our
message field cannot be recognized by
our JavaScript code so let's simply copy
this code right here and edit down here
after our input message ID right there
for example with that if we go back load
the page and type a right here we
get an error cannot read property let's
see yeah I got a typo right here this
should of course be written with a small
M not a capital M sorry for that
but we're saving that and we loading the
page this should work perfectly now so
let's see if I type a right here and
also any kind of value for the message
then you see that our submit button
changes its color if I delete this right
here it turns grey again if I at this
one it gets orange and if I delete this
one it also turns back to gray so this
validation is also working now so we
have the name and the message validated
the only problem now is the mail because
as I said I want to make sure that we
have a better a more specific validation
method for that and I will use reg X for
this purpose reg X stands for regular
expressions and these rhetorics simply
allow us to check if our code meets
certain or specific patterns in case you
never heard about these make sure to
have a look at this serious right here
because in there max gives you a really
cool introduction into reg X so
therefore make sure to check this out in
case you're not sure about how read
checks generally work however we want to
add a reg X now for our mail validation
this means we first have to add another
variable up here I will call this
variable
well maybe reg X and now we will simply
add two slashes like that and in between
these slashes I will now paste a regular
expression you can find the irregular
expression in the video description by
the way so let me paste that right here
and at the semicolon and without diving
into the details behind this rather
simple regular expression this simply
checks if we have a value different from
a white space right here then an @
symbol which makes sense for an email I
guess then it checks again if we have a
value different from a white space then
if we have a dot and then it checks for
another value different from a white
space of
course this will not check for any kind
of email combination that we can imagine
but that's not the idea of this video
you can of course add any regular
expression of your choice right here
the important thing is that you
understand the logic how you can do this
so we have our rhetorics up here but now
we need to include it as a condition in
our if statement how can we do this well
first we will add another logical
operator the end operator because I want
to have the check for the email as the
second condition just to follow along
the flow in our form right here and now
we can use a special read checks syntax
which simply works like that we add read
checks so our variable right here that
we defined and now we add the test
method right here don't forget to add
the parentheses right here because
inside the parentheses we now simply
have to specify what should be tested
against this rhetorics right here well
and in our case this is of course our
input mail because if we paste it right
here and now specified that for input
mail a specific property should be
tested against this parentheses and
which property could that be well D
value property once again that's
actually exactly the same logic we had
for our input name and for our input
message but now we're just testing this
value against this regular expression
with that we cannot make sure that we
have a better email validation
implemented but we also have to make
sure that we add our own input attribute
right here also to our second input this
one right here for our email so let's
add this quickly right here like that
well and if we now did a good job then
if we reload the page and enter a value
right here a valid email which could be
something like test at test.com and
another value for the message then our
submit button changed its color that's
pretty good
if I get rid of that right here it turns
gray again that's what we saw already
but
now delete the dot for example you can
see that the button turns back to gray
so it's invalid again and if I get rid
of the ad for example same thing happens
and the same thing should be true if I
delete the values in front of the ad
symbol for example so this works quite
nice actually by the way in case you
wonder why we didn't have something like
equals true or something like that
right here to our regex test well this
is simply due to the fact that if we
write the code like this inside our if
statement the result will automatically
be true or false and if the result of
this test is true then our if condition
will be met that's just a side note
however we have this nice color for the
button and now it's orange but if I
click on to it well still nothing is
happening and this is due to the fact
that at the moment we have here for our
button now there the disabled attribute
added and because of that the button is
well as the name indicates disabled
therefore we cannot click it now in the
first step I want to make this button
clickable again for that we can use the
JavaScript logic we added so far and
simply add the button with the disabled
attribute now now at the moment the
disabled attribute is true it is
activated you could say and therefore we
cannot click the button but if I now
change this abled to false right here
like that without any quotation marks
because we don't want to have a string
right here this should be a boolean a
so-called boolean so we could have true
or false in that case here we need false
because if the condition is met so if
the button changes our background color
it should also be clickable therefore
disabled should be set to false now we
should also add the button right here
for our else case so if the conditions
are not met then our button should of
course be disabled therefore
we said it right here too true so if we
now go back reload the page add some
valid values right here like that and
now well before I submit the button let
me show you right here my address bar
appear and please note that right now
the URL ends with HTML that's important
because if we now click on to submit
this hopefully changes let's see you
well first we saw that the zoom changed
let's make it like that again well now
you can see some interesting things the
first thing is that the form was cleared
again because the form was now submitted
but more interestingly we can also see
that now after HTML right here we have
the actual content of our form added to
our URL here we have the name which was
equal to a we have our email with test
at test comm and we have the message
which was equal to a not the most
creative content though but still we can
see that this was added to our URL now I
won't dive into the details behind what
was happening right here now as I said
make sure to check out the mdn article
this one right here sending form data in
case this is totally new for you the
only important thing I want to focus on
right now is that with the button being
enabled again we are able to fire a
submit event and as I didn't add any
kind of attributes right here to our
form normally you would add two
attributes at least you would add the
action attribute which would define
where this form should be submitted to
and you would also define a method I get
or post would be the values for that and
in my case right here I didn't specify
any of these attributes therefore the
method is get and the action so where
this form of be submitted to is the
current page in our browser
therefore it's this page right here and
we add the content
here because well it's a get request as
I said I won't dive too deep into this
right now the important thing is that
basically our submit button is working
now but there might be cases but you
might say well I don't want this request
this get requests in our case to happen
immediately this means I want to prevent
the default behavior after the submit
event right here was fired now the good
thing is that with JavaScript we can
also easily do that the only thing we
need for that is access to the actual
form element now let's quickly get this
access by going back to the code right
here and now adding a variable named
form and this should simply give us the
access as I said to our form we will
access the form of a class selector and
the class is well form so it's quite
easy so let's select the form class
right here and now maybe down here we
can add an event listener to this class
so we will simply type form add event
listener also something we learned about
in the previous parts of the series by
the way and now we will add submit as
the event this event listener should
listen to because that's what happens if
we click onto the submit button a submit
event will occur now with this event we
also have to define a function and we
will define a special function for that
because whenever an event occurs in
JavaScript a default event object is
generated now again I won't dive into
the details behind that but the
important thing is that we can listen to
this event and we can actually access
this event now how can we do this well
we first have to add a parameter to this
event this parameter could have any name
you want I will just name it event right
now and now I want to do two things
first I want to make sure that this
default event that happens after
clicking onto the submit button is
prevented
and what is this event while they click
onto the submit button and with that the
request will be sent to a server and I
want to prevent this request I don't
want this to happen for that I simply
type event now like that because that's
right here our default event object
basically and now we type prevent
default including the parentheses right
here in addition to that I will add a
console log like that and log well the
event to see what's actually happening
right here if I now go back and reload
our page or maybe even quickly jump to
the home page and go back to the contact
page to make sure that the URL doesn't
include our content of the forum that we
added right here and if I now add name
valid email and a message well if I now
hit submit once again then you can see
two interesting things you can see that
the URL ends still with HTML so we
didn't add the actual content of our
form right here as we did it before and
therefore the get request wasn't sent to
the server because well we prevent this
default behavior with this method right
here and we also locked the actual event
and if we click right here you can for
example see that the default behavior
indeed was prevented so let me quickly
summarize that we made sure that once we
click onto the submit button the submit
event is fired but the default event
which would send a request to a server
is not occurring
right now but we could do right now is
we could also add something like
console.log may be submitted like that
to kind of display our own message right
here so if we reload ad test add test
com
like that and now press submit now you
can see that we print submit it to our
console another question is why would I
want to prevent this default event from
happening well that could be various
reasons one reason could be for example
that you want to further process the
information your user would send you
through this form you could add some
additional information to it for example
and by controlling the actual requests
by controlling the fact when it should
be submitted you can easily do that and
by that gain additional well form
control and that's it actually that was
a very basic example how you could
implement form validation with
JavaScript now of course there are
multiple ways how to implement form
validation in your code you could also
do it on the server side for example but
the purpose of this video really was to
get you started with JavaScript to let
you dive deeper a bit and to get an
understanding how you can apply all
these different theoretical concepts
like D if condition we had like event
listeners or also like the prevent
default method to trim method and more
and with that I can only say well thanks
a lot for watching and I hope to see you
in one of the next videos of this series
