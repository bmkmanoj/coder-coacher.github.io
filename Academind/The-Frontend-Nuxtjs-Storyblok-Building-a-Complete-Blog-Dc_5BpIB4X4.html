have content on next chairs and also a
little bit on story block a content
management system which we use on our
page behind the scenes and I thought why
don't we build a project with both this
is what we'll have by the end of this
video but this video is only the first
in a mini series of videos where we will
build an entire block with knacks chairs
and view chairs for our front-end with
this awesome about us page but see a
little bit better looking post page here
and where a story block the content
management system will also be set up
from scratch so that you will learn how
you can create posts there and load them
into your front-end like this so let's
get started with the first steps in this
video
now to get started we need a next
project I will use create next app which
is like a CLI a command-line interface
which makes the creation of Munich's
projects very easy you can simply Google
for create next app and you will find
this github page here of their project
basically now there you all defined
setup instructions and if you got npm
version 5.2 or a higher installed you
can use that useful npx command you get
that npm version simply by visiting
node.js org and by downloading and
installing the latest version there
which you'll need anyways to develop a
next application so this is the command
you want to run to create a new project
and I will run it in my terminal
navigated into the folder where I want
to create my project folder so I'll run
npx create - next - up here and then the
name of the project and I'll name it
story block - block because we're going
to build a blog with well story block as
a bagand story block is a content
management system so let's hit enter
here and now we're asked a couple of
questions the name of the project the
the description if you want to use a
server framework but I don't because I
won't write any server-side code we will
use these server side rendering
capabilities of next but I won't add any
other server-side code so I'll pick non
here then if we want to use a UI
framework I'll also pick non here though
you could of course implement or add
bootstrap beautify whatever you want
here if you want to build a universal or
a single page application and you can
always change that you can change that
from within the next config file later
on but I will go with universal right
from the start because hey that's one of
the coolest features of next then if you
want to include the Axios module now
Axios is JavaScript Ajax library and I
want to use it I want to send Ajax
requests so let's say yes linting why
not let's add it my name that's correct
and which package manager I want to use
and I will go with NPM now this will
creates the prod
checked and automatically install all
the dependencies and once it's done I'll
open it with Visual Studio code which is
the IDE I'm going to use it's free it's
great
why wouldn't we use it so let's wait for
it to finish and here we are inside of
the ID I'll open the terminal that's
simply the terminal which ships with
Visual Studio code it's the normal
system terminal though and it's already
navigated into that project folder now
in there we can run npm run dev to start
the development server to preview our
application now this development server
will automatically reload whenever we
change something in a code so that's
really awesome it does a lot of work for
us it opens this page there after a
localhost 3000 is the default address
and here we just got some starting page
which well it's given to us out of the
box and a new project created with
create NOC step now also use get so let
me quickly open a new tab in this
terminal keep the other process running
though you want to keep that development
server running as long as you work on it
and then I'll quickly do my initial
commit so that I later can also share my
code with you so this is the default
structure and new next project ships
with and if this is all brand new to you
check out the next resources I already
got of course the most important one my
udemy course but also the articles the
video here on YouTube got a lot of
resources on that so to have to check
that out links in the video description
and next works a lot with so called
pages now in my blog here I'm gonna have
three page that's essentially the
starting page which we already got here
then and about as page which just holds
some dummy content but every blog has
one so let's add one and a page to load
a single blog post so if we click on a
post from the list of posts then this
single blog post should open to create
more pages we need to add files or
folders in the pages folder and I liked
an approach of creating a subfolder for
every path segment which then holds an
index but view
faul so let's create 140 about page it's
simply an about folder in the pages
folder and in that about folder I'll add
an index dot view file and this is the
file holding the content which we will
see once we wizard the about page I'll
also add another folder in the pages
folder and this is the folder which
holds the page that should get loaded if
we click on a blog post now such a blog
post of course will have some ID some
identifier and this identifier should be
encoded in the URL so that we
essentially can get this blog post we
want to load from the URL and
dynamically load it into this page
because I certainly don't want to hard
code a page for every blog post will
eventually have this is impossible to do
during development so here I expect to
get a post ID and I'll name the folder
post id therefore and in that folder
I'll again at my index dot view fall
this will later hold the content for a
single post now let's go back to the
about page though that is very easy to
finish let's work on that first and in
there we create a normal view component
because it's a dot view file a single
component file in that template I want
to create a section so the normal HTML
section element and I'll give that
section an ID which is about - page and
on this about page I want to have some
title where we say hey that's us welcome
to this page so maybe h1 tag hi that's
us we can always treat this later
and some text so here we could say we're
a bunch of highly motivated and talented
people blogging about tech stuff so
that's my awesome about page and we can
already see it in action if we go to our
page and there if we enter slash about
after the 3000 from localhost 3000 there
we see our content in the top left
corner I would agree that we can't
improve this from our styling
perspective
no probably also from a Content
perspective but let's stick to that for
now but I want to focus on the blog part
on the back end on the dynamic part I
guess that's more interesting so here we
got our about page not finished but it's
it's good for now we'll revisit it later
let's now work on the front page and the
general styling of our application I
want to control the general styling in
my main layout which we can find in the
layouts folder there you find a default
view file and in that default dot view
file you find well the starting code
this new project gave you out-of-the-box
I will actually get rid of all of that
because I want to write it for myself
and first of all I'll add the CSS
universal selector to select all
elements and I'll set box sizing to
border box because I hate that behavior
of content box where we end up with
where's sizes because the size is
calculated based on the content and so
on so let's use that to reset this CSS
behavior and let's also maybe add a nice
font to this application now of course
we can add a font with font family and
please note that I set up my body style
here in the style text of a default of
you file and I'm not using this style
scoping feature so this will really be
applied anywhere on the page because in
case you didn't know the pages we load
from the pages folder will get rendered
in the place of the next hook here so
this default layout here wraps all the
pages so the style setup here are
applied to every page and as I said I
want to use a font family and we could
just use cents serif here for example to
use the browser defaults and serif font
if I reload this page doesn't look too
bad but we can improve this I want to
use a custom font for that I'll wizard
google fonts simply Google for it and
the font I want use is called lotto Leto
I don't know so this one if we click the
plus we get this feature here at the
bottom which allows us to easily
implement this font on our page
and I'll also grab the Baldwin just in
case we need it and now we would
normally take that link here go back to
our code and paste that into our
index.html file or in whichever HTML
file we want to use it in the little
problem we have with the snacks project
is that we got no HTML file to paste
this in we got a bunch of dot view files
but no HTML file well we got that next
config file though in here we see a
bunch of interesting stuff and we get
this head sections of this head property
in the exported object this essentially
allows us to define which content should
be rendered in the head area of our page
actually we also can add some content
here which is rendered at the end of
body scripts and so on because this uses
view meta behind the scenes a third
party package that makes the addition of
meta tags and so on very easy and it
doesn't just focus on meta text of which
we also render some as you can see here
it also helps us with the rendering of
links here we're having a link to the
favicon but now I can and add a new link
with by adding a JavaScript object here
in this array in this link array to be
precise and I'll give this a real
property of stylesheet and then if you
go back we need to set the hyper
reference attribute to this link which
all go back and simply add an H ref
property and set it to a string which
holds this link if I save this now it
imports Lotto so let's go back to the
default of you file in the layouts
folder and let's use dead and then fall
back to send Seraph so now if we use
that maybe put it between double
quotation marks though would work
otherwise - but this is cleaner now we
can go back to our page and reload and
we see that font changed and if we
inspect it and open in the browser tools
here the developer tools we can see that
our text here indeed receives the
lotta font-family and it does so because
if we open the head section here we see
that this link tag here was added and of
course this happens because we added
this link entry in the next config file
so this is then handled by next end by
the view meta package I mentioned this
is then handled and basically turned
into such a HTML element which is
injected automatically for us now whilst
we're here we can also change the title
here from package name maybe to story
block plus next equals love and you
could also enter any description you
want here this is the meta tag to this
description meta tag which will define
the description you see on the Google
search when finding this page so here we
can simply add an awesome blog about
tech stuff built with next and story
block so this is my description which I
want to enter here maybe I shouldn't
have deleted the content property or
though so content and the values and the
description here and now if we save this
it should still work this is just a tiny
update affecting the title we can see up
here and also of course having an effect
on this content meta tag this one here
with that we're still on the styling
side but this was important this is
important to understand how it works
now I'm back in my default dot view file
and now I just want you wrap my next
part here so this next tag with the main
element text so this is a default HTML
element main and I'll give it a class of
main - content and down there in my
style tags all give main content a style
of margin top 4.5 Ram so that we have
some spacing to the top until we will
later add a header that being said let's
add such a head
because it would be nice if we could go
back to the starting page so we want to
add a header and a header is also a view
component but not a page we don't load
it standalone to occupy the entire page
instead it goes into the components
folder because it'll be a reusable
component will actually only use it once
but it will affect all the pages of our
app and anything which isn't a page
simply goes into the components folder
so let's add the header there and for
that I'll add a subfolder which I named
the header this name might look strange
to you
but it actually follows the official
views style guide which basically tells
us that if we build a component that we
will only use once and we will only use
the header once we should name it there
and then the component name so here it's
the header and it holds the the header
dot view file which is the actual
component I guess now in the their
header file I'll add my template I'll
add a header HTML element here which
I'll give CSS class of main header and
which will also give a nav element as a
child which will also receive a class
and here the class's main - Neph now in
that navigation element here I'll add an
unordered list which will give a class
of nav links and in that unordered list
I'll now add a cup of next link objects
now next link is a new element when you
don't know from vanilla beauteous
because next link allows you to link to
a different next page it's essentially
the same as a router link in a normal
view arm project in here I'll add a link
to all posts you could also name this
home I guess
and one link to the about page now you
might say there's one thing missing here
the list item right we should wrap this
next link in a list item because we're
in the unordered list and you'd be right
semantically we should add a list item
but I'll not wrap the next link with one
I'll instead take advantage of the tech
property which I can set on it and there
I will set tag to Li this means the link
will actually be a list item object or
element but this also means that we need
to nest a anchor tag without any
attributes inside of it so just an empty
anchor tag and this will then be handled
by by next door by view behind the
scenes to be precise and it will give us
a anchor tag wrapped with a link wrapped
with a list item where we can click the
entire list item so here tag is also Li
now we got this set up one thing that's
missing of course is the two property
which defines where this should lead to
and for all posts I want to go to the
start page for about I wanna go to the
about page so here it's just slash about
now we got our basic header set up we
can probably still improve this a bit
but let's take this for now and let's
add a style tag here now we can also add
scoped here to ensure that whichever
Styles we set up here are only applied
to the header and this is a fine
solution to ensure that we don't
accidentally overwrite our Styles
somewhere else in the application though
you could of course also use a CSS
technique like ve m block element
modifier to ensure the same but here I
will use my my style like this and I'll
add main header now main header is fixed
or should be fixed to the top will
therefore receive top and left off 0
should span the entire width of the page
and should also maybe have a background
color and for that I picked a nice color
which is 0 to 2 D 30 this is a dark
bluish color now if we save that in
order to see it we need to use that
header and I want to use it in my
default layout because of course it
should be visible on every page so I
need to include it on every page and
what is included on every page the
layout it holds
the part which is rendered why are the
pages folder in the end so in the
default of you fault
I want you use the header and for that
I'll add a script section in which I can
import my header component so I'll
import the header from and now in an ax
project we can use it as an alias for
the root folder so it's add slash
components slash the header slash the
header you can omit that view you should
emit DW because it will be added
automatically and then in this view
JavaScript object here I'll simply add
the components property and registered
the header like this this is taking
advantage of es6 I think feature which
will basically automatically expand this
property to their header the header so
if the value has the same name as the
property you can omit the value and the
colon and it will automatically expand
this so now we make the header component
available locally in this component it's
not a global component we can't use it
anywhere but I only want to use it here
so inside this div above my main section
I'll now add the header like this a self
closing tag and yes you can use it like
this with capital characters because
this is a template parsed by next or by
view to be precise and view of course is
case-sensitive so you can use case
sensitive tags there and actually this
is a recommended best practice though
you can also use the header like this
but since we got the possible that
you've using it like this why don't we
do so so now the header is included
let's now go back and reload and yeah we
can see the header there it is not super
beautiful but we can get there now let's
work on the look of the header of course
it's not entirely looking the way I
wanted to look so in that header we got
our nav element and in the nav element
we got the math links so maybe we should
stall these nav links a bit so let's add
a selector to nath links let's first of
all set the list style to non to remove
the bullet points
let's remove any margin and padding we
have we by default have one because it's
a unordered list element and I want to
use flexbox here to distribute the list
items next to each other so I'll set the
display here to flex and justify content
will then be lets say Center to Center
them in the middle of the navigation bar
and align items will all be Center two
also Center them vertically in the
navigation bar or in the entire header
actually I'll also give my nav legs a
height of 100% and that means I'll also
give my main nav a height of 100%
because this in turn allows me to give
my header a clearly defined height so
that everything is well adjusting itself
inside of that header and here I'll set
a height of 4.5 rim which happens to be
exactly the size I added as a margin top
on my main content this ensures that the
my main content doesn't go beneath the
header which is in a fixed position and
therefore taking out of the document
flow so now I added my height to the
header and to the main nav and to the
links and the links are now using
flexbox to position them next to each
other let's have a quick look at how
this looks like right now doesn't look
too bad the links of course need some
styling so I want to give my individual
link items some nice stars and for that
I'll actually add a CSS class to my next
links and I'll name it nav link here so
the nav link class is added to both
directly on the next link object this is
possible because it will be replaced by
a list item in the end so now we can go
down nav link was the class so let's
select nav link here like that and the
naff link itself doesn't really need a
style right now but the anchor tag I
want to style the anchor tag I want to
set it to display:block so that it takes
the full width of the list item I want
to remove the underline so text
decoration should
beam on and I'll give it a white color
so that we can see it a bit better in
front of the dark blue background now I
also want to target the naff link itself
so this list item element it should
receive a height of 100 percent so it
should take to full height off my of my
header I'll also set the display to Flex
here so that I can Center the text in
there vertically and I achieved this
centering by using justified content and
setting it to center and align items and
setting it to Center this will Center
the link text vertically and
horizontally in this linked list item
I'll add a margin of let's say 1 R M to
the left and right so that there is some
spacing between my linked items and I
want to add a padding of let's say 0.3
REM in all directions with that if we
save this this doesn't look too bad
actually
we got no hover effect or anything like
that but the links could look worse I
believe so let's now work on hover
effects for that I'll add another link
and now will ya nav link and then the
anchor tag select it if it's inside of
such an Earthling which of course is the
case and that'll add the hover pseudo
selector and the same with the active
pseudo selector so here I got a group
rule with two selectors for which the
same rule should apply and in that rule
I'll simply set the color to a lighter
blue for that I will use the hex code
0-6 C for D 1 now this should look nice
if we reload we can see does not choose
shabby now we're on the about page
wouldn't it be great if this would kind
of be visible here by well highlighting
this all the time the about part if we
inspect that about link we can actually
see that it get a couple of classes our
nav link class but all the very short
class name next link except active and
another class next link active sounds
like if we
the next link activeclass a style we
could always see that style whenever
this is active so let's give that a try
let's go back and let's now give our nav
link a different style I want to
essentially use the same style a half
for hovering and active so I'll add nav
link a and now only anchor tags which
have the next link active style if I do
that and I save and we reload nothing
changed so let's see yeah obviously this
is incorrect
I want to select all anchor tags that
are nested in the nav link where the nav
link has the next link active style
sorry about that so if we change the
next link active selector to the nav
link itself and we reload hmm both is
blue
the reason for this is that if we watch
closely in the developer tools we can
see that the aveline also got the next
link active style the reason for this is
that this other link leads to just slash
and actually the question wherever this
link is active or not is answered based
on whether the current path in our URL
starts with dead link and obviously
every path starts with just nothing
essentially so just a slash therefore
this is always active the reason why
this behavior works like this or why we
got it like this is of course that this
allows us to also mark a certain link in
the navigation is active if we are on a
child page and here we aren't though and
I want to have exact matching thankfully
there is this next link exact active
class this is only applied to the link
which is exactly active so where the
full path matches this link and that's
only the case for the second link on the
about page so we just need to tweak that
and say that we want to apply this color
to any anchor tag that's in an aflink
which has the next link exact active
class if we change it like this and we
go back now just the about page is
active if we go to all posts
just all post is active so this is
looking much better now the last but not
least I want to also tweet the style of
my Nath link so add another style where
I say Neff link with a class of next
link exact active should also get its
special style there I want to set a
border bottom of let's say 3 pixels
solid and also this bluish color here so
0-6 C 41 with that if we save and reload
now we can see that slight blue border
at the bottom for the active page now
this is the look I want to have for now
this is the look with which we can work
now let's see which next steps we can
take I think one next step we can take
is that we work on our index page right
now we still got the dummy content here
with which we started now I want to
render some posts there and then it's
also time to connect our back end
because we haven't done that at all
so here I'll actually get rid of all the
content in the page I'll get rid of that
logo component import and of the logo
component declaration in my script here
I'll also get rid of all the styles
which are set up here so that this is
completely empty and now we can also
delete that logo component in the
components folder so now we essentially
got an empty starting page no content at
all but also no error as you can see if
we reload so now let's work on that and
let's render a poster or a list of posts
actually for this the question of course
is how should a post look like now let's
create one let's maybe create an article
here an article element and that should
represent a single post so I'll give it
a class of post preview because actually
this will not be the entire post it's
just an excerpt to preview we can click
on this to reach the entire post and if
we can click on this we maybe should
also wrap this with a next link which
leads to the post page then in the end
now we created that single post page
already
don't forget that we got that indexed of
you file and you post a new folder and
therefore here to that next link I'll
also add the two property but that of
course should be populated dynamically
the exact link differs depending on
which post preview we're rendering here
so I'll expect you kind of loop through
a bunch of posts to then output them
here so maybe we need a data source
first let's go to our JavaScript object
for that and let's add the data method
and simply return an object in there so
this is standard view has nothing to do
with next or story block this is
standard view we can add data to this
component and never forget a page is
just a component and in there I now want
to set up a post property which is an
array where we could have multiple posts
a post is simply a JavaScript object
which has let's say a title a new
beginning to start very dramatically
which get a preview text let's say this
will be awesome don't miss it something
like that and also a thumbnail URL so a
URL leading to a thumbnail we stored on
some server now you can simply Google
any image you want with Google images
here I prepared a simple link will of
course add our own images once you got a
back-end and then I'll add an ID - new
beginning and ID doesn't have to be a
number after all it can be text it just
should be unique and let's say that our
back-end creates this uniquely now I'll
copy that and add a second object in
that array and here all named as a
second beginning which makes a lot of
sense I guess and give it an idea of
second beginning and leave the rest of
the content this is really just to play
around with it so now we got that posts
array and that could be posts as we
fetch them from a server I guess so now
let's loop through our posts
on this next link with v4 there I will
loop through my posts with the normal v4
syntax post in posts referring to that
posts property of course and if we use
v4 we should also use the key property
bind it to a dynamic value namely - post
ID now we can use that same ID as a link
because we expect to get the post ID as
part of the link anyways so why don't we
bind to dynamically and also bind that
to post ID I guess it makes a lot of
sense so now we're rendering a list of
posts which will be clickable which will
lead us to our single post page in the
end now on the page there's no content
yet but we'll get there step by step we
also get this well a little bit boring
article here because doesn't hold too
much content so in that article let's
add some content let's add a div with a
class of post preview thumbnail for
example and you can of course again use
different class names whatever you like
and that will actually hold my
background image now the background
image of course is also loaded
dynamically we got that URL here in our
object so we should access the thumbnail
URL and set it as a background image and
for this I'll simply bind style
dynamically and in case you're
relatively new to view this : dusty
dynamic binding this : ensures that
whatever we pass between the quotation
marks here is interpreted as a dynamic
value which has to be parsed by view and
the value I want to parse here is post
dot thumbnail URL so this will return a
string which in the end is then bound to
my style and that makes no sense we
should use a JavaScript object here
instead that's a syntax view we'll
understand
for this style property and the property
in that object should be the CSS
property we want to set so here this
will be background image in camel case
notation just as you access
Styles in JavaScript - because
background image with a - like this
would be an invalid JavaScript property
name and since this is a dynamic value
this is treated as JavaScript it is
executed as JavaScript so background
image should hold post thumbnail URL as
a value and this javascript object is
first and understood by view which will
then set the background image style on
this element so that was a lot of
talking for our background image here
let's also add a second death here which
will receive the class post preview
content and in here I want to have a h1
tag where I render my post title so now
I'm referring to this property here and
of course I also want to render my my
preview text so here I will also add a
paragraph where I render post preview
like that so now I'm referring to sorry
to this preview text should it be there
for so now I'm referring to preview text
here now we got our post let's save all
of that and reload and the styling is
missing but we can clearly see our post
here we got two posts and if we click
one we get an error because it does
navigate us to slash a second beginning
which is right but on that page we got
no content in our view components so
therefore it breaks additionally to the
page breaking this is not the most
beautiful layout I have ever seen so
let's work on this too and before we
work on this what could we do with this
HTML code in our page here well we could
put it into its own component view is
all about components so creating new
components to encapsulate certain
features is always a good idea so let's
go to the components folder here and
let's add a new subfolder there which
I'll name block and in that subfolder
I'll add a component which shall named
post preview dot view
will receive the template tags here and
there I now want to render my next link
with the blog when note though we have
to remove the we for loop and the key
property we will still loop through our
newly created component later not inside
of that component so this just holds a
single post preview and we will later
replicate the post preview component
therefore now of course the post preview
also needs some additional meat to live
to be precise all the data we're
rendering is now not available because
the post is not available here we have
to get that data from outside instead
and we do get it from outside with the
help of props of course props is a view
feature which allows us to set our own
attributes so to say on our own elements
so here prop is what I add to define
which props this component will receive
and I want to receive a title and I'll
use the more complex props definition
here where I then turn title into an
object so that I can define which type
this prop will be it'll be a string and
if it's required or not and it is
required and we will get an error if we
use this component incorrectly this
makes testing it and playing around with
it a bit easier during development so we
get the title I also want to have my
let's name it excerpt so that's my
preview text so my excerpt will also be
of type string and I also do require
this and I also want to have my
thumbnail image here so that will be of
type string cue it's a URL after all and
this will also be required so that
required true cue and last but not least
I get the ID of that post this will hold
to be a string as it turns out and this
will also be required so not the most
exciting props but hey it is what it is
now with these props being available we
know that they will be available because
we set them all to
required we can use them so instead of
post ID it's not just ID referring to
that ID property which we can access
from the template instead of post from
nail URL it's now just thumbnail URL
because no it's fun tail image excuse me
because that's what we set up here so
fun nail image instead of post title
it's just title because that's the name
of our prop here and instead of post
preview text it's now excerpt so now
this component would work once we pass
data from outside now let's all the work
on this styling whilst we're here first
of all I'll add my style text for this
and I'll scope my stylings here again so
that they can't leave this file and I
want to stall my anchor tag so I wrapped
this entire article with an anchor tag
in the end do two next link I want to
style this to remove any text decoration
that it would add and to set the color
to black so that our text color isn't
just blue I don't want to have too blue
color in my post here the post preview
itself
remember post preview this refers to the
article element here the post preview
itself should maybe get a border radius
of 3 R M let three pixels let's say I
also want to add a little box shadow of
one pixel one pixel maybe five pixels
and one pixels so this is XY blur and
spread and then give it a box shadow of
rgba 0 0 0.5 this will be a black shadow
with 50% transparency and I'll give it a
width of 90% so that the surrounding
container will have to decide how much
space this receives and a margin of auto
to Center it horizontally and a height
of let's say 20 REM next I want to stall
my post preview thumbnail so let's grab
this class here and add a CSS selector
for it
like that and the post preview thumbnail
will receive the actual image through
that dynamic binding we got here but of
course the positioning of the image dad
is something I want to define down here
so I'll set background position and set
it to center so that the image is always
nicely centered and I'll add background
size and set it to covered I also will
give it a width of 100% so it did it has
the full width of the surrounding
container and a height of let's say 10 R
M so that we can see something now I
also get my content so the post preview
content here let's also grab that and
let's add a selector for that down here
too and now the post preview content
should be well styling the text I have
in there so there I will add
text-align:center to make sure all the
text is nicely centered horizontally and
maybe a padding of when R M so that
unlike the image which should stretch to
the edges of the surrounding box this
doesn't I think this looks a bit nicer
since the surrounding box will have a
box shadow so I believe this doesn't
look too pretty if our content touches
the edges then so this is my layout for
now now this is actually written mu L
mobile first for bigger screens I'll add
a media query here standard CSS feature
and set a min width of let's say 35 REM
which by default equals 560 pixels and
for this layout so for screens that are
bigger than that so for tablets and
bigger I'll set my post previous style
to a width of 25 REM instead of these 90
% which I defined up here so that it's
not as broad on bigger screens and I'll
add a margin of 1 REM with that if we
save we see no content on the starting
page because we're not using the post
preview component so let's start using
it for this I'll go back to my index to
view file in the pages folder and first
of all I'll import it so I'll import
post preview from add components
blog post review like this now with that
added I have to register it
so in this javascript object of that
view component I'll add the components
key and I'll register post review like
this year now we can start using it and
now I want to use it together with a for
loop of course because we still got that
post data here so let's add v4 on our
component and still loop through all
posts with the same loop we used before
so nothing new here but of course I now
want to bind all the props post preview
receives so I want to bind title excerpt
thumbnail image and ID so let's do that
let's go back to the index page let's
bind title and they're all bound
dynamically because obviously the value
is dynamic I can't hard code it I don't
know it in advance
so here I'll bind post title then I'll
bind my second value which is the
excerpt that will now be this preview
text I believe so here it's preview text
to be precise it's post preview text
then we got the thumbnail image and
thereafter D I D so let's bind thumbnail
image to post thumbnail URL that's the
property name in the data here and let's
now also add our our last thing the ID
and it's bonded to post ID now with that
if we save we see our posts here now one
thing I also see is that I don't see the
image background image so there's an
error yeah there is a dump error in my
post preview dead image URL can't be
added as a value for background image
like this instead we want to use URL
here so we want to wrap this with URL in
a string and then with a closing
parenthesis because URL as a CSS
function that accepts a string URL and
which then converts this basically into
a value CA
can use for the background image so
let's add URL and wrap thumbnail image
with it now with that if we save it we
see our deliciously looking images so
this looks much better now one thing
that doesn't look as good is of course
the thing that if we increase the the
width they stay on the left and also
that here we got no no place no space to
the top for example so let's fix that
let's start with the space to the top
for this I'll go to my index to view
file in the pages folder and I'll simply
work on that container class which I got
here anyways I'll instead give it an ID
of posts because this is what I have
here and then I'll take this posts
selector and maybe add a scope styles
here too and I'll add a padding top of
let's say it um so now if I save this
now we got more space now regarding the
positioning I will go back to the code
and I will turn this to be Flex
container so that section is a Flex
container and all the post elements in
there should be positioned in that Flex
container they will be positioned in the
center both horizontally and also with a
line items vertically though that
doesn't really matter because I don't
assign a height to posts but still now
they're aligned like this and on smaller
green screens they now shrink which of
course is not optimal so on bigger
screens this is actually a nice look but
I believe on smaller screens we should
do something the problem is that they
are aligned next to each other in a row
on smaller screens we should simply set
Flex direction here to column whoops to
column if we save that there beneath
each other and now we maybe add some
margin to our post preview so on smaller
screens we also want to add that margin
of one REM so let's remove it from that
media query in the post preview
component and let's instead add it to
post preview and
so margin:1em top and bottom and otto
left and right here like this well let's
just use one ram we need don't need auto
it should have one ram into all
directions
we don't need auto because we use
flexbox for positioning anyways so now
this looks good on mobile but on bigger
screens we could fit to next to each
other so for bigger screens I'll add a
media query again add media min-width
now let's maybe try these 35 Ram again
we used before in the post preview
component so that same media query we
had down there let's use that and for
such a screen I want to set my Flex
direction to roll like this so now it
looks good on bigger screens and on
smaller screens I think we can work with
this now of course we want to get posts
from the back and anyone ensure that we
can click them and actually reach a page
where we see something so these are in
the next two big things we want to work
on the back end is what I want to work
on first though so that we can fetch
some data and there after we'll work on
the detail page now let's dive into that
back-end and then starting with it will
use story block a content management
