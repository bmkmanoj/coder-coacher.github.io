on board in this in the next videos
I want to demystify regular expressions
regular expressions can be very useful
but also can be intimidating we all know
these super long regular expressions we
use to validate an email address now
let's have a look at what regular
expressions actually are and why we want
to use them before we then dive into how
we construct more and more difficult and
complex patterns and how we can think
about regular expressions to really
understand them let's start
let's start with the what regular
expressions are I'm on code pannier
created a new pan and now let's say we
have a text like hello there and this is
a normal string you could imagine that
it was entered by a user into an input
field and now we have it stored in a
variable or constant here now let's say
we want to see if that string we got by
the user contains two else and obviously
there are different ways of achieving
doesn't JavaScript we can of course use
non regular expression ways but one of
the easiest ways is to construct a
regular expression and well check this
this also answers the question what a
regular expression is it's just a
pattern a pattern of characters in the
end you use it to check strings for that
pattern
if the pattern finds a hit in a given
string a regular expression can be
constructed in two different ways in
JavaScript I'll store it in a new
constant the first way is to create a
new rec X object this reg FX rec X
constructor is a default object provided
in JavaScript it takes an argument and
that's a string and there you will
define the pattern you want to check for
for example ll and thereafter we can log
something to the console we can take our
regular expression stored in that regex
constant and execute test and now pass
text as an argument and there you see
finally at the end I get a true code pan
automatically updates this so I get a
true because I find two else in hello
there if I now clear the console and
remove one L in hello there you will see
I get a false because now we got no hit
we don't find this this in the end is
what a regular expression is a pattern
we can check we can check on a string
now I mentioned that there are two ways
of creating a regular expression you can
use that constructor style here or let
me store this in the same constant after
comment
I ever went out you can create a regular
expression in JavaScript with two
forward slashes and even though it looks
strange
this constructs a new object a new
regular expression object it's just some
syntactical sugar javascript offers it
in between the forward slashes you
define the pattern without quotation
marks so you don't pass a string here
you just type the pattern like ll that's
our pattern and therefore the code still
works and if I riad ii l in hello there
we get a true again so these are the two
different ways of creating a regular
expression javascript and that's what we
do with a regular expression now there
are more methods than just tests we also
have x act for execute and this will
return an array with the hit it found
like the two else our pattern basically
and we can also reword this and take our
text and there for example called match
and pass our regular expression so now
this will give us any hit it has
basically the reversed version of x AK
or we have search and search will give
us the index where we find this
expression so ll starts at index two in
the text let's have a look and indeed
their index 1 would be th as 0 excuse me
and x 0 would be th index 1 would be de
and then next 2 st starting point of
that pattern dl now of course regular
expressions are even more useful if you
want to find more complex patterns if
you for example wanna find any word that
contains an @ sign or stuff like that
these are things were going to dive into
the next videos off this series have a
look at how we build more and more
complex patterns but i hope with this
video and this short example it's
already a bit clearer why we use regular
expressions and how we use them we want
to find out if a given text matches a
certain condition in the end and the
condition is simply a pattern now with
that let's dive into how these patterns
constructed starting in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
