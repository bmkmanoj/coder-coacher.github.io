last part we took care about our offer
and our categories below our oppose
titles and we also created a separate
template for our single posts like this
one now in this video what we're gonna
do is insert a neat little shirt search
form into our header here and when we
search for something we want to display
the results in a list like this one here
like our front page or index page here
so let's get started to get going I will
go to my header dot PHP file here and we
have a bit restructuring to do here
because as of now we only get our menu
links here wrapped into our menu header
class which takes care about this line
and styling here now as you also want to
include a search form I will wrap this
code into a real header or a real
navigation which we can then style
ourselves and where we are not dependent
on the output of WordPress function like
this one so I'm gonna create my header
of my nav tag here and inside this tag
or for this tag it will add a class of
menu a header which is just a class
we've already created where we wrap our
menu links here I will obviously remove
them here and then I will grab off this
code here and just paste it inside our
nav element here and if I now refresh we
will see that nothing changes because
everything I did is move our wrapping
class outside of this function where the
function would create simply a div
wrapped around our menu items with this
class and do it myself so now we can
also insert
a search bar here therefore I'm going to
trade a forum and when I hit tap after
writing a forum like this form tab cloud
9 will automatically create us ya little
basic form here for us the first input
will be where we write our search
criteria and this has to have a name of
s which is used by our press later to
just retrieve results for our enter two
words to a search term so don't change
this just use ass I will give it an idea
of search here we are free to use
whatever we like and I will put a label
before it which base basically says
search criteria and this label is for
the first input here which has a give
search now I will remove this button and
I use instead the button tag which is of
type submit' and just give it a label of
search and now there is one more thing
if I would use this form in this state
it would not only search through posts
but all the pages and I don't want this
behavior I only want it to display posts
therefore we have to add an input here
which is of type hidden' so it doesn't
show up which has a name of post type
and the ID of post type and now this is
important that you use post type here
because this will be analyzed by
WordPress in the background we don't
have to write a search logic ourselves
and it will be analyzed for the value we
also specify here and that value will be
post so does important that you use post
type here and post here and this will
basically say ok only include posts now
we also need to provide an axe
which is executed once we hit the search
button this is just forward slash so it
will go to our front page so to say this
is the starting point of our WordPress
application and Eric will handle or a
search and the method will be get so
we're not posting anything to the server
or getting something from the server
right now if i refresh you we get our
search here and now let me just enter
post title and hit Search
and now we only got supposed to wear a
post title is included now go back to
our home screen and this is everything
we need for our search right that is
exactly what you wanted now the last
thing I'm going to do is clean up this
this styling here right so I'll just
create a little wrapper here but forum
will be the name of this class
search-form just cut everything and
paste it inside here indent it okay and
now in my style of CSS i will go just
below my header classes here and create
my search form class now there i want
the font size of let's say sixteen
pixels just let me refresh this yeah
looks better I wanted to be on the right
so float right now we got you've got it
floating here it's right bottom so we'll
need to change something here again we
need this container class again but it
will be a different class I just call it
in halflings
I will style these math links here to be
float:left now I will add some height to
my menu header a class of 40 pixels so
that the celina will then be in the
right space again and now we need to
vertically center this and a padding of
10 pixels from top and bottom should do
this
okay so now we got to style the way I
want and this already finished this
section so see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
