very basics of our angular applications
with the project structure and what core
parts of our application are now I
already have my well very basic
application here set up and in the
description you will find a link to the
github repository which will have
several branches for several well states
of this series and there you will find a
set up branch which is this state what
you see here so basically if you want to
know how to well setup a project from
scratch
watch my setup video I got on this
channel to where explain how to set up
my well custom-built boilerplate for
angular 2 applications so maybe this
application and what this currently does
is display this page
well that isn't that useful but it has
all the basics of language to
application in it now the boilerplate I
am using here has a structure where I
have app and assets of death and a
source folder for my code source and app
will hold the compiled code so
typescript compiler to JavaScript and
scss compiled CSS and the uncompelled
code which is the code will actually
work with lives in the assets folder in
case of the S CSS code and the dev
folder in case of the typescript code
and we're of course writing our
application in typescript here so in
this folder I got my app component here
and my boot dot T as far but started
this Buddha taught yes far what this
file does is it bootstraps our
application it loads up a regular to
application this is the part where
everything starts and we need this
application we need this file and this
bootstrap method here specifically for
everything to work otherwise we wouldn't
have anything any application we also
have this
next our HTML file here in our root
directory
well this file imports a couple of
dependencies or a couple of famous we
need for application and this might very
well change a bit and telling that she
was released but basically it contains
some poly faults we need for a lot you
to work correctly in older browsers
it contains alert you itself as well as
the router and the HTTP module because
we're going to use this and it also
contains rxjs which are our observables
and system Jas
which is just our well loader which will
load the components or the JavaScript
files we need for the current page to
render correctly system she has setup
here in this script part here where we
basically define the root folder app but
all our JavaScript files will live in
and that it should start with the app
boot file the bootstrap file to load up
our application this is the structure we
have now I also said we have this app
component and here is a key part a
component and we're two applications are
made up of components and what you
embraces the web components standard and
when we build an angular application we
create many components which you then
put together to get one single page in
the end and of course all these
components are then rendered together
into one single Dom but we create our
application by well bottom-up so to say
by creating these tiny pieces these
components now I do have videos on this
channel where I explain this whole
concept and explain your role
architecture
for the application but to give you a
black but to give you a quick overview
but basically do you have components
which makeup or app or Dom in the end -
we have directives and components are
just directives and directives in the
end are only certain commands
instructions so to say we place in our
HTML code which challeng want you to do
something when it finds these
instructions for example in our
component case here this instruction
would be in or in isolation of well this
my app tag my app is not a default HTML
element of course but it is a directive
and instructional what you will be able
to help because we tell it how to handle
it
in our app component file we're setting
a selector which is also Maya and
there's no coincidence of course by
setting up my app as a selector here
angle to you is able to render whatever
we define here in the template of our
component in this place here where we
set up will replace this custom-made
component by placing this instruction
this directive here my app which is as I
said found that you matched as we have
set it up here as a selector and then it
renders whatever we specify here as a
template of course our selectors
therefore have to be unique so that
angular 2 knows when to render what we
of course may use a component model
times in our Dom but if you want to have
two different components with the same
tool sector
that won't work the way you want now
yeah I was talking about a selector this
template what is this what is this add
component thing here well this is a
default typescript class which will be
compiled down to JavaScript code
actually runs at every browser nowadays
and
we and annotated this class with this
metadata this is just some metadata and
we can attach metadata in typescript by
using this at notation here there's some
Manna Dey that you find bangla to which
can be attached to any class and this
kind of transforms this class into a
component technically of course it stays
a class but it
well provides some annotation which
allows angle to when it comes over this
class you know that this class is
actually a component and a component has
several features and one very important
one is dead it has a view which is
rendered the template we specify here
this is what will actually be rendered
to the Dom and this does header here is
what we're seeing here at the top this
is rendered by and what you knowing that
this is a component and that is has this
template which should be rendered
whenever it finds this my app selector
here so this is our component decorator
which basically contains some
configuration for this component so that
this configuration or so that this
component is displayed that way or use
the way we want that's our project
structure that are two key parts of
language to application and this is in a
nutshell and I'm very short explanation
of course how components who work how we
configured them and why we configure
them the way now of course in the next
videos we will see more configuration
and being a data to this component we
all see multiple components we'll see
how we can output dynamic data in our
components we'll see how we can make
components work together across several
well components and how we can access
the web to fetch data and much more and
if you want to dive into some concepts a
little bit deeper right now you might
have a look at the other videos on this
channel where I do talk about a lot of a
metoo things already see you next videos
