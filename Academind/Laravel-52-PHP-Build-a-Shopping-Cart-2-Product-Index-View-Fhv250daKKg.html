set up our project we implement the
basic project structure now in this
video I want to start out putting
alright so once you start working on a
product page outputting our for now a
dummy products which we can add to the
card and well by later on it's torreón
so let's start for this I already got my
index template dot PHP file here which
is of course page or the view which
should hold my different products
however I also want to have a header to
well later on navigate you buy let's say
user airier to sign in or sign up and
also to access my card so I will create
that header for now and I do this in a
partials folder by adding a new fall
which I'll call header load later PHP
and then on get bootstrap calm under
components I will pick the default
bootstrap navbar now of course you may
change this or laplace's with whatever
dapper you like but I just want to have
a basic navigation bar here which I can
use and customize to my needs so
therefore I'll grab all of that code
here which is more than I will need but
I will clean it up in a second and paste
it into my header here now as already
said this is way more code than I need
so I will quickly clean this up but
before I actually do this I want to
implement it first so in the master file
and the master layout here right before
I enter my content here I want to
include this partial and I do this by
using the include command here and
little plate in larold blade templating
engine and then I just specify the name
or the path to the file I want to
include so this is in the partials
folder and then the header file so if I
save this and reload my page you can now
see this bootstrap header with that it's
time to clean it up
so let's think about what do we need or
what do I want I want this brand here
which leads back to the
product in next page in this case for
now I don't want all of this stuff here
I want to have a link on the right which
allows me to go to the user page or to
log in log log out sign in or something
like this D will use a related stuff or
none of the thing about it let's make
this a drop-down where I then have like
sign up sign in or if you're assigned in
log out and access to user page so drop
down is fine
and I've also what you keep this link
here which should lead to the shopping
cart so now first I'll get rid of this
part here on the left and in order to do
this you can just see I want to get rid
of this link this link at the drop down
so I may just grab all these links or
this whole unordered list here on the
left delete it also get rid of the
search bar delete that now on the right
as a set it will keep this link which
should be well I should be leaving to
the shopping cart later on and I also
want to keep this drop-down menu but I
will use or call this user a counter or
something like this um this is fine and
in here well I would get rid of some of
these actions here let's say these two
actions and later on then I will have
let's say the logout link lot a log out
link at the bottom and here the user
account link or something like this so
if I now go back that's how the log just
looks much better and if I resize this
page a bit you can see that we get this
mobile navigation built into bootstraps
or this works too great so that's the
important first step next I want to add
a little bit of fine-tuning already I
want to have like a user account I can
hear an X to the text and a shopping
cart icon next to the shopping cart link
here I will use font awesome to do this
and if you're not aware what font
awesome is this is well with named sass
and a fund which you can include like
any other font you might
your webpage but instead of real
characters this one has a couple of
images or little icons you can use and
therefore this one makes it really easy
to implement icons small little handy
icons in your application now in order
to use that you might just click get
started
and then just pick this see the end line
here to import it well from a CDN server
you don't have to download it and that
will also include that right believe the
bootstrap import here and the cool thing
now is I can have a look at the icons if
I click on all icons and now I can just
search so if I search for a user I see
all the icons related to your user and
let's say just default user icon doesn't
look too bad now as you see if you click
on it
you already get the code you need to
have to add this icon to your page so if
I now go back to my header and add this
user I can write before this user
account text here if I now reload my
page you can see this little icon now
obviously this is way too close to this
user account text so well it's only the
case because I have to enter a space
here and if I reload looks much better
now let's also have a look if we can
find a great shopping cart here so I'll
search for shopping and we get this cart
plus order stifled shopping cart I think
I'll go with this so I'll just grab this
code here and add this in front of the
shopping cart text this time I'll think
about adding a space after it so now I
fit reload it already looks a lot better
even though it's still a default
bootstrap log and you might find unit
but I think it's good to go with that so
with the header in place let's actually
work on the product page itself and I
think of having a grid of several
products here a responsive grid of
course where we will have on each
product short description a title an
image and then a link which allows us to
to buy it or to add
to the card and of course although a
price would be good so again I will use
bootstraps both in styles or things
helpers I got to get get us going and I
will go to the CSS part because I will
use the bootstrap grid here q well
create my my grid basically and if
you're not aware how bootstrap works
it's definitely worth checking out a
detail tutorial but to give you a quick
start with it basically to use the grid
which allows you to well make your whole
page a grid where you can position
things you have a container wrapping you
overall grid and in this container you
have several rows and then each row you
might have several columns and
bootstraps clever enough to provide your
different column classes with which you
can specify if a column or if column
should stack on certain screen sizes and
you will find all this information on
this grid information page on a
bootstrap page here so what I will do is
I will go back to my application and
first in my layout and you master apply
to a PHP file I will wrap the overall
content in a container so in a div
having a class of container and again if
you're wondering what I'm doing here by
just typing and then having this whole
they've tagged with the class attached
to it that is plug-in called Emmet and
it's not only available for phpstorm
it's also available for other editors so
you might check this out if you're
interested in having this functionality
in your editor and it basically allows
me to like specify class name by typing
dot and then the name of the class and
I'm just hitting tab to create a div
with that class add in the same style I
could create a h1 tag by typing h1 and
then hitting tab but that's just a side
note so back to the grid the content is
wrapped in this container and I do this
of course because each content will
have grit in my application here at
least and therefore each content will be
wrapped in this container however
regarding rows and columns that is
something which will be specified on the
individual view because that of course
depends on the way I want to structure
or I want to position data in my view so
I will go back to this index page in a
shop folder and now here instead of
having it works it's time to structure
the layout of this page now later on we
might have like let's say top
information section here or a banner or
whatever but for now I will only output
a couple of thumbnails on this page now
speaking of thumbnails bootstrap helps
with thumbnails to under components you
can have a look at the right navigation
and there you will have this point
thumbnails you click on that you see how
you can include evil pure image
thumbnails or here thumbnails with image
add text and buttons and this is exactly
what I want to have in my application
therefore again I will just copy that
code and if code copying is too boring
for you or to beginner like you may of
course all the type but it's just a
couple of nested ifs with separate word
with different bootstrap classes so back
in the index page I will now enter the
thumbnail so I get my thumbnail in place
here so let's have a look at this how it
does it look okay not not too bad um I
personally I want to have it a bit will
s wide bit smaller of course having an
image would be great because that looks
a bit ugly like this and I won't need
two buttons I only want to have let's
say and Add to Cart button and then on
the Left I want to have my price so the
buttons should go to the right and say
add my card and on the Left I want as I
just said I want to show the price of
this item okay so that's where let me
work on this first I will get rid of
this first button which I won't need
and I'll just restructure it a little
bit nicer here replace this with a div
element here I don't want this to be a
paragraph I'm here in this paragraph
above the icons or above the buttons
excuse me I will have to infer text
about the item and I will just enter
some dummy lorem ipsum for now and again
this text was created by using the Emmet
plugin which has this functionality
pulled in if you're ever in need of some
dummy text well to be honest the
quickest way is just to Google for lorem
lorem ipsum and for example you might
find this page which is on German but
it's straightforward you just specify
the number of words you want then you
could choose if you want words which is
the default or characters or paragraphs
then you just hit go and boom there you
go you get your text which you can copy
so I get Malhar up some text here this
will be the title which should be the
product title and of course here we need
an image now let's he'll look for a
possible image I will just search for
well what what do we want to sell on
this page let's say we're selling books
so we're selling Harry Potter because
that is the book we we like here or
maybe you don't you may choose another
book so let me look at well these are
driven books so you might not recall
these layouts or these images so you
might just pretty coups you pick
whichever book you want so I'll go with
that great and I will just copy the link
here
now you on your page shouldn't do deep
linking like this you want to store the
image on your own server and serve it
from that and I will implement this
functionality later I just want to get a
prototype a quick prototype going here
so we'll enter this link here and the
source attribute of this image and I
want to reload my page looks good but
obviously far too big I don't want that
to be in the or
in all sizes certainly don't so in order
to fix the size of this I will just add
some inline styles for now I will set
the max maximum height to let's say 150
pixels and also it's a class of image
responsive just to make this look good
on all devices so now I very resize this
yeah looks better and of course stand
this to your needs I am happy with this
now inline styling is not the best way
just want to see how this looks so I get
rid of this here and instead I will add
a new folder in this public folder which
is the folder of course the server will
serve in the end and sort of browser has
access to this folder and here I will
add a source
oops a new folder called source and in
the source folder I will have a never
new folder called CSS which should hold
my app dot CSS file mode so all the
styling form application will go in here
now you can see that my image I want to
style lips inside this thumbnail class
and therefore I can use this thumbnail
class here and then access each image in
this class which is only the one I want
to change and set the max maximum height
- well 150 pixels like before now if I
go back and reload you will see that
this does not work and that's the case
because I'm having my stylesheet here
but I'm not importing it anywhere right
so back in the master layout here I want
to add the import to my own style sheet
and I will just write below the
bootstrap files here where I have my
Styles hook so I could either import it
here in this master layout or now import
it in my index in my shop index file and
use the Styles hook here with section
styles to then provide the Styles I want
to use on this view now since I want to
use this app dot CSS file throughout my
whole application I will go with the
first approach and add the import
directly in the master layout here so
right preload bootstrap I'll add a new
link or new
import and now how do I import my app
dot CSS file
alarum well you have to be careful here
because your files will always be served
from the public folder because this is
the folder accessible by the browser
however depending on the route you're
currently on you might not be able to
access the source folder like this
source CSS app dot CSS this will work
now because if you can see if you see
you can reload this applies the new
styling but if I would have another out
like let's say later on the shopping
cart then the browser would look for a
source slash CSS slash app dot CSS file
under this shopping cart folder which of
course doesn't exist on the server since
this is only a you and your all segment
and not as folder on the server but the
browser doesn't know that that this is
just the way we style our URL and
therefore this would lead to an error
now in order to always import this file
from the same source or from the save
path and not be dependent on a current
URL we can use a helper lateral offers
here and I access this helper by using
double curly braces which allows us to
add code to our level plate template and
the code and one to enter here is URL
colon colon two and then the path cue
this file seen from this public folder
on so source CSS app dot CSS now this
you are all too thin here this too
method used on some kind of URL class
here is in reality fs8 URL is a facet
now FS AIDS is a concept in level which
allows to easily access different
helpers if you want to put it that way
off the framework now
- method here in reality as defined in
some other class or in some other object
but so that we don't have to write it or
access this complete object and find out
where this - method actually lives
letter will offers us this URL for say
it which does what the name implies
itself assay data it allows us to easily
access this underlying helper method
here and this specific helper method -
does the following
it takes the path we specify here as an
argument and finds this path in your
root folder independent of the current
route and then it will parse this in the
correct URL the browser has to access to
fetch this file so by doing it this way
here we're making sure that we're always
fetching this fall and not trying to
access some path which doesn't exist so
now if I reload the page you won't see
any changes because of course it still
works but now it will work on all routes
and not just the root route were
currently on so to finish this thumbnail
I want to move this button to the right
and say add to cart and I also want to
output a price on the Left where the
button currently sets at in order to do
this I will go back to my index file and
a shop folder and to move the button to
the right I will gift is another class
here which is called pull write this is
a built-in helper class in bootstrap
which applies some floating to this
button to float it on the right if I now
reload this looks pretty broken because
this button l hangs on a bottom right
corner here and well does this might be
the style you like but I think we can do
better here in order to fix this I have
to clear fix before using this float
here so I will apply another class to
the div holding this button now we'll
just give two stiv a class of clear fix
and if I now reload this looks much
better now what does clear fix do clear
fix is basically a combination of styles
being applied which make sure that all
prior floats are cleared before the new
one is applied and by doing this we make
sure that this float this button you're
floating somewhere actually floats in
the overall element it sits in instead
of being kind of mixed up with Prior
floats and the OL grid here in bootstrap
is bold with floats and therefore
hanging a little bit off on the page
it's really a stylistic fix we have to
apply here and a common one too as long
as you use floats to lay out your page
at least and of course there are other
great ways like flexbox in the future
but not supported by all browsers so I
will go with the default wood strip grid
system based on floats for now so floats
okay that's one thing now add or change
text and add the price on the left here
so in order to change the text data
straightforward Add to Cart and also I
want to change the color of this button
now if you go over to bootstrap you can
see which colors we got available you do
find this here under CSS and then
buttons and if you scroll down a little
bit you see all the default buttons
bootstrap offers now I think a green
button is a great choice as it should
encourage our customers to buy something
so in order to make a button green you
have to apply the button success class
to it and note that you cannot only stop
button elements with this button classes
but like we're currently doing in our
app all the style anchor tags or any
element as a button now this button
already has the button class but we have
to change button default to button
success here so if Y now reload you can
see I got the Add to Cart button last
step I want to add price so I will add
and you div here
where I will say like let's say $12 as a
price and now if your load this looks
pretty crappy so in order to bring this
in line I will also add a class here the
pull left class to float this on the
left but in the same line as this button
floats and this looks bad or bad we can
we could make us stand out a little bit
more so in order to make a stand out a
little bit more I will give this a new
class price this is not a good strip
class I will defined us myself in the
apt or CSS file and I want to style this
a little bit and basically what I want
to do is I want to make it bold I also
want to increase the font size a little
bit at least I think so let's say let's
say 16 pixels let's let's try this and
yeah how does this look looks better
might stand out even a bit more if this
text here were a bit more grayish and
less black so in order to do this I will
go back to the index page and I want to
sell this paragraph the product
description therefore I will give this a
new class called description and back in
the Aptos CSS file I will make sure that
my thumbnail class I want to style all
descriptions because of course the
description lives inside this thumbnail
element or this thumbnail div and
description should have a color of well
let me just choose nice gray here like
this maybe save this have a look could
be a little bit more on the white side
so maybe like this
yeah I think that's great so with this
I'm pretty happy and of course there's
always something we can do but I will
leave it like this I think I'm even
happy with the size now that I think of
it we should be able to fit three of
them on
one page and now before actually
outputting some data or making next
steps
let me duplicate that five times to see
how this looks if we have a really
complete grid here and not just one item
so in order to do this for now of course
later on we will just do this more
elegant I will grab my whole column here
not the row just a column for now and
copy it two times and regarding the way
if you see these classes here call MV 4
and call SN 6 now what these classes do
is they specify how many blocks this def
should be wide now in a bootstrap grid
there are always 12 blocks available so
with having MD for this means on a
medium sized screen each Dave here
should be 4 blocks wide so free divs are
fit on one or in one row with gathers
between them
however on smaller screens only two of
them fit as each of the divs should be 6
blocks wide indicated by this class so
now that I copied ed if I reload you'll
see this looks ok my opinion and now to
have multiple rows I will go up to the
top and grab the whole row here with all
the columns in between and duplicate
that and now if I reload you see we get
this grid with all the items and again
you may restyle this make this smaller
or wider whatever you like I'll go with
that
and I think this is a decent first
prototype of a shop and in the next
video we'll go the next steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
