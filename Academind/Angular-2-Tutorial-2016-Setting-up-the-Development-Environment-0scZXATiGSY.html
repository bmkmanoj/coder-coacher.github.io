able to write some code is to set up our
local development environment now in
this course I'll use typescript to write
angular 2 now before you're running away
scared what typescript is just once you
explain to you typescript is additional
layer to JavaScript which compact
compiles down to plain old JavaScript in
the end which was chosen by the angular
2 team as they are chord language to
build angular 2 on as it offers some
features plain JavaScript doesn't offer
as of now that includes classes which
kind of were added but it also includes
a modular approach decorators some very
nice things which really help us in
developing angular 2 apps and which were
the reasons reasons why the angular 2
team picked typescript and which is the
reason why we will follow their path and
also use typescript now setting it up is
real easy the first thing we need to
install typescript and what we will need
throughout this course is NPM node
package manager so let's get this fire
up on you tab on your browser and just
enter NPM and the very first result is
the one you're looking for then you want
to scroll down to installing NPM and
then just pick whatever operating system
you're on and so on
just pick or write installer now once
NPM is installed just enter typescript
into your browser get to the very first
result click on get typescript now and
just follow this instruction here and
enter MPM install means g typescript
which will install it globally on your
computer which is perfectly fine because
we will need it for all our angular
applications so once you've done this
you're almost ready to go
of an additional thing is head over to
github to download an angular 2
boilerplate which I set up which will
include everything you need to get
started in a second
no more configuration needed just clone
a specific github repository and
specifically I want you to head over to
get up calm mschwartz Mullah which is my
name and then slash angular QB the
boilerplate this is the boilerplate you
will need and then you can either
download it as a sip or easier just copy
this link here fire up a new terminal
window and now let's create our project
folder and there just right type git
clone and the link you paste copied here
now if you don't have get install or
something like this is perfectly fine
just to download that zip file unzip it
and you're already ready to go to now
once this cloning is done CD entered a
newly direct create a directory here and
then we need to execute a command MP
install which will now install all the
packages and dependencies required by
angular 2 and this installation process
will take some time I'll be back once
it's finished on my computer ok
my installation just finished and now
what we're going to do is start gulp
which will take care about the
transpiling of typescript to normal
JavaScript by just entering gulp here
and then we will need a new terminal
window in the same directory and inside
this directory we need to enter M p.m.
start which will run a live server you
can see here and as you can see when it
writes hello world on your screen in the
browser here everything is working fine
and your angular 2 app is working now in
the next video we will change what we
see here and write our very first own
component</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
