weather app series we're nearing the end
of the series and reason course is that
this application already works really
great however there are a couple of
things I want to fix where I want to add
let's put it that way for one I will get
rid of this dummy data as we are now
able to add our own data second I want
to have a sidebar which allows us to
store separate profiles containing
different cities which we then can load
too well
changed cities we see here because once
I got rid of the dummy data here this
will be empty by default and only be
full of the data we add here but the
real application you might want to save
that and one step is to save it on the
front and a different profiles however
on a real app of course you would
synched it with some kind of server
where these profiles would be stored -
so I will first start by getting rid of
this dummy data and those of course
happens in the beverage
data TS file where I just delete the two
new Webber items which are added by
default so that we only have an empty
array laughed so that's one thing and
now if we have look at the application I
can still add Berlin and this looks good
but as I said it would be great to save
it in a kind of profile on the left here
maybe I also have a default profile at
startup of the application which you
could always note so in order to do this
I will create a new file here and I will
do doesn't the root development folder I
will call this fall profile oops
create a new fall profile dot yes and
this much just you find the profile
class I want to have
profile now I want my profile class to
have our name so each profile should
have a name profile name which is of
course a string and also each profile
should have an array of cities which
will be an array of strings so this will
not be an array of Weber items but
because we won't store the complete
fetch to Weber item here but instead I
will just store the city names strings
here which will be searched for in the
API
once I load a profile because of course
I always want to have the most recent
Weber data therefore I'm not saving the
Weber data but just the city names which
I want to search on the open Weber metal
open weather map comm API so with this
I'm able to store a list of cities
basically that's all and that's the
profile class I'll use next I want to
create this sidebar component which will
hold all these profiles so also in the
death folder I will treat a new file
called site oops
cold site bar component TS and of course
this will start by being exported so an
exported class called sidebar sidebar
component and I will add the component
decorator of course this will receive a
selector of my sidebar and of course
also a template now what should be
inside this template well I want to have
let's say a heading which says save
profile something like this and then I
will have a button which allows me to
save a new fault profile so safe list
profile should save to current list of
weather items so of the you ever items
we will have down here for example
Berlin will save the current list as a
new
profile so this button therefore needs a
click listener which should fire the
abort target the unsaved new method
which I will have to create in the body
of this component of course so this
allows me to create a new profile next I
will add an article so default HTML 5
element here which should basically hold
my different profile or hold one profile
I will later on loop through all these
profiles of course each article will
have its a heading age 4 with the name
of the profile profile name and the city
name city or the name of all cities
excuse me might be multiple cities like
New York London I also want to add a
button in let's say the top right corner
which allows me to delete a profile
therefore I will use just a X so the X
character and I will gift us a class of
delete which I will have to write my own
my own to give this a styling I want to
have and I will add a click listener
here to which should be on the lead
profile profile and I want to get the
event the click event passed into this
method so that I can stop propagation
later on so that it doesn't bubble up
anymore
but I can stop it so let only the click
event on this profile is recognized
so let's have a look at this and let's
see home ok how this looks in our view
in our template in order to see this I
will of course have to embed my sidebar
here in the app component so I will do
this right below my header my sidebar
and also of course I need to add here my
directive sorry
so a sidebar component and of course as
always make sure to add the import to
the sidebar component now if we reload
the page
well we can see this doesn't look too
pretty to be honest so that definitely
needs some styling now in the source
code of this project and you can find us
on github I will provide
this sidebar dot s CSS file which has
all the styling I need to make this look
better so you may just toss this into
your project then or pause the window
right now and then let it go again and
pause now and resume and pause to type
it whatever you prefer but as I said you
will find it my github repository now in
order to apply these styles to this
component though I will need to add
something to this component decorator
the style URLs metadata which allows me
to specify an array of strings referring
to paths in my project which holds CSS
files so I only want to add specify one
string here and this will be the path to
my sidebar dot CSS file this will live
and the source CSS folder and then
sidebar dot CSS since this is the folder
where all my a CSS files will get
compiled to and remember that when
accessing style or template URL sangla -
you always have to think from the root
folder the project folder on and not
from the file where you're currently in
so source slashed CSS refers to this
folder even though this dev folder where
a side part of component lesson has no
source folder in it this has to be seen
from the project route on very important
now the style is imported here well only
be applied to this component that's
important to only this component will
receive the styles and after if you have
a look in its eye part of a CSS file you
see that host selector and this means
the whole body but only of that
component should receive these styles
here
and that is a good way to make sure that
you're not over writing or interfering
with some other styling in your
application but instead only apply your
styles where you want them to be applied
to go a little bit deeper into that that
uses you encapsulation a concept
introduced Bangala to which kind of in
the default setting at least resembles
the shadow Dom specification which is
not supported by all browsers and shadow
DOM would mean that each element in your
Dom might have will a shadow Dom a
separate Dom behind it with its own
styles and so on and as I said this is
not supportable all browsers but angular
to emulate stays by default such that it
through a clever trick by appending an
attribute to your element and then
adding this attribute to all the styles
which should only be applied to this
element side note so by using this
technique it emulates these component or
element specific styles and make sure
that if you style for example the h3
element here only the h3 element in this
component that receives the style and at
all and not all HV elements in your
application if you want to learn more
about you encapsulation you will find a
link in the description below so what
this if I now reload this looks much
nicer but to make it look really nice I
will add a class to this article called
profile now this looks good so the
profile list is a place in the next
video it's time to fill it with some
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
