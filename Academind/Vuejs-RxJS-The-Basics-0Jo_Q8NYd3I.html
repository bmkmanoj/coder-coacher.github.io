we're going to dive into how we can use
rxjs
in a view chess project I do have videos
about both on this channel so you should
be familiar with the basics
I want to show you how to connect both
and in this video I won't use view rx a
package provided by the view chess team
which also allows us to integrate our X
chairs interview chairs I want to show
you the basic go and I want to highlight
that you don't need that to use our X
chess in a view chest project I will
have a look at this view rx package in
another video though so let's get
started I'm going to brand new project
here created with the view CLI using the
web pack simple template and it'll set
it's brand new the only thing I did is
highlight this part in the template of
the effort you file because I want to
delete it the same is true for the
message here and for all the default
styles I don't need them because I won't
use that instead we want to use rx
chairs so let's install it we already
use NPM here of course so we can run NPM
install rxjs
- - save - install it in the node
modules folder and store a reference to
it in the package to chase and follow so
let's do that this will download it and
give me the latest version of it and
with that we're good to use it do you is
this we need an observable now obviously
because we want to play around with
observables so what I'll do is in my
data method here in this app to view
component I'll set up a count property
which are set to zero and that clearly
is not an observable I want to create
one in the created lifecycle oak though
so once this component has been
initialized I want to create my
observable at which I can listen so I
will use ops and now I want to use
observable and for that we need to
import it of course because the end is
fathered out believe what there is no
observable object so we need to import
it to unlock it so let's quickly do that
I'll use my import statement and now the
quickest way of doing it would be to
import our X from rxjs / our X and this
will import everything from the RX
chairs package and that is why you
shouldn't do it because you would import
a lot of stuff you don't need and that
will bloat your fine
a bundle will really increase its size
and it's not a good practice to do
though so that's not where we're going
to do its dad what I'll do is I'll
import observable from rxjs observable
because I'm only interested in the
observable here and with that I can set
up my observable here and I want to use
the interval helper method firing every
second and interval simply gives me an
incrementing number where a new number
is emitted well every second or
whichever timespan in milliseconds you
specify here and now I want you to
subscribe to that so I want to call
subscribe on my brand new observable and
as you know the first method pass to
subscribe is the method executed by RX
chest whenever a new value is emitted so
we get the value here and then I could
set this count
equal to value because we know value
will be a incrementing number due to
that interval method that's just what
this method does and count as a number
so now we could go to our paragraph here
and simply output the count with
interpolation like this and we could now
simply and run npm run dev to spit up
our development server and do this app
in the browser let's do that if we do so
we'll realize that we do see zero which
makes sense because our initial value is
zero but it doesn't change and if we
open the console log we see an error
that interval is not a function what's
that
well interval is not a known function I
should say because the way our X J's
works we have to be explicit about what
we use for the reason that we don't
bloat our bundle right now we only use
the observable and you could argue that
this should unlock all the creation
methods like interval and maybe all the
operators we can use too but that's not
how it works and that makes sense
because you would unlock a whole bunch
of things you don't actually use so if
you want to use that interval method for
creating an observable you have to
import it and you do this with a
slightly different syntax by importing
from the package itself rxjs / then ad
you always use ad to add functionality
you want to use and then it's from the
observable part the interval method
might look strange but this unlocks this
exact method now if I hit save and go
back to the page you see it starts
incrementing and we get our new number
every second automatically output to the
template now we could stop here but I
also want to show you how to use an
operator let's say we only want to
output even numbers here so as you've
learned in one of my other videos you
can do this by simply chaining another
operator before subscribing and the
filter operator would allow us to filter
the values which is what we want to do
right filter takes a method as an
argument where we get the value so this
is executed for each value which is
submitted and then we simply return and
since this is an inline arrow function I
can omit return but it will be added
complicit Li so we return a value and
the value I want to return it's true or
false true if I want to allow the value
to continue false if I want to drop it
so it should be true if the value is
even and we can verify this by using the
Marshalls operator so dividing the value
by Q and modulus will then give us the
remainder of the division if that is 0
then it is an even number because we
have no remainder
and therefore we should return true so
this check will return true for an even
number if you wanted to check for the
opposite you check for that not being 0
which means there is a remainder which
means it's an odd number so I'll change
it back to the equal sign though now
with that we could think we're done but
we all need to unlock that operator that
filter operator so we need to import our
x chairs add but now not from observable
but from the operator package the filter
operator with that if we now hit save
and we go back to the page we see the
bcq
four and six and so on so every even
number and the other ones are dropped
and not output and that's actually all
this is how we can easily incorporate
rxjs into a view chess project without
using a special package however there is
a special package which adds some
convenience to this whole thing we'll
have a look at this in the novel video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
