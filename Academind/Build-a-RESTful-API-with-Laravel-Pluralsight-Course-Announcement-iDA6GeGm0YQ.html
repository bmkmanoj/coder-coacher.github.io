I have some exciting news to share at
least very exciting for me I'm now a
published plural cite offer because a
couple of weeks ago a published by first
course on plural side it's about
building a restful service with Lera law
and in this course I'll start at the
very basics some refreshes about what
restful services actually are what level
is and which core principles to follow
but thereafter will deeply dive into the
creation process starting at the theory
work how to plan such a service how to
derive to write API endpoints and how to
structure the service and of course
thereafter it's all about implementing
this so writing the actual neural code
to create all the required models
relations the API endpoints the
validation logic how to handle
validation the restful service and very
important to authentication how to
authenticate in a restful service and
how to implement authentication with
level on the restful service using JSON
web tokens if you already do have a
plural set account or you were thinking
about getting one anyways I'd be more
than happy to welcome you in this course
and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did
creating it anyways I just wanted to
share that of course your videos will
continue coming on that channel but
that's big news for me and I'd be happy
to welcome as many as of you as possible
maybe see you there otherwise see you in
all the other videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
