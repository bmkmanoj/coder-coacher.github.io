really let me say thank you you and
especially you so if you're one of these
100,000 subscribers we now have you're
just amazing and if you're not maybe you
want to become amazing but anyways I
thought this would be a good opportunity
to do something which I was asked for
quite a bit and which I guess makes
sense answer some common questions I get
while you and if you have more questions
please post it below the video and I
might do erver video where I answer more
questions so let's dive in and let's see
what you want to know and what I got to
say
so here's one question I get quite a lot
and of course there are different
variants of it but the cool question is
how do you learn so many things so fast
and the answer is if you look closely
it's not that many things it's mostly
JavaScript to the JavaScript world and a
little bit of level and PHP because I
used to start with PHP when I started
becoming a web developer but my main
area where I'm active is actually web
development with JavaScript with server
less services I worked a lot with dad
and I simply learn it because I use it
in projects like our new webpage which
is built with Cyril as technologies
behind the scenes and this is how I
learned it I use these things and I
don't dive into every single server-side
language
I don't know asp.net I don't know Ruby
on Rails
I never even use them so these are the
things I don't know but the things I do
know happen to be about JavaScript which
happens to run a lot of things you need
nowadays so I guess it's also a bit
lucky something like that well yeah
Dada is basically yes and then how do I
learn it if I do want to learn something
new well you have to practice right it's
it's a boring answer but you have to
dive into you blog posts articles maybe
the source code when angular q was in
the alpha stage I had a look at the
source code because documentation was so
bad
documentation for better documented
frameworks is of course a good source
though for a view chess for example and
also of course video tutorials though if
you're amongst the first to learn
something resources are pretty scarce a
lot of the time though I try to also
make a lot of content on technologies
that are relatively new so that this
becomes easier but that is how I learned
that many things and how I learn them so
fast if you want to call it like this in
the end the most important part is
practice it build example projects clone
popular web pages of course in
simplified versions and that is how you
learn new things besides of course
gathering all these resources which you
need like
and so on how much day for time do you
spend learning well you could say like
100% because you learned all the time
but actively sitting down and learning
something new I don't have a fixed
schedule on that if I need to learn
something new or want to learn it
I can easily spend entire week on just
that or I distribute it and spend a week
and thereafter 2 hours every evening but
since you have to count in these example
projects we're of course easily talking
about way more than one week and I don't
have a fixed schedule so do whatever
works for you and what you can fit in
besides your regular job I don't think
it makes a lot of sense to sit down for
four hours every evening if you're bored
if you're not there because you're still
in work in your mind so it's better to
then take a break and maybe just spend
one hour learning something you that is
something you have to find out though
it's different for everyone how do you
stay up to date with the latest web
development development reading a lot
data is the trick and Twitter so
following important people or basically
every framework has its own Twitter
channel that is a key part because you
read a lot of new things on Twitter for
the first time and besides that of
course Stack Overflow surfing around
they're diving into github and have
watching certain open-source projects
you heard about have a look at the Stars
they have that is how you stay active
and how you stay informed and that is
something I can recommend though what I
can also recommend is and I do mean it
like that you can subscribe to our
newsletter on academy.com and not just
because we want your email address to
spam you that that's not at all the goal
but we'll try to share new things that
we found interesting with you there so
that might be something that's
interesting to you do but besides that
the things I mentioned forums Twitter
great sources can I use your code in my
next project
I get this question quite a lot on my
YouTube videos for example or the udemy
courses and it's good that you ask way
better than just using it but the answer
is yeah you can use it but there's one
important thing I absolutely have to
highlight all the code is of course for
these tutorials it's never ever the code
as you would write it for a project use
cell and ship to a client why because a
lot of testing and optimization and of
course more complex features go into
such projects and I know everyone wants
to see videos where we built a real
project from start to end
the problem just is a lot of that
process will actually just bore the
majority of you because it's also a lot
of testing going back and forth so I
focus on the difficult parts and try to
show these try to some show some pain
points and some interesting features if
you want to use that code for a project
do it but test it optimize it and adjust
to your needs it's not meant to be
shipped to a client it's not optimized
at all in most cases what should a new
web developers start with because we
have tons of languages and frameworks
nowadays and I can't recommend my web
development world of web development
video which I created a month ago or
something like that and you might want
to look at that a link can be found
below the video now what should you
start with always the basics HTML CSS
JavaScript it's boring everyone tells
you that but it's what the web is based
on at the end and you got to know it you
you have to know these basics and
thereafter pick up a server-side
language note j/s might be simples
because you already know JavaScript but
feel free to also dive into PHP or
anything like that and then stop and
build projects practice these things
thereafter type it to other things like
frameworks and so on this is how I would
recommend starting an alternative
approach is to still learn these basics
but then quit
switch to like frameworks like angular
and so on which is definitely more
steeper learning curve but it can make
sense because you're able to build
cooler projects more quickly
the downside is you might not fully
understand everything you're writing so
you'll have to spend time to well catch
up with that and fully understand what
you're doing but if you do that this
might be the more motivating way anyways
no way around the basics you gotta learn
these when will the next video we
released
that's a YouTube specific question of
course and well the hands race we
academy and release two videos each week
the the goal is to release one on Monday
and one on Thursday we sometimes very
very rarely deviate from that and have
one on Monday one on Friday but two
videos per week is what we're aiming for
and what we always managed to do there
are weeks where you will see more videos
like before Christmas we had a lot of
videos now with the website launched
with quite a lot of videos but the bare
minimum we're aiming at are two videos
on on Monday and Thursday can you create
some video about X Y set these are very
important questions I want to get your
suggestions for topics I can't do or we
can't create videos on every topic you
suggest but your suggestions are super
important to me and if you fall out the
channel for quite some time you will
have seen that I did create a lot of
videos for topics that were requested by
you now there are some topics I just
can't do videos on because I don't know
the things myself and I'm not one of the
tutors or coaches that simply create a
video on something they learned like
half an hour ago that's not what I do
so you will probably never see a asp.net
with you by me because I just don't use
it but in general I welcome your
suggestions I want them I can't promise
anything but I'll do my best to cover
all the topics you suggests and release
videos that are interesting to you guys
so please keep
these suggestions coming how do you
record your videos there is one simple
answer we created a video about that and
you can find a link to that also below
this video what are your plans for 2018
well from a channel perspective or a
academ ID perspective the plans are to
continue with what we do but do it
better I guess we got exciting topics
you want to cover this year both on the
channel and on udemy we're working hard
on our new webpage which you might have
already seen if not check out
academy.com it's it's actually really
the easiest way of accessing all the
content we created we have all the
YouTube content we have structured on
that page additionally we have articles
and we want to put way more effort into
this in this year so this is a major
plan keep that going make it easier for
you to access our content and give you
extra resources like articles for videos
and so on and we also want to spend more
time on our newsletter make it a real
newsletter where you get interesting use
not just about new content but also of
course but also about well interesting
developments in in the industry for
example that is a major focus but of
course as I said at the beginning it's
also a major focus that we keep udemy
and YouTube coming and cover the topics
you guys want to see last question do
you hate react because I made this video
where I basically said that I don't like
react JSX so this JSX syntax that much
and that I prefer view che s well the
answer is no I don't hate react I use it
why would I have created a course about
it otherwise the thing is what I said in
this video I'm not a big fan of JSX it
is what is this I I'm not a big fan of
it but doesn't make react a bad library
I like reacted is an awesome library it
is very popular for a reason I like View
Chase and I also like angular yeah I do
like them all I build projects with all
of them and each library or framework
has its own strengths and
weaknesses reacts weakness to me is JSX
I know there are a lot of people who
love it that's fine but I don't hate
react so that was it I hope you liked
this video I hope it was helpful to you
if you got more questions please post
them in the description or in the
comment section of this video and I hope
to see you in future videos on this
channel too
