development starts right here with you
having a look at a website this makes
you the so called client and as a client
you are displaying this website entirely
in the browser because you use the
browser to have a look at this website
but how does this work how can you see
the information that you have on the
website
well basically by typing a URL this
could be academy.com for example you are
sending a so-called request right here
to a server and with this request you
tell the server that you want to receive
information from it because you want to
display the website and once this
request was successful you get a
response from the server with the
information you need to display the
website and that's basically what web
development is about it's about creating
a website and making sure that this flow
works correctly for your website now
there are two core concepts that we have
to understand when we talk about web
development the first part is this one
right here it's the so-called front-end
as you can see it this runs in the
browser only so that's all the
information you can see and access right
now in your browser now talking about
information what information is that
well basically it's code and it's a
specific type of code the core part of
each website and that's a must without
that part no website would work is HTML
HTML is basically responsible for the
content being displayed on the website
so the text or images for example in
addition to HTML we can also get CSS CSS
is also code and this code is
responsible to add style to our website
because normally we want to browse
beautiful websites and although a
website would work with HTML only
browsing better looking websites is a
better user experience and there
for definitely something that we want in
addition to CSS we can also receive
JavaScript which basically adds logic to
our website this could be for example a
logic that makes sure that you enter a
valid email address if you sign in to a
user account on a specific website but
important thing is that the website
generally works with HTML only and that
all the code you can see right here runs
in the browser and this can be a problem
because talking about the user account
again if you have a user account at an
online retail store with your email your
password
and your credit card information this is
not information that you want to display
in the browser this is information that
should be stored safely somewhere else
and this somewhere else brings us to the
second core concept of web development
it's the so-called
backend the server side because this is
the server side code which cannot be
accessed by the browser now as for the
front-end we also need code or a
specific language on the back end to
make sure that it all works correctly
and the language on the back end can be
no js' could be PHP or Ruby on Rails
just to name some in addition to the
server-side language we also need a
database because you want to store and
manage data example databases could be
my sequel sequel server or MongoDB and
with the combination of the language and
the database you have the backend of
your website and that's actually the
core concept of web development so as a
web developer you cannot decide if you
want to become a front-end web developer
a back-end web developer or if you want
to do both which will turn you into a
full stack web developer and this is web
development
