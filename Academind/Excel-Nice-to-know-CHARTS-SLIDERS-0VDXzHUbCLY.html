I'm Manuel and in this video I would
like to show you how you can easily add
a slider to your chart in Excel and with
that slider you will then be able to
switch between different data that
should be displayed in your chart in our
case this is going to be some stock data
now what do we need to do this well we
need Excel and we need source files
well Excel is something that you
hopefully have already and the link to
the source files can be found down there
in the video description and if you open
that source file then then you should
see something like this right here if
that's the case then you're ready to
start right now
so what do we have right here well as I
said we have some stock data so stock
prices for the Microsoft the Apple and
the Sony stock and we have the data for
different dates so it ends on the 30th
of June 2017 and it starts on the 4th of
January 2016 so that's basically these
source data that we want to visualize
now if you look at the prices you can
see well the prices are kind of
different so we have 69 for Microsoft
144 for Apple and 38 for Sony so we
should maybe define a starting base for
these prices like 100 for example
because this makes the visualization in
the end kind of easier and better to
read now what do I mean by that well we
can say that we have for the price a
starting point like that and let's now
link that to the Microsoft stock for the
beginning now if we go to the last line
right here this one then we could say
that our starting point right here
should be 100 well and then we could
simply calculate we can say that well
the change in the first day is change of
course so the price at the end of the
second day in our case divided by the
price at the starting point multiplied
with 100 right here like that and as you
can see we now see how our price changed
compared to this 100 as a starting point
now what you should do right here is we
should fix the role right here and also
right there
so for the starting point and for the
100 if we did that then we can simply
copy that here up to there paste it well
as we can see we now have the prices for
the Microsoft stock always compared to
this 100 starting point now this is nice
but we don't only have the Microsoft
stock we also have apple and Sonya of
course so we can simply select all the
data we have right here and well now
simply drag it to the right by pressing
ctrl R and with that we can now see that
we have our stock prices again but
is that common starting point of 100
let's maybe add some formatting right
here you may have seen it already I like
things to be formatted so let's do it
like this make this bold and maybe also
align that to the right now in case you
wonder why the colors are different when
compared to your Excel we have our well
at least that's what I think beautiful
academic schema right here that's why we
have that purple and that orange right
there but we are not talking about do
formatting actually we want to create a
chart so let's do this now and first we
need the chart input right here
let's place it right there now what
could be a potential input now in the
end we want to create such a slider as I
said in the beginning and this means we
want to keep things kind of dynamic
right here and whenever we talk about
dynamic things in Excel it might make
sense to at least think about the choose
function if you don't know what that is
actually just take a look at another
video that I have here on the channel in
there I talked about the details behind
the choose function right now we can
simply apply it so how can we apply the
choose function right here well we first
need Excel this one maybe which is kind
of the field that defines which value is
selected and then we can simply write
choose like that and the index num is
now simply that cell right here well we
can fix that cell of course immediately
and now we can say that if this cell
displays 1 then J 2 so the cell we are
working right now in should display
Microsoft if we have two right here in
our input cell right there
then we want to have Apple and if this
is equal to 3 then it should be Sony
like that let's press enter and as you
can see if I change it to 2 its Apple if
I change it to free its Sony this is
nice but that's only well the stock that
we select but we also have to make sure
that the right data is selected well but
the great thing is that we can simply
apply that formula and kind of copy it
down so let's go right here jump to the
last line and I'll copy it and with that
well as you can imagine exactly that
happens so if you take a look at the
data for example right here we have 129
this is this place right there if I
change it to 2 we have 148 so the apple
value and fries is of course the Sony
value right there so this works nice
actually and that's all the input that
we need for our chart again let's maybe
apply some formatting before we jump to
the next point I guess that I don't know
if you like that style so as always you
are free to design that just as you
prefer bigger a little bit so that's the
chart input and this means right now
well we also need to create a chart so
let's select that column right here so
we start in j2 and select the entire
range and now go to insert add here and
now select well maybe the simple line
chart right there we can now select the
chart and cut it and scroll up again and
maybe paste it right here that's not the
best way probably because you cannot see
it maybe like that I hope that's ok for
you however we first to make sure that
we also include the date in our chart
so let's right-click it go to select
data and now press edit right here and
now select the label range which should
be well the date actually so let's
select the entire column right here so
we get that and now we can press ok ok
second time and if we now scroll up
again well then we see that the chart
looks kind of correct so we start at the
4th of January at the 4th of January
sorry and end right here at the end of
June
this is totally fine and of course if we
now change that right here's our choose
field that we created well then the
stock price changes this is awesome this
is nice because that's actually what we
want to have but the problem is that
well I cannot see a slider in here so we
always have to change it right here in
that cell and that's not really user
friendly
so let's now add a slider and see how
this might change the way we can
interact with that chart and to add such
a slider we need the developer ribbon
this is the ribbon right here now in
case you wonder because you may not have
that ribbon just take a look at the
video description down there you can
find a link which'll
guide you through the activation process
of this developer ribbon it's really
easy so no worries and as soon as you
cut this ribbon well the new can
selected of course and if you now go to
insert right here then you see different
form controls and we will select this
one right here so let's select it and
now press right here into the chart area
and now you can see well this doesn't
look really good so we can play around
with it make it smaller
like that now it looks better already
right here there and like this no not
the most beautiful way but I think it's
fine well now we have the slider and now
we can click it but well nothing changes
not good so let's make sure that this
slider works now so we right click it go
to format control and now it gets
interesting
because now we see that we have our
current value well we can change that to
1 actually and now we can specify a
minimum value and if you think back
about our choose function right here
well then we have three values actually
this means the minimum value should be 1
and the maximum value well this
shouldn't be 100 this should be 3 the
incremental change and the page change
that is totally fine so we don't have to
change this the only thing we have to
add right here is the selling well and
as you can imagine we have the minimum
and the maximum value so we need to link
that sell link by clicking right here to
this cell right here that we created and
that is again our choose input now we
got that so if we click right here and
press ok then we can unselect that
slider now and as you might imagine now
if you click on to this arrow right here
then the charge changes dynamically
depending on what we select right here
as you can see it all the changes from 1
to 2 to 3 and we can go back to
Microsoft just as we want you and that's
actually it that's what I wanted to show
you because this is in my opinion and
easy way how to make your chart more
interactive and by that more user
friendly I hope this helps you when you
work with Excel and if you want to
display something like that
and be able to kind of display different
types of information in one single
visual maybe think about that solution
and with that we are not done with that
video and as always I can only say
thanks a lot for watching and hope to
see you in one of the next videos bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
