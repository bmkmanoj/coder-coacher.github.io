this in the next video we will have a
look at flexbox flexbox stands for
flexible box layout module not the best
name maybe but flex box is really
awesome because flex box allows us to
display our elements on our website more
dynamically or more flexible and this is
really important especially nowadays
when we have all these different devices
which we want to use to access our
websites like laptops tablets
smartphones and so on and because of
that we need a responsive website and
this is what we can do with flex box so
let's have a look at that in this and
the next video
so as I said flexbox is awesome but
first we have to understand some theory
behind it so how it actually works and
it all starts right here with a specific
property because what you want to do is
you want to add the way an element is
displayed and what you do then is while
you add the property names display to
this element so far so clear and we had
different values for that this could be
block or inline now if you don't add
block or inline but this one right here
flex then you change this behavior of
this element basically because you turn
the element you added this declaration
to into this you turn this element into
a parent or into a Flex container well a
Nesta name says a container normally
contains something in this something are
the children or the so called flex items
and that's the important core concept of
flex box that you have to understand
because you always add display flags to
your parent element or kind of the
wrapping element and by that you turn
this parent or as I said this wrapping
element into the Flex container and
inside this container you then have all
these different flex items so the Flex
items are basically nested elements into
this or inside of this parent element so
that's important to keep in mind now as
soon as we get this we can add more
properties to our Flex container this
could be flex flow justify content align
content or align items we can of course
also add more properties to our Flex
items this properties can be order flex
or align self and now at this point it's
probably confusing therefore let's
forget about that for a second so about
these properties for the Flex items and
talked about these in the next video and
in this video we will just focus onto
the Flex container so how it works how
we can create it and what happens if we
add all these different properties and
with that we got the basic theory set
and this means we cannot jump straight
into the code of our example page and
see
how this all works so let's have a quick
look at the code which you can of course
as always find down there in every
description or a link to the code and
what we can see in the HTML file is
basically this div with the class parent
this will become our Flex container you
remember back what we saw on the slide a
few seconds ago and inside this div we
have six other divs this will become our
Flex items we also saw that before but
we'll talk about the details regarding
the different Flex items in the next
video in this video we will only focus
onto the properties that we can add to
this parent class right here so talking
about properties let's go to our CSS
file right here and here you can see I
just added some basic styling to HTML
and body and here I indicate that we
start with Flex box and actually we will
only work right here in our parent so
this will be the only rule or rule set
we will work with now in this video and
down here you can see the styling for
the different divs important as you can
see for the one I didn't add any height
or width to it for the second if I edit
a width of 450 pixels and a font size
you will see later why this is important
at least for what we want to show right
here then you can see in the furtive
that I added a height of 150 so here
would here the height in the for edit
width and height so both and the five
and six only has a width of 200 pixels
so that's our basic setup we will work
roof but as I said the focus will be
right here in our parent or on our
parent now what does look like on the
website well it looks like this
basically here we have our six stiffs
and as you can see the content of the
div always indicates the height and
width property that was applied who so
that's the basic setup I think now it's
time to go back to our code and have a
look at flexbox finally so in the code
we will add this play flex right here to
our parent element and that's really
important although I'm repeating myself
but I want to make sure that you really
see how this works
this is now becoming our flex container
and all these this right here which are
nested inside this element you can see
it right here we have the Deaf class
parent st well parent then and inside
this parent we have all these divs so
flex items flex container keep that in
mind however we are back right here and
we need to save this now so we just
added display flex right there and if we
go back and now reload the page well you
can see something really interesting
right because all our divs which were
still are actually block level elements
are now displayed in one single row
that's really interesting what is even
more interesting is that if I decrease
the size you can see that the width of
the elements decreases as far as
possible and as far as possible means up
until the point where the content
basically needs the space you can see it
right here and right there if I increase
our side you can see that all the
elements are increasing up to the point
where they reach their defined maximum
if we inspect that we can see that now
this box has a width of 200 same is true
for here here we have 150 here we have
still the initial value so only the
value or the width the content needs
here we have 150 and here we have the
same thing just a word that the actual
content needs and also important our
parents are a div with the class parent
is also behaving like a block level
element so it increases and decreases
the size depending on our website with
so that's what happens basically when we
use display flags there is more that's
happening right here but we'll have a
look at that step by step throughout
this video so let's go back to the code
now and change this value from display
flags to display inline flags right here
if we save that and go back and reload
the page we can immediately see what
happens to our parent our parent now
behaves like an inline element this
means it doesn't occupy the entire space
anymore let me maybe unselect the
inspect tool here it only needs the
space that is required to display the
content
just a normal inland element behavior
basically more interesting also is that
if I decrease the size now you can see
that our elements are not decreasing the
width they just keep their width and if
I decrease the size more well you can
see that all our elements are basically
hidden so this is what happens if I use
the inline flex value for our display
property now I don't think that's what
we want so let's change it back to flex
right here like that and save it
so if we go back now we can see that it
behaves like we had it before this is
nice but that's of course not everything
we can do with flexbox because with that
we now just defined that this should be
our Flex container but of course now we
have lots of possibilities how to change
the way these flex items behave and to
see that we will add another property
and this property is called flex flow
like that and these standard values
because we will need two values for the
Flex flow our row and no rap this one
right here now why am i adding two
values here well the reason is simple
this flex flow property combines two
separate properties which you could also
use but I like to use this combined flex
flow property and which properties are
these actually well let me comment this
maybe right here Rho simply refers to
the Flex Direction property and no rep
so the second value refers to flex rep
well kind of intuitive actually like
that as I said you can also write these
two properties separately but I'll stick
to flex flow because I think it's easier
to use however if we save that and go
back and reload our page we can see that
the behavior is exactly the way it was
before because as I said this is the
standard value or these are the standard
values however let's change that now and
let me start with the second value with
no rep so let's change the Flex rep
property because if we have no rep right
here well we can also have rap of course
if we save that and go back then we'll
see something interesting because if you
look the page you can see well nothing
happens that's not really interesting
but if I now decrease the size of the
page can you see it now our elements
will wrap as the name says and what does
rep mean here well it basically simply
wraps as soon as we reached a point
where it would have to reduce the width
of our items as you can see it keeps the
200 width of our width 200 pixels items
down there if I wrap that further you
can see that it keeps that width and
then comes finally the point where it
decreases the size of these elements as
you can see it cannot decrease that size
right here because the content simply
occupies that space but that's basically
how Rev works and there is also another
important thing that you might see
already and we'll talk about that in a
few seconds you can also see that if you
look at the last two elements you can
see that now the height of this element
decreased significantly because right
here we have a height of 150 pixels
although we didn't define any height but
for this element now when it's wrapped
it only has the height of 18 point 5
pixels so the value it needs to display
the content and that's also something
really interesting but this is also
something that we can change as I said
we'll talk about that in a few seconds
the main thing that changed now is that
adding wrap as a value for the Flex wrap
property allows us to well let our items
wrap we also have another option right
here we can also use you can see it
already wrap reverse if we use that and
go back and reload the page like this we
can see that if we now decrease the size
it wraps well reverse as the name says
now our two elements right here are on
top and if one right here is at the
bottom almost something you can use just
by simply changing the value that we
have right here however I will stick to
wrap because I think that's the more
intuitive and maybe normal way that you
would expect
to happen to your elements if you want
to wrap it however we also have this one
flex direction so this value right there
and the standard value is Rho but as you
can imagine you could also change that
to column right here if we save that and
go back to our page and reload it mu
then we see actually a lot of
interesting things because the main
thing of course is that now it is
displayed as a column again or the
elements are displayed in a column again
and this is more the behavior we know
from the normal block level elements and
if I decrease the width you can see it
behaves just like we saw it before but
right here the elements don't become
smaller than the width that we defined
so basically not only the widest display
changed but also the behavior changed
not it's interesting and also something
we'll have a look at in the next minutes
but there is more things we can change
right here if we go back and change it
from column to row reverse for example
and save that and go back and reload the
page we can now see that if we increase
our page we have the same behavior we
saw in the beginning referral but now
from a reverse perspective so that's
also possible and as you can see if we
decrease the size you can see that our
elements decrease until they reach the
minimum width they need for the content
let's increase that or let's maybe keep
it like that
this and let's not change it to as you
can imagine column reverse like that and
let's go back and reload the page and as
you can see now it is displayed
differently again now we see the phone
right here and the elements are
basically aligned to the left here and
if I decrease the size you can see that
again the width of the element stays the
way it was defined initially now this
can be really confusing so this whole
row column reverse column reverse
roofing and there is also a really
important aspect included into that that
you have to understand
to make sure that you can use flexbox
and because of that it's now time to go
back to theory again to understand what
actually happened here because the main
thing you have to understand right here
is nine X's versus cross X's now it gets
even more confusing but let's have a
look at it
step by step so first we have this thing
right here this is basically our website
or to be more precise this is our flex
container now what we did we added flex
direction you remember flex flow the
first value this is the Flex Direction
property now we add the value of Rho in
the beginning this was the default value
that we had what does this mean for our
container for our Flex container well
this basically means that the main axis
goes from the top left corner to the
right as indicated by the arrow that's
the main axis just keep that in mind and
if we have a main axis then we also have
a cross axis and the cross axis starts
at the same position as the main axis
but still goes downwards of course so
that's the basic setup we saw in the
beginning now we can also change that
because we saw that we didn't only have
Rho we also had Rho reverse now what
does this mean well Rho reverse simply
means this right here our main axis now
starts in the right top corner because
if the normal row is from left to right
from the top left to the top right then
Rho reverse well this should be from the
top right to the top left corner of our
containing of our Flex container so this
is the main axis then and this is the
cross axis so this is what happens
between Rho and Rho reverse let's go
back to the code and try this out once
again to make sure we understand that so
back in the code now we will add row
once again like this
go back and increase the size maybe like
this and reload the page so we know that
we now set our Flex flow to row and so D
main axis starts right here in the top
left corner and goes from left to right
across axis then
goes from top to bottom you cannot see
it right here but that's just what it is
now if we change it if you go back and
change it to row reverse save that and
go back again you can see that now if
one starts right here in the right top
corner so it goes from left sorry from
right to left right here and the cross
X's goes down here and if you don't
believe me with the cross axis we can
simply decrease the size or the width
fear as you can see it like that and as
you can see the elements start right
here and they are all aligned to the
right basically so to the cross axis if
we go back and change it back to row
right here
oops sorry without the e and go back
again and reload the page now everything
is aligned right here to the left
basically because now our cross axis
starts in the top left corner so that's
the first thing that's row versus row
reverse let's increase the size let's
maybe keep it like that because if we
now go back to our slide and now have a
look at two more examples and the first
one is this right here we have 2 flex
direction of column now can you imagine
what happens then to our to access that
we have I hope you can maybe you can't
no problem because what happens now is
that our main axis now goes from the top
left corner to the bottom so not anymore
from the top left corner to the right
because we changed the way or we change
our two axes with that column value and
if the main axis goes from top left to
bottom then the cross axis has to go
from the top left to the right now if we
continue that and think about that from
one last perspective this would be flex
direction column reverse can you imagine
now what happens well maybe you can
because what simply happens now is that
column reverse simply goes from the
bottom left corner because remember with
column we started in the top left corner
and went to the bottom left corner and
column reverse then well this means that
across axis has to start in the bottom
left corner and go up to the top left
corner again
and this also means that our starting
point for this two axis is now the
bottom left corner and therefore the
cross axis will also start there so this
is basically what you have to keep in
mind and the easiest thing to remember
that is actually that the starting point
so the initial starting point for the
standard value which is Rho is the top
left corner of your Flex container so if
you add a value of Rho you start right
there with the main axis going from left
to right if you take Rho reverse you
still stay in the top corner but then
you start reverse so you start in the
right top corner if you define column as
a value well the starting point is still
the top-left corner but now your main
axis doesn't go to the right but it goes
down and finally if you have a value of
column reverse well then your starting
point initially is the top left corner
but as you have reverse you just have to
go down to the bottom left corner and
then go up again to define the main axis
so then the bottom left corner is your
starting point so as I said try to keep
that schema in mind because it helps you
a lot to understand how flexbox actually
works and if you now go back to our code
and now change Row two column like that
go back and reload the page you can see
that our items now behave differently
and if we change it to column reverse
right here like that then you can see
that it starts in the bottom left corner
as I show you and goes up to the top so
that's basically this core concept
behind the Flex direction and this is
really important because the direction
or the position of the main and cross
axis has a lot of impact or consequences
for other properties that we can use for
example if we have a look at our website
again and change it back to column right
here that we load that you can see that
basically the width the maximum width
right
simply answered 150 150 200 200 we
sought it already but if I change it now
to row to row right there and reload the
page and increase the size you can see
that the height of all our elements is
kind of well stretched to fit the entire
Flex container and this behavior can be
changed of course and to understand this
behavior we need more properties and we
need to understand what we just saw
about the main axis and the cross axis
so let's have a look at these properties
now because the properties we can add or
will add are the following ones it's a
line items and it's justify content so
two more properties now what does this
mean what are these properties doing
let's have a look at it in an example
because this tenet value for online
items is this one stretch so if we save
that and go back and we load the page we
can see that nothing is happening but if
I go back now and change stretch to
Center save that go back then you can
see something interesting because right
now the height of these elements is just
the height that is required to display
the content so it's not well s devalue
said stretched to the maximum anymore so
aligned items
seems to have an impact on to the height
of our elements and I must say that this
is totally wrong so don't remember that
I just said that because this is what
you could see right here because if I
simply change now our Flex flow from row
2 column
oops right here to column and reload the
page can you see what happens it's not
the impact on to the height as you might
have thought it now is an impact on to
the way our elements at this plate on
our website regarding the position and
in this case it's the center position
and why is it then not referring to the
height as I just said
would be wrong because a line items only
refers to the position of our items
relating to the cross axis you remember
the cross axis now goes from left to
right because we defined a flex
direction of column so this means our
main axis goes down here and the cross
axis goes right here from left to right
and we defined a value for aligned items
so you can remember that as aligned
items along of the cross axis of sender
this means if I now change that value to
flex start for example and save that go
back right here then it's aligned to the
right because you remember our starting
point is right here in the top left
corner we have the main axis going down
right there but that doesn't have an
impact for online items and we have our
cross axis starting right here so this
is the starting point and flex start
simply means okay position the items
right here at the beginning of our cross
axis mainly now if we go back and change
flex flow from column to row once again
and save that and reload the page then
the behavior changes again because now
our main axis starts right here from
here to here from left to right and our
cross axis goes from top to bottom right
there and this means the cross axis
starts right here so the starting point
is right there at this part this means
if I change aligned items back again to
Center like that and save it then we are
centered because again starting point of
the cross axis and point of the cross
axis center of the cross axis this is
basically what a line items do so keep
in mind a line items refers to the cross
axis that's really important now you
might say okay I got there I understand
that the position of the cross axis
changes depending on the flex direction
and that we can change the behavior of
the items in relation or in
direction of the cross axis with aligned
items but what about the main axis then
good question actually and the main axis
can of course also be changed or the
behavior of the items in relation to the
main axis and this can be done with
justify content right here because if we
now add justified content Center for
example right here and save that go back
we can see that our items are now
centered if you can see that more maybe
are now centered along the main axis
again keep in mind flex Direction is row
main axis goes from left to right and
justified content refers to the
positioning of the items along our main
axis so if I now change Center to flex
star or flex end maybe would be smarter
I think like that and if we go back and
reload the page you can see that now our
items I can increase it anymore sorry
but you can now see that our items are
now positioned at the end of our main
axis and if we now add another thing if
you know add a height for our Flex
container of I don't know maybe 600
pixels like that and reload the page
maybe that's that's too big I'm sorry
let's make 500 maybe I think that we can
see better yeah then you can see it
better maybe because if I decrease the
size so let's keep it like that and if I
now write Flex start right here for a
line items and go back you can see that
now aligned items so the positioning
along the cross axis so here to here is
start at the beginning anti position of
our items in relation to the main axis
so left to right in our case is now flex
and this is defined by justified content
you can see it ends right here we have a
gap in the beginning and justify content
just says that now if we set both to
Center works
again like this and like that then we
can see that the entire content is
basically centered and looks like that
so this is what it basically looks like
and I know that this can be kind of
abstract in the beginning therefore
let's have a quick look at a slide that
summarizes kind of what we saw right
here in this practical example because
basically what happened now of what we
talked about now is the following we
have the Flex direction of rosette for
example this means we have our website
and on our website we have the main
access starting in the top left corner
we talked about that anti cross axis
also starting in the top left corner but
going from top to bottom we saw that and
we know that already
what happens now with justified content
and the line items is the following with
justified content we define the position
of the elements along our main axis in
this case and if this defines the main
axis well aligned items simply defines
the position along the cross axis this
is what we just saw in this example now
if we think back about that from the
Flex Direction column perspective it
slightly changes because our website
looks like that and we now have the
cross axis going from left to right
that's a difference you remember because
now we have the Flex direction column
defined and this means the main axis
goes from top to bottom and this also
has an impact on to our illini 'tom and
onto our justified content property
because aligned items now refers to the
cross axis but from left to right so how
these items are positioned there and
justify content refers to the main axis
again but now this is referring from the
top and bottom positioning basically
right there
so maybe also keep that in mind whenever
you're confused what happens now
regarding aligned items or justified
content and this is actually it
regarding these two properties now you
might ask yourself okay I understood
these properties but which values can I
apply right here how can I play around
with these different values and a good
source for that is as quite often
actually
mdn the Mozilla developer Network if you
look right here on to this page you can
find a link to it down there in the
video description also so if you scroll
down a bit you can find some general
information about flexbox right here but
if you scroll down you can find all the
different properties you have right here
and in our case we used a line items for
example and if you click onto that you
can see all the different values you can
use for align items now as you can
imagine these are too much values to
have a look at them throughout this
video therefore you can just play around
with them now because you have the
theoretical background and there are
also interesting ones for example
baseline let's maybe try this one out
quickly because if we add baseline right
here as a value and save that and go
back and reload the page you can see
that now I hope it becomes clear right
here that the items are now aligned
based on their content so as you can see
this is one line this is for example
what baseline is doing maybe not the
result you want to have right here I
just wanted to show you that and how
this works now we are almost done with
the properties or with the core
properties that we can use for our Flex
container but there is one more
interesting thing that I would like to
show you and this thing is called align
content now you might say okay we got a
line items we got a line you got
justified content what is that now well
let's maybe start with our center value
again
because we know that already if we save
that and go back well we can see that
it's centers now but this is nothing to
do with this new value let me maybe undo
it and save it as you can see this is
not related to that but if I add Center
once again like that and reload the page
and if I decrease the size of our
website you can already see what happens
because with align content we can define
what happens with extra space that we
have in relation to our cross access so
from top to bottom if I go back right
here
and delete that save it you can see that
it is displayed like that so we need
more space by adding Center we say well
as the name says just Center my items
right here so it uses just the space
right here and if I now changed it for
example to a value like space between
like this for example and go back and
reload the page you can see that well as
the name says there is a space between
the first line and the second line
really important for the property it
only works if you have more than one
line because if I increase the size now
like this you can see that it basically
doesn't have any effect right here on to
the way our elements are displayed for
example if I use flex start right here
to show you that and save it and go back
and reload the page you can see nothing
changes but if I decrease the size you
can see that our items are now displayed
while at the beginning of our cross
access right here and this is it
actually this is the first part of our
flexbox video series here I know that
this can be quite confusing in the
beginning but if you keep in mind what
you can do with flex direction so
basically change the starting point of
your Flex container and bite at the
starting point and the direction of your
main axis and off your cross axis and if
you then keep in mind what happens to
align items so aligned items always
refers to the positioning of your Flex
items along the cross axis I cannot say
like this like that because it depends
but you know what I mean it's always
related to the cross axis then you have
justified content which always refers to
the positioning of your items along the
main axis and then you have align
content which always refers to the cross
axis but only in cases where you have
items in more than one line so I hope
with these examples and with this
background knowledge you are not ready
to start with Flex box and maybe use the
code you can find right here as I said
attach
the video or the link is attached to the
video to play around and to practice
that also used to MDN and play around
with the different values you can apply
to your properties because in the end
flexbox
is really awesome it's really helpful
and actually quite intuitive to use if
you got the basic concept however this
was just part one as I said because we
now only applied properties to our Flex
container but inside the Flex container
we have all these different items and so
far everything we changed affected all
of the items but what if you want to be
more precise what if you want to make
sure that specific items inside your
Flex container behave the way you want
well then you also need to apply some
properties to these items and we'll have
a look at that in the next video of the
series so I hope to see you there and as
always I can only say thanks a lot for
watching
hope to see you in the next video and
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
