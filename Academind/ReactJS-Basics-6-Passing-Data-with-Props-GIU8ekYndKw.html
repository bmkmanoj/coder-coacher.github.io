components already and that's great and
that would allow you to create a
flexible app with multiple components
but there is something missing or there
are actually a lot of things missing but
I'll come to them one thing is right now
we're not really taking advantage of the
fact that we're doing all that a
JavaScript we're not really able to
react to user input we're not really out
putting anything dynamic right now
there's no real advantage to just
creating pure HTML right well we'll get
there step by step and one important
thing is of course passing data from
components to components so let's say
from my app component I want to pass
data to my home component because home
component is as all components are a
component I can reuse I can use multiple
places I could create two home
components after all and if I save this
we see two new components and each
component might have a different
configuration so it would be nice if I
let's say could pair something like a
name or a age or whatever configuration
to this home component and display it
there and we can do this with a concept
called props for properties so what are
props therefore well for the case that
we have a component in another component
inside of another component and we want
to configure this component then we can
pass props into this component so back
in the code this would work like that
let's say you home component should get
a name and it's totally up to you what
you name this you can define what you
want to pass in there and then you pass
data by enclosing it in single curly
braces and then let's say a string in
this case Max and I also want to pass
something else let's say the age also in
overall I'm passing some user data here
now the age would be a number enclosed
in curly braces like that
and you could also pass an object here
so let's say I also have my user object
here and then this user object then you
could have something like again let's
say now name would be Ana and then
hobbies could be an array sports
whatever you like something like that
and then you could also pass this so you
also pass the user object then which is
user does one year should be a variable
of course so that is how you pass props
you just you find them like HTML
attributes on your component and then
the data you pass has to be enclosed in
single curly braces here and with that I
can go to my home component which will
receive these props and now how does it
receive or how can I use the props in
here it's actually really simple I can
exit it Annie render method or access it
here in your render method by accessing
this dub props so even though I haven't
created a property named props in this
class well remember we're extending
react component and react component has
this property so therefore I do have
access to my props here I can lock just
to the console and if I go back to my
application you see we locked something
here let's reload it here are some
objects and why is the second one empty
well because I'm loading home component
twice right and only the first time I'm
passing data the second time it's empty
that's why the first time my props
property provided by react has my name
my age and the user object and if we
have a look at this object well they can
of course access all the data here well
that means we cannot only access this he
exited here access it here in the
console we can also output it so in a
new component we could say your name is
and then this is how you output data in
a component also with single
curly braces this props name for example
so now we're getting to the place where
our components actually make sense we
can output data we can not only show
static content but instead output
something like for example properties
and we could output data which is not
passed by prop C or two I could all just
output let's say some text which is
something like so I could also output
that with single quality braces text and
the second thing you learned how to pass
props and how to use them like so oops
that should not be in your return
statement though should be above it so
with that I'm outputting the name and
your age is and then I would put this
dot prop stop age and we can also have
the cuter object so you could say user
object name is this props props user
name and then we have the hobbies write
name and hobbies right
it's called user yeah so this and then
we also have your hobbies like or let's
create and you line for that a div and
then we have hobbies like so hobbies and
then we want to output them in unordered
list let's say now here is the question
how could I loop through such an array
and now I know that is quite a lot we're
learning at the same time but it's key
to to understand what's happening here
looping through items in react is
actually really elegant you can do it
directly here you could do it before too
but you can do it here in your HTML code
if you want to call it like that by
access
thing whoops go out of T list item for
now by accessing this props dot user dot
hobbies then we can use the map function
since this is an array and we can
basically just say we have a callback in
here what we want to do for each element
in this array that's what the map
function allows me to do so I'll use T
fat arrow syntax since we use es6 code
if you're not aware what is is
definitely have a look at some es6
tutorials basically this will give me
each individual hobby the name here is
up to me and it can use this hobby then
to output something until something
should be the list item where I then
went to output the individual hobby
again enclosed in single curly brace
even I'm in curly braces here already
that is how you would do that now to
make this work we'll go back to the
index page remove the empty home
component for now so instead would give
me an error otherwise because I'm trying
to open things the abroad component
doesn't have and then if I go back you
see well we got all the wonderful new
output dynamically added to get our
hobbies here to get to something here
which is this text and we got the name
we pass in the age and from the user
object D name so really a lot of stuff
and all dynamically input into my render
function and into this component here
through props from outside of it but
like text also from inside of it the key
thing to take away is that this is the
syntax how to output data in your
component in your HTML code in the
components able to say single curly
braces and then whatever you want output
can be properties you're getting passed
into from outside but can also be
variables or properties of your home
class here like text which is this
variable defined up here and that's
really key to understand as of course is
this way to loop here now regarding loop
there's an interesting thing we don't
see it here
first I'm adding a number hobby year
let's say reading and that will work but
if we open up the console we see that we
get this warning which tells me that I
should provide a unique key for each
property here and that is because I'm in
a loop here with the list item and in
order to make reactions work better get
a better performance so to say I should
give each element a key so that reacts
yes is able to uniquely identify it
otherwise when checking if it needs to
update it will need to check all the
elements as doesn't have clear
references to assign a key as simply
right key here like a prop and then just
give it a key in order to get one I'll
add a second argument to my fat arrow
function to the arguments I get passed
into it automatically by the map method
Welch I will name I which is just the
current iteration number so starting at
0 than 1 and so on and I will pass this
as a key and with that if I save it well
you see that's just some hot reloading
box I got but the warning went away and
with that I got clean code again and
with that you saw how to output data and
how to pass props two very important key
concepts to work with react chess and to
build react.js applications which are
more than just displaying HTML pages but
instead are actually outputting data are
dynamic and are able to interact with
each other though until now only from
parent to child but we'll see the other
direction soon too before we're coming
to events and state and how components
can interact with each other let's talk
about props a little bit more there are
two other things which are important
which I want to hide
here the first one our prop types prop
types is a concept you will find in
react chairs which allows you to
validate these props it's a good
practice to set up prop types to tell
react what type a certain prop type will
have for the home component you can set
a boom or prop types by accessing your
home class outside of it here outside of
the class body and then access prop
types like this that's an object you got
built in to react chairs this simply is
a JavaScript object and there you list
all your props you're expecting as keys
so we have a named prop then we have a H
prop and we have this user prop and then
you confer them so the name prop here
for example is and then you access react
for that and then you prop types object
on you react based class here or base
module this shall be a string like that
so with that I'm just telling react hey
this property this name property will be
a string and in order to learn more
about available prom types
simply lizard the official react.js page
and then adjust google for prop types to
find out more about available prop types
here the H here for example will be of
type number and the user here will be an
object so this will be of type object
and again it's just a good practice to
do this and if stat should all be
capital case by the way capital case P
here at the beginning for prop types so
with that if you save that you see it
still works but it's a good practice to
let react.js know about these prompt
types and well use them prop types and
force that your components get used
correctly and you get errors if you try
to set a prop to a type it's not meant
to be we do this because javascript
doesn't have types built in right it's
not
five script it has dynamic types we can
reassign a string to be a number
therefore prop types allow us to make
sure that we only use the types we want
to use now the other thing I wanted to
show you is that you can also pass data
into a component from another component
without using props because consider
this example here you have your home
component that's all nice but besides
these props you pass here you might have
let's say some text you want to pass and
that would be a common thing if you
think about a widget like let's say a
tabs component where you have multiple
tabs then you might want to pass a
specific text or HTML code into this
component from outside and not through a
prop so you want to write something like
this opening a closing tag and in
between you want to have let's say a
paragraph this is a paragraph like that
now it would be nice to render this
paragraph in my home component and in
order to do this react.js has a special
property you can access it's called on
this props of course and then children
now children is a reserved word which
just means whatever is passed between
the opening and closing tag here so if I
save this and go back we see this is a
paragraph and if we inspect this we'd
see it really is a paragraph so the HTML
code was also passed successfully not
just the text also DP tags and that is
how you can use or pass complete code
including components by the way from
outside into your component yes using
props indirectly but not setting it up
as props here in this attribute like
style of course it's a good practice to
also set up the children props here so
children and now since you can't you
find a type of that
what is a good idea is to access prop
types and then element is required for
example no it's not that
is required like this if I save this and
go back it should work and no errors in
the console so with that we're using
your children props again a reserved
word we set it up correctly here just
make it required and we're passing it
from outside of course that means
whenever we recreate this home component
we will have to pass something since
children is required in our case here so
with that we're done having a look at
props we learned a lot about props and
not only props also how to generally
output data in react that really was a
key part of the series and with that we
can continue to events and then also
state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
