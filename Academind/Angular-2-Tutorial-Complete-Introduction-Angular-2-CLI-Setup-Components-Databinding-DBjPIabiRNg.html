contains lectures of the first two
modules of my five-star rated udemy
course on angular 2 and it will walk you
through the very basics of setting up
your angular 2 application with the
angle at UCL I and then creating your
components and using data binding by the
end of the video you'll be able to
create your first angular 2 applications
and not only know how to create it but
what you're doing there if you enjoy it
definitely have a look at my full course
to which you'll find a link in the
description and with that I wish you a
lot of fun with the video
let me quickly go over what angular 2
actually is it is a framework to create
single page applications now that of
course raises the next question what are
single page applications let's first
have a look at that traditional web
application which means a server-side
application we have a user who uses the
client whore who is the client and
simulate this for example by using a
browser which is what we do all the time
when we access the Internet we also get
a server which holds our business logic
our data and stores our website renders
our website when the user clicks on a
link for example the client will send a
request to the server when the same is
true when we enter a URL for example and
the server will handle this request and
well send back a response ad in a
traditional web application where we
only have a server-side language or
framework we would send back a response
which contains HTML code which the
browser should render and finally view
to the user now the problem here is that
we got a lot of requests to the server
with this approach for example we might
visit example.com and this what is your
request service since back HTML then we
decide to wizard example calm about
request response example.com account
request response and you get my point
for each different URL or we don't even
have to switch your else for each
request where something has to change
we probably have to query the server to
get back to new data or the new view we
want to show to the user and with this
approach we spend a lot of time sending
requests and getting response as the
server has to work with that the data
has to travel through the internet so
that is a lot of time that is spent on
the task and this in turn will lead to a
slow feeling of webpages do you know
what happens if you use the apps on your
eyes
or on your mobile phone in general it
feels very very fast most of the time
and we want to bring that feeling that a
polite feeling to the browser to where
we don't have to load new pages upon
each action therefore in a single page
application the user still clicks link
and this is handled by the client
however the client handles that on its
own and will rerender the HTML page
through JavaScript so the server is
totally left out here if it is possible
if no data from the server is needed of
course and the client can handle all
that on its own that of course is much
faster because we don't have to send any
data over the Internet we don't have to
wait for a response we don't have to
render that response everything is done
within the browser of course there are
some times where we have to send a
request because we might need some data
from the server or some business logic
which you can only store on the server
in this case we will send a request and
we'll get back a response but besides
initial loading and server-side
operations which are absolutely
necessary we won't need that and if we
do need it we will do it asynchronously
which means we still rerender the page
instantly to the user and we'll wait for
new data to arrive and then incorporate
that and well rerender with you again or
whatever is appropriate this leads to
enough different count of requests which
we have to handle by the server we might
with at example.com and we will need to
query the server to get the initial HTML
file which will hold our single page
application however for the next request
when we wizard the about page we might
not need the server so no request is
sent here if we access the account we
might need some user data so here again
we would make a server request but as
you can already see we saved one request
and with that a lot of time and even at
the times where we do send requests
especially the account page here we
still provide the instant feeling or it
is very reactive feeling to the user
because we will handle
response data asynchronously as we are
able to instantly rerender the page
fruit JavaScript therefore angular 2
handles the incoming user requests or
the winds which are sent through URL
changes or Dom or mouse events issued by
the user it then parses the URL to route
appropriately and all stand on the front
end in the angular 2 router no request
is necessarily sent to the server here
and finally it renders this new page by
changing the parts of the dom which
needs to be changed and the Dom of
course here refers to the document
object model so the HTML code in the end
and that is done with JavaScript and
therefore feels very reactive as it runs
solely in the browser all that stand
through directives components data
binding and if you're not sure what all
this means
while that is what this course is about
great so now that you learned what an
angler to application is why you could
use a lot you as a solution for your web
project and at least in theory how it
works and that components play a very
important role I think it's time to make
the step from theory to practice and
start with the first application in this
course so let's do this for this
application of course also set the
basics which you will need for all the
other projects and examples throughout
this course so the bare minimums your
system should have two well create angle
to applications but no worries it's
really easy it's only one thing you'll
need for this course and that is node.js
so head over to noches org and then
simply download the latest version for
your operating system
so simply click this link and then save
it wherever you like once this is
downloaded make sure to head fruity
installer and install it on your
operating system and you're good to go
now you might be wondering what do you
need no chess because we're creating an
angle a to application not no chess
right well we need it for two reasons
one reason is yes we're creating an
angular 2 application but that needs to
be served from a tiny little server as
well and well no chess is capable of
running such a light white simple server
as we will need it the second reason is
throughout this course I will use the
angular command-line interface or the
angular 2 command-line interface to
create all these examples and several
well components or general pieces of
those applications and you'll learn it
throughout this course now no worries if
you don't want to use the command line
interface all the code we write works
exactly the same way in your custom
setup project and all the code is in one
single source folder so you're easily
able to convert well the code you see
here or the structure you see here into
your custom workflow additionally I also
have a complete module on setting up
your own workspace or workflow without
ECL I however the CLI makes it real easy
to create projects and that as well use
it so as mentioned
we're for the seal I will also meet no
chess since well we need to know its
package manager and p.m. to install the
angular CLI in the first place and the
CLI itself will also need note - well do
all the magic for us so enough of the
talking let's install the angular -
saliva this can easily be done from the
terminal or command line interface if
you're on Windows and since you
installed notes yes you have
NPM notes package manager available
therefore the only step required is to
run NPM install - g2 install it globally
on your machine angular CLI now this
will work on Windows if you're on Mac or
Linux you might need to add a sudo at
the beginning to give just the right
administrative rights then hit enter and
well here on Mac I'm prompted to enter
my password so I'm doing this real quick
and then this will install the angular
angular C live for me
notice when I take a couple of seconds
I'll CEO once this is finished at the
end you should see something like this
of course the version might worry
whenever you watch this video but it
should finish without an error then in
the same terminal or command line window
navigate into the directory where you
want to host all your project folders
once you are there simply run ng this
will well trigger the angular CLI which
has installed new to create a new
project and then the name of the project
which will also be the name of the
folder so I'm going to call it first app
now this will automatically install a
couple of dependencies and so on it will
also take some seconds so I'll be back
once this is done see you then
so now to set up you're finished and the
angular 2 CLI automatically creates a
tiny little app for you so let's have a
look at this we can easily start up our
little web server I was talking of
earlier also managed and created by the
angular angular CLI as well as our app
by typing ng surf this will Wells well
first we have to navigate into our newly
created fold of the
so now Angie's earth this will spin up
this server and also keep the server
running and whenever you change
something in your app it will live
update so you don't have to hit the
reload button but we're not at this
point yet so let's have a look at our
application first over in the browser
I'll have to localhost four thousand two
hundred this is where this app is how as
to that and you'll see first app works
yay you created your first sigma2
application though I see your point
that we didn't actually do that much so
let's dive into the code and change a
little bit
so I opened this project in webstorm my
favorite IDE for angular 2 development
sensei it ships with great angular 2 and
typescript support however you may of
course use whichever editor or IDE you
prefer I know that Visual Studio 2015
which is free at least a code version so
did this basic version offers good
typescript angle to support or you might
choose sublime text or atom 8 editor
with the right plugins that will
certainly work as well anyways so we got
this project structure and will that's a
lot in one of the next lectures I'll
talk about this structure at least its
variable but their basics of it and in
the angular seal I module at the end of
the scores I'll go into a bit of more
detail here the most important thing for
us right now is to know that in this
dist:4 here the compiled and finished
code will live and in the source folder
is where we edit our application so why
do we have there's two folders well
you'll see this in a later lecture when
I talk about typescript but generally we
will write our code in typescript not in
JavaScript and therefore this will need
to get compiled in order to run in the
browser which is only able to surf
javascript this is the reason so
therefore here in this source folder we
see our index.html file which is two
file hosted by this mini server and we
have this app folder now as I said I'll
come back to the structure first let's
have a look at the app folder here we
have this first app component dot TS
file and we got this HTML the CSS and
the dots back ts file well that's backed
up ts is for testing purposes and we're
not having unit tests here so I'll get
rid of this the other files here are
important though if I open up this HTML
file this might be the one we see right
well we got h1 and then this title thing
in the middle if we have a look at our
running application this looks like a h1
tag but it's not saying Kali brace Kali
brace tyler crowe libre scully brace
instead it says first AB words well
that's because this is Anglet use
template syntax and here we're using
string interpolation a technical of
course later learn in this course so
basically here we're outputting some
dynamic content where does this content
for a come from well from this first a
parent T asphalt which is the typescript
code which will again later get compiled
to JavaScript to run in the browser so
this is the actual logic of this
component and once it does look that
much code here in this file it's quite
important we get this component import
here from the angular library or
framework which basically allows us to
make this class a component by adding
this add component decorator and again
I'll come back to that in the component
module this is just a first up here then
we basically have some configuration for
this component and the two most
important ones for us right now as the
selector first app app and the template
URL first app component on HTML which of
course the HTML file I just had a look
at so here this seems to be the file
which gets loaded and first app app
selector seems to be important for
loading this component here and you will
find the selector in the index dot HTML
file which is the file serve by the
server now here's a lot of code at the
top and that's basically all from the
angular CLI making sure that well the de
life reloading is working then here this
part is responsible for loading all the
dependencies de imports we need to make
our application run but then here with
system import system chasis the module
loader will we're using this app so
basically a program making sure that the
right files are getting loaded we're
importing main now this will basically
start our app and I will talk about this
in a component section however here
you see this first app app thing and
there certainly isn't a default HTML tag
this instead is the selector we
specified in this type script file so it
looks like the selector is important
here because it allows us to basically
create new HTML components or elements
which you can place in our HTML code to
load our components because this loading
text here is certainly not what we're
seeing we're seeing the content of this
HTML file well and this dynamic content
then interrupted into the content kind
of so this is what we see and this
indeed is how an angler to application
works you create new components new HTML
elements if you want to put it this way
but it's a bit more as you will learn
and then you can use them in your code
now L said there's a bit more to it and
you will learn this but basically this
is how it is first app application runs
and since we know that we know that this
HTML file here is the right place to
change something or it since we are
outputting some dynamic content we
search for this content this title well
maybe you already saw it is here in this
dot ts file here title first app works
this clearly is the text we see here so
if we change this to does this show up
and I save this and all you do have to
do is hit command or ctrl s to save you
will see that your browser already
updated and you see does to show up
isn't that awesome
and this is how you would generally work
with that it's life updating and that's
how you work with components you can
change some content in your class here
which you might output the HTML file or
if you don't need dynamic content you
may of course also enter anything
directly into this file like hi I'm also
displaying which will give us this
paragraph here that's a for the first
app and I'm pretty sure
this was a lot of stuff you probably
didn't know yet otherwise you wouldn't
take the course you will learn
throughout this Court though and this
generally is how quickly you get set up
with the angular CLI and in the next
lecture I'll go briefly over this
structure the most important things
about the structure and thereafter
you'll learn a bit of a typescript and
then it's time to get started with
components see you there
so as promised just a quick overview
over all the folders and files which
were created by the angular CLI I will
keep this brief
on purpose because I don't want to bore
you if you're interested check out the
separate module on the Inglis Eli where
I will go through that in a bit more
detail and also explain how to use the
angular CLI in general though you'll
learn a lot of that by just following
through that course I made sure dad well
you're always on the same page as I and
I'm not using any commands you don't
know or understand so if you were not
interested into details about a
structure right now you might just skip
this with you your so there okay so
let's continue I'll give you all these
folders and files from top to bottom
while not through each file of course
this conflict folder very easy hold some
config and you probably won't need to
change anything here as it is mostly for
testing purposes the dist folder is the
deployed or the both app and what you or
the angular CLI builds our application
whenever we change something and save
this file this will then trigger the
live reload of the browser and the files
which are actually served the browser
can be found in this test folder
therefore we never write directly in
that folder we let the angular seal I
manage this folder for us and we need
this extra folder since we're using
typescript and this has to be compiled
to JavaScript D CLI also supports
compiling SCSS OSS code to CSS if you
want to use that and anyways there are
some optimizations which need to be done
for example we don't need all the node
modules all the dependencies installed
here but just some of them and the
required ones will be copied into this
vendor folder here for example and all
the development only dependencies will
be left node marshals folder so that we
don't upload unnecessary stuff on our
server once we actually deploy the app
that's the dist folder the e3 folder is
for end-to-end testing and not
interesting to us right now the node
modules folder holds
all the dependencies of our project
including development only dependencies
we need this for development but as I
said for deployment all relevant
dependencies will be copied into this
vendor folder in the dist folder this
public folder is empty you could store
any files you also want to copy into
your dist folder there so if you have
some images for example or anything like
that the source folder as I already said
is the meat of our app here we're
creating our application here we're
working with components with typescript
files with the templates and so on and
basically here we get this app folder
which holds all our typescript files and
templates of our components and we get
well this root folder with you are
important in next our HTML file which is
responsible for loading and starting a
wrap this is the only file which
technically gets served by the server to
the browser to be rendered since we're
creating a single page application and
we get a couple of other files now I
could talk hours about them but
basically the main dot TS file is very
important you'll learn more about it in
the component section it's responsible
for starting a poor application to give
angular to this initial kick it needs to
well run and to identify that this year
this four-step app actually is a
component so that's basically their
important this is the file which gets
import here mein refers to main dot TS
or later in the compiled version main
dot is of course system config is rel
responsible for configuring system TS
which is the marshall loader you see it
in action here all these system commands
and well this file might look very
complicated and long it's very simple in
the end basically everything down here
asked this common sass is managed by the
command-line interface and just make
sure that all the dependencies get
imported correctly and are a whale
available to our application and up here
well nothing is specified here you can
later on change some things if you add
for
party packages for example and also
check out the module on the Anglo seal I
to learn more about that
well this TS conflict a chaser file is
important for D type script compilation
and the default settings should be fine
but whenever you need to change
something but you should know what you
do then you can do it here the typing
starts DTS falwell is important for two
things it declares one variable here
which is used in all the typescript
files which is important to not get
compilation errors and more importantly
or also as important it imports a couple
of typing's now what are typing typing
is kind of hard bridge between
JavaScript libraries and typescript code
you can mix typescript code with normal
JavaScript code and indeed you'll often
do but if you want to use a pure
JavaScript library which was not written
in typescript you need kind of a bridge
if you want to get compiler support and
IDE support like auto completion so that
basically the typescript code knows
which types the JavaScript code uses
even though javascript doesn't have
typings and that's exactly what the
Taipings files here will define so this
is generally optional it would work
without it but you would get some errors
there's a spider this year well and
that's all for resourcefully I want to
talk about right now
now the temp folder here is very strange
and basically does this need by the
angular CLI during the build process
nothing important for us typings folder
of course houses typings I was talking
about when talking about this typings
file all the other files here also are
providing some configuration for our
project most importantly the angular see
light or chase and file anti angular CLI
both chase file which allow YouTube for
example when working with third-party
projects implement them here or
generally change the basic setup of your
application like for example the prefix
you want to set for each selector by
default where your source file lives and
so on
in general you don't need to change
anything here so that was the put as
brief as possible overview over the
structure now who puts clear how all
that works with that time to continue
with the next videos
so once typescript typescript is as I
said a superset JavaScript it adds new
features to the JavaScript language most
importantly types but also classes
modules and much more that makes up
typescript and besides these extras it
is JavaScript with but different syntax
but not really that far away in the end
the browser can't run typescript
therefore typescript will always be
compiled into JavaScript which is what
the browser is able to read now you
might ask how can we compile something
which is not included in JavaScript to
JavaScript well you can do that because
for some things like classes there are
different ways to write it in JavaScript
and for things like types which simply
don't exist in JavaScript we don't have
strong typing in JavaScript well this
will be left out but it's good to have
it anyway because the typescript
compiler will check those types and give
us errors if we misuse types or use them
wrongly so we get this extra level of
security which is one of the biggest
benefits typescript offers us because
speaking of benefits why would you want
to use typescript instead of JavaScript
well there are some general reasons and
some angler to specific ones the general
reasons would be that you have that
strong typing I just mentioned which
means that you set which property will
have which type for example that a
property should be a string if you then
try to assign a type which does not
match the compiler and probably your IDE
too will give you an error and that
prevents you from making a lot of
difficult to find errors as you look at
this check right out of the box at the
beginning so that's the biggest and most
important feature as tiny as it might
sound but it is not another reason is
that you can use next-generation
JavaScript features today for example
classes imports and exports so that
modular multi file approach and as I
explained some of these things will
transpile into two-day JavaScript cell
prototypes and so on and some things
might be left out but are still usable
with the types of compiler to give you
errors and so on another reason would be
that you get missing JavaScript features
like interfaces or generics now
JavaScript doesn't have any similar
thing
however again the compiler knows that we
for example want to have an interface
which forces us to implement a certain
method and therefore can yell at us if
we don't do that and after the
compilation step is finished yes we
won't have to feature anymore but we
don't need to because we already checked
it before third so that are the general
reasons now if you are not convinced and
well you probably should be but if
you're not let's talk about dealing or
two specific ones very importantly
documentation support is mostly in
typescript and yes this will probably be
added for pure JavaScript in the future
but the maturity of examples and
articles you find uses typescript so it
makes your world a lot easier if you're
using typescript to the questions why is
that the case why is everything in
typescript well because the angular 2
team chose typescript as the main
language so to say for angular 2 and of
course it is due to the reasons you can
find on the left in the general part and
as all of this is the case
this course will use typescript and I
strongly encourage you to do the same so
with that the question is how do you use
typescript well if the angular CLI
projects you don't have to separately
install it because the project will
automatically do that for you however
you still might want to install it
globally on your machine and you can do
this with the serial on Mac on Windows
leave out sudo npm install' typescript -
G command and I'll do this in my machine
because you might need it in other
projects which are not related channel 2
or and you will see this in one of the
next
when using TS lint which is a little
support helping you to write clean and
well formatted typescript code so I will
quit my running server here for now and
install type script by typing npm
install' g type script and I should add
sudo since our Maxwell do that enter my
password here real quick and that will
install typescript globally on my
machine and in my case as I already had
it just updated to the latest version
so until now you saw your first
application you saw you could change a
tiny bit of it um we went through the
project structure and all of that and
that's nice but what's actually
happening in an angular 2 application
what's angular 2 doing and how do we
build an angle application well of
course with all these files but what's
inside those files the core concepts of
angular 2 applications are components
and directives with components being
directives now what's that well
directives are instructions in the code
in the HTML code telling angular 2 which
is the application running over you code
what to do and components are such a
very important instructions which tell
angular 2 how to render certain pieces
of your application so if we have a look
at our browser window here and we're on
example.com well we probably see a
header with products and about link for
example and on the products page you
might have multiple products kind of a
sidebar on the right and all of these
things here are components of course
they are living on a kind of a route
component a component holding everything
together that is the app component you
saw in the first app lecture where we
had this app component being
bootstrapped and the main dot TS file if
you remember this and that's the core
computer root component holding your
application but then your application
consists of multiple smaller components
sitting on that root component and that
is the key concept of an angular 2
application when you're creating angular
2 apps you'll be building components and
component does not only mean HTML code
which is rendered in a browser but also
the logic behind that code so handling
user events loading data doing
calculations interacting with our
components
of course you because of course your
points are and stand alone they work
together so this is the key concept of
energy and when you're creating an app
you'll be bowling components which again
have a view HTML code you see in the
browser rendered as a web page anta
logic attached to that HTML code and
within each component you may have
references or selectors of other
instructions other directives or
components so that you build up your
application of these building blocks
which then work together and make up
your overall application because if we
have a look at our web page here we can
basically identify a couple of
components we have our item components
we have two sidebar component the header
component and of course the root
component I was mentioning
back in the project this as I mentioned
first app app component here has this
extra app because angular seal I put
this app there because this is the root
component being started in this main OTS
file on the bootstrap methods method
which loads app or overall application
so this is the root component holding
our components and throughout this
module you will see how we create
several components and let them work
together but for now I want to stick at
this first app that component es file in
this file you can see we got a
typescript class which of course gets
compiled to JavaScript as all the
typescript code does and this class has
a name of first app app component this
class has a property title which is of
type string and says does that really
work we're exporting this class here to
make it available outside of this file
too so this is a module this is
automatically transformed into a module
which you can import using the import
statement like we're doing it here at
the top of this file for the component
metadata we're importing from the
angular 2 framework that being said
that's a very important step this
component metadata which you see
attached right above this class you can
see that we have an app sign at the
beginning which indicates that this is a
typescript decorator which allows us to
easily add metadata to a class now
rightfull you may ask what is metadata
what's that how what does do well
metadata is basically some additional
information you attach to a class which
you can't order want you include in a
class body and which will tell
JavaScript or in the end angular to what
this class should be transformed to or
give it some additional information
otherwise this would be plain normal
class and angler queue would not know
that this is a component it should
render to the screen and so on with the
add component decorator angular 2 does
know that and it knows okay this is a
normal class and I will transform it
into a component
we'll use it like a component now what
makes up a component some of the things
we define here in this component
decorator this component decorator takes
a javascript object as an argument as
you can see and then here we get four
fields defined now be aware that there
are a lot of the other fields too and
you don't need all of the fields of the
configuration for each component it
depends on what your component does
witch dependencies or other things this
component might have and you will see
them being added step by step throughout
this course this component here has a
module ID and we'll come back to that in
a second it has a selector too and this
is the very important thing this first
app app selector here now what's that
what's this first app app selector this
is the selector the instruction angular
queue will search for an H HTML code and
whenever it finds this instruction this
selector it knows okay I should render
this component in this place now where
does it search for it and where does it
find it well for this route component
which is started with the bootstrap
command it looks in this index.html file
and in this index.html file you see this
line here first app app with loading
text between the opening and closing tag
now this clearly isn't a default HTML
file for each HTML tag right there is no
first app app tack in HTML nonetheless
when loading the website we're seeing
this does that really work and nothing
else right we're not seeing the loading
text now angler two knows that this
first app app refers to this first app
component here because we're
bootstrapping this application and
passing this first app app component
that's necessary for the startup for
application until tango - hey look for
this first app app component in the
index.html file and add as look for it
and it does find it because we have this
tacular and the stag meat matches this
selector that being said the selector
could be changed it works like a CSS
selector so here we have just first app
app and this would be similar to let's
say h1
now h1 would select all h1 elements and
of course I'm not doing that here
because I don't want to replace h1
elements which is a default HTML tag
with my component but I could do this so
back to this I could also make this look
like a attribute like an HTML attribute
now with this this would no longer work
with that code here as I can show you if
I restart my server and she's Ruth and
now if I reload my page you're seeing
this loading text because now I go to
will no longer replace this first app
app select trigger because it's not
aware that it should the selector is
pointing to a different element for
example the selector would now match a
div which has first app app attached to
it like an HTML attribute now you see
that doesn't really work here because
now this is matched as I replace the
selector with an attribute selector
again I'm just using the normal CSS
selector noted notation here so nothing
special I'll change it back to tag
selection so that again I'll be able to
swap out this first app app select
reader
so that's the selector very important as
you learned next is the template URL
which refers to this first app that
component or HTML file which of course
holds the HTML code which should be
rendered whenever England you finds this
selector here in HTML code so basically
right now if the selector and the
template URL
we're telling angular to whenever you
find this first app app selector as a
tag as an HTML tag in the code take it
kind of remove it and replace it with
the HTML code you find in this template
here though of course yet it does a bit
more than just replacing it but this is
how you can think of it with these
selectors now you could also get rid of
template URL and specify the template
inline which means in this file if you
want to write over multiple lines you
would use backtick so to backticks and
now you could well create your h1 tag
here name it inline template to indicate
that this is in the same file and if I
save this you will now see the text
inline template now I'm no longer using
the external template here I could get
rid of this HTML file and I will get rid
of this testing file here too since you
don't need it yet and I would have my
template in this component here now the
question is should you do that
or should you use an external template
it depends but on by the styling guide
it's a good idea to use an external file
whenever you have more than three files
or three lines of code in your template
so if I had this here another line that
would still be fine that would still be
line but with that time but I should
think about adding an external template
file however of course it's totally up
to you in the end the same is true for
the style URLs metadata here style URLs
takes an array listing all these CSS
files you want to use to style this
component
here an important thing on which I will
come back to you is that the style will
only be applied to this component so if
you're styling your h1 tags in this CSS
file not all your h1 tags of the whole
application will get styled but only the
ones you have in a template of this
component that's a very important
concept to understand and as I said I'll
come back to that so here I'm referring
to an external style sheet and as I said
I could add multiple style sheets here
but I could also get rid of URLs and
have styles here this will still take an
array of multiple strings and then I
could also use back text to write a
words but lines and give my h1 tag which
I have here is saying inline template a
styling off let's say a red color now if
I save this you'll see that the color
changes to red so that's all eyes back
to this module ID thing here what's that
well now that we have the template at
the styling inline of this component and
no longer use external files you would
not need that however whenever you use
external files so template HTML file or
styling CSS files you will need this
module ID thing here and set it up
exactly like you see it here to allow
angular to that once it is in production
and compiled and may be bundled to still
find the appropriate external references
the appropriate external files because
of course the files are not at the same
that the stylet under data HTML code is
not in the same file but in another file
and to keep that relative reference and
to not having to define absolute URLs
here for template URL and so on we can
use module ID which will basically tell
angle to hate your external style sheets
and template HTML files will live in the
exact same folder as this compiled or
minified or whatever
here module we'll live in that's the key
thing so this much light evening this
much like the metadata make sure that
the relative references to your external
files are being kept
so this as you can see change quite a
bit doesn't look like the components set
up when we created a new component we
got rid of the external files and the
sole works and this is how you work with
a component you configure it in this
metadata in this decorator as you can
see I'm not even using this title
anymore so I can really get rid of that
and now I got an empty class and all of
my logic lives inside of this metadata
which shows you how powerful and
important this metadata is and metadata
you'll always need as a template because
component in the end always needs to
have a view which can be presented to
the user that's the bare minimum it will
need and which you should make sure to
provide be it with an external file or
inside of this component file here by
just adding this template metadata so
this is how you transform a default
typescript class into an anglo to
component how it is loaded through the
selector here in the index.html file and
how you set it up or configure it with
the metadata that's all nice but in the
next lecture we'll finally have a look
at adding our own components
so in order to do this I blow up up a
new terminal and again this is our
normal terminal here just in my IDE and
I will use the D D ng come on again so
I'll navigate into my project folder and
then with ng generate I can generate a
new piece so to say of my application
for example component later you will
learn about different things you can
create you might use in your angular 2
app so I will create a component by
using ng generate component and then I
give this component a name and I will
name my let's say uber basically our
component will be the name at the end
ever and then hit enter now this will
create a couple of new files and it
looked great a new folder too as you see
it created this other folder now in this
folder you again find the same files you
saw before I'll get rid of this testing
file then I got my HTML file which just
says I love Oryx and empty styling file
of which I will get rid here because I
won't need it right now
and I will get rid of this style URLs
and my component itself in the TS file
this ng on anything is important right
now you will learn about on in ed and
lifecycle hooks what it is in the end
later I'll also get rid of the
constructor for now and after import
here so now we got well pretty empty
file as you can see the selector was
automatically set to FA other that is
because when creating this project I
added the prefix flag to the angular CLI
and set the prefix to FA which make sure
that it prefixes all my selectors with
this FA - thing now why is that
important well think about the
importance of the selector angular 2
will replace everything that matches the
selector with this component imagine you
made an air mistake and were to set the
selector to article
article as a default HTML element and
that probably wouldn't be that good
let's say you don't make the mistake but
you name the name it angular sidebar now
that certainly is the default HTML tag
right right but what if you were to add
another third-party library and that
library were to use the exact same tag
now you would have problems again so in
order to make sure that you're not
interfering with default HTML tags or
third-party libraries the solution is to
make unique selectors and the very good
practice to make sure that your
selectors are unica's to pick clear
prefixes this might be the appreciation
of your company name the abbreviation of
your project of your through its name if
that makes sense whatever but pick
something which makes this selector a
eunuch and then follow it by the name of
this component so other in this case
since I named this other component so
this is the file which was set up for me
and now I want to use this FA other
selector I want to use this component in
my app component so I'll get rid of
another line and I'll add FA ever should
work right I'm using this other selector
every other which is the selector setup
here so if I save this and have a look
at my project hmm I can't see it too
easy it we should see our works right
right but I don't see it the reason is
the component first app component
doesn't know what FA other is like the
index.html file wouldn't know what first
app app is if we would not tell it and
where do we tell it in this bootstrap
file where we telling what you start
this application and started with first
app app component now this will tell
Anglo to oh okay now I'm aware of this
first app app component so I'll have a
look at this I see that it has to select
your first app app and now when I go
over this file and find first
up here I know that this refers to this
component now we're not doing the same
in this first AB AB component we have FA
other but we're know we're telling
angular 2 that this is a component that
it should look at a component and it
doesn't by default scan all our
components which is a good thing so how
could we tell angular 2 while we're not
doing that in the bootstrap method
because our application is already
running the place to tell it is inside
this first app component here because
here is the template where we're using
this component now remember that I told
you that components are directives
instructions in the code telling anglo
to you what to do so we're using such a
directive in the template of this first
app app component in order to tell
English you that this is a directive or
put in other words order to let angular
to know which directives we want to use
in this template I add another metadata
to this components decorator the
directives metadata which takes an array
as a value
now this array just has a couple of
references to the types of directives we
want to use in this components template
and here of course we only want to use
one type or one reference and this is
the other component so I will add our
component here now this still won't work
and I could auto import here with my IDE
but I'll do that by hand I'll import
something from the upper folder now to
something I want to import this aberrant
component and by the way one of the
scalp style bed rules is to have an
empty white space before and after your
import module names here so now this
works and I'm importing that from other
and not from other slash other component
which would work too by the way now I've
been pointing it from this other
component file without that I'm just
importing it from other and this will do
well to this index stop TS file and in
this file I'm exporting this our
component now that might look a bit
complicated here because why would I
have an extra file for that
well the reasons just if I add multiple
components or things in general modules
I want to export in this other folder
I would group them all in the index dot
ES file here a concept called barrels
which allows me to organize my imports
like that just indicating or referring
to this other folder and not to the
individual files this makes for shorter
import statements saves code and makes
it more readable and is a good practice
you should follow in writing and on to
applications the thing with the barrels
was just decided the important thing
here is of course that now I let and
what you know that I'm using the average
component as a directive in this
template here and now angle two will be
able to in identify this fa other
selector therefore you see other works
now if you reload your page or if you
save it it is reloaded automatically so
with this we're now using another
component in our first component so
we're nesting components were having
this root component which gets started
by the bootstrap method and which then
holds our new component fa other or the
other component inside of it
you
so that's nice but let's say we want to
add another component and this component
should be assembling off this F a other
component now I could do this by
repeating the command from before and
let me just nameless another well I
could hit enter and this will create a
new folder and a beret with all the
files you're used to
however I don't want to do that I don't
want to create a new folder I want to be
this component to be in this abra folder
so I will just navigate into this adder
folder and inside of this art folder I
again around ng and I could run generate
or I just run G which is just an
abbreviation for this and then I could
type component or just just C which is
also an abbreviation so mgg see that and
that's the same as ng generate component
test and then what I'll do next is I'll
add the name of course another then I
will add a flag which I'll call flat and
this will make sure that it doesn't
create a new folder but instead creates
it inside of the folder you're in when
executing this command so the other
folder in my case here I also don't want
to create this external HTML and CSS
file here therefore I couldn't add the
template or flag inline template and the
flag inline styles I can also abbreviate
those two flags to just write with one -
I T at is now if I hit enter you can see
that it created two new files and I'll
get rid of the test file so it didn't
create an HTML or CSS file and in this
file here i got an inline template the
inline style setup i won't need them
here
I got a selector of FA and number of
courts of course I'll get rid of the
other things here again I won't need
them right now
and that's that now if I have a look at
the indexed ES file i'll
need to update this to make sure that
I'm not only exporting our component but
also an abra component of course in this
case from the n average component file
make sure to not add the file endings
here you're not having dot ts here at
your exports you don't need that the
same is true for the imports by the way
so now I have this another component and
now in the first app component I can
just add another component and I can add
the import here too that was this input
grouping I was talking about I'm now
importing all of that from the upper
folder even though the modules are
technically in different files and
that's just because I am preparing this
in this index dot ES file so now I'm
ready to use this another component I'll
add the selector
HTML tag here and now you can see
another works so this sibling component
to the Avro component works too and now
you also learned how to quickly generate
new components with the abbreviations
and how you can switch between having
them created and subfolders or in the
same folder with inline templates or
inline Styles it's a really important
thing here
now one important thing to note is if I
go to the other component and/or then to
the HTML file and I replace the
paragraph with h1 and save this you of
course see that this is black whereas
the h1 in the app component is red and
that is even though I just set h1 to be
red I did not add any other selectors
making sure that this only applies to
this h1 and not to the average ones I
could say okay it's a different
component it's clear that it doesn't get
applied but it's not clear
normal CSS does no components right in
your browser
you don't know what components you get
one single HTML code and how does it
work that not all the h1 elements get
styled if we set a styling here this
question is answered by view and
capsulation a concept introduced or used
by angular 2 we go back to the browser
this is what our page looks like and now
if you only want to stall the item
components let's say all of that our div
containers but we only want to start
those diff containers we want to make
them green how could we do that angle 2
emulates a concept called
the shadow Dom the shadow Dom Dom means
that an HTML element has its separate
Dom behind the scenes so for example
here this article element with the h1 in
it would have a shadow Dom behind it
where we apply the styling like let's
say setting the font size but our h1
elements on the page won't be affected
by that because they have a different
shadow Dom behind them now the shadow
Dom is a concept which is not supported
for all browsers and therefore it would
be unsafe to use that natively because
while it wouldn't run in many browsers
so that is not the best way but angle to
emulates the shadow Dom which means it
offers the same fact functionality also
working in older browsers which of
course is great so the emulation angle
too adds
looks like this we have a component
which has its own shattered on behind
the scenes but we are using the actual
shadow Dom instead we're reviewing us or
what angular 2 is doing it adds this
critical attribute to it which of course
isn't the default HTML attribute and
this critical attribute as well as the
cryptical attribute on the h1 tag allows
angular to to identify that only
elements with that attribute should get
the styling defined in this component
and of course that attribute will vary
from component to component and with
that angle to make sure that your
styling is really only applied to the
elements you want it to apply because in
the end and all to will add your Styles
in the Hat
tag of the HTML document and add this
attribute selector to it but it's best
to see this in action so I'm in the
browser and if I inspect this red h1 tag
here let's increase this in size a bit
you can see this cryptic attribute I was
talking of right and if you have a look
at the average one tag you don't see
that so it's only there on the one which
is actually relative or tag doesn't have
it now if we have a look at the Hat of
this document you see the style tag hero
which was added bang or two now here we
have the same rule we set up here h1
should have a color of red
but angled you added something to the
rule it added this attribute selector
which is a normal CSS selector making
sure that only h1 elements with that
attribute receive a red color and that
attribute of course is the attribute and
alt you added in the HTML code here q DS
this component or all D component and
child elements therefore elements in the
natural component don't receive the
styling because they don't have that
attribute and if it would have a
different styling there there they would
get different attributes
and a different styling therefore so
this is angle choose view encapsulation
and that things that you can turn it off
if you don't like that you can turn it
off you will find how to do that in a
cheat sheet for this module but that's a
fault and it's really really handy to
use
now can we use multiple components in on
the same page or in the same template of
course we can if I just duplicate this
another component you see two times
another works now all that text here is
not really that useful so if I want to
let's say change D another component of
it and no longer output and number works
but instead let's say I would have an
article here and this article should
have some styling it should let's say I
have a simple border and then output
some text between so I would of course
add these styles metadata here to set up
the article styling and I just add a
little border here
I just added a solid black border around
this article so if I now say it is you
see that this works however maybe I
don't want to have a dummy test it text
in here but I want to pass this text
from outside now there are two methods
to do that and one of them is data
binding property binding which you'll
learn about later but sometimes you have
components which only are kind of the
container for a ver HTML code and in
order to allow you to pass our HTML code
easily into your component you can do
the following let's say I want to pass
in another div and of course this is
getting longest templates it would be
better to outsource it to a next
relational fall but I just keep it here
to have it all in one place for demo
purposes and then in this div I would
have an h2 tag saying hello and then a
paragraph saying world now if I save
this
I'm not seeing it here that's all broken
its it's not outputting this what I'm
entering between these tags and the
reason is of course as I said angle two
finds these tags throws it away and
enters the content of your component
template and that is important because
otherwise what cells still see this
loading dotted thing if that wouldn't be
replaced so sometimes we don't want to
replace it though so in this case I want
to keep it good thing is and what you
has a handy directive we can use for
this and by simply adding ng content
like this the selector this refers to a
built-in directive angular 2 offers now
this will render all the content being
passed between the opening and closing
tag inside of this component therefore
this now works and if I add let's say
something else for the second time I use
this component like let's say just a
paragraph saying something else you'll
see that this gets rendered too and this
is a good way how you can create
reusable containers which take our HTML
code and then bad dead inside of them so
this is how you can use ng content to
render this HTML code within our
components now what happens if I change
this h2 to h1 remember I'm styling h1
for this component here as you can see
the styling gets applied here too
because well this is not inside is not
defined inside this and our component
it's defined in the first app component
and this is the component which applies
to styling so be aware of that that you
style the content you pass into the
outer component inside of the parent
component like here
so that's been a short introduction to
components templates how you can use
multiple components and how you build up
your application of components however
we're still outputting static text until
now and that isn't the most important
thing isn't or the most interesting
thing isn't it so what be great if we
could interact with the templates and
output dynamic data there if we could
let our components interact besides
passing HTML code from parent to child
if we could listen to events in the DOM
for example those are all very important
things so time to get to that so this of
course about data binding which
basically means interacting with data
interaction between templates and
business logic data binding means
communication it means that our
component body the logic the class DD
typescript code interacts with the
component template the view which the
user sees and our component body passes
data to this template and there are
different ways to do this you will learn
all of them of course and listens to
events as I said you will learn all of
them so which data binding methods do we
know or do we have got string
interpolation which has the following or
this syntax double curly braces and then
an expression which resolves to a string
and you already saw that in the first
app where we output title between curly
braces title was referring to a property
of this component which was a string
therefore we were able to output it
because as it's written here the
expression you want to output has to
resolve to a string in the end another
way would be property binding and
property binding means your binding
which means sending data to properties
in your Dom in your HTML code now there
are different properties available free
kinds to be precise now we'll come back
to that one example would be to bind to
the disabled property of a button
this is a normal Dom property and then
you need
and notice that we don't have Kali
braces here we just have quotation marks
and between the quotation marks and
expression which resolves to the type
this property needs so for the disabled
property here for example true or false
but for other properties you might need
an expression resolving to a string or
something like that kind of the opposite
of property binding where you send data
to a property here for example to the
button property would be event binding
where you'll listen to events emitted
from an element from something here for
example we're listening to the bolt in
click property or well click it went and
this click event is available in a bath
for example it's available on each HTML
element and then between the quotation
marks you have the expression you want
to execute whenever this event occurs
now note that expression means that you
could also set up a method which should
be executed here or if it's a very short
logic you have you just defined it
inline in this code the last thing is
two-way data-binding and QA data binding
of course was one of the most important
things for angular 1 which made angle 2
so very very successful and popular
angular tune by default doesn't have
two-way data-binding by default all data
flow is unidirectional which allows it
to let run it so fast and circumvent
some problems nonetheless if you need to
weigh data binding it's still there and
the syntax is that what you see here
square brackets then break then
parentheses and then ng model inside of
that and as you probably see it's the
combination of property binding where
you use square brackets and the went
binding where you use parentheses and
this of course is no coincidence but
instead it makes sense to mix both
syntaxes because two way binding as the
name implies is two way it is property
and when binding in one single thing now
ng model is the key word
you have to use and then between the
quotation marks on the upper side of the
equal sign you set up the model could be
a single property could be a more
complex object and a field of that
object which you want to bind to this
input field here for example now this
would lead to the following behavior
where you enter text into this HTML
input and then the model in the code the
component body would be updated if this
body would be or if this object this
pound object would be updated somewhere
else this would also be reflected in the
input element so it's two-way listening
and sending it into course you will see
all these data binding methods in action
throughout this module
before I come to property and event
binding into a data binding though I
want to have a closer look at string
interpolation now in order through this
I will get rid of all these components
here and of that import as well as see
directives metadata here and of the
styles to let on eat them and I'll get
rid of this outer folder because I don't
need those components anymore instead I
will create a new component so gee white
space or space and then C and you
component which I will call data binding
this file gets generated in this data
binding folder I'll get rid of this spec
file of the testing file here I don't
need that and the first thing I'll do
here is as you can see it has a selector
of FA data binding I'll add the selector
here in my template FA data binding as
you are probably aware I also need to
add the import of my data binding
component from data binding and I can do
this as I also have the indexed es file
here and then I add the directives
metadata to set it up
data binding component I'll just save my
application and you see data binding
works great so I'll also rename this to
route component here and now in the data
binding component I want to demonstrate
data binding so I'll get rid of that
stuff here for now again and next I will
again add a property here now named is
string interpolation and this will be a
string this is string interpolation and
I'll add number one called number
interpolation let's see if that will
work too
and now in the template in the HTML file
I'll output this so I will replace
data-binding works with string
interpolation and if I save this you see
that we see there's a string
interpolation this is how I output it
that's really how simple this is this
expression between the curly braces
resolves to a string since well this
property is a string and then simply
renders it when once this component is
loaded and rendered to the viewer to the
user now how does this work if I use the
number interpolation does this work
because that is no string right number
interpolation save this well it still
works as you can see because a number
can easily be cast to a string and
typescript wearing what you've dusted
for us so this will work to everything
which is a string or can be cast to a
string will work here so this is how we
can use string interpolation
next I want to talk about property
binding and there are through about
event binding so to present both where
are they available we can bind to Dom
properties or events so for example on
an image the source property which is a
native property built into well the Dom
it's not added Bangalore to the fact
that we can bind to it as added but
property itself already existed the same
is true for the collective end this is
not add a bangle or two these are native
properties or events already existent in
the dawn we could also bind to directive
properties or events these are of course
add a banner too for example the ng
class directive which you'll learn about
soon which allows you to add CSS classes
to something to an element this is a
directive and this is a directive which
needs an input to work correctly this
input is sent by a via property binding
something you will learn in this course
of course - the same would be true for
the ng submit event which is an event
occurring when we submit a form handle
bangla - also covered later in this
course also not a built in event but
instead one add up angular - with a
directive now the next thing is kind of
the same since components are directives
but you still differentiate it here you
can also bind to component properties so
properties set up in the class and the
body of your class of your component
class can be bound or can be events can
be met events you can listen to from
outside so these are the free
availabilities you have native
properties in events direct us prop
directive properties and events and
component properties and events both of
all of them being targetable with this
property and event binding syntax for
the latter to direct different component
properties you may use sample than ones
to add your custom bindings for property
binding this is done with the add input
metadata which you add in front of the
property you want to make bindable from
outside for event binding well it would
be at output event name and then this
would typically be an event immature
object or an object built into angular 2
which allows you to fire events because
these custom events have to be triggered
somehow and you trigger them by hand
this would be how you work with that and
of course you'll see this in action in a
few minutes
- show us action let's begin with
property binding I'll first add another
heading here which says string
interpolation or sound line and then
we'll talk about property binding here
let's say we have an input field here
type text is okay now I want to set a
default value I could do this by adding
the value attribute which is nothing to
do with angular - this is default HTML
code and add text if we have a look at
this you see text here
no angler - we have stuff happening here
at all now I will get rid of this text
and instead use string interpolation to
output string interpolation I'm still
using the default value attribute but
the text string I'm outputting is now
created by angular - does the string
interpolation so this is working this is
one way of doing this another way would
be I use D value property binding now I
add Colley brackets skew-t brackets
around the value here now it's no longer
a default HTML attribute it's instead
referring to the Dom value property and
I'm binding to that property by adding
the brackets which tells a lot you wait
a second this is no default attribute
here we want to bind to a property - in
this case a property called value and
then I don't have curly braces between
my quito's quotation marks anymore
because I don't need it now as explained
on this lines slides I directly add an
expression resolving - to type this
value or this property needs and this
value property needs a string
therefore I add string interpolation
which still refers to this property set
up in
my component here and passes it to this
value property therefore this look like
nothing changed
and indeed yields the same result as
before where I was using string
interpolation with quality braces and no
brackets here but this way we're using
property buying now what's better well
here it's really up to you
but oftentimes you only have one way of
doing it or you what it's clear that you
want to do it like this especially when
working with custom property binding
which I will show you in a few minutes
so this is how you bind to properties of
HTML elements here but it would also be
interesting to see how you can bind to
directive properties right because I was
talking about that too so I will add
another element a normal HTML element
here let's say I want to have the
paragraph element here and the gift of
the text of is this styled and now if it
save this it's of course not really
styled it's just text right so in order
to style this I can give that a built-in
directive anglers who ships with the ng
class directive now if I attach it like
that this won't work
this expects property binding so I add
brackets and then this directive here
this property expects to get a
JavaScript object so I create one with
single curly braces this is nothing to
do with string interpolation here this
is just a JavaScript object because
between the quotation marks off property
binding remember that you write a normal
JavaScript expressions there are some
special things like you can't use the
new keyword there but in general it's
JavaScript code just make sure not to
write multi-line code that won't work
but as long as you stay in one line you
can write your javascript code so I'm
creating a JavaScript object here and
for this object for this directive here
the key is the name of the class I want
to attach so let's say red border and
then true or false if I do want to
attach it now if I saved us you won't
see anything so I'll first define this
class in this CSS file and gift us well
color border giving off 1 pixels solid
red and of course here I have to select
the class red border so now if I save
this file here you can see that we get
this red border because if I inspect
this element here you can see it has
this class red border attached to it if
I go over to my HTML file and set this
to false and save you no longer see the
red border because it no longer has this
class attached to it and of course you
can not only hard code this like I'm
doing this here in this template but you
can also do this dynamically this false
might be the result of let's say a
method call on tests and then in the
data binding component it would have
this method on tests which might return
true save this and you get the red
border again because this returns true
and this is the expression executed here
and this of course is a way to allow you
to write multi-line code again so as you
can see normal JavaScript code here for
example a method execution in the end
resulting in an object this property
needs a JavaScript object with a key of
the class name and then true or false
and therefore applying the styling now
besides ng class we also have ng style
which has as a key the style name so
let's say color for the text color and
then as a value a string defining the
style so let's make that green now you
can see that this is green text because
what I said is a private way to write
this I could also make it blue of course
so it works pretty similar
again using property binding here to
make sure that we're passing the data
this directive needs as this directive
has a property bound to the outside to
work correctly and this will certainly
become 100 percent clear once we start
writing our own property bindings which
we'll do in the next video
as explained it's of course nice to bind
to already existing properties but it
really gets clear once you write your
own bindings so I will create a new
component for this and I'll navigate
into the data binding folder because I
want to create it there then I use ng C
for create or G for generate C full
component and then I will main a named
it property binding with a - make it
flat so that it stays in the same folder
and also I want to have inline template
and inline Styles so this creates two
new files I'll get rid of the test file
and here is my property binding
component now let's say I don't want
your output property binding works here
but instead what I went to output here
is a value I get passed in from outside
now I could do this using ng content
like you learned before but here's never
technique and of course you cannot only
pass content you want to output but
content you want to use anywhere in your
application as you might be aware so
here I will first get rid of this stuff
here again and then I want to output
with string interpolation a property
named result which I will define here
and result should be a number it's let's
say zero at the beginning now I want you
set result from outside though so I will
add add input metadata and import input
from in Lahore and this will make this
resolve property bindable from outside
so now I will go to the data binding
component or to the HTML code property
binding and I will add number headline
here call it custom property binding
now below discussed improper keybinding
I will add F a property by name which is
the selector of this property binding
component and notice how the English CLI
automatically transformed property -
binding into property binding camelcase
class name so I'm importing this of
course now also adding the directives
metadata and a property binding
component which has to be imported of
course and also get rid of one in it
here so import property binding
component from the property binding
component here and now you see that zero
hero of course because it is set to zero
initially right we set this here however
by adding add input this property can be
bound from outside of this component so
I can go to my data binding component
into the HTML template and add something
to that selector I'll add brackets
because we're talking about property
binding and this is the syntax which
tells unless you that property binding
is in place and then result list of the
name of the property I want to bind to
I'll set results to 10 and now if this
reloads you see that we get 10 year
because we're now binding to the
property from outside we're passing the
data which should be shown there from
outside in to that component
so you'll require a lot about property
binding time to move on to the next step
event binding I will trade in you
component and as you might have already
guessed I will not name it property
binding but event binding otherwise I
created the same way I did before get
rid of the starts back tour ts file and
then this event binding component all
again get rid of all the things I won't
need here for now okay and I will add a
button here which says click me if I
click this button nothing would happen
right now what I can do though is I can
add a click listener to that button and
on clicking I will execute EE on clicked
method now be aware I could also execute
some code right away here I don't have
to execute a method you may execute any
channel strip code here however I opted
for the on click method created in the
body here therefore and I will just open
alert telling me it worked now in order
to really see anything I of course have
to implement this component therefore I
will add the import here so this will be
from the event binding component also
added in the directives array here and
then in the HTML file I'll add a new
horizontal line and a new heading saying
event binding and below that I'll have
my event binding component click be
works so here I'm binding to a default
Dom event to event supplied by this HTML
element or by all HTML elements by the
Dom clicking on
element is something which is natively
built-in like would be mouse over Mouse
leave and so on so this was this native
event but in the next lecture I'll have
a look at building my own event and of
course also how to listen to that
so while it's nice to listen to built-in
events and you often do that oftentimes
you'll also need your own events and I
will show you how to build such a custom
event and use it with event binding in
this lecture so I'll go back to the
event binding component and I'll add a
new property which I will name click and
this will be a new event emitter object
now event emitter is something I have to
import here from angular 2 core and this
allows me to emit events and to listen
to it like the name implies so what I
want to do now is here when I'm clicking
on it I'm actually using my clicked
u-bend here my clicked property and I
call the emit method and I will emit
some text it works therefore this is a
generic type I like this of type string
it will work without that too and if
you're not aware what generic types is
don't worry about this basically this
means event emitter is an object which
it cannot wrap itself around several
other types so you may omit and you went
with data of type string like we're
doing it here or you may omit and it
went with type of being well a complex
JavaScript object so it doesn't care
which type of data it emits and
therefore its generic and here we're
using string that's all I'm saying here
so now I'm a bit omitting this event as
a next step it would be creative someone
was listening
I'll make this listenable outside of
this component here I could listen to it
inside of this component right now but
to make it available outside I'll add
the output metadata or decorator here I
also have to import this here output
with this this is now listenable outside
of this component so I will go to my
data binding component HTML file and
I'll also add something to this selector
here too
Tagg like i before did with the result
property binding here I'll do the same
year for the event and I named this
clicked because this is the property
name I used in the well class here so
clicked of course is no built in no
native event this is my custom event and
then like for native events I specify
what should have more and this event
appears when I want to execute us I will
execute you on click method and I want
to pass data I'm omitting here remember
I'm meeting a string and I can extract
the data with dollar sign event object
or name here and this is protected you
can't override this this is the object
and what you will store the data passed
through a wind freely went inside off so
dollar sign event is your way to extract
data you pass with any wind so I'll
execute on clicked and I pass this you
enter data so in the data binding
component all therefore add this on
clicked method and I know that I will
get a value of type string because
that's what I'm ever emitting and I can
then simply output this in an alert so
if I save this
let us page load click me you see the in
it works text and this is how you can
set up your own custom events and listen
to them in a parent component to that
and this of course is a great way to let
components communicate
for both input and outputs of property
and event binding there are some
additions to the syntax you already
learned for event binding the ad output
here can take an argument of type string
where you might specify a different name
which can be used outside of this
component so internal this property's
name clicked but let's say outside of
this so in the component listening to
the event you want named is clickable
for example then you could go to the
data binding component or to the HTML
file to the template where I am
listening
and now clicked would no longer work as
I can demonstrate you nothing happens
because we rename renamed it to
clickable which is now the outside name
of this property so now this works again
this is a way to have differing names
inside of the target component or of the
component with the input or output and
the external the other components
however it is a best practice to not
really use that if you don't have to so
you may just leave it like this and use
the internal property name as the
external one - the same you just
software output does of course all the
work for input another thing which you
also shouldn't necessarily use is that
instead of having at input in front of
each property you want to have as an
input and the same is true for at output
of course you could add the inputs
metadata or outputs in the case of event
binding and then in an array half as
strings all the different names or
property names you want to use so for
example you might want to use result
here and this would allow you to get rid
of the add input now this would still be
set as a input but you don't have the
decorator here and of course you also
don't have to import it from here then
should be inputs here by the way as you
can already see I'm getting this
underlined and I get an error by Tia
Slynt telling me that this is a bad
practice and I should use ad input the
same would be true for outputs so while
you might do this and you can it's a
better practice to well revert this and
use the at input decorators your like
before so that you learned how you can
let your components communicate with
each other transfer data listen to
events and so on of course there are
other ways to you will learn about them
and the services module but this is a
very powerful and important thing and
property and event binding as well as
string interpolation are things you will
use a lot really a lot
how to come to the last way of data
binding two-way data-binding be aware
that as i already explained it's not a
default in hangout you and it isn't for
a reason because it is slow and it has
some problems nonetheless if you want to
use it and you'll learn that off times
you're fine without using it but if you
want you this is how you do it I will
create a new component and I will name
it two-way binding again will be flat
with inline template and styling I'll
get rid of the test file and inside of
this I'll train you input some normal
HTML element get rid of this starting
text here don't need two styles don't
need on another zero of course so get
rid of all of that you'll learn what
that on anything means soon and with
this I want you bind what I enter here
with two-way binding so I will create an
object here let's name it person and
person should simply be a JavaScript
object
I'll use the literal notation here which
will have a name let's say max but equal
to my name and an age so 27 in my case
so this is the person and I want to bind
this input here to the person's name I
use brackets and parentheses add between
ng model to indicate that I want to bind
to a model that I want to use two-way
data-binding
and then between quotation marks just
the model to which I want to bind so
here to the person and then to the name
so dot notation here to access this
field this already set up to a data
binding and to demonstrate this I will
duplicate this simply and now if I
implement this by adding the import
two-way binding component what's the
name
to a binding components right like this
did I miss type here two-way binding
component here so now adhere to the
metadata to the directives metadata and
that of course as before clips or I lay
it at two-way binding save this let it
reload and here you see the to import
fields at the bottom now that might be a
bit hard to see though let me quickly do
some cheap hack in here add a couple of
empty lines just to bring it up a little
bit so these are the two fields in F I
change that one of them see that it
changes in both of them and this is
really all that is to it it's two-way
data-binding both fields are bind in two
directions which means if I change it in
one field in a sent to this property and
update there and if I update this
property from somewhere else like from
the other input field or the other input
element it's also reflected on the first
one
because again it's two-way data flowing
out of it and into it so where with
property binding we only sent data into
something and with you went binding we
get data out of something here both
directions are active which again is
two-way data binding
