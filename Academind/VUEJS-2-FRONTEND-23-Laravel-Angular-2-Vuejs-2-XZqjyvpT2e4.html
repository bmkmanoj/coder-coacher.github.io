of the series we finished our first part
of this view chairs front end which is
connected to our level API where we are
now able to send quotes to fill out the
form and submit our quote send to the
back and store it there and well right
now we can only view it in the angular 2
front that we built a couple of videos
ago in this video we're going to add
routing to this beauteous application
and add a page where we can view all the
quotes who are fetching from the
database so that we are able to view the
quotes of the view chairs application to
you let's start with that I will start
working on this in my quotes that you
file in this component what I will add a
template now we're add a wrapping diff
since we must only have one root element
in such a template here and in this step
I want to add a button which allows me
to press it which says get quotes to
fetch all those clothes and here I will
simply add a class of button and an
button primary and of course I'll add a
click listener to call on get quotes or
any method you want to execute here and
add a caption of get quotes to the
button and below it I'll add a
horizontal line and then here I want to
loop through all the quotes now in the
angler queue from that I created a
separate component for this so let's do
it here too I'll add a new view fault
quote and this should hold a signal
quote now a single quote should look
exactly the same as in the angler queue
project so I'll add a template here with
a diff and this date will receive a
bootstrap class the panel class and then
all the view panel default Clause to
give it a nice panel like look and you
can have a look at the bootstrap
documentation at the components there to
find out how you may configure it is how
it will look like or you wait a couple
of minutes so this is the panel now
inside of this panel I want to have a
panel body which holds the actual quote
so I'll add a new div here with the
bootstrap CSS class panel body here I
want to output these well body of this
quote key content but below this I want
to have a panel footer which will give
me some editing options
so in there I actually want to have a
dip which I only show conditionally
which will hold an input field field
type text which is only shown if I click
the edit button which I'll now add oops
in the footer in a second test which
I'll show as alternative to the first
dip
this test will hold my actual buttons so
here I'll have a link where I will
simply say add it and then another one
where I will say delete to be able to
well edit and delete those quotes and I
will add click listeners here so here I
want to execute on edit and in the on
the link below that I want to execute on
the lead in the first test where I have
my input I therefore I will come back to
this editors later but for now I
therefore want to add a button which
allows me to save this so here I will
execute on update and this is the method
which should then actually reach out to
the back end and commit those changes
save them on the server I'll also have a
second link which allows me to abort
those operations or here I will say on
cancel so if I decided otherwise this
will just cancel it
remove this div and bring you back to
viewing node instead of editing this
does the general template I want to use
now in my quotes dot view file I want to
use this quote dot view component I just
created so I'll add a script here with
my default export the view instance
responsible for this component and their
arrival register this newly created
component as a local component so simply
import quote from well we close that
view file super simple should be a
relative import though and assign it
here as a value this allows me to now
whoops not not here in a separate object
with app quote as a selector this is the
correct syntax so this allows you to use
app quote here to create that template
or that component to create an instance
of this component and of course I want
to create this multiple times for each
quote I have
so I kind of need to store all the
clothes I will eventually fetch in some
property and then loop through that
property here in the template so I will
add the data method here in my view
instance and return an object here and
in this object again I need to have a
property which will store all my quotes
well name this quotes and it will be an
empty array initially we will then fill
this by reaching out to the web when
hitting this get quotes button up here
now with this array I can create a loop
here with the four and I want to loop
through all the clothes to it quote in
quotes I am looping through all the
quotes in this array and now I also want
to get this quote I'm currently at in
this loop so for each iteration I want
to pass this loop off this iteration
this quote off the saturation queue this
app quote component here so I will kind
of act like there were a property I
could bind or some attribute I could
pass so I'll name this QT to avoid
naming confusion and pass quotes the
quote I'm currently at in this loop so
this one here as a value now this QT
attribute here however is currently not
bindable so let's change this by going
to the quote component which is where I
try to pass it and adding a script tag
here to exporting the default object
again this view instance and there are
at the props property which allows me to
define any properties which are
accessible from outside now we just saw
there is one property of what I makes
edible QT so this will now make sure
that in this component here in this
template or in the whole component
actually I have X of students QG
property but it will be set from outside
so here in the panel body I can
therefore simply output it with string
interpolation like this with QT and then
the actual message will be stored in a
field named content we know this from
our back end this is how we receive the
data so this will now allow me to output
the content of a quote we'll look up
those buttons here later let's first
make sure that we can actually click
this on get
vote button here and get the clothes so
add the methods object here and in there
I'll add on get quotes this method I'm
executing when clicking this button up
here and here I again want to use Axios
we installed it in the last video in
this series to reach out to my server
and get all the quotes so therefore like
a new quote I need to import Axios but
simply copy this here shall we like this
and then send a get request something
you can learn on the Axios github page
here it works like this get and then the
URL and of course if you want to learn
more about X just definitely have a
detailed look at this page how you may
configure it and so on so access get
send the get request the URL we need to
reach out to is the following year your
back-end server slash API slash quotes
this will give me all the quotes stored
there so this is now of course also
promise or the get method here gives me
back a promise I should say where we
will eventually receive the response we
can then handle it it here or let's all
the implement this we could get an error
which I will for now simply log to the
console now I want to do something with
that response though this response will
hold my actual quotes so I'm very
interested in getting those quotes in
the then block I can simply log response
to find out which data access gives us
here and how we may get access to this
list of quotes now that would be a good
idea we could now click this button here
but we have no way of getting to the
quotes component right right now in the
app of you follow all including the new
quote component we have no way of
getting to quotes so let's add routing
for this we need to install the view
router so I'll pop a new tab in my
terminal here and install it with NPM
and stoll NPM install view router and SP
you save flag to also say the entry in
package judge Jason I do have a video on
routing your on this channel so if you
want to learn more about this definitely
have a look at those route
video now I could add a separate file
for my routes I will set up everything
in the main dot JS file here since it
isn't that much code but you may of
course changed it and I will begin by
importing the router so view router from
view router like this that's the first
important step then I want to set up my
routes and routes are an array in view
chess and each route then is a
JavaScript object which has a path which
I want to be an empty pot for my quotes
component I will assign a component with
the component property here
I therefore also need to import it
otherwise you jet doesn't know where it
lives
so that would be d quotes component from
dot slash components then d quotes not
quote quotes new file so this is the
component I want to load when I just
visit my project slash nothing the new
quote should actually be loaded at let's
say new quote so slash new quote at the
end and here that should therefore be
whoops P slash new quote you could say
and that should be the new quote
component which I also need to import
new quote from the new quote view file
in the components folder here of course
so here new quote so these are the two
routes I'll have now with the routes I
can set up the router this is a new view
router instance and cue router I pass an
object configuring this router now the
first thing I will set up here is the
mode which I'll set to history to use
normal slashes instead of the hashtag
mode because I like that and give you
development server is set up to support
this and then I will configure the
actual routes stored in my routes
constant here well last but not least
this router has to be added on the
router property of my route view
instance and what that routing is
initialized now for that to work
correctly we also need a place to load
our routes though so in the app
thoughtyou file here where a loaded my
app new quote I will instead
now load my route and we do this with
router view which is a protected
component give you router ships with
which is again like a place holder where
the actual that route will be loaded
this of course now allows me to get rid
of this component here in the view
instance because we're using routing no
need to import it and set it up here as
a local component and for this to work
correctly I also need to use the view
router so back in the main dot chess
file our exit view use view router and
this will unlock the router view we're
using here for example excuse me we're
using here for example so these
components give you router ships with
for example so it's at being safe then
the pros are still running this is
actually an old error kind of a look at
this and this looks good we're loading
to get closed component now I will as
show or will try to go to new quote
looks all too good so this works of
course it would be nicer to have some
links here so let's implement this too
so I'll go back to my application here
and I will simply duplicate this row
here and the app W file too now also
have a place where I can place my link
in between also to place a horizontal
line between those two rows and here
again I want to set up some links I can
use so here I use the router link
component give you router ships with
where I set up to where this link should
lead to so this will just be my quotes
link which will lead to just slash and
here for the second link I want to go to
new quote so here it is new quote the
other link I have and let's add a pipe
symbol in between to have some
separation also to have this whole
project not sit directly on the top edge
and so on I will add a simple style here
where I will save on my apps they appear
I'll add a margin of 30 pixels something
like that so that's nice now saved us
and have a look at the app looks good
and now we can navigate between the two
rows routes here let's now see if the
get quotes partner works if I click it
we get back some data so distance seems
to work but how can we now access our
quotes let's
have a look at this object we got back
this is the object created by Axios this
package we're using to reach out to the
server here we get a couple of
properties and data looks promising
in data we get a quotes property which
holds our array of quotes so this is
what we need to access well with that
information we can go back to the quotes
component and here we're analog T
response I will instead say this quote
referring to this closed property here
set up for this whole component response
data quotes just like this this will
extract the quotes from the response and
assign it to my quotes property here now
with this let's save it and let's now
see if this works it should have
reloaded effects logic linkages again we
see the quotes here but we also get a
lot of errors those datas because all
those click listeners here are not
defined but generally you see that this
works now of course we need to make sure
that it's editing and so on works and
that we only show this input if we click
the edit button and so on so let's
finish this view chase application by
next working on this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
