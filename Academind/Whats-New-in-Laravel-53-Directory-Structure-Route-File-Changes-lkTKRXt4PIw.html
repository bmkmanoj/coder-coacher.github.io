and with it we got to change directory
structure and our routes file got split
up well in this video I'm going to have
a look at both and see what changed and
how we are still able to create routes
so let's have a look at this together
this is the new structure in 5.3 and
that's the old structure in 5.2 great
cells see you on the next videos nah
seriously um we're having kind of the
same structure and it's not like
everything changed but we get to
important changes specifically one of
them is really important and important
to know if you're updating your
applications or viewing my old videos
and want to use the code in five point
3d routes here is 5.2 we're previously
stored in the app HTTP routes folder
here right and we had all our routes up
here to the right don't need to see them
unfold because well that's just a
default set up I haven't wrote any
custom code here well in five point
three happens to be that the routes are
now in their own folder in the root
directory so no longer under App HTTP
but instead here in the routes folder
now why do we use a new folder for that
because we no longer have only one
routes file we have three what well we
don't need them all free all the time if
you write a normal server side web
application where you render your views
like for example in my shopping cart
application or my social network series
you would use the web top PHP file and
indeed if you open that file you will
see this welcome route you had here on
the right in the routes file so why do
we have two new files then well this new
split makes it easier to write for
example restful applications with level
or any api's if you write create such an
API which means an application which
doesn't send views to the server but
instead provides API endpoints for some
front ends like angular 2 to connect
with well then you would use the API
routes file why do we have a separate
file for this the reason for this simply
is that with this split it's now easier
to apply the middle of where we wanna
apply and I'm not talking about
authentication middleware which you
would have added
on our own anyways but the built-in
milla we're like CSRF protection we
don't want that middleware on our API
routes because it's not like our API
works we're not using CSRF protection
there we're not using sessions there
instead we need our middleware there for
example like throttling sign-up attempts
or anything like that and this split of
files makes it easier as these api
routes automatically only get the
middleware they should get for example
the protection or DD fraud link but not
dcs RF protection whereas the routes in
the web PHP file for our server-side
applications like the ones we again
built in this on this channel still get
you CSRF protection will aware and so on
so that's why we have to split and the
third file here the console PHP well
this is if you basically create your own
console commands and I'm not going into
detail here we never did this on this
channel you will rarely do it anyways
but if you do well then you can serve
specific routes for that here too so key
takeaway API for restful api is has
different less middleware than the web
routes web PHP file for your server side
we send a view to the client default
applications
that's the routing there is one other
change in the directory structure which
is actually less interesting than to
show it nonetheless if we compare the
HTTP folder here you'll see that well it
looks roughly the same we get this
request folder in 5.2 we don't have it
in 5.3 and you will also notice that in
the app folder itself here we're also
missing some files like chops listeners
policies and yeah I think that's it the
reason for this is these folders will
still be created if we need them but if
we have a look at them in 5.2 all these
folders are empty anyways
we're not really using them here this
request object we're not easy really
using it if you want to use that if you
create a new job with the artist in
command it will still create that folder
in the app folder so the folder is
technically not gone it's just not
shipped by default because it would be
empty anyways but if you use it it will
be created in the same place as it was
in 5.2 and these are the directory
changes and especially the route changes
I wanted to talk about see you in the
other videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
