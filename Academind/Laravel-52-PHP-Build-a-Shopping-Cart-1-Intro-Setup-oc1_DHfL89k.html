the first video of this project on the
lateral side so this video is not about
no chairs this is about wearable now I
will start as I said it's very basics
and will are the very basics of starting
a new project well setting it up right
installing it so this is what I'm doing
here I already got a new terminal window
here and what I want to do is I want to
use composer to create a new level
project and it is real easy to do
I navigate it into the folder where I
want to store it so you should do the
same on your machine of course and in
there having composer installed on my
machine this is of course important you
can download it from get composer org I
type composer create project and the
level / level and then optionally I here
specify the folder where I want to store
the project in this case I will call it
shopping cart now this will download a
level framework and set this folder up
for me and this will take a couple of
seconds here because first as you can
see it installed wearable but now it's
updating all the dependencies and that
are a bit more so I'll be back once this
is finished
great so my installations just finished
but now the interesting question is how
do you actually run it so which options
do you have to run it
I choose way grand / home stairs or a
virtual machine which will host my web
server by PHP interpreter and so on to
run this project so I'm already prepared
to start my new app which I will show
you in a second but if you're not using
vagrant and of course it's fine
not you you may have ma'am or Sam or
some other PHP development stack on your
machine and of course you should consult
the documentation off that's that figure
out where to put your project so that
they get served correctly or you might
use cloud 9 or any other cloud IDE or
cloud workspace provider where you can
also set up and store projects and if
you're interested in that you will
to find a link in the description
explaining how to drill or at least lead
into the respective resources which will
show you how to do that so with that's
talking out the way what I will do is I
will open up a browser window and
navigate to this newly created
application to see that everything is
working as it should
great so here is my working application
level shop dev is just the URL I set up
in my hosts file to navigate there
easily and with that
I got the project set up but now it's
time to have a look at the folder
structure do some cleaning up there and
we'll set up the basic folder structure
we or at least I will need to
successfully create and handle this
project probably not that surprising I
use phpstorm for that and n phpstorm
there are a couple of things I want to
go through here the first one is T dot
E&amp;amp;V file and at this file you can
provide some basic configuration for
lateral as you probably are aware now
the most important thing here of course
is the database make sure that you're
setting up this connection to your
database on your machine or your on your
stack on which you're developing so for
me with homestead this default setup
here is perfectly fine but you may need
to change this change database name and
so on the next thing what I want to do
is in the resources folder on the views
the welcome to play dot PHP file a list
of you are currently seeing in a browser
but we won't need that we will build our
own views so I will get rid of this and
next I want to provide a couple of
default files here or starting files on
folders so I want to have a master
layout providing a layout for all my
views so all of you should extend this
layout to have well the same style and
same skeleton and so on then I will have
some partials like the header which is
used in multiple views and then I will
have my well individual views I use use
I use yes and this and this use again I
will structure them by
well part of the application so I will
have views related to my shop and I will
have used related to my users because my
users of course need to have sign up
sign am pages and so on so how do I set
this up specifically well I will create
a new folder here and I look hold this
folder layouts and I will create another
new folder resources here there which I
will call partials and another new
folder called shop with showed of course
hold all these shutter lighted views and
finally a new folder called user end as
you might guess this folder should hold
all the user Lite views so let's get
started in the layouts folder I will
create a new master layout here and I
will call it master the blade to PHP and
you probably learned how to create such
master layouts in my upper-level videos
and you might ho look at them if you're
unsure but here's a quick wrap-up
layouts are basically a concept in
levels templating engine blade this is
why this file has to stop blade in it
which use or which provide a basic
skeleton our views can well extend or
use basically so with this I'm able to
setup my normal html5 skeleton and I do
this with Emmet here really quick which
allows me to have well stock type this
HTML tag head tag body section and so on
as well as the title and I can provide
certain hooks in this layout where my
views later can come in and inject or
insert their content so that I don't
have similar files with only different
content pieces in them but instead I
have one single file where are the files
well inherit from this file and then
input their content and this of course
leads to viewer files to be written and
if I change something for example here
in the skeleton if I add
today had section I only have to do this
in one file and not in all my single
views so this of course is a great time
Savior and it is also a good programming
style so with this basic skeletons setup
here there are a couple of hooks I want
to provide here in a couple of imports
let's start with the hooks which my
inheriting views should be able to use
so here I start with the title I don't
want your heart killed a title here I
will provide a new hook with the yield
keyword and yield allows you to specify
well attack your or a name and I will
call this title and my other views will
be able to come in and supply a title
and level will know or play it a
templating engine will know where to
enter this title because I set this hook
up the next hook I will have is below
the title here let's say my style hook
where I want my views to be able to
insert their specific styles or style
sheet imports if they have something
like this and of course be aware you
don't have to use these hooks if you
don't provide anything well it will just
say empty but you can and that is the
great thing about them at the end of the
body section I will provide a similar
hook the script hook and this again
allows my use to inject or insert their
own scripts at the bottom of my document
and finally the most important hook I'd
say is the content hook and be aware
that all these names here are totally
arbitrary
you may choose whichever names you like
I just chose these names because I think
they are very expressive but that is
totally up to you so the content hook
here or this yield content here is of
course responsible for allowing the
views to insert their own content into
the skeleton so with this I get my basic
layout set up but for this application I
want to use bootstrap to have some basic
styling available so in order to do this
I will go to
bootstrap caputre calm and I actually
won't download it but I will grab this
CDN link here to basically import the
stylesheet package from the content
delivery network here and I will insert
it right above my custom styles hook
here so that my Styles would be able to
overwrite bootstrap if well I need me to
do that so this is one thing I also want
to grab the bootstrap script here
because that later on will give us the
ability to create modal's or something
like this if you want you and I will
insert that right above my custom script
hooks in hook here and I will also grab
jQuery and as I said I don't have this
application planned out completely but
chances are high that we will need
jQuery or bootstrap modal's or something
like this along the way and if we don't
we can always come back and throw it out
of our application later I just inserted
right now so that I got all the basic
studying available and don't have to
write this all on my own for now so
jQuery can always be grabbed from a
content delivery network and you will
find down here and simply by clicking on
this code check or comlink you're able
to choose your check for aversion and I
will pick 1.12 1.12 the minified version
here is fine for me close this and
insert this above the bootstrap script
source hero script tag and with this I
prepared my layout in a way I needed to
be prepared to work with it the next
step is for me to create a new view and
I will do this and I just saw all these
folders you should not be directing the
resources for that is certainly wrong
they should be in the views folder here
so make sure to move them there right
very important sorry about that so now
in the views folder in the shop folder I
will trade my basic in next up later PHP
file and for now all I want to output
here is a heading which says it works
just to see that I successfully created
my own view and hooked it up which I
haven't done yet that's the next step in
the app folder which holds all of the
app relate total all the code we will
write throughout this application all
our business logic in the HTTP folder I
got this routes the PHP file and here
all three routes are registered routes
available for the user to access queue
well navigate in our application
currently there is only one route get
slash which refers to this basic root
URL here because you can imagine a slash
at the end now here I get the error
because this welcome you doesn't exist
anymore of course because I deleted it
so time to replace this and no longer
return
you named welcome but instead return of
you named index however this view is not
inside the views folder directly but
instead in the shop subfolder so in
order to access this I can write shop
and then just dot index note though shop
slash index would work too if I now
reload you see this it works heading I
just provided so I will get just get
this back to a dot and with this we have
the very basic setup however this index
view currently is not extending to
layout therefore it doesn't get any
styling and it is not a semantically
correct HTML document so therefore the
next step is to go to the top of this
file and add another level plate
templating key word or command which is
called extends and this allows me to do
what I explained earlier extend from a
base layout use the space layout and
insert my own code into specific hooks
in this layout here of course I want to
extend the master layout living in the
layouts folder
therefore access this room layouts dot
master now I get my
layout extended however currently this
is not inserted correctly because I am
not using my content hook which I
prepared for it so I will add this by
using the section command here which
says which hook which place in the
layout do you want to use for the
following section which is defined so I
will use the content section and I have
to close this off with an section
otherwise level has no chance of knowing
when the content I want to insert ends
and then I just grab my heading here and
insert it between this popping and
closing at section flight tag here so to
say and this command now enters this
content in the content or in the place
of this content hook this yield content
part here in my skeleton so if I reload
now it doesn't change if you look like
on this but if you open up the HTML
document you can see that this is now
inside the body tag before the scripts
but after the head tag here which of
course has to be the case because well
this is where this yield content hook is
set up to be now as the last thing
notice that we don't have a title so I
will provide this title and I do it the
same way I provided my content by using
section title and section and then I
will just call this level shopping cart
if I now reload well voila you see this
works I get the title in my tab here so
that's a basic setup of this project of
course June the next videos some other
files will be added a custom style sheet
for example and so on but as I said I
want to build this project step by step
to get rid of you and well this is a
very important for a start we got a
project set up get our basic views and
in the next video it's time to have a
look at well how product page should
look like so where we can
click on products to add them to our
shopping cart for example let's have a
look at this in a next video see you
there
