out react.js for now so reacts works
standalone it doesn't meet react chest
and actually you can use read acts with
other front-end frameworks of your
choice to with plain JavaScript even so
I'll leave out react chest for now so
that you understand how Redux works
before I then in one of the next videos
show you how to wire up react chest and
read acts so in the next is in this
application where I of course use react
chairs I will comment out everything
here I'll need it again later and then
down here I'll work with redux I already
get my web pack server running and in
order to work with redux I need to add
it so I will install it and with NPM
install and well Redux here and I'll add
the safe flag to add it to my
dependencies so this will pull down
readex
and install it should finish without an
error looks fine and then I can use it
again I will come back to the reactions
part in one of the next videos so in
order to use redux the first step is to
create a store and i import the method
to create such a store from the newly
added Redux package so the one we just
installed the method i need is called
well create store and as you might guess
this method allows us to well create a
store so i will create a new store in a
constant here call the create store
method and this method takes two
arguments i'll start with the second
argument first which is the initial
application state now this could be a
javascript object could be an array but
here i'll keep it real simple and just
pass an integer just a number one choose
any number you like now what's the first
argument the first argument is the
reducer m1 i use now as said i can use
multiple reducers and i will come back
to multiple reducers in one of the next
videos
for now let's say only use
one reducer remember a reducer is the
part which takes your actions you just
patch anywhere in your application and
then does something with that action so
it changes your state I'll create a new
user here
name is up to you but I'll name it
reducer it's a constant and it's
basically just a method I'll use the fat
arrow notation here like this to create
this method and it takes two arguments
these arguments will be passed
automatically by read acts it takes a
state and it takes an action so here I
then can do something upon the action
now what you typically do in a reducer
is you want to determine which action
occurred because one reducer typically
handles multiple actions so a switch
statement is a suitable thing here to
check the type of the action so I check
action dot type so in a switch statement
I then want to handle a case let's say
add we want to add something to our
number remember our state is just a
number so the add case here I'll add the
logic soon for now I'll break and then
these subtract case now I'm writing this
all upper case you don't have to but
it's a convention you typically use to
name your action types or to give them
upper case names so you might want to
adopt this right now the reducer does
nothing it just checks which action
occurred but then it does nothing with
that action it doesn't change our state
an important thing is our reducer always
has to return a state so here I'm just
returning the unchanged state we have to
return a state because this is the new
state our application will use from this
point on because as a next step I will
pass this reducer method to the create
store method here now this sets up the
very basics of our Redux application or
our application using redux
we have a store which we created here
and this store knows this one reducer
and it knows hey this reducer will give
me the new state therefore the reducer
has to return a state otherwise we will
get errors because our store doesn't
receive the new state it expects it only
has the initial state the one but it
doesn't get new states therefore reducer
has to return States again as of now it
only returns the initial state already
State we pass to the reducer talking
about passing something to the reducer
let's do this
I want you trigger such action I was
talking about dispatching actions in the
previous videos these actions for now
are dispatched on the store which means
hey store here's a new action and the
store will then send the action to the
reducer because it knows the reducer is
responsible for handling the action the
store does not handle it the store only
knows who's handling it the reducer so
we dispatch in you action here and
dispatching an action means calling the
dispatch method that's a method the
redux package ships with and this
dispatch method here expects a
JavaScript object now that is the action
we send and here is the point where I
was talking about earlier I am setting a
type property and then I'll set the type
of D action I want to dispatch now I can
use any string to give this action a
name but of course it makes sense to use
a string I'm already handling here so if
I were to choose multiply here well then
we wouldn't find it in the switch
statement and nothing would happen so
let's use add here and this means with
add being triggered we will land here in
this case block of course no code is run
you're except for the break statement
which gets at gets us out of the switch
statement here but we will land here and
if we add code then the add code here
will be executed so that's the type but
we
also need something else we need a value
or a payload to this action now here you
may choose a name of your choice but
typically you will use payload and as
you will see in later videos if you add
our packages which enhance the redox
functionality let's say those packages
will oftentimes expect that you use
payload here as name for your values so
using another name might then lead to
problems so I'll stick to payload and
that's the payload of the action
typically annual teachers and later
videos of course in your redox app for
example if you change the user name the
payload would be the new user name now
here it is simply the number I want to
add let's say 10 so now we're
dispatching add action with a payload of
10 and of course this won't trigger
anything as of now so in order to
trigger anything here let's take our
state here and set it equal to the old
state plus action dot value now we're
changing the state we get our state pass
to the reducer and then we set the new
state to the old state Plus this action
value and then we return the state here
so in order to see something I then do
when everything you typically don't do
in your react chess application because
there you will see something in well on
your web page of course but since we
don't use react here I will subscribe to
my school's store here which means
whenever the store is updated fire this
callback I pass here the callback I pass
as a fat arrow function so this function
gets executed whenever the store is
updated and here I simply want to log
store update it and then let's print
story gets state which is a built-in
whoops which is a built-in function
which gives us the new state so with all
of that in place if I save this and go
back to my application here and I open
up the console reload the page we see
store updated not a number so something
is going wrong here what could that be
it's of course that here I should use
payload and not this so now you see
store updated 11 so value of course was
wrong because I just explained that we
should use payload here and then I did
it wrong so payload is the thing to use
here with that you see we get stored
updated 11 because the initial store is
1 as you see here the initial State
excuse me the initial State in the store
is a 1 and then we dispatch this add
method we're add action here which adds
10 so if I change this to 100 here well
then you see a 101 because initial state
is 1 we add 100 we get 101 easy huh so
let's dispatch another method we could
dispatch another add method here for
example add 22 and then we could
dispatch subtract method so let's say we
want to subtract 80 then now of course I
have to implement you subtract method
here so state should then be state -
action dot payload and if I save this
and let me reload this UC store updated
101 because we add 100 then you see
store updated 123 because we add 22 to
101 and then you see store updated 43
because we deduct 80 from 123 and that
is how Redux works in a nutshell we
create a store we tell the store who is
responsible for changing the state we
and dispatch in action this dispatched
action is handled by the reducer we
execute some code depending on which
action gets executed we return in a new
state the new state is stored in the
store and well we're informed that the
stored changed and of course later this
part here the subscription is handled by
react.js so these are the very basics
and with that let's go on to the next
video where we will have a look at using
more complicated types than numbers as a
state specifically objects and arrays
which is something you'll typically do
in your application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
