will be about webpack 2 and the next
videos in this series will also be about
that and dive deeper into the individual
features of webpack now what is webpack
if you watched any of my other videos on
this channel or you watched it some
front-end development tutorials in
general you probably already used
webpack quite a lot because there you
rarely just import script files or style
files in your HTML file instead you use
we're exposed probably using webpack
which do a lot of work for you they
bundle all your files together maybe
they even transform them so that you can
write your javascript code using es6 the
next version of JavaScript which isn't
supported by all browsers but then it's
compiled by that we're explode by this
tool which is being used to code which
runs in the browser and web pack is such
a tool one of the most important ones
are probably the most important one you
can use right now the most popular one Q
web pack is a build tool you could say
but it really does more than just build
your code it manages your code it really
allows you to create awesome web
applications managing all your style and
JavaScript files mainly but not limited
to that
so that is web pack now why would you
want to use it let's have a look at a
little example project I created you can
find it in a branch in the github
repository which is linked in the video
description the first branch there this
is a normal HTML file not that much
content in it we have a header a button
and a paragraph and then we're importing
two with style files and two scripts
we're importing these files from the
source folder and then the respective
subfolders that is a normal project and
it's not using webpack or any other
build tool at all therefore what we can
simply do is we can reveal this file in
the finder and simply double click on it
to load it this will open it in a
browser and that is really how you open
your project but it works here and as
you can see I can now click my
here and show and hide the paragraph now
one important thing to realize here is
that we're using the file protocol not
HTTP and that is something I will come
back to in a later video in this series
for now it's okay though and again that
I'm importing all these scripts by hand
and if we have a look at these script
files here for example well what I do
here is here in the after chess file I
access my button add eventlistener then
I call a method here a function which
simply updates the paragraph so it shows
it or hides it depending on this boolean
variable we set up up there and then we
also got this function which we attached
to the event listener which toggles or
changes this variable from true to false
and the other way around
and which then calls these update
functions which update the Dom in the
end which change the content of the
button the text content and decide
whether the paragraph is displayed or
not and these buttons or this button and
the paragraph I don't get access to them
in this file I do doesn't need Dom
loader J's file all I do here is I
assign them to these variables and I get
access to them with the document query
selector method a normal JavaScript
method and therefore DM word order is
important in the index.html file I first
import my Dom loader which accesses the
elements in the DOM and stores them in
variables and then the app dot J's file
and if we switch that order well we can
simply go back to the page reload it and
you now already see that you can see the
paragraph all the time and if we open
the console we see we get an error that
secret button is not defined and if I
click the button nothing happens here
our script is broken and that of course
is the case because we switched the
order here and therefore since we load
the app dot J's phosphorus we try to
access the secret button which is a
variable which doesn't exist yet because
that bit gets defined as the downloader
which gets loaded second that already
shows you my you might want to use that
you like web pack which manages all your
files for you now of course in this
simple app there is no reason
you could simply put all the code into
one single file right you could put the
apt uh chase file or decode in this file
and decode in the downloader
all into one JavaScript file and load
that single file and that would be
absolutely fine but of course there's
only fine for a very simple application
like this one you don't have to build a
very big application to quickly have
much more code and then you either have
one file with tons of code inside of it
which gets hard to maintain and manage
or you have multiple files and you have
to watch out that you import them in the
correct order and that you don't forget
an import here the same of course for
your CSS files there you also may have a
main file and then you have a file which
specializes on some things on styling
certain elements and maybe you want to
use the cascading nature of CSS and even
overwrite our styles and then you also
have to keep in mind to use the right
order so all in all this really works
only in very small applications and
quickly gets hard to maintain and manage
and that is where webpack helps you
additionally we're not minifying our
code here now again for this very simple
application that doesn't really matter
but if you have more code you really
want to optimize the code you want to
minify it and of course you don't do
that by hand you will use a tool which
asset here again web pack offers such a
functionality web pack helps you with
that so let's quickly improve our app
here by adding web page and using some
of its very basic functionalities now to
get web pack the easiest and most common
way of doing so is to use NPM notes
package manager now for that you will
need node.js installed on your machine
and whilst we won't write any node.js
code here no worries we simply used it
because NPM notes package mentor is the
defective package manager for front-end
web development and for managing all
your dependencies and web pack will be
such a dependency because that is a
JavaScript library package we will use
so make sure to download the latest
version
year and that of course may have a
higher number at the point of time
you're accessing this and install no
chairs on your system once you did this
you can go back to your project and
there open up a terminal or command line
window I simply use the one integrated
into my IDE and make sure to navigate
into that project folder and here what
you can do is you can simply run NPM
Amit you first need to initialize this
project you need to initialize it and
tell NPM that NPM should manage this
folder after hitting Enter
you're presented with a couple of
questions you can basically hit enter on
all of them here the default are fine
for now of course feel free to fine-tune
them now after you did this you should
have a package sub JSON file here which
basically keeps track of your project it
allows NPM to manage it well let's do
something with NPM let's use the NPM
command again still in this project
folder in the terminal here and then we
can run install to install a new
dependency and the dependency we want to
use here is webpack of course make sure
to add safe death - - save def to
indicate that this is a development only
dependency so we won't need it for
production webpages simply it will be
used during development now if we hit
enter
NPM will download this package for us
and we'll create a new node modules
folder in this project we will see it in
a second
in this folder it will store all the
packages we added so here if we have a
look you see a lot of packages were
added because web pack has a lot of
dependencies and if we search for it
with web pack simply as one of these
folders one of these projects here so
that is how we add web packs now we can
already use in our project the easiest
way of using it is to go to the package
of Jason song where you see that web tag
was added as a dependency and add a
little script we can name it build any
name you like here in the scripts object
make sure to wrap it with double
quotation marks since we're writing
jason code here now then all the between
double quotation marks as a value for
this
property here you can find the script
and the script simply is webpack this
will target this web tech package we
downloaded and you can't access it like
this directly from the command line
which is why I will create a little
script for it accessing it from the
command line would be more difficult you
would have to type in to denote modules
folder and so on so web tag and then the
most basic form of using it and we will
see how to write a configuration file
and so on in the next videos the most
basic for list to then define the entry
point which could be our source
JavaScript folder so here we could
simply enter source JavaScript and then
app dot J s like this there's a little
web peg this is the father you should
start your journey I will explain what
this means in a second then you also
define the output file let's say once
you create a new folder test for
distribution and there we want to create
a bundle dot JS file this is our script
defined with that script defined we have
to adjust our app shares code because as
I said website will start its journey
here and what do I mean with that here
we have to basically give website a clue
about what this file F J's file depends
on and that's how website will then work
in each file you tell it K which
dependencies that this file have and web
pack works its way up starting at the
file you specify as a starting point F
chess in this case and then working its
way through all the imports this file
has and then the imports off the import
and so on to finally know which files do
you use which features of these files do
you use and then it will merge all that
code into one bundle well let's see it
in action so first of all we need to
import our Dom loader here so here we
now simply add an import and we want to
point to the Dom loader file now
importing it like this won't do the
trick though we also now have to specify
what you want to import from the
we have to tell whether what that is Q
be able to import something from this
file we have to go to the file first and
export something err
so simply place export in front of the
variable the function whatever it is you
want to make available outside of this
file now as a side note you might
recognize that this is es6 syntax and it
is but you still will run your code as
es5 and you can't use other es6 features
it's only that import and export syntax
which is detected by web pack and then
used correctly so don't think that you
can write es6 code now we would have to
add a certain additional package to be
able to do so and we will see this later
in this series and other videos for now
it's only that export and import syntax
we can use so we export both variables
so with wheen kali braces using this es6
import syntax we can now reference the
secret paragraph and the secret button
about variables we then use in this app
tops J's file with that we can simply
run npm run build our script we created
here and hit enter and we should see
that web hex successfully created a
bundle for us you can see it in the
disco der
this bundle file which includes a lot of
code webpack added for us but most
importantly it should work
so let's now add this to our index.html
file I'll comment out DQ other imports
and simply add a new one where I then
point Q D dist folder and here D bunwich
as file we just created and website
let's simply reload our app here and
this looks pretty good since we don't
see an error and you see the button also
still works so we got the same
functionality as in the start of this
app but we only have one import now and
this gets managed by web pack and if we
add more JavaScript files and import
them in the app dot J's file web tag
will automatically add into the bundle
and manage it for us and as I mentioned
data is super important and another
great future web pack offers is
you can also minify the code so before
we conclude the video let's do that
let's add another script which we maybe
named bill : brought of course the name
is up to you and then you can simply
copy the command from the build process
but you also add - P here or - P at the
end after webpack basically this will
run it in production mode which simply
changes some things webpack does one of
the most important things is that
website will now automatically minify
your code we can see this by running npm
run build process we run this you see a
new bundle was created if you access
this this looks much more compressed
smaller if we reload the application it
still works but now we're using this
smaller code as you can see if you
whither to sources folder this bundle
chairs here you also see that many
flight code which of course is smaller
and therefore it's downloaded faster
something you will really only see if
you're using the HTTP protocol which we
aren't right now so in the next series
in the next video of the series we'll
have a look at how we can use the web
pack development server to host our app
on a little dummy development server to
simulate that it is on a real server
which you can only simulate if you use
the HTTP protocol and not the file
protocol which doesn't offer the same
features and thereafter we'll dive
deeper into web Pegg and its core
features</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
