basics redox flow here where we had an
initial state of a number of one and
then we just patched some actions to add
and subtract values to that value and as
you can see this works fine now
typically your application doesn't use a
number as a state it might use an object
instead and you might want to change
your values in that object it also might
use arrays and since objects and arrays
are reference types which means they are
no primitives which get copied but
instead have one place in memory and
then pointers pointing to that place we
want to make sure that we're changing
the state in an immutable way which
means we're always taking the old state
make a copy edit this copy and return a
new state so that the old state stays
untouched let's see how we do that
I'll make some changes here I'll create
a new constant which I'll name initial
state and this will be a JavaScript
object this initial state here well
let's say have a result of 1 so before
we had this initial state of 1 now this
is one property in the initial state
object and then it has the last values
array which is empty at the beginning
like this next in my reducer here I can
use the es6 addition of default values
or default parameters in methods to set
my state equal to initial state in the
case that no state is added or is sent
to reducer so once we dispatch actions
read acts will automatically pass the
current state to the reducer so the
initial state is then ignored but if we
first set up our store and we don't have
a state there
or yet then the initial state object
here is used to initialize the state
that's just some ESX work and if you're
not sure how all of this works well I
got a es6 video on this channel and I
even got a es6 course on udemy so you
might want to check these out if you
want to learn more links in the
description so initial state is setup
here and since I'm setting it up here I
can remove the second argument in the
create store method so now I'm only
passing the reducer because the reducer
on its own handles the initializes
initialization of the state here so far
so good we change the state to be an
object and we change the way we
initialize the state now with that
I want to use this object to then change
the state in the switch statement here
whenever we dispatch an action now I'll
leave the action the way we create them
all the actions remain the same we still
only pass values as Paulo payloads these
are not adjusted to objects there is no
need to do so because we're still only
adding 100 we're not adding an object
with 100 that's important to realize the
payload here is always just a value you
want to change in the reducer is the
place where you then have to figure out
how to correctly change the state so how
would we correctly change the state for
the add action here well we take the
state object here and we could do the
following thing we could simply stay say
that state result is equal to action
payload or is equal to old State result
plus action dot payload now if I save
this and go back to the application you
see that my store is updated do result
US 101 123 and then not a number because
the subtract action here hasn't been
updated yet so this looks fine ignore
that the last values is not updated
because I'm not implementing this yet so
the result
is updated but here's an interesting
thing even though we see result 101 here
if we expand the object we see result
123 and the reason is because we're not
doing this in an immutable way I'm
simply taking the old property and
changing the value there for all old
objects or the state in the older
objects here like the first action here
is also changed because it's one of the
same object it's the same place in the
memory and hence we don't have an
immutable approach here now why is an
immutable approach better because
currently we get no way of getting back
to an older state we can't see how our
state changed throughout the application
and therefore we're back in the world
where handling the state is a bit more
complicated because it's always hard to
know what the current state of the
application is so a better way is to not
do it this way not directly manipulate
the property but instead create a new
state here I do this by creating a new
JavaScript object so state is now a new
JavaScript object it's no longer the
state we're passing here it's a new
JavaScript object and then this
JavaScript object I want to use all the
properties of the old state now a quick
and easy way in es6 to get all the
properties of an object and add it as
properties to a new object exactly what
I want to do here is to use the spread
operator the spread operator are free
dots and here I take the state and this
may basically tells JavaScript or es6
give me all the properties of the state
object this object here which has a
result and the last value property and
add them as properties to this new
object so in this specific case here
that
exactly the same as if I would have
written state result and then state last
values but of course I would have needed
to also set is equal to result and then
here two last values like this now
that's much longer and the big problem
of course is if we change to sit here we
have to change it all over the place
here so that is a much better way to
achieve the same now of course I don't
want to simply get the old properties I
want to change the result property that
is why I now add result and set it equal
to be State result this again is the old
state here so the result of the old
state and add my payload to it action
payload that is why I simply pass the
value here as a payload and not some
kind of object because the dispatching
here or the action is not responsible
for passing the finished
new state object that's the top of the
reducer so the reducer always works with
the payloads which are types like
numbers strings may be objects of course
but never the new state so now I set
this or I created this new value
consisting of the old result property
and the payload of my action and I'm
setting this to the result property now
if you watch carefully you might think
well I'm spreading my old state object
here this old state object has a result
and has lost values and now I'm setting
result again so now I kind of created
something like this result would be
State result lost values would be State
lost values so I have result twice and
that exactly is what helps but that's no
problem because the latter result
property
so the last one I specify here overrides
all prior properties with the same name
which is the behavior I want I first
spread all the properties of my old
state and then I override the ones I
want to override now as you can see I'm
not touching the last values yet and if
my initial state would have much more
values some of them which are never
touched by an add action well then these
properties would never be overwritten in
the turn off this add action so if I
save this reload my application here you
now see store updated with results 101
and 123 but now if I expand them you see
that the value actually isn't changed
because a brand new object is created
all the time and we don't see the old
object being overwritten instead as
happened before now with that let's also
implement this for the subtraction here
so let's copy this simply subtract the
payload save this now you can see the
values being changed here again the
result and the old objects is not
touched and with that we get an
immutable way of using strings eggs of
using objects could be of using objects
as our estate now we also have this last
values array here so let's say in this
last values array here I want to store
well the value that was used in this
action so I could use my newly created
state remember I'm creating a new state
here and set last values or use this
last values here to push action dot
payload payload like this and I'll also
take this and do the same for this
abstract action I'll save this reload my
application you see everything works
here you see the array here is growing
we have an array where we have 122 and
80 Oh
again we have the same problem as before
even though we get the information that
this area has one element it actually
has free because it was changed after
the time this object was created because
I'm not doing this in an immutable way
I'm simply taking my state and then I
push a new value here but since this
last values array is the one we spread
from the old state we're always using
the same array which is stored somewhere
in memory we're not recreating it so
whilst the object the state object is
handled in an immutable way the property
this last values array here is not and
this certainly is not the way we want to
do it so we want to do this in an
immutable way - and the way to do it is
to overwrite the last values property
just like we overwrite result here and
then set this to be equal to you a new
array where again use the spread
operator to spread out the old last
values array spread operators can be
used on both arrays and objects to
either fetch out all the properties in
the case of objects or all the elements
in the case of arrays so state last
values fills this array with all the old
values and then I add a new value action
payload so that's kind of pushing in an
immutable way and I'll do the same in
the subtract case now important thing in
this case here I could of course remove
this spreading of my state object
because I'm overwriting all the
properties that exists anyways but I'm
leaving it here because in reality you
will oftentimes have a case where your
action doesn't change all the properties
of your state we might have an
additional property like let's say
username here set it equal to max and
this is never touched so therefore we
want to still spread the state and only
change the values we need to
change now if I save this and reload my
application again well we see user name
is always the same the array contains
one two and then three elements which is
of course the case in the last object
but now the first object is also correct
and at this point of time where we
changed the state for the first time we
only have the first value that was added
100 in the second place here we have 122
and then the last time we dispatch in
action we get 122 and then 80 and the
result has changed appropriately too so
that is how you handle objects and
arrays in an immutable way in your Redux
state and that is a key thing to know
and to use to make a predictable state
or to have a predictable state in your
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
