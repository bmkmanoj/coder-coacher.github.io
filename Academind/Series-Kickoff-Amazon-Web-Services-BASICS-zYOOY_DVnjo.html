kick off video and I want to kick my
mysterious off a serious about Amazon
Web Services a lot of you guys asked me
if I could show how we can actually
deploy the things we're building on this
channel or you're building on your own
onto a real server so that you can
wizard it from the web and I think that
makes a whole lot of sense now obviously
there are thousands of hosting providers
and a lot of possibilities of choosing
one and getting your page from local to
web Amazon Web Services is one of the
biggest cloud providers it's much more
than just a hosting company you can book
much more services than just hosting web
page and that is exactly what makes it
difficult which is a pity because I am
of the web services is a great company
and it offers a great range of services
with which you can do a lot I really
like it a lot and I do work with it a
lot however getting started with it can
be tough because they have that many
services if you whiz it their official
web page so dead serious has to go of
navigating you through that general of
services here explaining what AWS
actually is and showing some examples of
how you may use it see you in the next
video where we will actually get started
and dive into what AWS exactly it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
