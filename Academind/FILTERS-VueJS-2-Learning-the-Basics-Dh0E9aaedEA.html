- in this video we're going to have a
look at how we can transform the data we
output in our template directly in the
template with filters for example if you
have some string which is all lowercase
and you want to output it as uppercase
we're going to build this example in
this video so I am back here in jsfiddle
a tiny little editor in the web you can
use for simple projects or for playing
around with JavaScript HTML and CSS only
projects and all I did here is sort of a
basic view chairs to set up where I
import view chairs here work from the
CDN and then my app Dave here which I
take control over with my view instance
down there and then I get a title but oh
the tile is all lowercase now what if I
wanted to output it uppercase well
option number one we already learned
about computer properties if you
followed all the view videos on this
channel I do have one about computed
properties there we could set up a
computed property which the end of
course is a function as you learned
there and we could name it that title
just to have a different name and as I
said this is a function and in their
return this title to uppercase to
uppercase is a built-in JavaScript
function we have available in JavaScript
and then output that title here in the
template hit ctrl enter we see hello
world in all uppercase and that's a
perfectly valid method this is using a
computed property and taking advantage
of the fact that you chess will
automatically recalculate this whenever
we change the title but there's also a
different way of doing this because
imagine we do have a couple of strings
which are lower case in which we
eventually want to turn into upper case
strings well the problem we do have of
this solutions that we would have to
create a computer property for each our
data field we want to transform so if we
not only had the title but also the
message here which is something well
then we would have to create and you
compute a property for this message and
that quickly is not something you want
to do so instead we can use a filter
filters are simply little helpers you
can use in view chess and you would have
to create this on your own because there
is no built-in filter there's only the
capability to build your own filters now
how do you build a filter well you do it
by accessing the global view object the
one we're instantiating here you don't
have to instantiate it it also has some
static functions if you will and there
we can access filter now this allows us
to set up a global filter which means
one which is application wide available
the alternative would be to set up
filters object here in the view instance
to create local filters which are only
available in this view instance now it
doesn't matter in this example here but
it'll start with a global one and I'll
name it upper case this is the name we
will later on use to work with it and
this method then also takes a second
function or argument I should say which
is a function this function will be
executed by vue.js whenever this filter
is applied to something and we will
apply it in a second this function will
automatically receive one input one
argument and that's the value view j/s
will pass this value to this function
automatically and this of course will be
the value on which we apply this filter
later on so any what we then have to do
is we have to return the filtered which
means transformed value and there I
could therefore simply return value to
upper case the same as down there in the
computed property but now in this filter
now what's the idea behind this filter
what's the advantage well since we
created it here gave it a name of upper
case I can go into my template and pick
the original title here and simply add
the filter by adding a pipe symbol and
then the name of the filter upper case
the name we picked here without the
quotation marks though if I now hit
control enter again well we see the same
result but now not using the computed
property but instead defaulter now only
to highlight this in the local setup
here we can also add filters here by add
them with the name first so if you want
to create a lowercase folder we would
give this property a name of lowercase
and that would also be a function which
gets the value just like in the filter
above which we defined globally and then
we could then return value to lowercase
never built in JavaScript function now
what this allows me is to even chain
this to the other folder by adding an
average height and now lowercase
referring to that folder we register
here locally which is therefore only
available in its instance and now that
control enter well it's lower case
because what happens here is we're
chaining filters which means we're first
executing the upper case folder on title
and then we're executing lower case
folder on the result of upper case on
title so on this part and this gives us
this newly filtered value and the great
advantage of folders of course is that
we can now apply this to any value we
want to output so also to the message
which I could not also transform to
uppercase like this hit ctrl enter and
here it is something these are filters
in view chairs again there are no
built-in ones but you're totally free
and imagining what you want to build
with filters and you do build them like
this evilly finding globally here with
view filter name and then the function
which holds the logic or globally in the
filters object which holds key value
pairs where the key is the name of the
filter and the value is the function one
important note though you always want to
use a computed property if you can now
here it's clearly impractical because
you might have multiple messages or
strings you want to transform but if it
is less impractical use a computer
property because computer properties
offer you better performance because
vue.js is able to analyze on what this
computer property depends and whether
therefore needs to recalculate it well
of that I hope the basics about folders
are set and you are now in the position
to transform your output in the way you
want to transform it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
