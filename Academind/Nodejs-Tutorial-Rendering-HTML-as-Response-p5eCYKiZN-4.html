have a look at the IDE and the believer
for DES and well we had some charge for
basic speed for working with nodejs time
to get back into writing actual node.js
applications in the very first video in
this series we created the first
application where it just renders some
text to the screen there's hello world
text is easier and I just copy that code
into a new folder for this video and I
also created an index.html file which
says now using HTML with an h1 header
here and what I want to do is I want to
output this HTML file instead of this
text how do I do this
well just entering index dot HTML here
obviously won't work because that would
just well do you think I have to show it
but let's put charge which is shown in
XHTML P so that's not the way to do it
let's think about what we have to do in
order to render this file to the screen
user the file is currently on our server
therefore we not only have to send it to
the user but you also have to grab it on
a print server first that's the first
step we have to do right we can't send
something which we don't have in our
application therefore we need a way to
access or a server file system gets the
file and then attach it to the response
we send the user basically or it send it
with the response to be using so we have
two staffs here regality
and let's start with the first one
fetching it on our file system for disk
thank god no TS has number module
somehow verse continues and i will
import this module which will purchase
FS for file system and the modules that
itself is also called FX for files
awesome
now with this file system module we can
perform what kind of tasks with our file
system on server one of these tasks is
to read a file which is what community
because the
file already exists and we want to read
it and read it in two locations or to
say so that we can send it to the user
the client with response now more the
way we will find well it's actually
pretty easy we use our file system
option here and then we call the read
file method which takes well three
arguments that if we you do wish to
Table three and the first one is the
powerful body once we've in now this is
going to be our index.html file and the
path is just dot slash it makes the HTML
don't slash just to indicate ends in the
same folder now I don't want to enter
past any options but what I want to pass
is a callback and this whole bag will be
a function which should be well executed
for once no chance has to finish reading
in this file here i will use pass two
arguments or these two arguments will
automatically be passed into this
callback function one is well if you get
an error and the other is the data if we
are successful inside this file what I
want to do is I want to first check if
we do have an error
so if error is to check I can do here
because we return true if we have an
error in this case I just want you
change the head of my response and use
404 as a code SAVE not found because it
got an arrow been trying to read a this
file and then I will just output some
text so we'll just right for a long time
if we don't have an error in this case
well I'll keep the head I've already
have and I will instead use response and
then just right but I'm not writing any
text here I'm writing the day that we
get and this data will be our HTML file
some can catch it or
render it with response by simply using
this right method here and passing this
data we got from reading the file and
then I'm always done the last thing I
want to do is call the response and
function within this coal bag so I have
to listen delete it here because if I'm
calling response that and you're outside
of the school bag then it might get
executed before the whole bag for the
beginning of the file has finished
therefore we want to not pass the file
in response because we would add
response before we got all data we need
therefore the right place to call
response and it's not outside of the
school back but inside this function now
I'm saving this and I restart my server
here at below this page and now you can
see we got our HTML file here the
problem is this is probably not the way
we want it to render over HTML file
writing Hawaii doesn't look like this we
did not want to have to pure text well
that's exactly the problem we still got
a header of text plane to output plain
text we're telling the browser this is
plain text don't render it as HTML or
we're not instructing the browser to
render it in HTML to put it down there
to change this I'm going going to check
change this text plane to text HTML a
let me save this and restart the server
and an unloading your and now you can
see it's correctly rendering HTML and
this is fully multiple HTML bus with no
js' and the next value will be finds a
little bit and as a basic routing and
soon enough we'll continue using frame
rates and top no GS see limited supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
