back on board I already created a couple
of videos on regular expressions and
I'll be very honest with you
chances are it's still difficult to
fully understand them now let me share
my thoughts on this in this video
so regular expressions are complex I
created a couple of videos diving into
some of its or self decor features we
work with when working with regular
expressions not all of them you can do
way more and pages like regex 101 that
come are great to learn more with the
quick reference on the bottom right and
the editor to test it the key thing
about regular expressions is they are
kind of hard to learn because it's very
unintuitive how we we work with them or
it's very different to how we otherwise
write our code normally we write our
code in English like language we have it
very structured we have commands that we
understand with regular expressions we
put something very complex in one line
in the end and we use just a limited set
of commands it's not the problem that
there would be too many commands the
thing is it's very hard to see how these
commands interact with Java how would I
really build a pattern and I hope that
my previous videos helped you a bit
keeping in mind that you'll read it
left-to-right that you can group things
with parenthesis that you can define
things like please take all characters
that match this previous condition with
the plus or with the star symbol these
things still regular expressions can be
tough and don't be frustrated if you
still feel like I'm going to google them
I also Google regular expressions if I
want to find an email validation regular
expression I google for it now the
important part about googling is the
following let's google for email regex
if we do that if we google for email
regex we'll find something like this
Stack Overflow Fred here where people
are discussing about the best possible
regular expression for validating an
email address in the client so with
JavaScript let's say now we scroll down
we find answer an answer which is marked
as correct and now comes the important
part about regular expressions if you
google them which is absolutely fine
everyone does that if someone tells you
he never does Ted I wouldn't trust that
person too much no seriously
when Google said but if you google it
read through the discussions you find if
you scroll down in that discussion you
find another answer which is not marked
as the top answer but also uploaded
quite a bit and there the person who
created the answer actually gives a good
explanation why you might look into
different patterns and which one it
recommends using and that is how you
should approach to regular expressions
you should be able to understand the the
syntax in general you should understand
yet that this part here simply creates a
range where all special characters and a
to said lowercase and numbers are
allowed that's important this range
wouldn't include Apple case characters
though then that this plus here means it
shouldn't just match one character from
the range but all characters as long as
this well as the subsequent characters
are also in that range
you should understand you should be able
to read these regular expressions you
can by the way always copy them in queue
tools like read checks 101 and then have
them parsed for you to understand and
step by step here on the right so this
is always an option now you can
understand what this regular expression
means and get some help and that is how
I recommend working with them don't be
frustrated
Google them Google for the solutions you
want but don't just blindly copy them
analyze the solutions work with them
read through discussions maybe try out
your own solution first before you
Google and then compare your solution
with the best solution and that is how
you can become better and how you can be
confident that you use the best regular
expression for a given shop now that may
all sound trivial but I know that people
forget these things were some parts of
this process and especially always
picking the first result you find isn't
that great so this video on its own
might have not taught you too many new
things but maybe it did maybe taught you
that you should carefully Google and
that learning regular expressions really
is about learning the commands
practicing them still googling but then
understanding what you found and at some
point of time you'll be able to sketch
out really good regular expressions on
your own and you might only need to
Google to validate them that is what I
can give you because no regular
expression tutorial can really teach you
everything so that you leave it and say
yeah I got it I understand it all I
doubt that this is possible
regular expressions are about practicing
them and do you practice the most if you
analyze existing expressions and then
try it on your own
so I hope this was helpful hopefully see
you in future videos to have a great
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
