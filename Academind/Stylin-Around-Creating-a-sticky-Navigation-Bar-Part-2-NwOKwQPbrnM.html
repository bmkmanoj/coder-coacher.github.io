this video we left when the navigation
bar was basically finished but it wasn't
attached to the top when we were
scrolling down so this is what we'll be
doing in this with you now I don't want
it to fix it to the top at the beginning
because the style will be different a
little bit because as you can see here
it does have no border at the bottom but
if we scroll down this border with the
slide shadow will up here okay so it's
also a good exercise exercise for
JavaScript and jQuery let's some start
by creating the scrolling class which is
basically the class will will attach to
the navigation bar once we detect that
it'll scroll down now we want the
position to be fixed
obviously and let me just add it for for
demonstration purposes right now so what
you can see right now is there is no
longer centered and this is because we
fixed the position all right so what we
want to do is say okay from the top
zero pixels because it should be
directly at the top should also have a
set index of two which was we wanted to
be above every other element of the page
we want this border on the bottom of one
pixel solid dark gray and we want this
box shadow which should have two pixels
vertically zero pixels horizontally a
little bit of spread and then here just
like gray basically so now that this
doesn't look the way we want so we do
have
to fixed positioning somehow and as you
want it centered we're going to add some
padding left and right to it so padding
left will be 10% and this is important
it should overwrite the default padding
and padding right will also be 10%
important now why do I choose 10%
because the width is 80% as we specified
here and here here this to navigation
work and 10% are a half of the remaining
20% on each side so 10% padding left and
right now we have the content centered
and just looks pretty good but it
overlaps the first headline right from
the start and this is due to the
position fixed now we could work on this
by just adding a margin to our main
container taking into account the height
of this navigation bar but I don't want
this because I want this little effect
that it has no border and when it's at
the top and it gets attached once it
starts scrolling so we need JavaScript
for this and we could use the on scroll
listener but this listener basically
fires a lot when the user Scrolls down
because it fires on every pixel the user
Scrolls and this is pretty ridiculous
because for us it's only important if
we're at the top or not and we don't
need this event every moment the user
Scrolls so what we're going to do is
we're going to set an interval which
checks every 200 milliseconds if the
users at the top and if he is we do
nothing and if he's not we check if this
navigation area already has the
scrolling class and if it does not have
it and the user is not at the top we
will attach it otherwise if he is at the
top we will remove
so let's start by adding the interval
and we do this by using the jQuery
document.ready function because we only
wanted to check if the document is
readily prepared because otherwise it
could lead to situations where we try to
append something to an element the
navigation which might not be loaded
already so inside here we have set
interval and we have to check scroll
function which we still have to write
and we will fire it on every 200
milliseconds so let's write a check
scroll function here it takes no
arguments and first I want to select the
navigation bar so Woronov
will equal top nav and only the first
item in case you should have several
elements with this class then we want to
check if document oops don't scroll top
is greater than zero so if we're not at
the top and we don't have the class of
scrolling added to our navigation we
will have to add it so now have add
class scrolling right now in case we are
at the top and we do have it added
because if we're at the top but don't
have the class we don't have to do
anything so in this case
I will remove the class remove class
scrolling and with this code what should
happen now is that once I scroll down we
see this line and the navigation bar is
fixed at the top and once we scold the
scroll back to the top
this fixing will be removed and this
border at the bottom of our navigation
will also disappear okay yeah looks good
so this is everything we want to achieve
in this video and I will bring out a lot
more of there's CSS JavaScript tricks
things which might be interesting if you
have some special questions or ideas
please leave them in the comments any
feedback is highly appreciated and I
will hopefully see you in the next video
say what is this max goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
