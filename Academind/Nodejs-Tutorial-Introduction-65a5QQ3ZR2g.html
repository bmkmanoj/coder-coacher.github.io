brand new project where we have a look
at noches now I could imagine that many
of you already know what no chairs is
but I find it very important to explain
it at the very beginning of a project
what we're actually doing so that
everyone is able to follow along as this
is an introductory serious and not
anything for the pro is doing it since
five years so what is no chiz no js' is
a runtime which allows us to run
JavaScript code on the server now you
might think okay that's new because we
mostly use JavaScript here in the client
in a browser we use it to enhance user
experience by opening up modal's by
providing live validation and so on so
to make our applications very reactive
that is where we mostly use javascript
and where it is very powerful we use it
either plain and plain JavaScript form
or we use frameworks like jQuery or
angular when you create single page
applications or react or many more of
course so this is how we use JavaScript
in most of the cases now to understand
how JavaScript code can run on a server
obviously we have to think about how
does it run in a client in a browser now
the developers of browser applications
they need to provide certain engines
which interpret the chava script code
they encounter when loading a web page
and then I need to run this code and run
it correctly and render the web page
react to user experience and so on so we
need an engine to execute that code such
an engine is Chrome's
v8 engine that is basically just the
JavaScript engine developed by the guys
at Google who set up the scrum browser
and they well recognize the JavaScript
used to be very slow and therefore what
they could speed it up if you would
transpile javascript code into machine
code and execute it there so in a
nutshell this is one of the reasons why
or why v8 their JavaScript engine is
very fast and it is this engine to this
built into Chrome browser it
is also open source and it's the same
engine which powers noche ass because if
you have the engine you can run
JavaScript everywhere it doesn't have to
be a browser right of course no chess
has made some adjustments because we
need certain functionalities when
running it on a server when creating a
server which you don't need an app
rouser and so on but in general noche
ass is using this v8 engine to run
javascript files you give it to it and
this is how we use it on the server side
we create our logic in JavaScript and we
execute it with noche ass which is able
to interpret it and well provide us with
a server functionality indeed it's very
simple and very quickly done and we will
see this in the next video to set up a
server with nodejs
and that's also a lot of fun so we will
see this in a future videos this is how
we run nodejs applications or this is
what noches is in a nutshell of course
now I don't want to read too many
comments when you forget that and at
yeah of course it's more complex than
that but you got a minute make a point
somewhere so this is how nodejs
functions now one important question is
why would we use no cheers is it better
than let's say Ruby PHP asp.net anything
like this is it worse it depends on what
does it depend while there are certain
advantages and disadvantages a huge
advantage of node.js is well it's
JavaScript code therefore if you're used
to JavaScript from let's say front-end
development you don't have to learn a
completely different new language you
can use the same language and if you
switch frequently between front and back
and tasks you don't lose your context
each time you don't have to get back
into PHP and then back into JavaScript
but you say in the same context so that
is a not to forgotten advantage that you
can stay in one language and that you
can really excel in one language instead
of learning
and different ones so this really is an
advantage and now red Vantage is is that
it is a non-blocking which means it uses
one thread but it's asynchronous by
nature so it is very fast - it's very
good at handling multiple multiple
thousands of requests at the same time
what it's not that good at though is
handling a single data intensive
requests there are better languages for
stuff like that it can be slow it's not
fast in every situation but it's
generally fast when yeah when serving
multiple clients at the same time
multiple requests at the same time and
now we're disadvantages even though no
Chiu's now has a couple of years on its
back it's still not even close
as mature as let's say Ruby or PHP or
dotnet is it is still very new even
though it has matured a bit and
therefore well getting into it can be a
bit hard it's in development constantly
so there it's a very dynamic language
and you won't find that that many
resources that you might find on more
mature ease or languages so that are the
disadvantages and advantages you might
think about but overall I have to say
it's a lot of fun it fits this channel
obviously well as we now came from
angular war 2 and dive directly into no
chairs and yeah I like working with it I
hope you will like it too
after having seen this complete serious
in the next video we're going to start
with setting up our noche ass and wire
loom and which is very easy and writing
our first application see you there
