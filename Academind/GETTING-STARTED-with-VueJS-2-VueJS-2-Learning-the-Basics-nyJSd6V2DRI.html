have you here this video is about UJS
and I'm going to say it right away I
absolutely love vue.js it's a great
JavaScript framework in this video we're
going to dive into what it actually is
before we then start creating our first
app right away so let's start so what is
view jeaious its creators describe it as
a library for creating reactive
components in modern web interfaces
certainly a nice phrase but what does it
mean it actually means that view chess
is a framework you would use to make
your app more reactive to control parts
of your Dom why review chess to
dynamically output data there to listen
and react to user events to bring that
mobile app feeling to a desktop app so
making your app reactive is a very first
important takeaway you could all think
of view chess as kind of a replacement
for jQuery though you have to treat this
argument carefully it's much much more
than that it's actually more comparable
to frameworks like angular 2 and react
es but if you want to use it as a simple
replacement for jQuery you could do that
it gives you access to the Dom it makes
outputting data very very easy it fixes
many of the flaws jQuery has but again
that really is kind of an understatement
it's much more than that it's really
great at controlling the DOM and with
that I mean not just giving you access
to some element now keeping it in sync
on its own which means you have some
data in your JavaScript code you change
it there you output it somewhere the DOM
and it gets refreshed automatically you
click a button and you'll listen to that
event it gets executed automatically it
makes this reactive interactive approach
really easy well and finally you can
build single page applications with it
you aren't limited to creating simple
widgets or controlling parts of your web
page you can control the whole
application with view chairs it goes all
the way up to big enterprise level
single page applications so that is view
chairs comparable to real
act in angular2 but really in my opinion
like the perfect combination taking only
the best pieces of both frameworks and
therefore really awesome now that we
know what it is let's dive into it and
create our first application in order to
get started with vue.js visiting the
official page is probably a good idea so
I am on you chestal org here we can
click on get started sounds like a good
idea if we want to get started well
we're actually landing on the
introduction page but let's switch to
the installation page now there are
different options on how you may install
view chairs it depends on whether you
want to set up a more complex workflow
using let's say web pack or if you want
to simply import a script and get
started with it right away now for our
first steps I'll choose the easiest and
quickest way of simply importing a
script and I will choose a CDN year so
that I don't have to download and store
it locally and you may choose whichever
link you want I'm going to choose the
first one from unpackaged here and with
that link I will now head over to Jay as
fiddle jsfiddle if you didn't know is
kind of like a online editor where you
can write simple HTML Javascript and CSS
code and see it run there instantly
really nice to try out some things you
can also share it obviously not what you
would choose for a real project but I
will also have videos on how to set up a
more realistic workflow but for learning
and getting started with view chairs
this is perfect so in there let's first
go to the HTML section make it a bit
bigger and add a script tag here you can
simply type script and then hit tab to
automatically expand it here we simply
import the script we just grabbed from
the getting started installation page
and you may remove this version number
two always fetch the latest version now
with that we're having access to view
chess now in order to use it let me
create a div here with hash tag I app to
give it an idea of app after hitting tab
and then there a 1/2 a paragraph now in
that paragraph I want to output hello
world but typing it like this is really
not the view chair style well that is in
JavaScript at all right so let's
that say I want to output this
dynamically so my HTML code is a simple
div with a paragraph which is empty now
let's switch to JavaScript and let's
imagine there would have kind of a
result of some operation which you want
to output in our HTML code in the end so
in your running application to use view
chess we have to create a view instance
first so we have to instantiate our view
object we can do this with the normal
new keyword and then we have this view
object which is provided to us because
we have this script import appear now
I'm not storing this view instance in
any variable because I'm not interacting
with the instance itself but it still
gets created because I have two new
keyword now right now this view instance
isn't doing anything it exists but it
isn't doing much we have to pass an
object in order to configure it and to
use it and in this object we have a lot
of different properties and methods we
can use to find unity we use this view
instance which is the core of our view
J's application in the way we need to
use it now let's start simple with one
property you will often use the L
property this stands for element and it
tells view J's which element in your Dom
so in the HTML code up there which
element do you want to control through
view J s behind-the-scenes that element
will become the template of this view
instance and it will be this template
which is then rendered to the DOM and 2d
what the user sees in the end by view J
s so what do we want to control well D
div with the ID of app sounds like a
good target so this element here takes a
string which works like a CSS selector
and since I want to select this div with
the ID app I just use hash tag app to do
so now we get control of this div and
with that control we now want to have
some data we can output there for that
we get this data property like L this is
kind
a reserved word a reserved property
beauteous will recognize and data
actually as an object so where L was a
string this is an object and then this
object we store all the data we want to
work with in this view instance and this
view instance again is really just a
contained piece of code controlling a
part or whole everything of our doum
doum whatever we want so you're
controlling this div with the ID app now
in here let's say we want to have a
property in this data object and this
name is totally up to you so I'll choose
title and I will say hello world here
now with that title set up we now want
to output it here in our Dom in our HTML
code which again behind the scenes
became the template of this view
instance well this view instance has the
title data so how can we output it view
j/s gives us a certain text you may know
from other languages we use double curly
braces opening and closing and in
between we can interpolate we can output
some data so here we can simply refer to
title referring to our title stored in
the data object again data is a reserved
word in our view instance so vue.js
knows how to access the title and if we
now in J's we'll hit ctrl enter to load
this we see hello world on the right
because now we're dynamically outputting
our title data through string
interpolation with D double curly braces
here in our app or in our dev here with
the ID app which is controlled through
UJS and this is generally how vue.js
works you take control over a part of
the dom then you may have some data you
also may have other things and we'll
come back to those and you can work with
the data you can also listen to events
as i will soon show you in one of the
next videos and then create a reactive
or possibly reactive app with that
because the cool thing is and you will
see this in the next video when we also
come to events whenever title here
changes it will automatically update to
dawn but again i come to this in the
next video
these were the first steps and then
our first view ge'ez application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
