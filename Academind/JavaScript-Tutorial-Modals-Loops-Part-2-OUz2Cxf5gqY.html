video of the series we created the
JavaScript logic to make it possible to
open and close a modal on click so if we
click on to this image right here this
modal and this backdrop open and if we
click anywhere on to this backdrop both
the modal and the backdrop are closing
that's nice and we achieved this by
using the query selector right here and
we selected the trip image class a class
both the left and the right image share
right here
but the problem is that with this method
we are not able to open the modal
whenever we click onto this second image
the reason for that is that by using the
curie selector method we are only able
to select the first model that has a
specific class in our case so this means
the query selector is probably not the
perfect approach for our goal let's see
how we can change that and improve that
solution in this video
now as I said the problem is that with
our current Curie selector we can only
select the first image right here so we
actually need a method well that allows
us to select both images for that we can
go back to our code and now add the all
keyword after our query selector right
here with all we will now no longer be
able to select only the first image of a
specific class in our cage and then it's
done we cannot select any additional
element with this method as the name
says we can select all the elements of a
specific sector in our case tea trip
image class on our website so if we go
back to the page and reload it we can
now see that we don't have a single
element selected but we get such a node
list if we open that node list right
here you can see that we have the first
image selected right here and we also
selected the second image right there
also have a look at these numbers right
here each image has its own index number
inside this node list the first image
has the index number zero so item one is
zero from a node list perspective and
then we have the second image which has
the index number one this would continue
the third image would have the index
number two and so on but with that we
are now able to select both images the
question now is can we also access these
images because now we have these two
images with two different index numbers
but we might want to access a specific
image the first or the second one we can
do that in JavaScript by simply adding
the image SF variable so this variable
appear now adding the curly braces like
this and now select the image or access
the image based on this index number
right here this means if I would now add
the zero right here like that and now
console.log this and
tire code right here and don't forget
bracket and if I now reload the page you
can see that we now have the same
behavior we had before we selected this
first image but now we selected it
inside this node list this means if I
now change the zero right here to one
like that and we load the page you can
see that now the second image is
selected and therefore we have access to
the second image now so that's pretty
cool already we are now able to select
both images but we cannot work with that
as of now because actually what we now
want to achieve is once we click onto
this or that image our modal should open
once again to do this we have to react
to a specific event again a click event
now in the last video I used the on
click method right here in this video I
want to use an alternative I want to use
an event listener how does this work
well first I will get rid of the
console.log now like this and like that
and now we have our image that we want
to select then I will add a dot and now
write add event listener like that to
make such an event listener work we have
to specify an event and we have to
specify well what should happen once
this event occurs for that we'll open
the brackets and first specify our event
which is a click event at the moment
like that if you're not sure about the
events we can add to such an event
listener make sure to have a look at the
video description where you can find a
link to the mdn which dives deeper into
that but in this video we will only use
the click event after specifying this
event we also have to specify what
should happen now and well what should
happen is actually already defined by us
because we want to open the modal
whenever we click onto this image right
here so let's simply add open modal
right here no brackets because we don't
want to ex
the function immediately and if we now
delete our old code right here we don't
need that anymore like this and now go
back to our website and reload it you
can see that if I click onto it now the
modal and the backdrop is opening if I
click on to the first image nothing is
happening though because we only
specified or selected the image with the
index number in the node list one so as
you can see right here this image right
here with that number if we would now
simply take the code right here and
maybe copy it up there and now change
the one to a zero like that and go back
and reload the page then this would work
for the left image right here and also
for the right image so with that we made
our modal work for both images and that
actually is quite fine but it's only
quite fine because if you look at the
code again we can see that we basically
copy and paste it at the same code two
times the only difference is the number
right here which allows us to select the
item in the node list and if we would
have more than two images we would have
to copy and paste the same code again
and again and I don't think that's what
we want to achieve wouldn't it be better
if we could do this differently because
why don't we just copy that one time
right here and then not set the fixed
number into our brackets but a variable
for example something like I like that
like this one I so this is basically all
the code that we should need and this
would allow us to get rid of this code
right there
because now we only need a structure
that allows us to change the value for I
so basically it should be 0 and 1 equal
to the index number in our node list
right here and then this code should be
executed now repeating the same code
again and again and changing a variable
is something a loop is perfect for
a loop is a so-called control structure
and in JavaScript we have different
loops for example a while loop and for
loop and for this purpose
the for loop is the one to choose now
how does such a for loop work then well
the for loop starts big surprise now
with the for keyword then we need
brackets right here inside these
brackets we have to specify some
conditions for this loop I will come
back to that in a few seconds and then
we need our curly braces right here so
basically our block and then we could
add this block right here because that's
exactly what should happen for each
iteration of this loop the problem now
is that we didn't specify any conditions
so we didn't define how this loop should
work and because of that we only have I
right here so the first thing we have to
define in our for loop is the starting
condition the starting point that we
have for that we will use the same
variable we have right here
so I and in the beginning I should be
equal to 0
what does this mean well we would have 0
in here and therefore select the first
item in our node list and then this
event listener would become active and
see if we have a click event and if
that's the case the open modal function
would be executed so with that starting
condition being specified we also have
to specify an exiting condition this is
also related to I of course so we will
continue our loop until I is smaller but
smaller than what the image SF length
like that no what does this mean now
well the image SF length right here is
equal to 2 we can see this right here in
our node list but I should only have
values of 0 the starting value so
basically the value that lets us select
do that selects the first image or one
because one would select the second
image and that's why this node list is
important to keep in mind
so this well behavior that the first
has the index number zero the second has
the index number one and so on but with
that structure we make sure that I can
only have values of zero and one and
once I is equal to 1 the loop will no
longer be continued
the only problem now is that our loop
doesn't change the number so it always
stays at zero because we didn't specify
that it should increase the value of our
variable after each iteration this is
the last thing we have to specify in our
for loop and for that we can use the
increment operator here in JavaScript
which simply works like that I plus plus
this simply says that whenever we
finished our loops or one iteration of
our loop the variable so I right here
will be increased by one integer so
after the first loop this will change to
one so this is basically all the code we
need right now so we start with I equal
to 0 therefore we select the first item
in our node list we check if we click on
to this item and if we do that the open
modal function so this function right
here will be executed after that the
variable I will be increased or will
increase by one integer so I will then
be equal to one the loop will check if I
is still smaller than the image SF
variable length so our 2 right here this
is the case so the loop will run once
again this time with I being equal to
one right here
therefore this event listener will
become active and see if we click on to
the second image so this one right here
and if that's the case the open modal
function will be executed after that
this increment operator will become
active again and increase the value for
our I variable to two now and then our
for loop will check if I is still
smaller than our image SF length right
here and as this is equal to two
it will stop the loop right there
because this condition is no longer
fulfilled so
let me now get rid maybe off this code
we don't need anymore
and if we now save that go back to our
page and reload it we should see that if
we click on to this image the modal and
the backdrop is opening and if we click
on to the second image this is also
working perfectly and that's it actually
that's the entire code we need right
here to be able to open and close this
modal depending on the image we are
selecting what we could do as a last
step to make this a bit more consistent
we could also add the event listener
right here to our backdrop to close the
modal for that we will get rid of that
code right here now type at event
listener open the bracket add the click
event as we did it before and now add
the closed modal function right here so
this one with that if we go back and try
it out one less time we can open the
modal close the modal open the modal and
close the model and this is it actually
this was the second approach how to make
such a modal visible and invisible I
hope you liked the video and in the next
video of this beginner sky JavaScript
series we'll work on the contact page
right here because this page is empty
that's not the biggest issue but I also
want to add some nice JavaScript
features in this form we will create
right there which features these are and
how this works let's find that out in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
