application because I let the user know
where it currently is or if click was
successful so animations are more than
just a nice little extra feature they're
really important in the next videos and
in this video we're going to learn how
to add animations to our react.js supply
keishon and for this in this video I
will set the basics by explaining how
CSS transitions work so no reactions at
this point but we'll soon get there and
that's what you were going to build this
application with the material CSS
framework we got this simple card which
we can scale up and scale down or hide
all together so let's dive into that and
rebuild this I'm starting with a basic
react application and that's a very
simple application all I do have here is
well this render function which renders
me my header here though the links by
the way will not work and then the
content of this application which is
this card as mentioned before I'm using
the material CSS framework I'm importing
it here in the index.html file with this
link so this is my reaction and I want
to look up these action buttons here
with the respective methods and then
trigger is some styling changes so I
already hooked them up here to the
unhide and on scale method but these
methods don't do anything now how do we
use CSS transitions to animate our
object here you have to understand how
the transition property or attribute
works in CSS I have my Styles constant
here which I will assign to this card
here I simply use the spread operator to
spread out my style attributes here and
add them as an inline style to the card
but error is only one style I want to
add and that's the transition style
transition is a CSS attribute I can use
to define how the element on which I
attach this class or this style should
behave when some other style is changed
therefore the first thing I specify here
on the transition
element or the transition attribute is
on which change do I want to react or do
I want to animate something I could
enter all which means react to all
animatable element or attribute changes
and keep in mind not all attribute
changes are animated and you can
generally trust your common sense in
what you would think that would be
animatable and what not for example
changing the font family well that is
not animatable because yeah you could
think about how one character slowly
changes to the character of another font
family but that's not really that
realistic and it doesn't work on the
other end things like the opacity are
animatable and we will use this so we
could set this simply to all or we could
target specific attributes like let's
say we only want to animate when the
opacity of an element changes now here
I'll use all since I want to animate
both the scale and the opacity now the
other thing we want to specify here on
the transition element is the duration
over which we want our animation to
appear so this transition from the old
style to the new style that is why it's
called transition in the end here I'll
choose one second so that we can clearly
see this transition happen and then you
can also specify an easing function
which means should it be a linear
transition so always have the same
velocity or speed or should it have a
higher velocity at the beginning and
slow down to the end or the other way
around you can do this with ease in or
ease out and so on so I'll choose ease
out here and of course I need to put
these that into a string
since I'm in a JavaScript object here so
with this I'm setting up my transition
and I'm telling CSS here on any
animatable style which changes don't do
to change instantly instead do it over
one second and start faster than you end
this is what I'm telling it here now I
already set up some basic styles here in
my state I want to start with the
opacity of one so that we can see it in
a scale of one
that we have the normal size default
size now if I click the unhide button I
want to change the opacity because I
want to hide the element so here what I
want to do is I want to set opacity
equal to let's say zero so that it's
gone now that would remove it instantly
if we would not have that transition
setup here and here on the scale what I
want to do is I want to change my scale
to now you could say 21.3 but I also
want to be able to scale it down if I
click the button a second time so here I
will simply check what this state scale
is if it is greater than one in which
case I want to scale it down to one
otherwise I want to scale it up like
this so if this I'm setting these two
properties in my state but of course
setting them doesn't really do anything
in the animation remember on the card
object which I want to animate here I'm
only distributing my Styles constant and
the style constant well it only has this
transition style here so right now we're
not animating anything in order to
change this and do animate something we
have to go to our card and this is why I
set up the Styles in this way here in
the first place and add additional
properties here like the opacity so we
also want to animate the opacity and
here we want to have the opacity stored
in our state like this now for the scale
we don't set it with a scale attribute
that's not how it works in CSS instead
we use the transform attribute which
then expects a scale function like this
those pure CSS here we have this
transform attribute which allows us to
apply all kinds of transforms to element
like for example scaling here or also
moving its position in this scale
function here I'll now exit out of my
string because here I want to add this
state scale so the scale to eat a salad
so that this is inserted in the string
which is
then applied as a style this is how this
works now let me save this and go back
to this application and let's see looks
pretty good to me so this is how we
created this and if this was too fast I
strongly recommend a basic CSS video or
course because here I really wanted to
focus on how we can add this to our
react application so what did we do just
a wrap up we set up the transition here
on his Styles constant to transition any
animatable attributes on this element
over one second with a faster start in a
slower end this Styles constant was then
applied as a style to D card here simply
with the spread operator to spread out
all the properties of this Styles
constant since this is no object and
here we have to add key value pairs this
is why I had to spread it out and then I
added other properties or other key
value pairs opacity and transform both
are of course CSS Styles we can use an
opacity simply takes a number which we
store in this state opacity and
transform takes a transform function
here I chose scale and who does function
I pass the scale stay stored in my state
and the stored scale or opacity has
changed when I click t hide or scale
button this is how this works together
and of course you can find this code in
