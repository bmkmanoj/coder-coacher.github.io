covered a lot of topics and one great
topic has been missing as of now and
that is how we can connect to the web
how to use HTTP to get or manipulate
data for example through a restful
service now we got our service set up in
this project or in this course because
we were already using services but we
were fetching our data from well in the
end just a constant or a variable we
defined right so that probably won't be
how we will be doing it in a real app
and therefore we will have a look at
HTTP now in this video yes that's right
we will have a look at HTTP and how we
can access the web to access and
manipulate data let's have a look at
this here we are ready for some HTTP for
this video I'll use JSON test comm where
I basically have the chance to use their
REST API to send get and post requests
and get something back so that I can
just demonstrate how we do that I also
listen to some comments which complained
that it was a little bit hard to read
from time to time because of my font
size so I would try to take care about
that and increase my font size
appropriately what I want to do in this
video is I use my contacts app and I
will add a little side note because I
didn't find a way to at the moment
implement it in a way it would refit
into the contacts phim so I will just
implement an additional component which
does that HTTP request stuff so that you
have a chance to learn that and then we
might find a better way to embed it in
our contacts application the future so
first thing I'm going to do is I'll
create a new contact and/or a new
component not in my contacts folder
button the top folder and I will call
this component an HTTP test dot
component TS and
let me just get this boilerplate here so
to say we'll have a selector of HTTP
test don't need that out of it as of now
in the routing configuration and here we
will have HTTP test component so that
will be my MD the testing component and
what this component will hold is it will
get a button which says test get
requests it will get a paragraph where I
will be able to output whatever I have
in my get data which will be a property
I'll define a second I will have a nut
or yeah will have another button which
says test post request also line break
here and then I have another paragraph
where I will have the output of that
request the post data property will be
used here in my class here I have to
define my get tighter and my post data
properties so as I again that will be
the properties that result or the
response of my requests will be bound to
and yeah that's that for the component
as of now in my app component right
under my router outlet here I will embed
my HTTP test component I just created
and for Network we also have to add as a
directive in our directives array here
so the HTTP test component save it and
now we get our component here nothing
nothing happening as of now obviously
but that will change soon now I will
define a new or create a new service the
service which will do that HTTP access
because that would be the the standard
the default way you do that an angle at
you you create a service which has the
methods to to get or to a manipulated
data and then you can call that service
on
methods in the service from all the
components where you in check the
service so that's the much most modular
and flexible way you could do it and
therefore the way I would strongly
recommend you do it so I create a
service and I will just call it so I
look great the service and I will just
call it HTTP test service dot TS and now
for that service I'll use my contact
service here just real quick copy all
the content here get rid of that I need
them tractable that's important and get
rid of that and call it HTTP test
service good
so now let's our service isn't doing
that much as of now let's change that I
will need my my HTTP service to access
the web HTTP is a service already
included in the angular 2 package so we
can use that but to be able to use that
there is one very important thing to do
but to be able to use the HTTP service
at least currently as of beta zero there
is one very important thing to do
otherwise nothing will work there in my
index.html I have to add another import
up here I'll add it under the up right
below the router here and the import I
need is the HTTP package and you can get
it from that URL here be sure to to
write it down or looked it up you can
also Google for it and this will import
it otherwise we can't use HTTP it's
currently not included in any of the
packages or of the script swearing
importing here very important so in my
test service and I notice I forgot to
zoom in a little bit more than before
but I'll do it from now on
and the test service I'll inject the
HTTP service by writing construct in my
constructor by writing private a pry
private HTTP HTTP this import was again
automatically added for me it's
importing it from angular to slash HTTP
now I will have two methods in the
service which I want to be able to use
I'll have the get current time method
because that is one of the things we can
do here get this date and time API
endpoint which we can call where we
basically have to call date chase and
test come and we'll get back a chase on
with yep current time and date so that
will be the get route will be using and
I want to be able to post data therefore
I'm using that validate endpoint here
where I can send and JavaScript object
with Jason element and it will give me
back if it's a valid object so to say or
what it is just like you're an example
just a little jason element it will give
me back which says something about chase
and I sent there so that will be my post
route so I will just call that post
jason just like that and obviously now I
could pass some arguments to those
methods and you probably would do that
if you call it from from a component
where you might have some logic which
defines what you post or get but as this
is just a little example and it's not
about passing arguments I'm pretty sure
you know how to that I'll just use dummy
values which I create here in my service
so let's start with the get route as I
said I'll be calling this date and time
route here and all I have to do is
somehow send a get request there and get
the the answer or the response I don't
have to provide any arguments I do this
why or I will return it to my component
which called by calling the get method
on this HTTP service we injected by the
way all this methods this does HTTP
service has are very intuitive you got
delete get hat patch post so yeah all
your HTTP works here in this case as I
said get and we will get it from this
end point here so let me just copy that
and HTTP returns air and observable
observables are something angular 2 uses
instead of promises as it did in angular
1 to get something in this case from an
HTTP request and then we can subscribe
every component which wants which which
gets our observable basically everything
which gets this observable can subscribe
to let's say everything which happens
with this request or it to all the
events fired by that observable so to
say so as the name says it observes
changes in the state of that object
I could tell much more about observables
because there is much more to tell and
observables are much more complex than
just what we were using them here for
but this video is about HTTP HTTP and
therefore I will stick to the very
basics I might do with you about
observables in the future you might also
if you are very interested right now
Google that but I will focus on just the
basics here because otherwise this video
would boom explode so I will call the
map method on this observable and this
allows me to map the response we get
back to your variable to to transform
the response service
in this case I know I get back a JSON
formatted text so I will map this where
I will extract it so to say by using a
fed arrow function here where I pass the
response in and then I call the Chasen
method on that passed in value or on
this past and object you this what this
does is basically it says ok it has to
be Jason I will extract it as such I
will use it as such that's very
important because when we then subscribe
to our observable here we will be able
to actually get and display the data
excuse me and therefore we have to know
which format data has and that is what
we're saying here so I'm returning this
observable where I already kind of
specified which kind of text or what our
answer will be our response so that we
can use it back to my test component
here I want to when I bet and click this
button I want to fire that get request
so I will add a click event here and I
will call on test get I will create this
method here now on test get this will
call our HTTP service method to get this
yeah basically just the get current time
function there to do that I first have
to add a provider namely our HTTP test
service and I have to inject it in our
constructor here by defining it to our
HTTP service property the HTTP test
service so this will inject it in that
component and now we can use it here to
call our get current time method and now
remember that returns and observable
therefore we are now here able to
use all those observable methods and as
you can see there are a lot the ones we
will need is one we will need is the
SUBSCRIBE method which means to any
changes that happen there I want to be
part of it and be able to listen to in
this case the data we get sent back or
if we get an error back so I want to
receive that notification if you want to
say it that way so I'll subscribe to it
and now I can enter free parameters or
free arguments to this function the
first one is if I get back data what
will I do with this so the success part
of our request in this case I want to
set my get data property here let me
increase it maybe a little bit I want to
set the get data property to that Jason
we get back but as a string so what we
call json.stringify and then data which
we pass in there and if you're not
familiar with that syntax that's the fat
arrow function it was added as of the
es6 specification and it's also
available in typescript and basically
this is just a function where we pass in
that variable or that argument and then
this is our function body we also got an
error case where we say okay if we get
an error what when we don't goo what
should we do well in this case I will
just send an alert and the last argument
is a complete function which is executed
somewhere as you can see passing
functions in all three arguments but the
last argument we will pass a function
which will be called when everything is
completed so not in the success case but
just when the request completed so to
say in this case and we will just output
finished
to the command line let me reformat that
really quick okay that's everything I
need here now if I were to test it now
that would work cause we're injecting
HTTP here we're importing it here but
two things are currently missing one
should be more or less pretty clear here
we're setting a provider to use our HTTP
test service which you then inject in
our constructor now where are we doing
that here we can't do it in our service
right we have no decorator which allows
us to set a provider Cerie so somehow
how does Anglet you know how to create
such an HTTP object the answer is it
doesn't we have to go to our bootstrap
method here and as we added our router
providers to were able to be able to use
all that routing functionality we also
have to check or provide or HTTP
providers so that's one thing and there
is one other thing which I'm pretty sure
is isn't clear or which is bit
surprising we have to add an import
statement to our service because we're
using that map function here we have to
use this import statement to add that
map operator and to be able to use it
now I can't tell you of it well if it
will stay that way when angular 2 is in
its final form and released currently we
have to do that
otherwise we will get an error and a
pretty annoying one too because it takes
some time until you figure out what is
wrong I can tell you that so let me save
this and now let's try it by clicking
here and we get back our time as a chase
great let's do the same thing for the
post request in my service we will do is
I will create just an arbitrary JSON
object here
chase an element where I will string if
I let's say any object I want let's say
I have bar one is test and r2 will be a
number doesn't really matter now I will
use this and send it as a parameter to
my post request and so it will just set
it up now the parameter here is
important if we look back to our
validate entry here it tells us that we
should send chase and equals so will be
equals you my string if I'd JavaScript
object I get here so that will be the
parameters I'll send with that request
I'll also create a header new headers
and this header and will append that's
also angle to you built-in object I will
append the content type which will be
application/x-www-form-urlencoded so
that will be the header attached to a
post request and now I can again call
return this then HTTP POST now and the
post request takes two mandatory
arguments the first one is tea URL which
is validate adjacent as calm that's the
URL the second one are our or arguments
so to say the body of the post request
to be precise will it be that will be
our appearance and the
argument is a JavaScript object where I
can specify additional arguments in this
case I want to pass some headers or it
will pass the header I created here so
I'll save that now again I'll call the
map method on this what we get back on
our response and I will again unwrap it
as JSON so to say now back in my test
component I now will create a click
event here which fires on test post now
let me create that method here and I
will call my HTTP service the post Jason
method and then I will again subscribe
and will just copy that here because I'm
pretty much doing the same so I'm just
subscribing here the data will be bound
to my post data property here that's
important and the rest can stay the same
now let me save this and click test post
request yeah we get back to validation
that we sent an object with two elements
and and so on and they get requests so
that is everything that is two HTTP in
Anglet you to the basics at least
obviously we got more HTTP words and I
can configure request a different way
and we haven't even talked about the
methods or the functionality observables
offer us but that is basically how we
use HTTP in angular 2 how we can reach
out to an REST API endpoint and get or
post data and then get that data and
bind it to a property and use it in our
component or in our service or in both
places whatever we want and yeah that
that's right really it to me it's not
that difficult to be honest I hope you
were a step further on your road to
getting an angular 2 master and statute
