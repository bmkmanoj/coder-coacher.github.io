finished we have our our product view
here we were able to sign up sign in and
at Sault rate the first thing I want to
do is I want to correct a little mistake
I made in the migrations here in the
user table
I set the user table name to be user it
should be users there with an asset II
and that's important also we'll need
something else here we'll need the
remember token otherwise we'll look at
errors so after doing this make sure to
go to your terminal and run PHP artisan
migrate reset to reset your migrations
and then rerun them with PHP artisan
migrate like that and of course also re
seed your database and after that if you
reload everything everything should look
the same but now the user table name was
updated which is important so that's
that now with that let's get going with
the next part of this series in this
part I actually want to work on the
shopping cart so that we are able to add
an item to the cart and then click on
the shopping cart to see it I will store
everything in the session so I will
store my shopping cart in a session this
has the advantage that it persists if
the user navigates around if the user
leaves the page as long as the session
hasn't expired yet and also it has the
advantage of allowing anonymous users to
well browser items and create a shopping
cart that's of course something other
approaches where we would store our cart
and the database would not be able to
handle that great theme that's why I'm
starting off with this session based
approach now laravel already has session
support both and it makes it really easy
to work with sessions I'll have a look
at the config folder and then the
session file here and we'll just close
some our folders so in here you can set
the default session driver and this is
pointing to the environment file this
dot env
file and then the stop E&amp;amp;V file you can
set up your session driver which by
default is file which means that level
will create a file in the storage app
excuse me storage framework folder and
then here at sessions you see I already
get some files from testing here but I
can't get rid of those and these are the
files where level will store your
session now level has different session
storages and you can learn more by
simply googling for a lateral session
and then checking our tear ducts just
make sure to check them out for at least
version five to two for example and here
you'll see how to configure it and how
to store it so that's something you
might have a look at you'll also learn
it in this sessions PHP file in the
config folder you can set how long a
session should be alive in minutes here
and so on
so that is some important configuration
stuff you should be aware of the default
configuration works for me so I'm not
changing any with anything here and the
first thing I want to start with is that
album what that I'm able to actually add
items to the card let's all head over to
my routes file and I'll set up and
you're out here then you're out I'm
going to create is a get route I'll name
it add to cart and of course give it
whichever path you like however it is
important to note that this should take
a parameter ID because I need to know
which item to add to my cart right then
I'll configure this route to use my
product controller product controller
here and of course get add to cart could
be a good name for this action in the
controller so for the function handling
this and I'll give this route a name as
well and the name I want to give it here
is product add to cart of course choose
whatever works for you here so next in
the product controller I'll add this
functions or add my public function
get Add to Cart and I know that this
will get the idea of the product but
I'll also need access to my requests
instead will store my session so I'm
going to inject it here and by adding it
as a first parameter here level
automatically in checked meters request
object here and then it will also give
me the ID which gets passed through the
route as I set sets up here in my route
path now in this get add to card
function here I of course want to fetch
the product which should get added and
I'll use eloquent to find it by ID like
this so that's really simple to get this
product and next I want you to create or
get it into my session I want to create
a card in my session now I don't just
want to have an array of items in my
session that would be something I don't
like I want to have but here at E is
missing I want to have a real card
object in my session so I'm going to
create a new model in my app folder here
or in this Vianney up folder where I
have a product user model as well now
I'm going to create this by hand and
I'll name it cart dot PHP now this won't
be using eloquent I'm still copying this
just you well have a little bit less to
type but it won't be extending model um
as I said I won't be using Alec went
here right now this is just a normal pH
P class here and this will be the pluie
print I used to create a new card and to
store my items in this card now in this
card I want to have a public field named
items which should hold the individual
products though it's important to note
it with items
I mean group of products so for example
if I were to add Harry Potter and I
added two times then I don't want to
have two Harry Potter items there I want
to have one group of
reporter items and if I then add a Song
of Ice and Fire
a Storm of Swords then I want to have
two items here one is the Harry Potter
group the upper one is DDS Song of Ice
and Fire Storm of Swords group and
within each group I'll then still have
the items and the quality and the price
but I want to group them of course
because I want to present my shopping
cart grouped and I don't need three
times the same item in there I need a
group of those items with the
information of how often it has been
added and so on so that's one thing on
the cart level I also need to have my
total quantity and I'll set this to zero
initially and I want to have my total
price which also should be zero at the
beginning now the important thing about
this cart is I will recreate it each
time
I access it basically whenever I add a
new item or whenever I get the items now
for that of course I need to pass the
old cart to it and then recreate a card
based on that old card I'm following
this approach you always have the
correct state of this card and I'll add
a constructor function for this so that
I'm able to actually pass the old card
to it so in here I'll first check if old
card actually is there is set because if
I'm creating the card for the very first
time I won't have old card of course if
I do have an old card then I will set
items to be equal to old card items and
of course I'll do the same for the total
oops Tito key total quantity if I could
type and for the total price and if I
don't have that well then I will simply
set this items to be null however of
course never way would be to set it to
null here and then get rid of the sell
state but here so that's my constructor
which allows me to recreate this card
based on the old card so that
information gets lost next I'll add a
function which allows me to add a new
item and I want to be able to add a new
item as well as the ID with which this
item should be associated so I will
create a new variable which Illinois
named stored item and here I will just
create a new array of the item I want to
store basically and I'll explain this in
a few seconds again I'll set the
quantity to zero because it will be
incremented in the next step and I'll I
set the price to be equal to item price
and I also set the item itself to be
equal to the item I pass in now stored
item is there for this group I am
referring to so I will check if in the
items I already have in my cart if those
exist or if they are empty so if this is
new card I of course won't have any
items in my card
but if I do have items then I want to
check if I already do have this item I
want to add inside of it I do this with
arrow key exists where I passed the ID
and then the array I want to check for
this so I'll check if I already have
this item and if this is the case then I
will set store item equal to this items
and then retrieve it by the ID so I do
have an associative array here now I'll
add one more line before I'm able to
fully explain all of that I'll then set
my items and here I'm accessing a
certain element by this ID equal to the
stored item so what am I doing here I
add a new item okay and I first
configure this new item to well have a
quantity of 0 the item price and then of
course the item I want to pass now this
is an associative array as you can see
and this associative array will identify
a group of that item so I'm always
overriding the item because I only need
to store it one time this part here I'm
not pushing it on an array or anything
like that I'm not keeping a list of
items because it's always the same item
right so therefore I'm just setting it
here however then I check if I already
have some items in this array or in this
object excuse me in this card and if
this is the case I'll next check if in
all those objects all those products I
already have in my cart I also already
have the item I want to add right now
now I'm passing the ID of the item here
and as well later here in this line set
up an associative array so this items is
basically an associative array where the
key will be the item ID I can check if
this associative array already has the
item ID of the item I want to add as a
key this of course what means that I
already have this item in the shopping
cart in that case that I already do have
the item well then I simply set stored
item equal to the item I already have in
a shopping cart
so I'm overwriting this here basically
this first line I am completely
overwriting it this line here therefore
is used to create a new item if it
hasn't been added and I'm doing this
anyway because I can overwrite it here
if I recognize oh I already have this
item and in this case I have all the
information already in the cart and
that's what I meant before I'm not
pushing this new item on some kind of
array here I'm constantly overwriting it
because I only want to keep each product
once because I only need the information
once and then I only want to increase
the quantity and price appropriately I'm
not doing this yet and worries you're
not missing something I'll add this soon
this line here is then important because
it will access my items which again is
an associative array access to key of
the ID I pass here and store this item
at this position
now either it's simply well overwriting
the existing item so nothing's happening
then if you want to put it like this or
it's creating a new entry with the idea
of the product that passed in case this
product was included on the card before
then it includes then it creates a new
entry with the key of that being that
idea of the past product and stores the
item I set up here so that's what's
happening here and I hope I was able to
clearly explain this now you would be
totally right that this is not working
like this because I need to do some
other things before I pass the stored
item I need to access it
access the quantity field this field I'm
setting up here and increment it because
it's 0 if I created the first time I
certainly want it to be 1 and if I do
have an existing item well then of
course also I want to increase the
quantity because I was adding 1 I don't
just want to do nothing I want to
increase the quantity and I also want to
change the price of course so I'll do
that if I could type here so price
should be the item price times the
stored item quantity so item price is
just the price of a single item and
stored item quantity is simply how many
of such products do we have in the card
yet so let's say we have three times
Harry Potter then this would be free and
since Harry Potter costs 10 this would
be 10 and we would set the stored item
price to fruity and again stored item is
kind of the group of those items then as
explained I'm adding this to my array
here and of course I also need to update
the total quantity and price of my card
so total quantity will go up by one as
well and the total price should also be
increased by this items price
so of the individual item so to stick
with Harry Potter it would be increased
by $10 since that is the price of the
individual book good so that is my card
and that has been a lot of talking but
it is finally prepared and with that
it's time to actually use it so I'll go
back to the product controller to
actually use my card right now I'm only
fetching the product but now I can also
fetch my old card if I do have one so I
will use the session visaed and level
and to do this I have to add use session
at the top here and then I use the has
method to check if well this session has
a card key so if the card has been
stored in this session if this is the
case then I will retrieve it with
session get otherwise I will pass null
so old car sold cards is even null or
the old card then I'll create a new card
and add this use app card import here at
the top and through this new card I'll
pass the old card that's what this card
model is expecting in the constructor
here so now I have the new card and then
I'll call the add method to then add my
product and the product ID and yes of
course you could just add product and
retrieve the ID and D card model but
setting it up this way are more flexible
to also add items which don't have the
ID attached to the individual model for
example then I'll access my request and
here the session this is a different way
and the other way would just be to use
session facets just want to show both
ways here so of course you could also
replace those here with request session
and get rid of the session for Sade I
access my request and then use
here to put the cart back into it or
into it for the first time if we didn't
have it before and of course I want to
Syria serialize D card I just created
and with that I can then return a
redirect request or response here with
the route leading to let's say our
product index which of course if we have
a look at our routes file is our index
page so with that I'm adding items to
the session hopefully at least but we
would be able to see this yet right so
in order to see this out item request
session mmm come on get card here so
this will quit out of my program to see
if this actually works so reload my page
and if I click here nothing will happen
because I have not wired up this link
yet so I'll do that I'll go back here
and on my Add to Cart link I'll add the
route product what did I call it I
called it product Add to Cart so product
Add to Cart and I also need to pass the
ID which of course can access on my
product item here like this so now if I
reload this page if I click Add to Cart
we get to staight and we see our cart
this looks good we have total quantity
of one until price of 10 which fits
Harry Potter we have this items array
where we then have this group I was
referring to with one actually is the ID
of the book here so that's no default
index otherwise it would start at zero
this is the ID of the book we have the
item for the detailed information which
you will need to display title but we
only have at one time and we would have
it only one time if we edit add a two
times and the quantity of this group and
the price so that looks good so I'll go
back and remove this tie damn thing here
to let us work again now of course next
step is to create a shopping cart
and to actually display what's inside
the card inside of our application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
