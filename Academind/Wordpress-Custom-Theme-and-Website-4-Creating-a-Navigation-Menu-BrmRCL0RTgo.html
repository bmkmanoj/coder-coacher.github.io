we stopped at this point where we split
up our project or our skeleton into
different template files and now in this
video we're going to dive into our
header file and create a real navigation
and do some additional cool stuff so
let's get into it it'll start by opening
our header dot PHP file and this is the
way we left it last time now the first
thing I'm going to do is I'll change the
title from chest hello world to a
wordpress PHP function which will allow
us to dynamically set the title on each
page each post where we are so that we
don't have the same title for all our
pages make sense I guess okay you just
use the function WP title and this will
provide the hook just like WP hats does
for additional head tags for the title
in this case okay so that's the title
now let's get to the real navigation as
you might have already fought WordPress
provides a neat little function for us
which creates a navigation bar in fact
it has to do this because the user may
and can change the menu from this
dashboard so the user decides which
links should show up in the menu and
therefore we just create a hook again
like always you can always think of
hooks you're setting your theme for
content customized and created by the
user and that's no different for the
navigation so let's write our PHP tags
again and within these tags I'll set the
function WP nav menu many and what it
says is it creates two just explained
hook and if we saved us
open up our front end we can see that we
now have this navigation here to the
sample page and to the about page as you
can see now it's a little bit hard to
get back to our home page where we
started because we don't have a link for
that and that's because it's not
included in the non configured standard
navigation WordPress provides us so we
have to enable the user to configure his
navigation bar and we're doing this in
the next step we will do this by
enabling some general configuration for
our navigation bar because you can pass
some arguments to this function here and
we're going to do just that so I'm going
to create an area oryx and what's
interesting for us here is the theme
location so I'm just going to set this
to primary and what this means is that
the links displayed in this function
here which gets the arguments RX will
appear will be those that are linked to
the primary theme location and the user
will be able to specify which menu
should go to which location in his
dashboard so if we were to have a
navigation in the footer with a few
location of secondary then the user
could divide up links between the header
and the footer now to enable the user to
choose the location we have to register
it and we're doing this in our function
start of PHP by adding register nav menu
and then primary and then some
description navigation in the header
this will be the description the user
sees in his dashboard and now we get
everything prepared so that when we
switch to our administration panel and
we go to appearance menus we can create
a menu and I have already have to be
home button added here if you don't see
this home menu item go to fuel click
home and then add to menu now mike has
f2 so I'm just going to get rid of it
but now you should have your home link
to you just like create menu
and here under many locations you select
menu one and safety changes now if we
refresh our affronted we see that we now
also got the home button which leads us
back to our welcome page so content wise
we could say that our navigation doesn't
look that bad
now let's do now let's do two other
things first I really want to restart
this because this doesn't look very nice
and the second thing is I also want to
add the possibility to add navigation
items to our footer now what concerns to
styling this will be in the next video
where we will generally restyle our
current state of the website but the
footer we will add right now so I'll
open further at PHP and we can basically
just copy the code from header dot PHP
because remember it will be the same and
just above WP footer going to paste it
in re indent just a little bit said does
two secondary and also we now need to
register the section secondary
navigation item here navigation in the
footer save everything and now just let
let's try this out edit the menus create
a new menu
footer menu links yeah
create it and let's say I want to set
the page to be there too and I will set
so you can also set the theme location
right here navigation in the footer set
menu and if we refresh our webpage we
now also got this link in the footer
here and see how it also got the styling
the light blue background this is
because we provided the menu class
styling and this is class where a press
will automatically use when generating
your menus and header as well as in the
footer so that means that currently in
the header we get it doubled because we
get a div class menu and this code will
also generate a div class menu so if we
can roquette rid of ours here now it's
just re indent safe and if we now
refresh it just takes a little bit less
space because it now has only one menu
container so that's it for this video
and the next one we're going to use a
real cool styling making it look
beautiful and I hope I see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
