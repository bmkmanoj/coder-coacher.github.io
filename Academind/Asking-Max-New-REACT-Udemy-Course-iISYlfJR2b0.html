might have seen in this video a new
course is coming next week the course is
about react so we thought it's a good
point in time to have a little interview
with the creator of the course max in
this video let's start
so max why react that's a great question
so react is a topic which was requested
a lot both here in YouTube and on by my
udemy students and react obviously also
is a super important javascript library
as a lot of huge companies use it like
Netflix of course Facebook the creators
of react and so on so reactors also a
library which is missing in my course
collection if you put it like that
I got a course on view it of course an
angular now I also got a course on react
and I do work with react I do have
project to react and that is why I
fought yeah it might make sense to also
release a course on that till you make
sense but the question I maybe also some
of the viewers is if I think back some
months ago well that was kind of a video
where I had the impression and probably
some other people that react is not your
favorite I would say if you compare with
angular and you how do you think about
that No yeah dead that's a point which I
think I might have not expressed
perfectly in that video uhm the thing I
don't like about react or I like better
in our frameworks like you is working
with JSX which we work with in react as
school is okay and we use everything as
JavaScript that paradigm has a lot of
advantages
personally I prefer using HTML CSS in
the way we always used it to put it like
that and that is why I like view better
why for my own projects I use a lot of
view j/s that's true but that doesn't
mean that I don't work with react that
it would be a bad library or that I
don't like it it's just I prefer view
but again the does mean I don't like
react so I work a lot with react I
created a course about it you like yeah
and that that is important to me so if I
release a course on something it is a
topic I work with and I like so I don't
release a course on anything I don't
like or which I don't use it all so that
that's important because obviously I
want people to learn and people can only
learn if I know what I'm teaching next
HomeSense and I mean I had kind of had
to watch the course as you can imagine
and I must say it's it's a really
complete course and in the course you
see that you like reactor
this is something that becomes really
obvious soul but I think it's good to
share that because otherwise people
might have wrong expectations or
something like that absolutely
absolutely and as you say it is a very
complete course there's a lot of content
in there it's super long but it covers
everything from the very basics so you
don't have to know any react to get
started with it but then we dive deeply
into react also more advanced topics
like advanced Redux usage authentication
lot of features a lot of concepts you
need in a lot of react apps which are
not covered in our courses or which are
briefly claims over and that was
important to me this course really is
for everyone for newcomers and also for
you if you already got some react
experience so I wanted to put a lot of
focus on that I think this is something
that you can see in the course and
there's also an amazing epitaph to set
it to build it's the burger builder and
I must say you will see it I think we
put a video right here right now I think
it makes sense so you can see you can
add ingredients and you can see how this
app evolves throughout the course and
this is something that's really great
because you get a nice-looking app and a
nice working app and this is also
something that I thought was really good
but a really cool actually
because well you it has kind of a
feedback on what you're doing now just
some boring app where you say okay I
will never use that yeah I have to say
it's one of the coolest apps I ever
built in my courses the burger bowler is
a great app because we use a lot of the
things we learn in the course we can
apply it to it and it's fun to build it
because it's something different it's
not your traditional to do a list like
app which you build in a lot of courses
or project so I really enjoyed building
that and I think that it makes it easier
to learn react if you build an
application which is actually fun to use
it's a big coordinates the complete
course I think and so it's also if you
are new to react or something this is
something that could be like boom that's
a lot of content how should I do that
but I think it's you get a nice guides
and a step-by-step guide so you you dive
step by step into react and by that you
get all the tools you need to involve
kind of build this app and because if
not just one app you have multi
different apps so kind of practicing
apps I would say which are like there to
show you the basic concept and then in
the burgh a builder you really have the
big project but you apply what you know
and what what you learned and when you
dive even deeper that's basically
something that I found really
interesting in the course yeah and
that's
like to structure my complete guide
courses that I have a lot of smaller not
that realistic apps where I can really
focus on certain topics which I can
quickly show there and where I can
really put to focus on that which is
sometimes hard if you want to build a
real app because then you don't need to
cover all aspects of routing or all
aspects of Redux
but then I want to show a real app - and
that is why come up with a with an app
like the burger Boulder in this course
which is really using a lot of concepts
and I think that's actually that the
main information about the course right
so we now know why you choose react
contents of what you learn and also
about the audience so basically everyone
who loves coding who likes frameworks
and those libraries now with react and
with that there is one other point that
we would like to talk about and that's
the pricing actually would you like to
share some things about that because we
fought a lot about that because well we
can say that the course is the biggest
course and released and because of that
we found it's time to think about the
pricing and because of that we have two
different approaches yeah so what's the
idea behind pricing um obviously we we
always shared discount codes discount
links in our video descriptions for all
the courses
ìgod we created so there of course is
going to state the course has a price
and udemy and if we're honest you really
pay that price you you regularly get
some discounts and we will keep that
tradition will release course trailer
once the course comes out or once we
publish and advertise it so that will be
next week and probably first we can say
that yeah probably around first day
that's the plan but that's not entirely
under our control because we have to go
through the review process from udemy
side but that's the plan and when this
trailer is out there will be a link in
the video description as always which
will give you a course for 12 US dollars
and and there will be some commercial
rates automatically applied by udemy for
other courses and that that that's the
pricing we offer but we will offer an
alternative price for 10 US dollars why
our webpage academy.com
if you sign up to the newsletter there
and now we don't want you to sign up so
that we can spam you and that's
really important to us the idea behind
getting you to sign up to the newsletter
is that we got a lot of plans for next
year
content wise on our web page will revamp
the web page and we plan on making the
newsletter more than just an
advertisement channel we want to really
make it a newsletter not just
advertising news about courses but
interesting stuff in general to you so
that is the additional benefit you Greg
get and you also get the course for ten
ten dollars that's the idea and as Mick
said it's going to be a brawn but first
probably so if you sign in until the
point of time the trailer gets released
then you will get an email with the link
where we get the course for ten dollars
and we think that is the easiest
approach that you can have so we can
choose between the twelve dollar
alternative by just clicking into the
link below the trailer then or that user
to sign up as Meg said it's very easy a
caramel comm click onto newsletter and
then that's it actually and well I think
with that we basically got everything we
wanted to say right so let's talk about
the course about the pricing do you have
anything else you want to share no I
think I'm really excited to release the
course I think we got a very fair
pricing model we won't spam you as I
said the course is awesome has a lot of
content has a nice application would be
great to welcome you there obviously
it's the biggest course we or I but
Manuel contributed to the course a lot
by doing all the cutting and all the
behind the scenes work so we ever
released and yeah we can't wait to
welcome you in the course I'd say so
yeah we hope you have fun with the
course and hope to see you there and
with that well trailer coming next week
sneak peek coming next week course
coming next week oh stuff coming yeah um
coming next week so yeah thanks for your
support we have to say that I think
because it's still it's awesome to see
that the channel keeps growing and that
well you kind of seem to like the
content yeah definitely helped with that
well bye yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
