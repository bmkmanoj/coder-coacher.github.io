great to have you here because the view
chairs is awesome now in this video I
want to have a look at a little bit more
advanced concept computer properties I
assume you are familiar with the very
very basics of view chairs if not I do
have videos on those two on this channel
also you might want to check out the
video description there you will find
further resources including a very very
very comprehensive full course on beauty
as I created with that let's dive into
computer properties and see what they
are and how they work I get this example
application a very simple one I get a
button where I listen to a click and
execute the increment method down there
and in this method I simply add two to
accounter property and one to a clicks
property which is store in my data
object with counters and clicks set up
here I then simply output them in the
template here and I can click increment
you increase the counter by two and two
clicks of course by one that's nice and
there's nothing wrong about this code
though we can improve it if we had
different places in this application
where we want to increase the counter
and add something to clicks but for some
reason we couldn't share this increment
method because you want to execute some
average kill there're slightly different
code anything like that well then a
computed property might be great
generally a computed property is a great
idea
whenever you have one computer property
which depends on another one so data
sticky a property which depends on
another property like here we can say
counter kind of depends on clicks
because we could also rewrite this as
this clicks times two though we need to
change the order than here because if I
now hit enter well this still is correct
it still is the same behavior as before
when we had the counter simply a
incremented by two all the time now we
simply duplicate
clicks because that's the same effect so
we can say counter depends on this
clicks property therefore we can add a
computed property and we
you sell by adding the computed property
to our view instance and now a reserved
word an aviary served property there
which also is an object now in this
object we set up all the computed
properties you want to have and now
important a computed property here
actually simply is a method so this
method would be called counter let's say
so I write this as a method but I still
output it like a property in my template
because behind-the-scenes view J's will
simply take the value this method
returns and take it as a value for this
counter property which is kind of
created behind the scenes by view J s so
here I can then simply return and I have
to return something in a computed
property I can return this clicks times
2 and that of course means I can remove
it here so now what happens is if I
click the increment button let's see it
it still works
as before but behind the scenes that
works differently I click this button
and the increment method gets executed
now in this method I only change the
clicks property however I also tell told
view chess that I have this counter
property which is actually a computed
property since it's stored in the
computed object here in the view
instance view jeaious recognizes this
and analyzes this counter method as it
is here but again behind the scenes it's
treated like a property view J's
recognizes that counter here this
property depends on my clicks property
because I'm using this clicks inside of
the method body of my counter method
here and that means whenever clicks
changes view chairs will also rerun this
counter method therefore recalculate the
value of my counter property and update
Disney Dom as well this gets especially
very useful if you've got many
dependencies many connections in your
application and then using such a
computer property is a great place to
ensure that your app is really reactive
and gets updated at the right time
in the right place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
