series on this channel or should I say
the continuation the logical next step
after the reaction Spacek series this
series is all about react chess and
redux and we already got an idea
in the react.js basics series if you
solve that why we might need an
improvement for bigger apps or for apps
where we really need to manage our state
our data in the application well you got
a lot of component interaction and why
this might lead to problems
now Redux is kind of a solution to this
problem and makes handling the
application state so knowing where we
are and handling our data really really
easy so before I dive into
react.js read acts here let's have a
look at a basic react chess
application now Redux at this point now
that's a very very simple application
which leads to this screen where I got
my main page where I have a button and
then the user page where we see a user
name now if I click the change to
username button the name down here
changed do you see it let me show you
again it changes to Ana and of course
the code responsible responsible for
this lives in my index.js file which has
my state where its story initial user
name max and then this change username
method where I change the user name to a
new user name now this change user name
method here is passed as a prop to my
main component here and the user name
from my state here is passed as a prop
to my user component now this user
component simply outputs to user name
and the main component here well this
component actually has this onclick
listener on my button where I trigger
the change user name method and change
to user name - well Ana
so that is what's going on in this
application here that is of course a
relatively simple
and easy application you wouldn't see
the big problem though you can already
see what might lead to a problem I'm
handling all this stated in next is and
here it's doable and not that confusing
because I only have two components
because I only have well one thing that
changes a state or changes the state
days single method here but imagine this
being a bigger app and you saw this in
the react.js basics series very where he
talked about component interaction where
we had multiple buttons and so on and it
quickly gets out of hand you quickly
have to create all these chains of
passing event handlers as props to
children these children calling the
events passing data back to the root
component passing it to other children
so it really gets complicated and you
really get a problem managing that state
and knowing where you are in the
application therefore we need a better
solution and I will use this basic app
which you can find as a separate branch
and you get a repository you find in the
video description as the basis for this
redux serious and will gradually enhance
this application to then really be well
batter and to show how to use redux
so let's start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
