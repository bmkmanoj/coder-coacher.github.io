Miller and in this video I'm releasing
content from the first two sections of
my five-star rated 13 hours angular 2
course I got on udemy after this video
you should be able to create your very
first basic angle to applications to set
up your development environment and you
should have a basic knowledge about
components templates and what makes up a
tango 2 application if you don't want to
learn more or dive deeper I would be
very happy to welcome you in this course
as well of course as in all the other
videos I got on this channel I wish you
a lot of fun with the content and well
let's get going
hi everyone welcome to this course I'm
very very happy to have you here
throughout this course
I will give my very best to teach you
everything about angular 2 to get you
really started and get you into the
position to start writing awesome
angular 2 applications now what
qualifies me to do that I work with
angular 2 since quite some time I
started when it was in the Alpha of
course now it's nabina and i'd say i
have quite a profound knowledge of
angular 2 I enjoy working with
JavaScript and frameworks like angular 2
and I also enjoy teaching that's
something I've done a lot throughout my
life for example you may also check out
my youtube channel mindspace tutorials
if you're interested in more tutorials
and see what I do but that's just a side
note so in this course it's all about
angular 2 therefore at the end of this
course you'll be in a good position to
actually create angular 2 applications
this course is structured such that we
learn all the fundamental building
blocks of an angular 2 application all
the theory and how to apply it we have a
lot of practical examples in later
stages of the course we'll create a real
application which is more advanced than
all the examples in the different
sections and which will allow you to
train all the concepts you learn in two
sections before this but before we do
that we'll begin in this section with
well the question what is angular 2 why
we use typescript and what typescript is
and of course how to set up our
development environment now I know most
of you just want to get started and we
will do so in section 2 where we dive
into components which are the key
building block of any angular 2
application thereafter we'll learn more
about data binding which is how we can
work with data in an angular 2
application how we can manipulate and
change Dom and pass data around in our
application a very key concept
thereafter we'll talk about directives
learn what directives are and how we use
them how we create our own
and how we can again manipulate it Dom
with directors there after it's time to
have a look at services which allow us
to centralize certain parts of our
application and access it from several
points in our application so to say
after learning more about services we'll
have a look at forest angle at you and
see which awesome tools angular2
provides us to make working with forms
really simple because you know working
with forms is really and everyday a task
of every developer after having learned
more about forms we learn about pipes
which are little help us angler to which
allow us to transform data we output to
a few we'll see how hellos pipes are to
easily transform data or output it data
and thereafter we'll have a look at
routing in HTTP and see how we can set
up a router to well route between
different blocks in our application
different routes of course and with HTTP
we'll be able to leave our application
and access data or whatever on a number
server so a lot of content we got here
and I'm very excited to get into it I'm
sure you are too so let's get started
hi everyone let's take a moment to talk
about the architecture of an angular 2
application because understanding and
knowing that architecture is a key thing
when becoming an angle to developer
angular 2 followers a certain philosophy
or yes architecture when it comes to
building up applications with it
basically an angular 2 application is
very modular we have a lot of modules
something that types group supports
really well that hold the different
parts of our application and the angular
2 framework itself also consists of a
lot of packages or modules that is we
have to export and import certain
functionalities or classes when we're
interacting with different
yeah modules so we might have a module
with component and we might have another
module with a component now if we want
to use two ponente in component B we
will have to export the class the
JavaScript class in module a and import
it and what you'll be we will see this
in the course and it's really easy to do
it's just important for you to
understand that this modularity is a key
thing in an angular app or an angular q
application everything is modular there
now this modules as I said hold
different things one very important
thing that makes up every angular 2
application are components we will have
one or multiple components that kind of
yet really structure our application you
can think of it like an HTML document
where you have a header then a main
section and the main section might have
a sidebar and an a Content section and
then you have a footer at the end that
are certain sections or components on
your web page as well right right now
angular 2 works the same way you define
components and then you build up your
application with this these components
and these components are able to be
siblings or you are able to nest those
components in
each other and they are able to
communicate with each other to make sure
that you're able to use these components
you can give them selectors which is
basically a name and then you embed that
name in HTML text so in a greater and
smaller sign in your HTML code that will
be how you include components and of
course we will see that very detailed in
an extra video but just that you know
you create your application from
different components which you build
together in which you can obviously
reuse and that's the great benefit the
reusability the scalability and that
it's very easy to maintain since you
yeah make up your app from this reusable
parts like you probably already know it
from server-side frameworks where you
might use rendering engines like blade
and laravel or smart key where you also
have certain includes or components and
then you put them together so we have
these components that live in modules
that we can put together and build our
app up from now components are just
directives if you have an angular 1
background you might already know
directives but if you don't that's no
problem
directives are basically just
instructions living in the HTML code
that telling what you trail to transform
the piece of code the HTML element for
example where they sit on into something
else well it depends on the directive
what did you components are such a
directive but they don't live in an HTML
element they are kind of an HTML element
themselves specified by the selector we
give them now we embed components in the
code and run angular 2 runs over this
line of code it will know okay that's a
component I have to insert something
there that something will be the few
attached to a component or the template
of that component and that is the
difference or that is why components are
a directive but they are a special
directive
directive which holds a few a normal
directive will just hold instructions
how to transform the element it sits on
a component is not only such an
instruction it has a few and this
instruction is always swap out the
selector and put in that few so
components are directives with a few
attached to them we make a component as
well as we create a directive by taking
a JavaScript class and attaching
metadata to it this metadata will hold
certain firm ation like what is the
selector what is the template which
directives do i want to use in that
template that will tell angular to okay
this class is a component or is a
directive or is whatever and now the
configuration for this component
directive whatever is inside this
metadata we attach so we have JavaScript
classes plus metadata equals component
directive whatever and then we take
these components directives whatever and
build up our apps from it because they
are again modular now a very important
thing our services services are also
JavaScript classes which we turn into
service by attaching metadata or we make
them injectable by attaching metadata to
put it that way and then we can do
exactly that in check them into our
components or directives so a service
might holds some functionality that we
want to access from different places
throughout our application like from
component a and component PB now instead
of writing that function we might have
in at service in component a a B and
therefore duplicate our code we
outsource it into this well service this
class and then we take this service and
inject it into component a and B and
then both components are able to use the
functionality provided by this service
so services also a key thing in angular
2 applications holding certain day
were functionality that we store in this
kind of centralized place that we can
then use throughout our application so
that's the architecture of an angular 2
application having these modules with
components that make up our application
directives which change the Dom services
which kind of stores central parts of
our application that are usable in
different places of our application and
that are injected into those places or
module code modules and that is kind of
the core philosophy of an angular 2
application this modularity this these
building blocks and the reusability and
we will see this throughout this course
it's just important that you got your
first feeling on how this architecture
looks like and how an angle to
application works see only videos by
develop angular2 applications we need to
create a certain development environment
or workspace with which you will work
throughout this course now this
workspace is really easy to set up
indeed
I actually prepared it for you already
but there are two things we will have to
do or to install on our machines to be
able to well use this workspace and
especially use typescript so these two
things are no js' or there specifically
we need the node package manager and PM
which is the tool which will allow us to
well first install and update all our
dependencies of our projects and
secondly which will help us with the
compilation of typescript and the the
set up were the starting of a little
server which serves our files and which
will automatically update our browser
tab so that we can always see the most
recent well status of our application
and that's a very handy thing especially
the compilation of the typescript is not
only handy but required so we will need
that and the other thing is obviously
well touch crypt the typescript compiler
which we need to install in our system
so that we can use it throughout this
project let's get started the first
thing I want to do is I'm going to
search for node.js and on their website
you want to download the latest major
dependable ARM version here for your
system so ever if you're a Mac you don't
know that or Windows TV so it's
available for all systems and then you
just will download this save it to
wherever you like and once it's
downloaded me get it over here you
really just want to follow through all
these steps here that's really easy now
I already have it installed ever I'm not
going to go through the installation
process but it's well really simple
next thing is now we got it installed we
need to make sure that we have the most
recent version of NPM this package
manager which is the only reason why
we're using know what here right so to
do this you want to fire up terminal
again on window is just open the command
line on Mac you will use your terminal
app and then what we want to do in this
terminal here is on Mac we type sudo on
Windows we don't and then on both sifted
systems we follow up with npm install
NPM - G now you hit this and then you
enter your your password your admin
password on Mac and again on window you
don't need a sudo command so this is no
running and just make sure we have the
latest version of NPM now after that we
want to type NPM - V while to check
which version we have and well that
seems pretty good good so now we got MPM
installed the next thing is we need
typescript to do this
well Google for it typescript and then
it's the first result here typescript
languor --g and when we click on get
typescript now we're taking to this
little command here which is just copy
and then enter into our still open
terminal here and now I'm not going to
execute it because I have typescript
installed but you just hit enter and
this will install typescript and it's
the same on Windows and Mac you don't
need to execute this command is just for
compilation which we're not doing
manually we will let NPM or specifically
gulp handle this okay now so that's that
we have all the tools we need now we
need the actual workspace you also find
attach this with you a description a PDF
document which well will guide you
through this whole installation process
now the last step we have to do is
actually set up our workspace so the
files were going to use to write our
angular 2 application this is really
easy attach this video you'll find a
file called workspace manual
installation download this file and well
save it basically anywhere and then you
want to extract its file what I'm going
to do is I'm just getting this on my
desktop
okay so here is my folder first I'm
going to rename it to let's say angular
2 app name is purely up to you obviously
and the next thing is we have to install
our dependencies like well the angular 2
framework itself and a couple of our
dependencies we do this by while opening
up our terminal again if we haven't
already and in this terminal you want to
navigate to this folder
inside this folder we then have to run
npm install and this will install all
the packages we need now this might take
a couple of seconds and you might see
some errors throughout this process but
that is not really a problem because it
only means that something's had to be
recompiled maybe in the end it should
finish without an error and I will see
you then
so my installation just finished and
this is how it should look like on your
machine to no errors warnings are ok and
now we're good to go
now silicide this folder here in my
terminal and now I tip type NPM start
what this will do is it will well
compile the files and start our light
server and the gulp process which will
watch all our files and recompile them
whenever we change something there now
this will open up a new browser tab
specifically this one here and you might
see that loading text here well that
only means that basically the light
service started before compilation was
finished for the first time and just hit
the refresh button and you see should
see our hello world welcome page and
this is the point where we will begin in
all our future lectures by the way if
you always want to have the most recent
state of this workspace you might also
clone it from my git report which you
will find a link in the PDF document
attached to this video ok now we're all
good to go see you in the next videos
bye
hi everyone we successfully set up our
workspace in last with you now I want to
explain a little bit about well the
folder structure or the overall
workspace structure we're using
throughout this course so that you're
really ready to get started this is the
well boiler plate as it was installed in
the last video no matter if you were
following the full already manual
approach again you should have this
folder structure here and let me tell
you what each of these folders does well
the app folder here that is just a
folder where our compiled typescript
files will be moved to so we don't
change anything here that is the code
that will actually get executed in the
end because we're writing in typescript
this will get compiled to JavaScript and
JavaScript code will then get executed
but we're not touching these javascript
files
it's just our output directory the
assets folder contains the s CSS code
now if you don't want to use s CSS you
can write normal CSS code in there q
this will just transpile it you well
normal CSS code and add healthy features
like well first of all you can use a CSS
second of all it will also auto prefix
it and so on so very handy to use this
in development but you don't have to if
you don't want to the dev folder now
contains our typescript files so this
will be the folder structure in which we
will work most of the time because well
there we write all our logic all the
typescript logic all our real angular 2
application files and here we got this
app component file with just a very
first component this hello world for you
we see and at the same time which is the
root component of our project now I'm
not going to dive into project and her
into components here this will be done
with the component section so just you
know this is our first component which
renders the first page to the screen
we're seeing here then the world page it
is started by this boot ts file which
will start up our application and again
this will be explained later which is in
more detail but just you know this is
our booty as well
this is how it will look throughout this
course we will make some adjustments
from time to time but in general there's
the way it will stay now I noticed that
some people had an error that a dot TS
file ending was and it added to this
import and then it would doesn't crash
the app and it would not work anymore
make sure your import looks like this
app component from app dot component no
dot tspn very important the node modules
folder holds all the packages and
dependencies we're going to use
throughout this course or we need to
develop angular 2 applications when
obviously this will include angular 2
framework but also some other
dependencies now when we're deploying
our app we won't ship this whole folder
but I will bring out a specific section
about deployment in the future just as
you know you will find it later the
source folder which will hold our
compiled CSS files so as with typescript
in the dev folder which is compiled to
the app folder our s CSS files which
look at the assets folder here will be
compiled to CSS which will then be
stored in the source folder so this
source folder is also something we don't
touch well the Taipings folder you can
mainly ignore it that contains some info
for typescript to correctly identify and
use certain types so to say now all
these other files here basically
provides some configuration to our
project you allow our IDE to correctly
work to give typescript some information
to not fro certain compilation errors
and so on so that is really what's
inside these files so I hope this clears
this up a bit and allows you to get
started really good and quick see you on
the next videos bye
every one a number instructor with you
here very short just once you move
through this index dot HTML file here
where while we see certain imports in a
certain configuration now just so that
you know what all this stuff means here
it's a basic HTML skeleton and as you
might be aware with angular 2 we create
single page applications so technically
this HTML file is the only HTML file
ever sent from the server to our browser
the only HTML file which will render in
the browser so to say and then we're
manipulating this file through angular 2
so we got our basic HTML skeleton here
and the first important thing is the
space raft tag here what this does is it
sets the base URL so to say of our
application to in this case the root
directory
therefore it's slash what this means is
that in our case we're serving files
from localhost and we don't serve it
from low gloss slash Mike ulap or local
has slash anything we're serving it from
localhost / nothing else so from the
root directory on this domain and
therefore we're setting this to just a
slash now if you were to host this app
on your server and there you had like
example.com slash my angular 2 app you
would have to enter slash my angular 2
app slash into this base tag and this
tag is important for routing to let
angular to know where our actual root is
and that's very important
okay then title and so on then we got
several imports here and this will
probably change as angular 2 matures but
as of now a disaster several polyfills
we have to import to make it work and
Internet Explorer and so on then we have
our system and dot source such as file
which is system CS which again is our
file loader and I will come back to that
in a second
then we have our X J's which will enable
us to use observables observables as a
concept we will see when we're working
with HTTP and
see this in a later section but this
rxjs import here is important for us to
well use it and basically use HDPE
angular2 without using promises but we
will see this in a later section just as
you know what this import does now the
next three imports are angular 2
specific it's the core package then some
router specific modules and HDPE
specific modules theoretically we would
not need the latter to one if we burn or
using routing or HTTP but I already
included them here so that we don't have
to do this once we're in the specific
sections in this course
good then now we're just including our
main stylesheet the app CSS file and
then we're in the body where we have to
smile uploading tag my app is our root
component the app component and my app
is really just a selector of this
component to let angular 2 know where to
render this component we will see this
when we were in a component section but
this is basically how we start up or
implement our application below that we
have another script block here and here
we're loading all the files we need for
our application with system KS and now
I'm obviously not talking about
dependencies we're doing that up here
but about the files we write and here
we're basically setting the folder where
this files are to be found the app
folder where I set our compiled
JavaScript files won't live in and well
at the default extension and so on and
we also say at the beginning
please import this app boot file which
is the bootstrap file which will fire up
all our our application and all other
files will then be loaded dynamically
when we need them so this is our setup
this our index.html and I think you
should now be good to go to really
understand with what we're working here
the next step is to understand what we
do in an English we application how it
works and we'll start with components
see you in next videos then bye
Hey after all theory you're finally
writing some code in this lecture if you
watched my architecture with you and
you're really sure to have a deeper
understanding of all the fundamentals
behind Englert you you know that an
angular 2 application consists of
several components so building blocks
from which we build up our application
and which we combined you yeah to create
our website our application yet now in
this whole section we'll have a look at
those components how to create
components how to configure components
and how to let components interact with
each other because we'll have more than
one component in most applications but
let's start with the very basics with
just one component let's create one now
in my development environment the way we
set it up in the last video and here I
already get a component this app
component tsts stands for typescript
this file holds I am completely complete
angular queue component so this file has
everything which defines the basics of
angular 2 component and indeed it is
this component that we are seeing and
this screen here where we see hello
world
the hello world here is the text which
is shown or with which is inserted in
our template here the template of our
component here so this this might look a
bit strange here probably does if you're
new to angular 2 and you probably are if
you're watching this course and you
don't know it if you have an angular 1
background or because this is pretty new
and this is the core of angular q this
component based modular approach that is
the reason why you can read a lot in the
internet that there is a big difference
between angular 1 and angular 2 and it
is this component based approach that
really yeah sets apart angular 2 or that
is that the fundamental
core of angular Q now obviously there
are more building blocks to angular 2
and we'll cover them all but it's really
important to understand this component
focus concept now my opinion such a
component based orientation makes sense
because if you look at the way you
create websites or your style your
websites when we're just talking about
HTML and CSS then you're probably having
a header and a main container and you
have different sections with articles in
this container then you have the footer
at the bottom so you're already using
components in this way
you're dividing your page up into
several building blocks and if you're
using a templating engine when you're
coming from let's say a server-side
background when you have some experience
using PHP or anything there then you
probably use a templating engine to
build up your views from several
building blocks so this is really the
same concept here angular 2 this is this
component based approach and in the next
video we'll dive a little bit deeper
into this component and we're going to
build our own component see you there
Hey so this is the component we looked
at in the last video our basic component
our application ships with now what
makes this a component down here we got
a default class default typescript class
which will then be compiled to
JavaScript as I told you in the
typescript William for example we're
exporting this class to say hey this is
a class which should be available and
usable in other files so to say to you
so this is this modular approach I was
talking in the architecture video
angular 2 consists of modules everything
is packed into modules so to say and we
make things available outside of a
module this file is a module here for
example by exporting things like this
class and then we will be able to use
this class outside of this file so this
is where we define a class and as you
can see this class doesn't contain any
logic here it's completely empty class
no properties no methods so that's
definitely not doing anything here but
we're making this a component by firstly
importing component let me zoom in a
little bit here importing component from
angular to core from oops from this
package here from this module so as
we're exporting our app component class
here you can say component is just never
class exported in this module and we're
importing it here so that we can use it
here now where are we using it you
probably already saw it we have this add
component thing here now what's that app
component is a typescript decorator this
app at something part here is a
typescript decorator which adds a
metadata to our Charest applause and
this decorator obviously is compiled
JavaScript too but it's very nice to
write in typescript you have it always
beginning of this ad and then the name
of the decorator or
the metadata which should be added to
the class in this case this component
metadata here which really is just this
javascript object we're passing as an
argument you could say here in the
parentheses and inside this JavaScript
object so between those curly braces
we're configuring our component our app
component here and we get a lot of
configuration options here we're only
using two but there are a lot more and
we will learn about all those options
throughout this course obviously now
let's begin with the two we are seeing
here we get a selector metadata attached
to our component which basically says
okay this component should be this can
be used in an HTML file by using HTM and
HTML tag which contains app so by using
this oops this HTML tag we can then
embed this component into the HTML and
that is a so-called directive it's not a
default HTML tag as you can probably
tell it's a custom-tailored
HTML tag and angular 2 scans our
document for example for those tags it's
also scans for our directives its nose
and then when it finds this tag it knows
ah oh I know this that's a component I
know it because I have specified a
selector here and I know what to do with
that I will have to insert the template
instead of those app tags and the
template is specified here now template
here really is just a string right we're
just outputting hello world here and
that is again the text we're seeing here
now we could also link to an external
document here by using template URL then
we would have to specify the path to an
HTML file we would use this and we will
use this in this course when we have
like bigger templates which would be
really unnecessarily big here in our
JavaScript for
typescript file and which we want you
you have the separate file so that this
typescript file here stays clean and
doesn't have like 50 lines of HTML code
mixed in although it would be perfectly
possible you don't have to have a short
string here you can expand this template
over several lines and let me do this
for example here so that we can actually
see how we can change the output of our
application I will use two backticks
here so those are quotation marks that
are Baptist and what these backticks do
is they allow us to have a multi-line
string so now we can just write between
these backticks
like it was one single block of a yellow
of a string variable and we don't have
to make sure that we get light brakes
correctly so I can now use let's say a
an h1 tag here and this is a test
I'll let me close it and below that I
want to have an paragraph where I will
just have some dummy lorem ipsum text
and if you not using any editor where
you can quickly insert lorem ipsum like
i do here by just hitting Laurent and
hitting tab while you might insert any
text you whatever you like the text is
read the important thing here now let me
save this and you should see down here
you should see that your Gallup workflow
is updating that he's starting to build
ts process empty that he's successfully
finishing it now let's have a look at
our our our website and as you can see
it got updated with our new this is a
test and a dummy text now okay so we get
our component and a set we have two
selector which we then enter into an
HTML file and angular 2 finds the
selector and then replaces it with
whatever we specify here in our template
okay now where is this HTML file we're
embedding it well it can only be one
because
when you have one HTML file and hold a
folder here or in this whole project
here and that's the index dot HTML file
let's have a look at this one in the
next video because we will have some
basic configuration there and this
mysterious buta TS file which will
really get our application running see
you in the next video bye
back we are we changed our app component
here but until now we don't really know
how this whole thing gets loaded up in
the first place right now let's have a
look at our index dot HTML file we're
now in our body section and here we can
see our app tags so the app tags we're
setting up here in the provider which is
where we're actually seeing them here
let me just zoom in so that is where our
component gets embedded into our index
dot HTML and now there are two important
things here the first thing is this app
component will be our route component
and all our angular 2 applications will
have one such a route component all
other components will be some more
nested either in the parent-child or in
sibling connections within this app
component so all our components will be
a child to our app component and the
components and amongst themselves they
can be siblings too but we will only
have one root level component here which
you see app component so that's the
first important thing that we have this
hierarchy and that we have this root
component the second thing is okay we're
inserting it here and this will kind of
yet you load it but we need to load our
our JavaScript files to and where our
application itself we need to load that
too so that we're actually able to to
insert something here and we're doing
this in our boot yes file this file gets
imported here app boot so if you rename
this boot or TS to main dot G s you will
have to change this to main and what it
basically does is just the first file
that gets executed otherwise no file
would run work no JavaScript would be
running at the beginning of our
application when we first fire up index
dot HTML now in this boot dot yes
has to be something which gets our whole
application going and we have to imports
here the first one is the bootstrap
method from our angular 2 module that's
a core method this method will like name
says bootstrap or application it will
start our application
the second import is our app component
now here you can see we're importing app
component from our app component file
which is this file and here we're
exporting this class we could not import
it if you would not export it here and
then we're just using this bootstrap
method we're importing here and we're
passing one argument which is our route
component the component we want to
bootstrap so to say the component with
which you want to start up our
application so we're passing a rap
component as an argument and this will
set up and start our application and
we'll take care that we can see what
we're actually seeing here next with you
we will write our own app component see
you there bye
hey so I'm not back and we learned how
to set up our route component how to
bootstrap it how to get our application
starting and we had a label look at our
template in this video we're going to
create our own component so let's do
this I'll do it right here in my death
folder as a set this will be where all
our typescript code and all our
components modules whatever we will
create all that lifts in this step
folder and it's self subfolders so let
me create the my component component and
now the naming convention convention of
Earth files here is to name them first
name of our component then a dot then
component then just defy lending ts4
typescript and this is now the basic
file for my component now the first
thing we need to do here let me zoom in
to make this work is we need to import
component from angular 2 from angular 2
to core now this will as enable us to
use that component decorator this
metadata I showed you in the app
component second thing is I will export
I will create a class I will export it
so that is it is available outside of
this um of this module so I'll export a
class here which I will name my
component component and normally you
shouldn't have that component component
thing here so what you would have like a
contact list component or a contact
detail component let write just the
component here happens to be called my
component so this is the component class
and I don't need to add anything there
as of now the next thing I will add
though is the decorator so that we can
attach the metadata to
component here so I will use at
component then have parentheses and then
square bracket a curly braces using
curly braces inside the parentheses so
we create an in Chaves script object in
this in these parentheses here and now
inside here we're doing all the
configuration for our component now as I
said we have a lot of options how we can
what you can configure there right first
thing is will create our selector so the
HTML tag by which we can embed this
component and this should also have
reflects the name of our component so I
would call it my component with a dash
between the my component then we will
have a template here and I will again
use my backtick notation to have
multiple lines available and I would
just output this is my component for now
and this is for the moment all for our
own component as you can see it's pretty
similar to our app component because
yeah it is just an average component
right now we use this component in our
app component because as I said this is
our route component and we only have one
route component so all our components
will have to somehow live in this app
component so we're doing this here by
just let me get rid of this paragraph
here then I have the never heading here
which says now comes the second
component and below here I will use my
yeah the selector I just created so I
will enter my component here to insert
my component now if we have a look at
our web page we're not seeing the text I
entered there remember I had this is my
component well it's not showing up here
so something is not working here well at
the moment we're we're import you're
inputting our component you
we're embedding it into our HTML but
just as with the index.html and the app
tag here where we have to start it in
our bootstrap file our app component
does not know what my component should
be we have to yeah kind of bootstrap it
here we have to kind have to tell our
app component how to embed something
which has this tag we do this by adding
another configuration here so we have
selector we have template now comes
another one which is very important this
is called directives now directives
takes an array and in this array we will
list all directives and remember
components are directives just that I
have a few a template attached to them
so in this area here we will define all
non-default built-in directives and our
components aren't built in into angle or
two that we will need in this template
or in this component for it to work
correctly so in this case I will import
my component component and now my IDE
automatically added this import
statement up here but make sure you do
have yeah you do have this import
segment too so you need to import my
component component from my component
dot component so from this file right
you need to have this import statement
for it to work now let me save this and
now you can see we got this this is my
component text now to make things a
little bit easier easier I will just
quickly rearrange this here so if we now
get the side by side and I will keep
this for all the other videos in this in
this course now this is how we create
our own component how we embed it and
how we use it with the directives
configuration now obviously outputting
just static text is not that exciting
and probably not what you will be doing
in your applications therefore in the
next video we will have a look at the
various template expressions we can use
in angular 2 to alter our template
to insert data dynamically see you there
but
okay until now we have created our own
component we have embedded ad we have
set it up with the directives
configuration so we get a little bit
into how we use those components to
create a wrap and I hope you can already
think how we would have liked a header
component in a main component and how we
could compose our application by just
embedding them with our HTML tags
inserting them into our directives array
and you're building up a wrap with these
building blocks now as a promise we're
now going to have a look at how we can
actually output data or content in
general by using our template
expressions so certain expressions - -
all through our DOM and we will do this
in this video let's start by outputting
some text let's say my my component
component here I have a property called
name which is one of my case max you
might enter whatever your name is I want
to output this name somewhere here so I
want to say like um hi I'm and then I
want with my name here now the subtext
for this nailart you is to have double
curly braces I'm name and this will
refer this name here to this property so
it has to be the same and these double
curly braces tell angle at you to
replace whatever is between them with
the result of the expression it finds
there so this could also be like a
condition or a function like a
calculation but in this case it's just
referring to this property so it will
output the value of this property now
let me save this and you can see here I
hi I am max so it is exactly what this
expression here does this is how easy it
is to output information or data in your
angular
- templates awesome right now let's
expand the sentence a little bit by
saying and this is my very first angular
2 component it's so awesome
let's say we want to give us a
possibility to say if it's awesome or
not and if we say hey it's awesome
while we want to let's say highlight our
name and give gift us it's awesome some
different styling just to showcase how
we can dynamically influence our Dom or
our HTML here now to do this I'll first
add a line break here suggest a br tag
here and then I will have like number 1
then I have the questioner is it awesome
for our question mark and I will have an
input element here of type text where I
can then enter let's say yes and if I
enter yes I want to do this special
highlighting and if I enter anything
else well then nothing will happen now
to add to make this happen
first I will attach some styling to my
template here that I have some special
classes I can attach and detach - yeah
to my document depending on whether I
said it's awesome or not so we will add
a new decorator here we're a new
metadata that's more correct which is
called style URLs and this takes an
array of paths leading to different CSS
files
now this can only be one but we could
specify 5 or 10 or 100 if you would like
so oh don't forget to come here the
other way of doing this would just be to
use styles this would also take an area
but in this area we would have strings
with the
hunted of the stylesheet in the string
so it's the same with template we could
have damp template or template URL but
only singular because there is only one
template where one template HTML file
and here we have styles or style URLs so
plural because you can have multiple
styles or style sheets now I'll leave us
an external sheet here
so I'll have style URLs and I will live
in my source folder under CSS and I will
call this my component dot CSS now this
file doesn't exist yet so let me create
it here and I'm using s CSS so I'm
creating and creating an SCSS 5 year but
if you want to use plain old CSS you
just do in the source folder and you
create this file by your own or on your
own and just enter the CSS coding you
need there right so let's say for for
this thing here I want I want to be able
to add a class which is called s awesome
I don't seem to be able to type today
it's awesome and this will have a font
weight of bolt it will be a bold text
and I will give it a red color so that's
all I'm doing here just saving this and
now back in my component here I want you
yes I said conditionally attach and
detach this class so let's say I want to
format that it's so awesome part of my
text and give it this is awesome class
well if we enter yes into this input
field therefore I will wrap it into a
span element so that I can give it some
formatting I'm not doing anything here
yet first I will go to my input element
and I will add a hash tag input element
now this text is totally up to me I
could name it whatever I like but this
hash tag creates a local variable so
this is a not
angular2 template expression so as
syntax you can use in our angular 2
templates and then what you will find
this hashtag and we'll know that the
text after this hashtag will be the name
of our local variable and this local
variable will be bound to the element
where angular 2 finds it so we can only
use it within our HTML tags so within
the greater and lesser signs here and
then it is bound to the complete element
so not only to the value of this input
here not only to whatever we enter that
to the element as it's in its hole
right so with this local variable we
will have a possibility to it access
this input field and I will do it now
here in my spam by gear conditionally
attaching this class vendors a way when
this input field here holds a value of
yes now I'll use a built in angular 2
directive which is called class and then
we have a dot followed by the name of
the class we want to attach so it's orb
is awesome class and then close all the
square brackets and then we have an
equal sign and quotation marks and
between those quotation marks we will
have the expression which will be
evaluated and which will decide whether
this class will be attached or not so
what this class directive does is we
started by just telling English who
would want to use the class directive
then we're using this is awesome class
here as well to be to be attach or
detach class and then in the expression
here you have between equal to a
shemites with telling or two well when
should you attach it and when should you
not do that now that's a special
directive here this class directive and
will also show you another special
directive in a second
generally angular two directives don't
have this configuration where you will
first have the name of the direct
and then like for example here the class
name a normal directive which just be
square brackets like like just directive
right without any dot something right so
we will see this and in this course we
will cover a lot of directives obviously
so in this case we're using the special
class directive which makes it really
easy to attach and detach classes and
this expression will be check the input
element so does this the local variable
we created here check its value so dot
value we access the value of our input
field and check if it is equal to yes
and if it is yet so if this returns true
if input element value equals yes this
will return true then this awesome class
will be attached so let me save this and
now if I enter something here nothing is
changing why is that well that is
because it would be changing but our UI
isn't updated our UI only updates if
certain events or if events are
happening so I will add an event to my
input element here welcome to add events
and data binding in general in a
separate section in the next section so
I'm not going to go into detail but in
general an event is added by using
parentheses and between the parentheses
I add the name of the event and there
are a couple of built-in events so all
the default events like key up and then
we have again equal sign and quotation
marks and then between the quotation
marks the code which will be executed
when this event fires now we don't
really want to execute anything we just
want to catch this event so that UI
updates so I will just enter a 0 here so
that nothing happens but the UI will be
updated and if I now enter yes here you
see it got red and bold and if I write
anything else
well nothing changes so isn't that cool
that is how you can attach a class to
your document
through angular2 to to a certain part of
your document that is how easy that is
now in the next video we will have we'll
have a look at additional ways of
manipulating our HTML document our dawn
see you there bye
Hey so in the last video we had a look
at how we could conditionally attach CSS
classes we also learned how we can
import style sheets into our into
specific components with this
configuration with this metadata here
so now let's mess a little bit more with
our Dom here let's say we want to add a
button which is only enabled if we yeah
again have entered yes into our input
field so I will add this button here let
me just enter several line breaks
that'll have my button only and abled if
yes was entered so let's save this and
at the moment obviously it's always
enabled now I will use another directive
here a so called attribute eye directive
which is just a default directive with
square brackets so we have this yet
default that that's a standard that's
the most default way a directive can get
square brackets and then the name of the
directive within those square brackets
so this disabled thing here is not bound
to the disabled HTML attribute of our
button but it's an angular 2 built-in
directive so just an instruction like
every directive which tells angular 2
hey I have to disable this button if and
now here again this expression between
the quotation marks returns true this is
generally how all directives work you
have the directive name here then it
differs if you have to use square
brackets or parentheses for events you
have parentheses and for property
binding for attribute directives so
directives where you don't get an event
went but change the element you have
square brackets and this is how you can
memorize this if you have square
brackets then you're doing something to
the element you're changing the look of
it you're passing some value into it
whatever you're changing the element if
you have parentheses then you're talking
about events we're getting some
from that element we're catching some
action were listening to an event from
that element we're not changing it we're
getting something from it that's very
important
square brackets putting something into
an element parentheses getting something
out of that element very very important
that is how data binding works in
angular 2 now here I got my disabled
directive and the expression I want to
check it again if input top value equals
yes or if it is not equal to yes then I
want to disable this right so let me
save this and obviously this should be
input element so let me save it again
now you can see it is disabled now if I
enter anything well it's not changing
but if I enter yes maybe it was a little
bit hard to see but I can now click it
whereas if nothing is entered I can't
click it so this is how we could enable
a disabled button depending on the state
of another element in our Dom now let's
say we want to change the color of our
name depending on if we entered yes or
not we could again use this and attach
this awesome class but I don't want to
make bold obviously I could create a new
class but we have a number shortcut
directive light like this class
directive here where we can directly
apply a certain style so I will again
wrap this into a span element here and
then I will use this style directive
here and ask the class directive it's
not kind of classic directive not a
default attribute directive which has
this attribute styles where it name
comes from but instead we access the
style here again for dot and we want to
set the color so here we set all them
can set all the CSS properties or all
the styles how we can edit them of CSS
important thing here if we have a CSS
element where which would have a - like
background - color well then we would
have a camel case so we would have
background color with no - no space
between just with a capital B so
background capital C background that
color capital C so this is how you would
rename those CSS properties here but the
general here it should be easy to figure
out you are just setting the color and
now in this expression well I could just
write red in single quotation marks
because this has to be a string and now
it is red now I want to check if I
entered yes so I will add input element
value equals yes also in single
quotation marks well then it should be
red otherwise nothing so this is a like
a simple tertiary operator here where we
have this one line conditional check and
now we can see it is not red by default
but if I enter yes it gets red so we get
this style directive here to quickly
change the style of a certain part of
our Dom we got this class directive here
to quickly attach or detach a class to a
certain part of our Dom we got this
attribute directive here where we do
pass something into our button here
where we say you should ever be disabled
or enabled depending on whatever is
entered into this input element and this
is how we play with our Dom how we pass
data how we change it depending on what
the user does on the state of our
application and this is what we call
data binding where how we yeah basically
use our data to change the DOM and
obviously we will have a lot deeper look
throughout this course but that is
really the core of it and as you can see
it is not that difficult to get it just
requires some exercise and we will do a
lot of exercise throughout this course
see in the next videos bye
so we already covered a lot of about
components and it's almost time to have
our first little project using all that
knowledge to build a little application
first there's another thing I want to
show to you or to other things the first
thing is we're already nesting a
component here we're nesting this my
component component into a route
component the app component now let's
create another component Ted test cover
just test component test dot component
dot TS and I will again export a class
called test component and I will let me
zoom in a little bit I will add my
import so I'll import my component from
angular 2 core angular 2 it should be
and I will add my decorator
so again component pass JavaScript
object for select tour of test and a
template off well here I'm going to use
an external template HTML file so that
you can see how we do that so I will
have a template URL here and I want to
lead this to I will create a new folder
for that to a call templates and then
let's just say test dot TPL dot HTML
that's just a way I will name it I would
create that folder now here directory
will be templates so it's on the root
level and then I will have name of test
GPL HTML and here I will just have an h1
tag this is my second component
with an external HTML file so that's
that and now this test component I will
embed here at the bottom of my of my
other component of my component by using
tests and I will have to add my
directives metadata here so an area
where I then import test component
otherwise you would not be able to use
it
let me save - so you can already see
there with an external HTML file my
second component so this is how we use
external HTML files instead of writing
all our template like this in our
typescript file we can use an external
file here now that's one thing the other
thing is back to near my component here
I'm here setting my name to max and
besides the fact that I probably want to
get it dynamically in a real app or I
want to be able to input it in an input
field I Yahoo can do it like this that
we set up a default value but let's try
a different way of setting up a name
when the component starts but not
setting it up here so I will just delete
the value and just say that this should
be a string so this is types typescript
here that I'm setting this to type
string so it's not initialized yet it's
just I declared this property but it has
no value as of now now I could use my
constructor to like say this dot name
equals max and if I save this you can
see it still display max so this would
work but I don't want to use my
constructor this has several reasons in
it that's just not the best style
because yet would work for this but
let's imagine we would have an operation
which might take a little bit longer
than this would keep our whole component
from low
just because we're waiting for this
property to be set so I will use one of
the lifecycle hooks Engla to provides
four components these lifecycle hooks
are certain events which are fired
throughout life cycle four components so
whenever angle two creates a component
and it does this for this my component
because well we tell it here we need
this my component please create it we're
embedding it here so when it creates
this it's entering certain phases and
during each phase it gives us the
opportunity to do something so I'm
interested in the on init hook which is
fired when well the component is ready
to load and is initialized so I will
implement this this is an interface on
in it and make sure you import it import
on init from angular to core that's as I
said the interface which needs to be
imported now I got an arrow here because
I'm not implementing the method this
interface requires me to implement now
if you're not sure what interfaces are
it's generally a contract our class
which implements it has signed so it
MSAs okay this interface requires a blue
claw every class which implements it to
Street to have certain methods or
properties and those contracts those
interfaces are therefore used to make
sure that well for example certain
classes can interact because they now
hate this class implements this contract
I can safely call this method in this
class because it has to have it because
this interface requires is it to have it
so that's the same thing here we're
implementing on in it and then angular 2
knows well I can't execute the on init
method in this component when this
lifecycle hook is reached or this phase
in the life cycle is reached because
this interface which I'm implementing
here requires me to have the respective
method implemented so in this case
that's the on
in it the ng on innard method this will
be called when this component is
initialized now there are other
lifecycle phases which we're not
implementing and therefore angular no.2
will not try to call the respective
methods in our component because it
can't be sure that we're implementing
those methods so now this ng on in it
will be called when our component is
initialized and here is the place where
I will then set my name to mags and let
me save this and again we see nothing
changes which means it still works and
now we're setting the value of property
in this place and those lifecycle hooks
will be something we will use throughout
this course and you will use all those
hooks in your applications and there are
more hooks than chassis on init hook but
I have attached to this course a
document which shows you all the hooks
you can use and when they are kind of
fired by Inglot you now this is it for
the basics for about components how we
insert data how we use our template
expression expressions how will you stay
the binding and oh yeah we really really
really covered a lot here and I think
it's now finally time to have our first
lip project to to take what we learned
and put it into action
see you there bye
