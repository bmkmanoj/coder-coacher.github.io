introduce you to next j/s now what is
next
Jas
next j/s is a library for view j s so
let's quickly have a look at this first
what is view jeaious now i already get a
serious and a course on that which I
strongly recommend checking out before
diving into next J s but here's the
brief overview UJ s is a front-end
JavaScript framework you use it to build
single page applications or to enhance
existing multi-page applications by
controlling parts of your page or the
entire page through JavaScript and there
specifically through vue.js which gives
you a lot of helper and utility
functions that makes the creation of
front-end applications running in the
browser easier now it's a mixture of
angular and react from a syntax
perspective you could say it allows you
as I said to build widgets and single
page applications it includes a router
and a state management system view X
hence turning it or making it a real
complete framework and not just a
library for building components as react
would be one it's very lightweight
that's a huge plus of beauteous and it
is extremely popular now you might
already know all of that
so let's now dive into Knox chairs what
is that as I said it's a library
building up on beauteous and that is
super important to understand the
question of course justice why do I need
a framework for a framework if view
chairs already makes the development of
JavaScript apps easier what's the idea
behind next does it make the development
of future applications easier the answer
would be yes it simplifies the
development of view chairs applications
and not because view chess is so
difficult it actually isn't but because
there are some things which can be made
easier for example that's one major
focus of max chess D creation of
Universal apps with Universal I simply
mean apps that are also rendered on the
server now that is important to
understand as it's often misunderstood
we don't use view chess
and we also don't use next J s on the
server as we do use Express or happy or
Adonis J s or something like that it's
not a server-side framework it just
allows us to pre-render views on the fly
on the server so if you're visiting some
page in your view J s single page
application and you enter a URL
typically what you get is the index.html
file and then a single page application
where everything is rendered in the
browser now you can pre render things as
I said on the fly on the server and next
J's makes it easier more on that in a
second another thing we're next chasse
helps us and makes things easier is the
setup of routes and of the entire
project in general in noxious
applications you configure a lot simply
by creating a folder structure with
files in it for example routing as you
will see in this video you simply create
a bunch of folders and subfolders and
these will be converted into your routes
of your view application because that's
another important thing you still build
a view application in the end next
builds upon view it doesn't replace it
so we stick to the view world but gain
some extra tools and utilities so in the
end it's simplifies to development of
view apps it's totally optional and
since it mostly simplifies things during
the development it also doesn't add much
to the file size of your project so you
don't gain a lot of weight you simply
just gain a lot of features during
development while still supplying a view
app in the end with some overhead with
some extra kilobytes to be download but
also with some new capabilities like the
server-side rendering now let's dive
into all of that and let's take a closer
look at how this works in reality and
not just on the slide however there is
one more thing I want to show you on a
slide and that's the server-side
rendering part because it's so crucial
to get dead right I already said we're
building a single page application with
view Chasse so we're building an
application that runs in the
that's super important to understand
it's a client-side framework
how does server-side rendering fit in
there let's consider this case we have
our user you and you're visiting a
website which is built with UJS so you
send a request to a server by entering a
URL for example now typically you would
get back a response and if you have a
single page application that responses
the index.html file which contains your
view app it contains a bunch of scripts
importing the view app you could say
from that point on everything runs in
the browser and if you click around
under the application you never send a
new request you never send or get back a
new response or if you do this will be
behind the scenes Ajax requests and
responses so you always stay on that
index.html file and the view app the
view J's framework simply re-renders the
parts of your page that needs to be
rendered to reflect the new URL you are
now on even though it's technically the
same page now the problem with single
page applications is that if you have a
page let's say a block where you get a
lot of posts that are fetched from a
database what would happen is that you
got the index.html file with the view
app and once it starts and browser once
it runs in your browser
it starts fetching the blog posts behind
the scenes with Ajax requests and it
will render them to the screen once
they're there from a UI or from a user
experience perspective that is fine from
a search engine perspective this is
problematic because the search engine
crawler won't wait for the data to
return so all the crawler will see is an
empty page or just the spinner or
whatever you're showing there now this
is where a server-side rendering can
help you you're not creating a
server-side app you're not having a
replacement for Express or something
like that here instead the index.html
file which contains your view app can be
pre-rendered on the server for each new
request so not when you click around in
the app so when the user is using your
page but whenever a new URL is entered
and you hit Enter or you hit refresh in
your browser
and the search engine crawlers
effectively does just that it Wizards
different URLs and each URL is a brand
new fetch of your page for these
requests we can pre render the
index.html file to execute that initial
view code that should run not in your
browser but on the server that's the key
thing we pre render it on the fly upon
the request for the first load only
that's important for the first load only
thereafter we again have a single page
application running in the browser we
still have a normal view application so
if you then click around in this pre
rendered page you still send your ahx
requests and you have view manage
everything but that first request is
pre-rendered on the server you can do
that without nax che s you can find a
link to the official server-side
rendering guide of the view chess
framework in the description below but
setting it up manually is a lot of work
and not that much fun next J's helps you
with that that's exactly what next Chas
does it helps you with that free
rendering of that first initial page and
besides that whole server-side rendering
stuff it also makes the creation of your
app simpler because it uses that
configure a lot by creating folders and
files approach which we'll have a look
at so this is what next cheese does this
is what the server-side rendering does
mean here now let's take a look at let's
simply create a knock step to get a
better feeling for what happens and to
leave that world of theory here to
create a new knock step I will use
create next app which is like a CLI you
could say it is a tool which you execute
from the command line from terminal on
Mac which makes the creation of next app
simpler and it's available for order it
will work for both Mac Linux and also
for Windows of course so it works there
in all these environments you can simply
google for create next app and you
should find this github repository here
from the next community now on that get
up page you can find detailed
instructions and also installation
instructions now we will actually use a
third way of installing it which you
don't see on that page
and we will use nodejs which you need
under all circumstances because the
project created with this CLI tool here
will have a development server so that
you can preview your application and
that development server will use node.js
as a language so we need note J s and
you can get it from node.js org there
you can simply download the latest
version or the long-term stability
version if you're facing issues with the
latest one though if you don't then I
would recommend using the latest one and
we will use it for the development
server and because we're interested in
nodes package manager and p.m. which I
will use to install create next app once
you ran fruity note installer and got
npm also installed you can execute npm
install - g create next app that's the
name of the package this tool I was just
talking about and on Mac and Linux you
probably need to add a sudo from of that
to get the right permissions and when
stat is running it will download that
tool and install it globally on your
machine so you only need to execute this
command once and new second time
thereafter unless you want to update it
you can now use it anywhere on your
machine so now it was installed you can
now navigate in the terminal or command
prompt into the folder where you want to
create your next project and I already
am in this folder so I will now just run
create - knocks - app so the name of
that package we just installed my first
next app or whatever name you want to
use maybe since I want to use a very
simple recipe application I will name it
recipes but the name is up to you you
hit enter and now you're asked a couple
of questions like a project name I'll
confirm the default which you see here
between the parentheses with enter
description my awesome recipe book app
can now choose a custom server-side
framework and that can be confusing now
I said that next would not be a
replacement for Express and so on and it
isn't but you can integrate it with
Express or also with no server-side
framework in this case next we'll also
for production of not just for
development give you a node server which
you deploy because it of course needs a
node server to be able to pre-render
your pages on the fly and it only runs
on node that's also important you can't
use it with PHP or anything like that so
I will use non here I don't want to have
an average server-side framework because
I don't want to write any server-side
code here I just want to get that
pre-rendering capability so I will pick
non here now we could also choose a
custom UI framework and these are really
component libraries where we could
easily integrate things like a date
picker and so on into our project I
don't want one of these either so I will
also pick non here and now we can choose
to default rendering mode which you can
change after the project has been
created
you could still create a single page
application hence you would not use
these server-side rendering capabilities
you would still benefit from that
configure everything with files and
folders approach but I also want to get
that server-side rendering advantage or
feature so I will pick Universal here
which simply means the app then supports
both the client and the server side
though technically it still is a client
side focused app you just got that
server-side pre-rendering capability so
I will pick Universal here now next you
could automatically include Axios into
your project
Axios is a JavaScript library which you
can use to send Ajax requests but we can
also install that separately if we
wanted to so we'll hit no here you can
enable linting here I will also hit no
here and you can enter your offer name
here just to store it in a configuration
next you can choose that package manager
you want to install if you got multiple
ones installed now I also get yarn
installed but I will stick to NPM and
that will now create a new nak
project with the bare minimum settings
which are basically what you will start
with in a lot of projects so let's wait
for this to finish and I will back once
it is done so to set up finished and now
we see the commands we can execute here
so let me navigate into that newly
created folder with CD recipes and now
here we can run npm run def to start
that development server now this will
start at localhost 3000 by default it
also prints the address here and you can
now simply visit that address so i
entered it in the browser and you should
see something like the add a default
next app basically a starting screen it
gives you out-of-the-box now let me also
quickly open this in an ide I will use
wizzle's to you code here in this video
and there it should look something like
this this is the folder and file
structure and next project has
out-of-the-box and if you have worked
with view che s only thus far then this
will look quite differently the reason
for this is you still create a view
choice application but a lot of things
you had to configure and wire up
manually in your view apps mainly
related to the routing it's now done for
you the core concept of a next app which
I absolutely want you to remember is
that pages folder here in that pages
folder you create your routes by naming
your files and folders in there
appropriately every dot view file in
that pages folder will be considered as
a route and you can also nest routes and
create more complex paths by creating
subfolders let me show you what I mean
if I add an about dot u file and these
should be dot view files for normal
single file view components as you
probably know them from your own view
project if you create such about the
view file file you can simply add a
template in there and in the template
you could output an h1 tag where you say
the about page
something like that now if they save
this about dot view file and I go back
to my project here then I can go to my
URL and enter slash about now this will
load this page are just created you
might need to reload once if you just
add at that page and it will print out
the about page here so it loads this
content this view component here in the
about dot view file as my main component
through the view router behind the
scenes because I added an about dot view
file here
each fall is interpreted as a route here
index simply is the route route for just
slash nothing and slash about would be
forwarded to about dot view and I'll
turn it off by the way if I cut that
content here and remove the file an
alternative is to create a subfolder
about and in that subfolder I could
create an index of you fall again if I
now save this and I reload the previous
page then it will still work because
this yields the same result in the end a
folder is also interpreted as a path
segment and that index file in a folder
will simply be loaded if you enter
nothing else and if you got no other dot
view files in that folder and I
personally prefer this folder based
approach because I believe where I think
it makes the structure a bit more
understandable this way so this is how
you create routes and that is the second
core feature of knacks j/s we also get a
couple of our folders here which you use
for different features we will have a
look at some of them in this video but
the pages folder is the most crucial one
you create your routes through the view
router without writing any single line
of configuration code just by creating
folders and files and now if you inspect
the source code of that loaded page by
right-clicking and then viewing the page
source
then you will see that if you scroll
down that this is actually pre-rendered
you can see it here the about page now
this might look trivial because that is
what you entered here right but if you
create a normal view app without next
and you dare inspect your page source
you will basically see an empty
index.html file with a bunch of script
imports you see these script imports
here too because after the first load it
becomes a single page application but
this first page is pre-rendered on the
fly just before you read or just right
after you request it on the server as is
confirmed by the fact that the content
is in the file which you download from
the server if it would be added after
the initial load then this source code
wouldn't have been touched because
JavaScript changes are reflected in
there this is really the file you got
from the server so these are the two
main features of next the server-side
rendering and the navigation or the
routing by folders and files now let's
build up on that and let's create a very
very very simple page here where we have
some recipes to look at and if you want
to learn more about knack since I've a
bit deeper I got a whole course on that
where I walk you through the different
core features and give you a more 400
introduction to nax jeaious a link is of
course in the video description so let's
create a new subfolder in the pages
folder and let's name it recipes and in
there I'll add an index of you file now
my goal is to show very very simple
previews of recipes we could cook in in
there and if we click one we load a
detail page which will also be very
simple in this video but which will
allow us to see knacks chess in action
so in the index dot view file in the
recipes folder I'll add a template and
then that template here I well when I
display my index my recipes so at a
section may be gifted section class off
recipes and in there I want to have a
cup or a couple of article elements so
these are normal
HTML elements of course and each article
let's say could have um like a Dave
where we have a preview image could have
my h1 tag for the title and could then
maybe have a paragraph where we have
some nice review text now since we're
creating a normal view application and
you view component here in the index
don't you file we can of course also add
some styles and we can add the sculpt
keyword to scope the styling we set up
here to just this component and
therefore to this page so in there I now
want to add my recipes class which I'm
referencing and in the template and in
there I will have my article which is
just a recipe and actually I also want
to style that and let's say a recipe has
a very simple style box sizing of border
box to make sure the width and so on is
correct give it a width off let's say
two hundred and eighty pixels maybe give
it a padding of eight pixels give it a
border of one pixel solid and a light
gray maybe and some box shadow of zero
then two pixels as a second value then
maybe two peg pixels again and a darker
gray
darker gray like this and the exact
styling is of course totally up to you
now if we take a very quick look at
slash recipes like this and for the
first time you need to reload this page
this is what it will look like now I
want to have an image above it and of
course I'm gonna have multiple recipes
so let's quickly copy that recipe here
add it below the first one and save that
file you get life updating here always
make sure you keep that process running
by the way which you started with NPM
run death so now we get a second recipe
and I want to position them next to each
other so I'll give the wrapping recipes
container here a display of Flex to use
flexbox
and set flex flow to row and give it
also the wrap property to make sure we
wrap the content if our page with
doesn't suffice so if we are in a
smaller page this will automatically
wrap to have very basic responsive
styling here okay so these are the two
basic recipes now want to have an image
so let's quickly search for food and
feel free to pick any image that looks
delicious to you so we'll grab the URL
if this image which looks quite tasty
and I want to use it as a background
image for that div in my recipe here so
why don't we give that if you're in both
instances a class of thumbnail and then
also inline style which we can later set
dynamically if you want to which sets a
background image where we set some URL
like this and simply reference the URL
now we can style the thumbnail class
here to position that background image
correctly
by setting background position to center
and background size maybe to cover now
if we save this and we go back to our
application we still don't see anything
because what we also need to do is set a
width of 100% and the height off let's
say 200 pixels if we do that and we go
back we see our image there now this is
now my preview image of that recipe the
recipe itself could also use some margin
to have some distance to the next recipe
in my opinion so let's add a margin of
10 pixels to all directions looks better
and of course I won't have a different
image for the second recipe so let's
search one other image maybe some no not
this one this one looks quite good so
with
like that let's go back and add it to
this URL and as I said we can of course
set to stun emily by binding the style
property just as you can do it in any
view app and with that we got this
exchange so this is taking shape now one
thing I want to do in the recipes here I
want to change the positioning so I'll
set justify content which is a flexbox
property to center and align items also
to the center to Center them
horizontally and vertically in their
flex box not on the entire page so this
gives me this look so this looks quite
nice now one thing we can of course do
in next apps - and that is something I
definitely want to show you we can of
course still create normal view
components which are not used as pages
to construct our app from them for dad
we got this components folder and we
already start with a logo component now
let's get rid of that and let's create a
new dot view file in there so just an
ordinary view component as we used it in
the pages folder components in the
components folder however will not be
treated as routes but as normal
components which you can use anywhere
else in your next application once you
will register them so here I will create
my recipe dot view file and let's follow
the styling convention and name this
recipe like that and in there I got a
template - of course and in this
template I now want to use this markup
which I used in my index observed view
file in the recipes folder so the code
for one single recipe essentially this
is now what I enter in this template
here now the image the title and their
preview text that is something which I
expect to get from outside from the page
so what I'll do is I will add a script
section which we could have also added
to the components and the pages folder
of course you're just treating on the
normal view component now in this script
section here I'll add a props key here
to define the props this component
expects
and I will use the very short version
here I expect to get a thumbnail I
expect to get title and a preview text
now with that setup we can output this
with the normal tools view gives us
because that's really important to
understand you're creating a view app so
you use the same syntax here you just
got some extra helpers in the form of
nexts features so you're all out put the
preview text and for the title here I'll
output the title property referring to
this prop and for the image here I'll
bind style here to a dynamic value to a
JavaScript object where I got background
image using camelcase since we're now
entering some JavaScript snippet and in
here and close the object at the end and
here the URL is now something which I
get dynamically first of all this has to
be a string now because it is a
JavaScript value assigned to this
property in this object so URL like this
and then I escape here and close it and
in here I want to enter my thumbnail and
closing and close it in this URL and we
need to close that string after the
closing parenthesis so now we're
assigning a dynamic value to this
background image which we in turn pie
but bind and this object to the style
property and now we get a reusable
component which you can use by
registering it in our recipes page in
there to register it I'll also add a
script section like this and now I can
simply import it by writing import
recipe from and now in next projects one
of the utilities it gives you you can
use at to refer to the root folder and
therefore next slash components slash
recipe and omit the dot view this gives
you direct access to this recipe
component which you can now register on
the components key and your view object
here and your view component instance
object
so here under components I can register
recipe like that this allows us to use
recipe in the template here so I replace
the article with just recipe a
self-closing element if you want soon
and there we can pass the thumbnail now
for dad would have been nice to keep the
image link so let's quickly do that
scrap that link again and now do the
changes and now reference thumbnail and
set that link and let's put this over
multiple lines to keep it readable we
can also set a title here like delicious
pizza and a preview text which could be
awesome pizza yeah it's really
descriptive as you can see now we can
repeat that for second recipe here let's
grab that URL that image URL and you
stat here and now this is not a Pisa
this is some sea food sell it or
something like that or is it I don't
know it's something like that so seafood
sell seafood salad very tasty indeed
let's remove that article so now we're
mixing next with something which we
already know reusable components we know
how to use them in a view app don't we
make sure to save all files and if you
now return got an error regarding logo
which is still important in the main
index file let's remove it there can
actually clear can actually clear the
entire stuff down there to style the
script and remove the content here and
the section so if you save that updated
fowl we got that now the image is
missing what's broken here let's quickly
have a look we got our font nail and
we're binding background image to the
URL here and the problem I have of
course is to styling get the styles for
the recipe in recipes indexed of you
let's cut them from there the recipe in
the thumbnail and go to the recipe
recipe dot view file and add them there
of course also scope them and now enter
the styles and there save that file and
now we're back to where we already were
so now we're having the two recipes here
on that page we're out putting them
there now what if we want to click on
one of them and then see the details
page for Dad we might want to go to
something like slash recipes slash one
for the ID one now you can also have
dynamic paths in Knox jeaious by adding
a subfolder underscore that is important
part the underscore in the name of the
folder where the file signals to next
that the part after it will be some
variable some dynamic parameter by which
you can extract what the user entered so
something like maybe ID underscore ID
and there I again create an index dot
view file and in that file for now I'll
simply output a paragraph where I just
want to output the ID the user entered
and since it uses the normal view router
behind the scenes you can reference
dollar sign route that is an object
automatically made available by view
also in normal view apps where you use
the router by the way and there you will
have a parent's object and now I can
enter or excess ID on that parents
object because that folder is named ID
the underscore isn't is ignored it just
signals to next that this is a dynamic
segment and then you enter the name in
this case Rd by which you plan on
extracting that parameter and route
parents is just a default object given
to you by the view chess router which
next uses as I said with that if we save
that file and we go manually for now to
recipes one then I'll put one year maybe
it's hard to see but there is a one that
is that dynamic segment I was referring
to now this gives us the opportunity of
loading this dynamically
so in here we could have a section class
single recipe and in there let's say we
have a h1 tag
where I want to output the title then I
let's say when an output div where I
have my my image and blow dad I have a
paragraph with the recipe description
and you can of course always enter more
details now with that we got a very
basic page here without any styling so
let's quickly add some styling with
normal CSS single recipe here I'll again
use flexbox to give it some styling so
this play is set to flex and then I'll
set the justify content property to
center to center everything again and so
I do for aligned items to Center this
too now with that we get some very basic
styling which we can always find you
later I also want to align all the text
in the center so let's quickly enter
text align center tube and let's maybe
gift is padding of 30 pixels if we want
you and now let's make sure we can reach
that page without having to enter it
manually so here on the index dot view
file in the recipes folder where we got
our recipes I want to get forwarded to
that detail page if we click one of the
recipes now for dad let's simply assume
that each recipe here all the receives
an ID may be one for the first one and
two for the second one and in reality we
would of course get that recipe data
from a database where we probably also
have IDs for all the recipes here it's
hard coded but that's just a simple
example here so we got ID one and ID two
here and with that I want to output it
of course I want to output the idea or
to be precise I want to output a link
which uses that ID so back in the recipe
dot view file here first of all I'll add
a new prop which I expect so I'll expect
the ID prop which we just added and
we'll wrap this entire article in a link
however not in a normal link not in an
anchor tag which I write manually but in
the next link object or component now
that is s the name suggests made
available by next and it used the view
router router link behind the scenes in
the end what this does or how this works
is you enter a tube property with a puff
you want to navigate to now here I will
bind this dynamically by adding a colon
and then I want to go to slash recipes
this should be a string because we're
binding to a JavaScript expression with
the colon here slash recipes slash and
then it will add the ID now with that if
we save this it looks ugly because of
the styling but you can already see the
link and if I click on the first one I'm
taken to the detail page and the same
will be the case for the second one so
this works fine one thing I do notice is
the styling is a bit off we should set
Flex flow in that single recipe page to
column Q not put it next to each other
but below each other so now we got the
recipe detail pages and you can see that
we can go there with a dynamic path
parameter by using that underscore in
the folder name so with all that setup
we got a way of navigating around here
in our simple application now of course
we can enhance the styling in the recipe
that view file and the components folder
there I simply want to change my link
and behind the scenes it will use a
normal anchor tag so we can style that
so in that normal enter tag I want a
disabled text decoration so set this to
non and I'll set the color to black
still to not have that blue text now
it's still clickable but it looks a bit
nicer so now we can go to the detail
pages now to output something on the
detail pages we simply need to load our
data now we could use view X you can use
view X and next applications to
a link to instructions on how to use it
can be found in the video description or
of course also in that course I
mentioned earlier in this video I want
to load data from the server it just
asked the initial list of recipes now we
don't do that yet so for now let's
hard-coded but I'll soon add a way of
loading this dynamically so for now I
simply want to output the ID here so
that we can really see a difference by
accessing dollar sign route again this
is provided by the normal view router
params which is a default object or
property of that dollar sign route
object and now ID because the folders
name underscore ID now if there we can
at least see a difference if we click on
that we see two for that recipe and one
for the other one now as I said a second
ago
in reality you would not hard code this
you would load it from a server right
and this is what I also want to do here
or at least what I want to fake we can
add a special method and let's start
with the recipes page there in our
script we can add the async data method
now you might know the normal data
method from your old view apps data was
a property a method where you return an
object which holds data with which you
want to initialize your component and
that good heart code my recipes in there
nothing wrong with that
however in next apps which are
server-side rendered you get async data
as well a sync data is a special method
it's comparable to the normal data it
also initializes your component with
some data but a sync data is actually
executed on the server as well so if
you're in single page mode and you're
clicking around it's executed with each
click on the client but if you're
sending a request for a page for the
first time as explained at the beginning
of this video then you will actually
execute the code on the server to fetch
all the data which
needs to be rendered on the page in
advance on the server before returning
the page so that you can pre render the
page with the data on the server and
sent back the finished page to the user
and then this example here I won't reach
out to a server I will still hard-code
some curse um well code in here but you
could simply replace this with an access
call or whatever
Ajax library you want to use so you
could install Axios import access and
then make a get request and the
important thing is if you have something
like a promise like here for a get
request you should return it and next
will automatically wait for this promise
to be resolved take the resolved value
and take it if it's an object which it
should be as the initial value or the
initial data for this component now here
I'm not using access and I'm not using a
server but I want to show this still so
I will simply create a new promise on my
own as you probably know a promise tags
a function as an argument where we in
turn have two arguments which reject and
excuse me resolve and reject and you
execute these inside of the promise to
either resolve or reject it now here I
will use the normal set timeout method
and set a timeout to let's say one and a
half seconds and after that time this
arrow function here will get executed
and in this arrow function I simply want
to resolve some data and this is really
just some code I use to fake an
asynchronous request to fake that we
would fetch this data from a server so
in there I resolve a JavaScript object
with let's say a recipes property the
name is up to you which might be an
array and in that array I want to have
my objects and again this is really just
some dummy data which you normally of
course would fetch from a server now in
there you might have an ID could be
anything could be a number a long string
something like this here and you will
have a T title so here I will use the
delicious pizza title
you will also have your preview text of
course which is a string so Hiro will
also use to preview text from above and
you will have your thumbnail like that
so let's wrap this hump nail LinkedIn
now of course we have two recipes here
so let's also enter the second one there
I will grab the title which a hard-coded
into my template from the template I
will also grab the hard-coded preview
text and it will also grab the
hard-coded image URL so now this is all
coming as it would come from a server in
the form of a JavaScript array and since
I returned that promised an async datum
next we'll wait for this promise to
resolve or to fail and will then merge
the data which you resolve so this
object with the data your component has
anyways now here we don't have any other
data we could have and it would be
merged here however this will be our
entire component data the key thing is
in our template we can use that data
because the template will only be
rendered once this fetching is done so
there will be a recipes property which
we can reference in our template that
means we can remove the second recipe
and for the first one I'll use v4 and
loop through all my recipes in the
recipes property so recipe here the name
that is up to you you can name it
whatever you want could be R could be
recipe recipes here however is coming
from the data of that component and in
our case that has to be recipes because
we get back an object with a recipes
property which will become our component
data eventually so now we all should
assign a key and here it will just use
recipe ID each recipe has an ID don't
forget and now we can really just bind
all these values to the dynamic values
we're fetching so in this case to recipe
thumbnail referring to that thumbnail
property we added and the
same of course for title and preview
text so for title its recipe title and
we should bind it dynamically therefore
for ID its recipe ID and for preview
text it's there for recipe preview text
like that if we now save all files and
we reload this page we should still see
our recipes however if we reload it
takes one-and-a-half seconds because
this is pre rendered on the server you
can best see it if I open my url bar and
I click the Refresh icon you see it
spins and spins and here the data is
because it waits for this promise to
resolve
now let's fake the same on our detail
page so I'll copy the async data
function here and add it to a script in
the ID indexed of view file so there
I'll also add a sync data also have a
promise to fake a real request where we
get data and here of course I resolve a
single recipe so I resolve an object
which will become my component data
which just has a recipe property and
that should be the recipe we load it so
here of course we got two possible
recipes we could fetch the one with ID
one with just a delicious pizza and
Diablo 1 and to make this simple because
I don't send a real request to a server
where I could send my route parameter
the IDE to the server to only get back
one recipe I will actually keep the full
original code where I get both recipes
but I want you filter for the recipe
which matches my route ID so I will
still only get a recipe here but I got
an array here to which I will chain the
find method a default JavaScript array
method find takes a function as an
argument which will be executed on
every object or element in that array in
this case two elements so it will then
execute this function with each element
and receive that element as an input to
the function and you should return true
if that is the element you wanted to
find and it will then return this
element so recipe will only be one of
the two elements here I want to return
the element where the ID each element
has an ID property don't forget is equal
to the ID we entered in our URL now in
async data we actually can't access
dollar signed route because the view
component hasn't been fully loaded yet
and hence this has not been made
available yet but an async data you get
a special argument passed into by next
chess the context argument context has a
couple of convenience properties holds a
lot of useful information you can find a
link to the API documentation in the
video description and in this case
context has a parent's property which
holds the parents it can parse from your
URL in this case I'm interested in the
ID param and only if that matches the ID
of an object here in the array this will
be returned as their recipe which was
loaded so now I can output that here I
can output recipe title here and here I
don't just want to have the preview text
but the full description text so let's
quickly add a new property to both
objects description text this is really
a delicious meal and yes it's the same
text for both recipes but just for demo
purposes so now we can output that here
at the paragraph we can output recipe
description text and for the image I
want to bind this dynamically to recipe
thumbnail and alt could also be bound
dynamically to recipe title
now if we reload that page we got our
recipe here with a rather big image so
maybe we can do something about the size
here recipe image as a class can be
added to the image and now we can go
down to the size and style the recipe
image here in the stalls to get it I
give it a width of 100% and maybe see
how that looks like it's still very big
but this is fine in my opinion for a
starter now this is the delicious pizza
and if I go back and I load the seafood
sell it it still takes one-and-a-half
seconds because async data has that
promise which resolves only after one
and a half seconds and then I see the
seafood sell it looks very good to me so
now this is a very simple recipe page
and you always see that waiting time
because we're faking that HTTP request
we're doing which runs either in the
client if we're clicking around or on
the server if we enter a URL for the
first time and with that we get a very
basic next application showing its core
features server-side rendering and also
the you configure folders and files and
I will give give you the rest approach
now to finish this very basic app up
I'll add a second component in the
components folder and this will be my
header dot view file to have a little
navigation bar there I will just add a
template with a header component and in
there I'll have a nav component with an
unordered list with two list items and
each list item I want to use a next link
the first one goes to the starting page
the second one goes to my recipes and
actually I guess we have a third one to
the about page and now we add the two
linked to all of them now for the first
one it's just slash for the starting
page for the second one it's recipes and
here it's slash about referring to the
next review file for just
/ - recipes in next of you for / recipes
and - about the next review for / about
now of course we need some styling here
so let's add some sculpt styling here to
style our header appropriately maybe
make sure that it has a width of 100% a
height of 30 pixels maybe let's set
display to flex and center everything
with justify content center and align
items Center and let's then also add
some styling to the unordered list let's
set the list stall
jinan remove all petting and margin and
also give it a display of flex to
position the individual links next to
each other by also adding justify
content and then maybe
Center to and align items also centered
and now let's go to the list items
themselves and let's each give a margin
of 0 to top and bottom but 10 pixels to
left/right to get some spacing between
the items and now let's use that header
and here's a special trick we could
include it in any page but of course all
these pages should share the header and
that is where layouts come into play
each next page is loaded into this
default layout in the position of this
next hook here and you can also set up
some general app styles and the default
of you fall I will keep the ones which
were set up but you can of course set
this to your settings or clean it up the
thing is you can add a script section in
this layouts default of you fault you
and by the way you should keep that foul
because default the view is something
Knox will look for as the default layout
you guessed it and in here I will import
my header from at slash components
header and I will then add components
your header like this and add my header
with a capital H to not use the default
header here now if you save all files
you get the header at the top and you
can indeed navigate around to the
different pages know just saw the about
page can use some styling let's add some
stalls here queue and simply set some
text alignments
here for the h1 tag but the cool thing
is now we got our nice header we can
give it a background color of maybe five
to one seven five one like this and now
also style our anchor tags here in our
header to have a text decoration of non
and color of white maybe so this looks
now much better and now with that we
have an application where we can
navigate around get a header on each
page and where we take advantage of the
core features of next clearly this is
not the most beautiful application you
ever build and clearly next has to offer
way more than that but these are the
core basics which I wanted to show you
and I hope that this helps you getting
started with next now if you wanna dive
deeper you may have a look at my more
thorough introduction course on udemy or
additionally at the really good official
Knox documentation which you can find
our noxious org there you find details
about all the different features how to
use and configure them and also about
features which I didn't show in this
video I hope you got started with that
video though and and of course be more
than happy to welcome you in future
videos to hopefully see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
