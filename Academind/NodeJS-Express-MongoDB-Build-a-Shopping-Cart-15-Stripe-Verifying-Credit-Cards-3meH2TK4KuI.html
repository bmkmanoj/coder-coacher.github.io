first step is to validate the credit
card data a user enters here because of
course it's very easy for a user to
enter invalid credit card data here and
validating that on our own would be
pretty difficult because well you might
not be aware of the algorithms used to
validate if a credit card number is
valid is valid taking into account the
expiration date and so on good thing is
stripe does all that for us so the first
step is to sign in or sign up if you
don't already have an account with them
and once you did this I'll well come
back so I signed in to stripe and as you
can see I already got some charges here
though these are all test charges sins
and that's important my account is in
test mode you can see it here at the
upper left and you should make sure that
your account is in test mode too so that
you can test without any well issues now
of course you may play around and
definitely check out the stripe page and
documentation as this is no serious
about stripe I will show you the basics
you need to make charges when credit
cards but to learn more and learn how to
use it definitely have a look at the
official documentation there and as you
can see we get the documentation link
there and I'll just open this in a new
tab because it's really has a great
documentation starting with this getting
started example which really guides you
through the basic steps you need to
implement to well-validated data and
make a charge and actually this will be
pretty much what we're going to do next
so what I will do is I want you create
this credit card validation logic and
for this I will use the stripe SDK which
basically is a Java Script package I
import into my application not on the
back end in the front end and this SDK
will then grab the form the values there
send it to the stripe server validate it
and give me back the result off this
validation so it does all of that for me
indeed it will actually stop the actual
form submission which would of course
result on a request being sent to my own
server and wait for the validation
result to come back sounds a bit strange
while you're going to see all of that
soon the very first step is to import
the stripe SDK into your application so
to the front end so in the documentation
you may scroll down to stripe dot KS
here and this will lead you through all
the steps required here first one is to
grab this import which will use a CDN so
you don't need to download anything here
and then back in your application head
over to the checkout hvs file and at the
very bottom you may add this import
that's the first step the next step is
to go into your public folder the java
scripts folder and then here i will
create a new file which i'll call
checkout touches so this is a javascript
file which will run on the front end not
on the back and it's not running on my
noches server i also want to import this
checkout JS file and i will do so after
importing the stripe sdk so I will just
duplicate this import and here I want to
point use source Java scripts check out
HPS now here is an important adjustment
we have to make though in this file I
will use jQuery to basically fetch the
data from my form and the problem I do
have is in my layout file which wraps
all my views if you remember this I do
import jQuery at the bottom after my
body hook here so it will be imported
after whatever view gets entered here
the issue I have is I want to use jQuery
in this script here though but this will
get imported in this place in this body
place so I would then try to use jQuery
even though I only import jQuery after
using
I hope that's clear now fixed us what I
will do is I will crap this whole import
this cheque re-import and just place it
right before inserting the body here and
this is just a solution to make sure
that I have jQuery actually available
another solution of course would be to
leave jQuery at the bottom and import
this part here in the layout of Shaker
II but then you would have to make sure
that you're not trying to fetch data
which isn't there yet so either way some
adjustment is needed I'm going to go
with this way by importing jQuery before
the view so with that I'm ready to
actually populate my check out dot J's
file and fetch the data from my credit
card form to then validated through
stripe now for that it's actually pretty
simple
back to the stripe documentation
stroller still at the stripe touch as
file we can't just go through this
article from top to bottom as it says
here the next part is to set the
publishable key that is required because
when stripe validates the credit card
data it will give us back a token if the
data is valid and this token will
basically hold the credit card data and
it will be encrypted with our
publishable key with that key we will
later on be able with Nava key with our
private key we will later on be able on
the server to decrypt this credit card
information and make the actual charge
that's the Stu step process validation
and then charging now we do need this
key here to encrypt the data to make
sure that we don't make or that no other
person is able to well do something with
some cross-site scripting attack or
anything like that to send us a wrong
charge which we would then make on our
back-end therefore we do have the two
key is to make sure that we're only
making charges which are really issued
from our own page using this key so
therefore I will set this key now if
you're locked in this key here is no
example here that's your actual testing
and you can have a look at your keys in
your dashboard if you click on account
settings and then API keys now here I
plort it out in my little video I will
leave it like this here I'll clearly
visible to everyone because I can
recreate my keys which I will do after
this video so here you have the secret
key the one you will need later on for
decrypting your your chart or your
credit card information this is the
publishable key you saw in the
documentation and now that you live keys
are pretty much the same but for the
life environment remember we're in the
testing environment so enough the
talking I'm going to grab this key here
go back to my check out edge check out a
chase file and paste it in there at the
top and I can't do this because I'm
importing this check out chase file
after the stripe SDK which introduces
this stripe object which I'm using here
so even though my IDE doesn't know it I
know that this will be available the
next step is to actually trap the
foreign values and if I go on in the
stripe documentation you'll see we get
some code here cube so we can't just use
this code though I need a little bit
more than just this code I need to grab
my actual form so that it can also stop
submission and so I've also store this
in a variable which I named dollar sign
form then we'll use jQuery to select
this check out form and that's just an
ID I assign here in my check out dot HBS
view this ID here that is the ID by
which I'm selecting the form here next
I'm using this form variable Q add a
submit listener here that's just jQuery
code here with the submit method I'm
making sure that this method gets
executed whenever I submit the form and
or that this callback function here gets
executed whenever I submit the form so
there's only the function getting
executed and in here what I want to do
is I want to first use my form again and
find this button in the form there is
only one button
just a submit button here I want to set
the disabled property to true so I want
to disable the button I'm doing this so
that the user can't submit the form
multiple times while validation is going
on next I will go back to the stripe
documentation grab this code here and
paste it in here
now I need to make some adjustments
though for one I'm not fetching the
address but what I will fetch is name
and the only really required fields are
the first four so you don't need to pass
the name you didn't need to pass the
address you could just leave it out but
for completeness sake and also for later
lectures or videos in this series I will
also fetch the name here for now now of
course it might be worth adding the
address later on too but I'll go with
that for now now card number card CVC
card expiry month and year these are all
the IDS I am using in my HPS in my view
file here so these are the IDS setup
here a card name card number and so on
I also do have my card holder name which
is card name so that's the one thing I
need to change here instead of address
if I do have card name and that's
something I need to change in all the
other fields - I'm not using classes I'm
using IDs so replace the dot with the
hashtag sign with that I'm fetching all
the values from my HTML form and I'm
calling this stripe card create token
function again function ships
shipping with the stripe SDK now this
function has the data as a first
argument and the second argument is the
response handler which will get executed
once that is done validating my data I
will also add a return false statement
here to make sure that the form
submission which is triggered when I
click the button and then triggers this
jQuery function here that this form
submission has actually stopped and does
continuous so that it doesn't actually
send a request to my server yet because
I don't want to do that
I haven't validated it yet therefore I
certainly don't want to submit it to the
server yet so the next step of course is
to create this function this stripe
response handler the callback function
we're looking through for here as a
second argument now this callback
function will get a status and the
response and how do I know that well
have a look at the official
documentation here you will see this
response handler and again we can
basically copy this though we don't need
this form code here we already got it
through jQuery but it will copy all the
rest paste it in here and what are we
doing here while we're checking if we
actually got an error in our response
which would mean that probably our form
is invalid or our credit card data is
invalid then we try to show some error
messages that won't work as of now we
have to do something here and we
re-enable the submission so we enabled e
submit button again remember I'm setting
it to disable true here at the top when
we clicked it now if we fail I certainly
want to enable it again so that the user
may fix his errors if we don't have a
response error while in this case we're
creating or bird getting the token which
stripe created for us and this token can
chests be fetched on the response object
which gets passed into this callback and
here on the ID property that's just a
property available due to the stripe SDK
being added to our project and then I
add something to the form I use jQuery
to add it I add a hidden input field
which has the name stripe token and
wedge which gets this token which
tickets got generated through stripe as
a value so like with the CSRF protection
which also used a hidden input field he
were also while adding this token which
was created which holds the encrypted
credit card information to the form so
that when it actually gets sent to the
server and that's what is happening in
the next and last step here where we
actually submit the form to the server
then so once we do this we pass this
encoded credit card information orders
encoded and validated credit card
information to the server - and here's
the point I was talking about earlier we
encrypted this with our well key so that
we can then decrypt it with our private
key and if these two keys match or if
the they are matched through the stripe
algorithm then the charge is made but
I'll come back to charging later on for
now let's go back to the error case
where I wanted to show an error I get
this payment errors filled here but that
won't work now in my check out HBS file
I don't have any place to show some
errors so let's work on that I will add
a new div right below the total heading
here and this should get an ID of charge
error let's say and I will give this
some bootstrap classes like alert and
then alert danger just to make this red
and clearly visible and then here I want
to output any or error
I might have now for now of course I
don't have an error but in the checkout
dot J's file I might add one indeed I'm
trying to do this here where I find this
but of course here I have to find charge
error this is the ID I just created
right charge error that's the idea
assigned here so I'm selecting this and
I want to set a text which should be my
error message I'm just accessing this on
my stripe objects here and also I kind
of want to make sure that I only show
this message if we well do have an error
so I will go back to the view and add
another class here which I will call
hidden that's a bootstrap class which
will basically hide this element which
you can see if I reload my checkout page
right now you don't see any special
Divya right so because it was hidden and
if I just to show this if I remove the
hidden class well you would see this
empty red alert
so let's reintroduce the hidden class
here but only check out chairs file what
I want to make what I want to do is I
want you well find this charge error
here and then well I'm already setting
the text but I also want to remove a
class here I want to remove the hidden
class because I want to show it right
and with that I'll be able to actually
show validation errors now with all of
that being in place that should really
work so if I reload this page again and
I hit by now well I get the default
validation going on because I additi
required attributes so what I will do
here is I will add Chris a test address
this should also be Chris and regarding
the credit card number I'll first work
with a wrong one and then let me add
some dummy data here like this
if I click buy now now I'm getting an
error and the reason is that in my check
out HBS file
well I'm linking to source JavaScript's
well that doesn't exist in the public
folder I can directly access Java
scripts and that of course also it helps
to name this to a is not HBS there is
also one other change I want to make as
I just realized this when I had a look
over this check out HBS file in my check
out chess I'm trying to find the charge
error on well inside my form but
actually this is placed outside of the
form right so what I will do here is I
will remove form find and well just
selected through jQuery directly like
now with all that in place if I now go
back to the page here and we'll reload
this and I re-enter my test stay down
and keep in mind that I'm on purpose
entering valid invalid credit card data
right here if I now hit by now you see I
get the error here if I do fetch valid
data like for example the one year D
stripe documentation on the getting
started article here we get a valid
credit card number which we may use for
testing purposes and for testing you may
use any credit card number with any
validation excuse me expiration year
which lies in the future at any free
card code if I now heat hit this you see
we get does not found error which is
great because now I'm trying to send
request to the server and there I'm
trying to access the check out route
with a post request which doesn't exist
yet so even though this is an error it
technically means it works so we're
almost there ready to make a charge one
little bit of fine tuning I'm gonna add
here is I want you also at the hidden
class here when we first try to submit
this form so if we did have any errors
before I want to clear them now and
therefore add the hidden class again so
that once we had to submit the second
time it disappears and if we got errors
we see new errors instead of the old
ones great so with that we're ready to
make charge we validated the credit card
data through stripe through stripe
servers and with that well time to make
the next step and actually use our
server-side code to charge our customer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
