learned a lot about bootstrap over the
last videos off the series in this video
we'll have a look at bootstrap forms
we'll have a look at not just how we
style forms in a beautiful way like this
but also how we validate them and make
sure that we provide good user feedback
to ensure our users can really work with
our forms in the way we want them to
work with them so let's dive right into
that and let's start adding some forms
to our bootstrap project
so back in the project let's add some
forbs now for that I'll go back to where
we already did some work and here we
have that alert and that modal button
from the last video of the series now
I'm going to get rid of all of that I'm
even going to get rid of my grid here so
of that entire death and yeah as I just
said I'll also get rid of my modal so
that's the code with which I want to
start just in navigation and D Script
imports and now let's add a form with
bootstrap
now how do we add forms it's actually
pretty straightforward first of all we
add the form element not strictly
required for bootstrap but semantically
it makes sense to create a HTML form I
guess and in there a typical form
obviously has some inputs let's say we
add an input element type text and we
could give that some name like maybe
user name whatever you want to fetch
eventually with that input and we could
have another input maybe off type
password and we could well fetch the
user password so this would be like a
typical
standard form now we probably also want
to have some labels to give the user an
idea of what we actually want to get so
we could add a label here for an element
with the ID user name so let's add that
ID here too and this is not required by
bootstrap this just semantically makes
sense whoops here and let's add another
label in front of the password for an
element with the ID password so let's
add this ID here to this four attribute
here simply ensures that screen readers
can understand
- which input this label relates now we
should put some content between the
label opening and closing tags so here
we want to fetch the user name and here
we want to get the password let's say if
we save all of that and we go back to
our page and reload it this is what we
end up with not super pretty in my
opinion we most of
time one a stylist a bit differently and
bootstrap actually makes styling this
differently really simple the easiest
way of giving our elements a more
foreign like look or a nicer look is by
adding a class to our inputs the form
control class so for my username input
I'll add class equal form
whoops form control like this and I'll
add the exact same class to the password
field only to these I didn't add
anything to the labels at this point of
time now if we reload we already see a
drastic change
now our inputs look nicer they got this
nice animated or yeah this nice outline
here we click into him we got some
padding inside of there they got rounded
corners and a slight gray border and the
most obvious change of course is that
they now take the full width of the
screen that is super important this
clearly is not entirely the style we
want to have here but it allows us to
create a nice style in conjunction with
the grid for example or with some other
code that restricts the size of the
surrounding container for example if we
would give the surrounding form here an
inline cell which of course is bad but
just for demonstration purposes off
let's say free or let's say 500 pixels
and a margin of auto if we assign this
to the form element and we reload then
we have a nicely centered form like this
and obviously instead of using that on
inline Styles we could simply create a
helper class and assign that to our
surrounding form so this is a quick and
easy way of getting a nice input styling
and this already looks quite nice in my
opinion now we can also assign our form
control class to select inputs so if we
add another label here where we want to
find out which gender our user has and
we then add a select drop down here
gender ID gender let's say then we
typically populate this with a couple of
options so
this is all just a regular HTML code
there we could have mail and we also
have female so let's stick to the two
traditional ones here and with that we
got a nice drop down if we reload this
is our drop down now this clearly
doesn't fit the style of the other
inputs though we can as I just said also
add our class here this form control
class to death select element and that's
important to the Select element not to
the options if we added like this and we
now reload now we also have that select
element in that style
now what about checkboxes and radio
buttons well we can style these too so
let's quickly go back to the HTML code
and in there let's add an hour input
which is of type checkbox where we also
of course want to add a label which
shows the text after the checkbox here
and there we could maybe say except -
terms and give that here an ID off
except terms like this and then we could
simply say accept terms and conditions
with an ampersand ampersand here reload
and then we got our checkbox here with
the default in my case Mac style now
again this might not entirely be the
style you want to have and you can't add
a class to ensure that its child is
styled properly let's add a class to the
checkbox input and here the class is 4
and - check - input if we add this class
to teach checkbox input and we reload
still doesn't look perfect it's it's
been moved a bit to the left and it
looks even worse than before
we also need to add a class to the label
for checkbox elements we add a class
form check label to the label if we do
that and we reload doesn't look that
much better because we need one
additional class which actually has to
be added to a wrap
element most of the time simply add if
so let's add a div and let's give that
div a class of form - check so for a
checkbox and the same for radio buttons
we should group the label and the
checkbox or the radio button which
belong together in a wrapping div which
has that form check clasp and then we
add the different classes for the input
and for the label now with that in place
if we now reload the page now this looks
better now one thing that's important
I'm zoomed in here so that you can see
everything nice and clean if i zoom out
to 100% then I actually have the default
bootstrap stats that get applied assume
then this is not really the case which
is why there it looks like that before
if I view it in the real size that your
users would see it and in the end then
we got this nice bootstrap style so with
that we got a checkbox at it and four
radio buttons it's essentially the same
the same approach the same way you add
styles and classes all with the form
check CSS classes you at hatch this is
the simple way of creating a form or
styling of form in 24min puts now
sometimes you need a bit more control or
you wanna well control the layout a bit
more and for dad you can group labels
and inputs let me show you how this
works you can add a div and that div can
receive a class of form group now you
would take your label and input that you
which belong together
and put them inside of such a form group
if you do that and you then save that so
here I only wrapped the first pair into
a div if you save that and reload now
you see the thing that happened
basically is a little bit more margin
was added at the bottom of that group to
separate it a bit more from the
following element which often is what
you want so if I repeat this again div
with a class of form group and then I
take my second pair of label and input
and I put it in there and I do it one
last time for
that if your or for that select
drop-down I should say and put dad and
your tube then we got a little bit of a
cleaner form with more distance between
the elements which often well leads to a
battery user experience leads turn
eyesore stall which you want so grouping
elements with form group is not required
but something you can do if you want to
separate the different well groups of
form inputs a bit more from each other
so this is a nice basic way of styling
forms now before we move on to
validation styles so to show errors and
so on or buttons let me also show you a
different way of styling this right now
we get everything structured beneath
each other and often that is the look
you want but let's say we now also add
two new groups here at the top of the
form maybe a group for our first name
and a group for our last name so I
simply changed everything to first and
last name if we go back we got two new
fields nothing wrong with these but
maybe you want to position them next to
each other and how would you do that
well you can achieve this with the help
of the bootstrap grid you already learn
about what you can of course do you can
go into your phone and now I will remove
that inline style you can go into your
form and in there let's add a normal row
you can also add in a container but as I
said in the grid video the container
class is actually not required so we can
just add a row here and in that row we
could add a column and in that column we
could add our first form group and then
we add another column next to it where
we add our second form group now with
that if we just quickly restructure this
code if we now reload we got full screen
with again because I removed that inline
style that restricted the width but you
also see that the first two elements are
now in a
next to each other and we still have
that nice margin to the bottom so to the
other element because that still is in
its form group as our elements in the
row here art and with that we're now
taking advantage of the grid for more
advanced form layouts and that is
something you absolutely have to keep in
mind the grid is perfectly fine and
intended to be used in conjunction with
forms if you got any form which should
be more than just element after element
after element use the grid as you see it
here create columns and position them
next to each other and of course we can
now again restrict it a bit so let's add
another inline style to the form or
attach a CSS class in general and in
there or since we have a CSS file we
right why don't we use that so let's
maybe create a main foreign class here
and let's give this a width of let's say
450 pixels and a margin of auto to
Center it and let's then use this main
form CSS class on our form element here
so that's a custom form class now and
now if we reload that page its centered
again but now we got the first two
elements still sitting next to each
other due to our grid and of course you
can use all the great features here you
can use the responsive grid classes to
only put elements next to each other on
bigger screens and put them beneath each
other on smaller screens all the fun
stuff you learned in the grid video and
in the official grid Docs you can use it
here so using the grid in conjunction
with forms definitely something you have
to be aware of and as you see you can
even mix it here I'm using a grid row
for the first two elements and
thereafter for the our elements I'm not
using a grid we could do that we could
use rows and columns stairs hue but we
can also not do it because we don't
really need a grid down there so you're
really flexible when it comes to this
and that is something you should keep in
mind so that's the grid used in a form
let's fast forward to validation now
so let's assume we can submit our form
and of course our form then can be valid
or invalid and bootstrap offers us a
couple of ways of signaling this to the
user so how does it work
first of all boot strip offers a couple
of helper classes which we can manually
add to our elements to our form elements
to change the appearance off the inputs
for example let me show you what I mean
what we can do is we can go to an input
let's say - the first name let's say we
validated it on the server so the form
was submitted and on the server we found
out that it's invalid that the first
name is invalid now what we typically do
is we send back the page from the server
and we add CSS classes to the inputs
which were incorrect to signal well that
they were incorrect and to give the user
some UI help in filling the form out
correctly so what we do is we go to that
input which we want to mark is invalid
where we have the form control class and
we can add D is - in valid class to it
by the way
there also is a valid class in case you
want to mark it as such to give a clear
feedback that this input was valid and
doesn't need to be changed so we added
is invalid here if we now reload you see
it has a red border this is added by
bootstrap automatically and it has a red
outline - if we click on it
so this is added by bootstrap and this
well makes it clearer that this is
invalid well maybe we also want to add
some help text and we can add a div here
below the element where we say looks
good now if we save this and we go back
we reload we got this black text here
nice and we would render this
conditionally on the server to make sure
it's only there when the form is
actually invalid but to also give this a
red text color we all set a class to
that and that would be invalid -
feedback if we do this and we reload now
it has a slightly different style and
looks nicer as some additional info
added to the input by the way you can
always add a little help text let's say
below the last name by adding a div or a
small element actually below an input
with your help text like this should be
your last name in case it wasn't clear
by the label already and on that element
you add a class which is foreign - text
and if you saved ed now you've got this
tiny text below the element - now unlike
the error text this has to be a small
element here the error text can be a div
that's important you can also add text -
muted to our help text here and if I now
reload watch this text here closely it
got grey
it's a lit it's not black right now it's
a little bit more grayish to kind of put
it a little bit more in the background
you could say so that the user can still
see it but it doesn't immediately draw
attention still error text or the
invalid feedback is something different
this should only be displayed if your
input is invalid and you also get valid
feedback in case you want to show
something like this now here it won't
show up across T and what is not valid
but if we add is valid here then we
actually got the green style and the
green background and that all shows you
something else which is important
the invalid text and the same is true
for the valid text only shows up if the
input element prior to it has D is valid
for develop text or D is invalid for the
invalid feedback class so only if we
have is valid here the valid feedback
shows up and only if we got is invalid
here
the invalid feedback will show up
otherwise this won't be displayed so you
still should render it on the server
side only when needed but bootstrap also
only will display it if it's really
there so that was a lot to digest but in
the end you got these classes and
features so
you can really provide the best possible
user feedback
by adjusting the right classes and by
taking advantage of boots trip only
showing the text which makes sense for
the given input so this is how you can
add your own validation classes
bootstrap also is capable of taking
advantage of automatic validation on the
front-end now what do I mean with that
here we're assigning classes manually
and we would do this either through
JavaScript or on the server-side by ID
or wire the help of a templating engine
probably now you can also take advantage
of JavaScript to use the validation API
modern browsers offered where the
validity of the form is handled in the
background by the browser and bootstrap
can check that validity and
automatically add the right classes so
to say or the right styles not even the
classes the right styles based on the
valid or invalid pseudo selectors which
are offered by CSS now this is a feature
which might not be supported in all
browsers and you can read more about it
in the official validation Docs but here
is how it would work to take advantage
of this we go to our overall forum and
there we need to add the needs
validation class this signals to
bootstrap that this is a form which
should be validated and styled
appropriately automatically so to say we
can still set up our invalid feedback
and our valid feedback and here I will
actually leave my custom lis added
classes but let's go to username and
there below that input let's quickly add
our or a death here where I say invalid
feedback please enter a valid user name
and maybe you want to be more precise
and that in reality but here let's go
with that please enter a valid user name
if I save this and reload we don't see
the text below the user name because
it's not treated as
invalid now we could show it by adding
that is invalid class you learn about if
we now reload you see both the style
changed and the text appeared but we
want to do that with automatic
validation now for that we first of all
need some event that triggers the
browser built-in validation and for that
we need a button so let's add a button
to our forum below the last if I'll add
a button where I say submit and we shall
set to type equals submit we'll work on
the styling of the button soon for now
let's make sure we have one if I click
Submit it just sends the page to the
server and nothing else happens and what
I wanted you here is I want to validate
the user input on the client as you do
it with many JavaScript solutions like
angular react and so on and then send
the request behind the scenes if it is
valid now we won't send a request here
but I want to do the validation and you
could take advantage of any built-in
validation methods the framework of your
choice offers you but you can also do it
manually now for dad we need to add some
JavaScript code so at the very bottom
here I'll add some script code and you
could outsource this into a separate
file of course I'll write it in line and
there I will get access to my form here
by using the document query selector
method and access my form element by its
tag or maybe a better way is to select
by the needs validation class and you
could use query selector all in case
you've got multiple elements with that
class you need to loop through them
thereafter though here we don't need to
loop through them because we're only
selecting one the first element that has
this class and now in there we can add
an event listener so add event listener
for the submit event and then provide a
function that should be executed when
this event occurs will receive the event
object that's passed in automatically by
the browser and in there we can now
check if our form is valid we do this by
calling check validity a built-in method
to offer by the browser and
that is false then we know that the form
is invalid and here we can then prevent
a default so that no request is sent and
we can stop the propagation so this
would even work with approaches where
you're not sending the form data with an
ajax request but you want to have a
normal form submission but only if it's
valid so here we're stopping this normal
form submission if it's invalid and
we'll also set a form by a class by
accessing the class list of the form and
adding the voss validated class but
that's an additional class you need to
add so this would be added next to needs
validation and this will then make sure
that bootstrap assigns the right styles
to the elements to the inputs inside of
the form that are invalid
now how is bootstrap we're not boots up
the browser determining whether
something is invalid or not you need to
use some built-in attributes so for our
user name for example which is a text
input we can add the required attribute
to tell the browser that this input is
only valid if it's not empty
because it's required and there are
other browser defaults like max length
and so on but here I'll just go with
required now if I reload got the same
look as before please note that our
default or manually added classes are
still doing their job but if I hit
submit with the username being empty we
actually get that default hint by the
browser now that's not bootstrap doing
its job that's the browser and I don't
want that so we first of all need to
disable this to make sure that our
JavaScript code can kick in because this
will actually prevent the submission
anyways to disable the browser default
here we need to go to the form element
again and add the no validate attribute
this will disable the browser default
check so that our JavaScript code runs
and we can do our manual check and then
let bootstrap assign the classes
to reload the page again and now if you
submit you see you to us adding needs
validation to the form bootstrap
automatically sets some styles for the
username which it identifies as invalid
correctly and D valid starts to all the
other inputs including the checkbox and
if we inspect the invalid element or
also develop ones actually if we inspect
them we can see on the right that the
style getting applied is using the
invalid pseudo selector which is
available because of the browser
built-in validation we're taking
advantage of so that is an alternative
to manually adding or not adding D is
invalid or is valid classes as I showed
you as a first possible erm approach
when doing this manually you don't need
to add needs validation if you wanna
take advantage of the browser built-in
validation mechanism triggered via
JavaScript here then you need to add was
validated once you're done and prior to
that you need to add needs validation in
this case bootstrap will then take the
results of the browser built-in
validation and style your elements as
needed so this is how you can validate
bootstrap forms and as always check out
the official Docs to learn more about
that now let's finish this video but
also styling our button styling buttons
is super easy and as always link to the
official Docs can be found below the
video you style a button like our submit
button here by adding a class and the
class is the button class but then also
an additional class which doesn't just
define some defaults like border-radius
but also a specific background color and
there you got a couple of available
things like primary which takes your
primary theme if I save this and reload
then we see the button s this look
because the primary theme color is blue
here secondary would be a grey and would
also be available we
got success danger warning info
basically the classes you already know
from the alert video success for example
would turn this green these are the
default classes we can add now sometimes
you also want to have kind of an
inverted button where you only have a
border but a transparent background for
this you can simply add an outline
between the button and a success part or
the info or whatever color you use so
button outline success added to just
puttan will lead to distil still a
button which has this nice hover effect
but which by default only has a green
text and border and of course that's
available for danger and so on to last
but not least it can be interesting to
also disable a button for this all
switched us back to just priming primary
button now if we add two disabled
attribute to the button which of course
could also add programmatically through
JavaScript then you would also get a
nice disabled style by default which
clearly indicates that this button can't
be clicked and only if disabled is
removed it'll look like a clickable
button again so this is the last thing
you should know this is another way of
styling the buttons or taking advantage
of in directly applied styling and with
that you got all the knowledge you need
to build beautiful and flexible forms
with the help of bootstrap you know how
to add form elements and stall them
correctly how to structure them with
form groups how to structure them even
more and create more advanced layouts
with the form or the normal grid inside
the forum how to validate forms either
manually or automatically and how to
style buttons I hope you liked the video
and I'll see you again in the next
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
