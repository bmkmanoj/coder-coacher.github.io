video on this channel in one of my last
videos I got into flexbox and explained
the basics on how flexbox works or you
style or how you control the container
and which properties you can assign to
the children living inside a flax
container
now in this video we're going to use
this knowledge and create a custom grid
based on flexbox and you might know such
grids and yeah it's nice to know but in
the end you'll still use bootstrap well
with this grid I'm pretty sure if you
really look at it you will see it has a
lot of stuff you'll probably need and it
might be worth considering using such as
custom written and and therefore
customized grid instead of the big
bootstrap thing which comes with all
sorts of stuff you're never using and
which just slows down on the your your
website access so if you haven't heard
about flexbox or you don't know what it
is at all you can you're not really sure
how to use it I definitely recommend you
to check out my videos I did on this and
then let's go into it so I'm sitting
here with my blank er workspace open up
and it's a completely new fresh
workspace it didn't change anything as
of now first thing I'm going to do is
get rid of this hello plunker message
here and we'll start this grid by yeah
well obviously the the two components
which are most important to it the rows
of our grid and the columns and I will
create a simple four column grid here
because in my personal experience four
columns is what I use most I never
needed like six columns next to each
other really
but if you're worried you need something
like this this video will really get you
going on how to create something like
this easily on your own so let's first
head over to style dot CSS and start
riped
right away with our row class so I'm
just going to create a new CSS class
here and it will be our Flex container
holding our columns which will be the
children of our flexbox and therefore we
have to
well declare it as display flags I'll
also give it a width of 100% so that our
rows by default spanned the entire width
of our window now obviously you can
change that for you grid if you want but
I think the row being the whole width is
a pretty good thing I formals
when it comes to me I prefer working
with pairings and margins on my columns
instead of the rope because there are
times where in my grid a row might have
a background image which should really
span across the whole page and not have
any ugly white spaces on the left and
right you to some margins and that's why
I keep my rows 100% and control the the
actual alignment in this basement of my
content with the Rev the columns within
my rows so that's that and I'm also
going to enter my first Flex property
which is justified content and I want by
default to be all the items in such a
role the columns to be pushed up to the
beginning of the row to the start like
start therefore now I think the problem
now is we can't really see what we're
doing so I'm going to change this by
adding a helper class here Road mark
which will basically just make it
visible to us by adding a 1 pixel dashed
border around it with a light gray and I
will even more add to it by making it
easier to to recognize when you hover
over it by changing the border to dashed
and give it a light blue and the content
excuse me the content should then have a
background color off yeah also like blue
I looked up ok
set and these two I let me just
commented are really only helper classes
not you necessary for you grid how per
classes now even though I just said I
don't like Martians on my Rose I want to
give the grid the flexibility to easily
add some predefined margins so I'm gonna
create a help or a class for this row
subclass or an additional class with a
top and bottom margin property of 16
pixels and let me just do it this way
bottom sixty pixels I'm was considering
writing it in one statement by chest
writing margin 16 pixels 0 which would
do this exact same as these two lines
too
but I don't want to do this because I
want to give the user the possibility to
use this class as well as the left-right
class which I'm defining here and these
two classes would each overwrite each
other if I would use the combined margin
command property so margin left let's
give this first two pixels as well as
for Marge a left one right 32 pixels and
then we have to adjust width of our row
because we added margins it's no longer
100 percent I'm going to use this useful
than handy cock function of CSS to say
okay take your 100 percent and now just
subtract the two margins left right
adding up to 64 pixels okay so that's
our room
okay so let's that's it for a rose as of
now now let's get into our columns or a
column class
so columns and this one is the room
section like at my dad cult class here
and this one will basically have some
properties which all of my sub classes
are cal classes should inherit because
four columns I'll have more than one
class so a lift as empty as of now
because I going to have I call one of
two class for example right now I said
I'm going to use four columns why am I
writing what f2 here really that's just
to add some flexibility obviously I
could do the same with a two of four
class but I want if someone uses the
strip to really give him the possibility
to intuitively use it and I think it's
it's more intuitive to say okay I've in
this case I'll have two columns and
therefore I write one of two instead of
two of four when I'm only using two
columns overall that's the only reason
and this class will be the exact same as
the two of four class right okay so what
does this class hold all it has is a
width of 50% right because we say it's
one of two or two of four and that is
50% now let's write some HTML so that we
can actually actually see our work right
John going to declare a row here the
class row add a call one of two as well
as a call two of four
enter some content and we can see okay
it seems to be divided up now one thing
is we don't see our border that's
because I didn't add a mark property
class here sorry now we can see ok this
is our row and now let's do let's do an
equal things for our columns right so
down here I'm going to add a cult mark
class which will he have a dotted border
which is red and a background color of
miles look this up FC dfd for all the P
light red and I'll make that hover above
or change on hover as well then the
border will be let's let's make that -
just to have it all in the same line so
I'm going to give this the same light
blue and they're not the same because I
want to have a difference I want to be
able to see what is a column and what is
the rows therefore we'll give it another
color okay save it and now we also need
to add the mark class here and here now
what's just wondering why the the
marking doesn't show up and this is
because see here mark is added to the
Col class now here I only got to call
one of two class so I need to call base
class added here and now we can see okay
gathered here
now okay that is okay we got it fifty
percent two columns but maybe we would
like some gathers right in in most Ritz
you get some gutters to separate the
columns so yeah let's Adam with gutters
class here and what it does is it adds a
margin to the left and right when and it
really belongs to the row sorry not the
columns because the with gatherers is a
class we will add to our arrow because
we want to have gutters here with
gutters and obviously it should affect
our code and not our rope so nice we now
got our grid with our gatherings in
between and as you can see we got also
the space on the left and right now this
is obviously the case because we said a
margin of sixteen pixels - left and
right for both columns and that
obviously affects both sides so
therefore I need to write some
additional code to say okay the first of
type so the first column we encounter in
a row should have a margin left oops
of zero and last of type should have a
margin right of zero so now we only got
a gutter limited model of 32 pixels in
this case now we get this one and two
pushed or aligned directly to the left
edge of our container maybe we would
like to have some padding in our column
as well so let's go down to our columns
here and give the opportunity of adding
a class padding to our code
them which would basically just add a
default padding of 16 pixels and if we
now get her HTML file and say yeah we
want to have a padding here we got it
now for both containers now another
thing is we're using flexbox right so we
don't have to use the standard of having
our columns distributed this way right
we doesn't basically flex
start property so both columns are push
the left and this is only not directly
visible because as each column is 50% it
fills the complete row right but if
these columns were smaller we would see
them push to the left and actually let's
just show this by adding additional code
classes here so we got one of two we got
two for now I also want to give the
possibility to say one of free which
will have a width of 33 Lloyd a dot 3%
and I'll just add two of three which has
obviously 66.6 percent with and let me
just finish it up by saying okay we also
got one of four which has a width of 25%
and we got two of excuse me free of four
which will have a width of 75% now if we
change this to one of free for example
then we can see okay we again got some
space on the right even though we remove
the right margin this is because we got
flex start set for our justified content
property of our row the container the
Flex
container and this says okay at the
first element of the Flex container to
the beginning of our holding container
row and a second directly next to it and
so on and if there is space left well
the space will be on the left and the
opposite would be flex and where these
two items would sit all the way over
here to the right and we would have some
empty space here now sometimes we may
want this behavior sometimes we may not
so I think the user should have the
possibility to choose what you want
therefore I'm going to add some
additional classes here first one will
be space between and this will all be
row down row space between will have
justify content property of space
between how surprising row space around
will have justify content property of
space around as you might have guessed
and we'll also have Rho dot Center
property which will have a justify
content property of center and I will
also give the possibility of using flex
and content works and to have the effect
I just described that everything sets on
the end of the row now that's the
horizontal positioning options I wanna
offer here and we can use them by saying
okay I want some space between here and
now we can see the space on the right is
gone but I gather got a little bit
broader and this is because we said okay
the space should be between the two
elements if you were to use around we
will see that you got a tiny empty space
here here and you might not die
to see it but the gutter also got
broader if we use center we got a little
bit of bigger space on the left and
right because we only got our margin
gutter here but know that the empty
space is only divided between the left
right here because the rest is centered
okay
so I'll leave it at center as of now now
we've already gone pretty far here in
this video and the basics of our grid
are now set up were almost ready to use
it but we get some fine-tuning left to
do and I also then wanna show you how
how flexible it is yeah how really
flexible this tiny little grid here can
be and I will do this in the next video
so I hope I'll see you there
have a nice day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
