produce we added authentication on our
server so that we can make sure that we
issued hogan's to authenticated users
and that we can then check tokens pass
by those users to the back end to make
sure or to decide whether access to some
resources should be granted or not time
to now work on the front end beginning
with angular 2 to implement it sign up
sign in and so on process and also to
send the quotes there as d tokens there
to the back and to get some quotes or
create quotes now I will start with sign
up and sign in and then we will work our
way forward to storing the token and so
on so let's start in the project your
open in web store my ID by generating
two new components so with ng generate
component I do this with the CLI the
first one will be these sign up
component and yeah I just use different
words Justice Eli let's find here though
then use do the same for sign in so that
we get two new components here sign in
and sign up page and I want to include
those pages in the routing so here I'll
quickly add new routes to my routing
file so I will have a sign up route and
I will have a sign in route like this
and I want to load these sign up
component here of course in this case
and you sign in component in the sign in
pause case here make sure to add those
imports to the route file and also make
sure to add those new components to your
app module it's done automatically by
the CLI but if you're not using the CLI
or the SEMO didn't do it make sure to
add those components three declarations
array as well as the imports up here
manually with that we got to EQ pages
and place your components now in the app
component here in my header which is not
super pretty I will add them and to make
it easier to differentiate all those
items I'll add little pipes in between
and then simply duplicate this twice to
also have a route leading cue my signup
route and then one to the sign-in page
and of course renamed is here to sign up
and rename it here to sign
then all the Knights are styling
something you can do I want to focus on
on the cooler here which is how does it
work so let's work on the signup page
done we should have a way of reaching it
let's quickly check if this is the case
if we let this reload and click on
signup looks good so let's go to the
signup component HTML file and in there
I want to create a new form remove the
action because we will let angular
handle this form submission and then
there let's start with a form group this
is a bootstrap class to give it some
nice your styling where I want to have a
label for my email address let's say so
for the mail address and below that I'll
have the input which is a type email
which will receive the email and I'll
use the template with an approach so
I'll assign a name of email here and
ngmodel important when using ng model to
use the template driven approach make
sure that in your app module you import
the for this module otherwise you will
get an error and all those forms
functionalities for template driven
approach will not be unlocked so with
that let's go back I added this input
with ng model on it you get access to
this later when we submit the form and I
also want to add the form control
bootstrap class to this input now we'll
quickly copy this twice and actually I
will replace the topmost one too may not
make it type and not for the email this
will be for Danai let's say the user
name so user name this will be then you
have type not tell text ID will be user
name and name will be username then we
have the email I just created and then
below that I want to have the password
so let's name it password here let's
name this one user name here at the top
to have all these inputs in place and we
could add a column fernfield and because
if you super deep into validation here I
want to that I want to focus on the one
soakin thing and so on so all I will do
is I will add a button here and this
button will be of type submit and will
allow me to sign up therefore since you
the temperature will approach in my form
on my full element I will use or listen
to ng submit which is fired when we
click the submit button here and I will
call on sign up in this case whoops
sign up like this and of course I need
to pass a reference to this form so I
get this with this trickier assigning
energy form to a local reference named F
this name is up to you of course and
then passing this local reference to the
on signup method this will pass the
JavaScript object angle shoe creates for
us this JavaScript representation of the
form it will be stored in this local
variable and they'll then be whoops and
will then be passed to on sign up if
this is all brand-new to you definitely
check out some tutorials on the template
you'll approach angular users with this
let's go to the signup component here
and implement the on signup method we
know that we get the form there so this
will be of type ng form not ng4 ng form
don't need to import ng4 so ng form make
sure to add the import from add angular
forms and in there now all I want to do
is I want you submit the form I want to
send it to the server queue create an
user to do so I will create a new
service i'll created here in the root
folder and I'll name it off service so
let's give it a class that will export
the class with the name of off service
and in there
I'll add the add injectable decorator
because I will inject something make
sure to add the import I will inject
something and that something is the bulk
in HTTP service because of course I need
to send an HTTP request to the backend
so make sure to import HTTP here cube
and with the dejected I'll create a
sign-up method here queue here I expect
to get the username which will be a
string I expect to get the email which
is a string and I expect to get the
password which is a string now with that
data received here I can reach out to my
back-end will send a post requester to
create a new
user and our URL our route is basically
the same as for the closed service so
this one you slash API at the end make
sure to enter this here but thereafter
it's slash user to create a new user
data see URL we set up on our back end
and you relics file in the API dot PHP
file in the routes folder of course I
need to pass a body to and the body I do
need to pass here is my is my middle my
data here so we could have a look at the
back end if we go to the user controller
we see that for signup we expect to have
name email and password fields we will
also validate in here so we should maybe
also add some front-end validation but
first things first
let's pass the name here which is our
username let's pass the email which is
our email and let's pass the password
which is our password to make this
easier to read I'll bring it into a new
line lastly I will add something else I
will add some headers so here I'll set
the headers on this third argument I can
pass the post method this object very
compares some additional configuration I
wanted to have some additional
configuration I want to pass some extra
headers so here I will set some new
headers which also receives the
JavaScript object as an argument to the
constructor make sure to import headers
from angular HTTP and in these headers
here I will basically set these same
headers we set here on postman remember
on headers oops not on on on the
response here on the request we set X
requested with so copy this X request
with and the value was XML HTTP request
this is required to make the validation
work application JSON as content types
should be set automatically we'll see if
it works and what's that the post
request is done is configured I can
return this observable it's not sent yet
as always this is just the observable we
create here but we can now send it so
back in the sign up component
well first of all I will quickly add
some basic validation here
so as you required validator for each
input and maybe disable the button with
the disabled property binding if the
form is not valid so this basic check
here but more important in the
typescript code in on sign up I want to
reach out to my music reads off service
so we need to inject us here the off
service like this make sure to import it
from your off service file also make
sure to provide it I will do this in the
app module here under providers you
should add off service too and also add
the import in this file - just like you
always do it with services and that only
types could file with the officer is
injected here in on signup I will reach
out to it call the sign-up method get my
forum value user name of the field name
my forum value email and my forum value
password to send all these data to the
signup method and then we can subscribe
to the observable we get returned here
so here in the SUBSCRIBE method I simply
want to listen to you any response I get
and I will lock this response to the
console and I will do the exact same
with any error
I might get just like this so to finally
make it work in the off service since we
haven't gotten the import DD map
operator therefore we didn't import rxjs
rx like we normally do we would get an
error like this so what we have to do to
avoid getting an error is we have to
import observable from rxjs there like
this we also right now need to import
response here this might look strange
because we are not using this type
anywhere in this file might be solved in
the later version of angular right now I
do need to add this import so if I save
this now we see our signup page here
loads correctly and now
let's give this but the nicer style
wheel will have that much time so let's
quickly assign button button primary it
shouldn't look super nice but at least a
little bit nicer
so let's now try this here crisp test2
should be valid email address which
hasn't been taken yet and then my lips
say this type here so my password let's
open up the console to to see any
potential errors and hit sign up and we
get this error why do we get this it has
something to do with our course set that
we implemented earlier in this series if
we go back to layer low and there we
have a look at our course milla we're in
the middle where folder we set some
allowed headers here and the header we
just added the X request with header is
not listed so let's simply add it here X
requested with and we didn't get this
error when using postman because postman
doesn't have two scores issue but we do
have the issue when using our JavaScript
application angular so I now add it as
header to the back end to the back and
to level to our course middleware
created early and serious and with that
adjust it let's simply try again now
that looks much better
successfully created user as you can see
let's look it up in the database in the
users table this is the new user I
created a second ago so this looks
pretty good
and what did we hooked up our front end
to be able to create new users now you
can improve this you can improve this
form the validation you can reset the
form that's not really the focus of the
series though I will continue in the
next video with authenticating users so
signing them in working on this sign and
page therefore see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
