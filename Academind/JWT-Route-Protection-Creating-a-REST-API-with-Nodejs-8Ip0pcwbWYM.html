two videos we added user signup and user
login in this video I want to make sure
that we can also protect routes we got
that token which we issue since the last
video that token we can store on our
client not want to make sure that we can
use that token to access certain routes
on our back-end that are protected
before that we need to add protection to
some of these routes first so let's do
all of that in this video
time to add some protection we got our
products and we got our order routes
here right now there are some routes
which we don't want to protect for
example getting all products that makes
sense to be an unprotected route because
if we were to create a front-end for our
shop here we probably want to be able to
present all our products even to an
authenticated users the same is true for
the get route to a specific product
typically we want to allow the user to
get more product information before he
has to sign up and that maybe buy it or
whatever the plan is however other
routes like creating a new product or
deleting products or changing products
and maybe all order related routes
including the GATT roads here are
protected routes we want to make sure
that not every user can access them and
therefore we need some way of protecting
these routes a good approach would be to
add some kind of middleware which we can
easily add to a given route that runs
prior to that route getting processed to
actually determine does it make sense to
continue or aren't you Afeni cated
anyways so we need to add some
middleware that checks for a valid token
to be there and only if the token is
there and valid can be verified so it
hasn't been filled around with on the
client only if that is the case we
continue so that's the plan we'll add
such a middleware for this I'll create a
new folder in my API folder I'll need a
name it middleware you could name it off
whatever you want and in there I'll make
add my check off J's file because this
is what I want to do I want to check
whether the user is authenticated or not
I'll start with module exports to export
something and that something is going to
be a Aero function where I get the
request response and next you probably
know this pattern it's the default
middleware pattern we use in Express
Apps now I just want to create this
function and export it in this file so
that I can import it in my order and
product route file and then use it in
there to add
to certain routes if you remember in the
product route here we have the post
route where we also have that upload
signal middleware which will parse a
file and this is exactly the same
pattern I want to use we can add as many
handlers as we want and they will be
executed in the order from left to right
so if I then add my check-off middleware
here I will actually run through that
first and only continue if we succeed
that's the plan now for that will create
it here now what do we have to do in
this file we have to call next if we did
successfully authenticate and we want to
not call it we want to return an error
instead if we did not succeed so for
that we need some information from the
JWT package or we need some help from
that package we used in the last videos
there we have a way of creating a token
now there all this a verify method which
allows us to verify an incoming token
that is what I mentioned in the last
videos the server can verify whether a
token is valid or not for that of course
we need to that key we stored on the
server and we need to token so let's do
just that
let's import this JSON web token package
in this file here so I'll create my JWT
constant and simply require JSON web
token and then in there I will simply
create a new concept which I named
decoded because the verify method will
actually return the decoded token if it
succeeds and then I will call JWT verify
now you might see there are always a
decode method this will just decode the
token and not verify it and as I
mentioned in the last video the token is
not encrypted so decoding alone doesn't
ensure it's valid it just ensures its
valid base64 encoding but that doesn't
help us
so decode is only helpful if you want to
get to the internals of the token after
having verified it if you didn't verify
it yet then decode
makes no sense and verify we'll do both
verify it and then return the decoded
value so here is what I'll use
verify and then I assume to get to token
as part of the request body if we don't
well then we will always fail here and
that is exactly what we want to do if we
go into this middleware which we only do
if we added it to a route if we go in
here and there is no token present then
we should fail because then we got note
Okin right so we pass the token here the
key is what we stored in our environment
variables to process end and then it was
JWT key in my case here I added this in
the last video and then the next
argument are some options I don't pass
any special options here and then a
callback you can specify so I will omit
the last two values here I just want to
verify it like this now this method
verify will actually throw an error if
it fails so what I'll do is I'll add a
try-catch block here I'll try decoding
the token so I'll try this code here but
if I fail then I will catch my error and
in here I will then return a response
where I set the status code to 401 on an
authenticated and return a JSON object
with the message off failed just like
that
if we succeed here in the try block
though then we got a decoded value and I
will eventually call Next to continue
and what I also can do is I can set
request user data equal to decoded so
I'm adding a new field to my request
make sure to pick one which you don't
accidentally which you don't already
have so that you don't overwrite it and
now in future requests which use these
map that this middle where in front of
it we could extract a user data the
decoded user data on that field now with
that we get a middle where let's now try
it out and let's go to the products
file a page maybe and let's add it to
the post product route so GAD should be
publicly accessible but we want to add
our middleware to the post route so I'll
first of all import it I'll add and you
can't set the top here check off and I
will require it from middleware check
off and this is now the function we're
exporting there which is a valid
middleware function and now in the post
route here I will simply add check off
in front of this upload single and the
other handlers so this will run first
I don't execute it I will just edit like
this and Express will automatically pass
requests and so on into this now let's
try it out let's go back to postman and
let's create a new post request to
products let's switch to foreign data
again and make sure you enter your valid
data here and choose a file I added a
very Christmasy file here again and
let's now simply try this out let's now
hit send and first of all go to headers
and disable this content type and hits
send again and we get all failed because
the token is missing we're checking if
we got a token in the body
so let's simply add one let's first of
all make sure we can login I'll create a
new tab with a post request again queue
localhost
3000 slash user slash login and asked
before I'll add a header here content
type application Jason and a body raw
JSON data where I will set an email
password combination that exists in
database well again use test free at
test calm and your password was tester
now if we use that and we sent this
request I get my token so I'll copy that
and now go back to the first tab where
I'm setting the post request to products
and I'll add my token key here and add
token as a value I now hit Send I still
get all failed though now it can be
difficult to find out why the reason is
that in this post route remember we're
getting full and data were not getting
JSON data now in the app J's file we
only get body parsers for URL encoded
and JSON content type requests neither
is the case here we got form data and
we're taking care about this with the
upload single mail aware which simply
parses form data requests and extracts
the file along the way but it does this
parsing since check off runs prior to
this request body will not be populated
because it hasn't been parsed yet
now one workaround of course is to
switch the order here we can put check
off as the second middleware if we do
this and ahead send here then we do
simply a continue we just fail with the
creation of the uploads directory here
because I deleted that in the meantime I
would have to re-add it if I do that
uploads
and I had send again it succeeds and we
can see the file here then so then it
works this is one way changing the order
yeah we can do this we're doing some
unnecessary work here with the parsing
since we don't check prior to it if we
are authenticated and in general we
might not want to pass the token as part
of the request body because what do we
do for get requests sure we could add it
to the URL in a query parent or example
and we can't do all of that but a
typical pattern is to put the token into
the header so I'll remove this key here
I don't want to send to token like this
I want to send it as part of my headers
and there's one common header we use for
this the authorization header
authorization as the name implies should
hold any information we need for
authorizing a request and there a token
is typically sent by adding bearer
whitespace and then the token so the
token you previously previously sent
here in the request bodies let me copy
it again
and put it here after Bearer now why
bearer notice is simply a convention
used to indicate that this authorization
header bears a token it's basically an
alternative to basic HTTP authentication
so hence bearer the tokens of course the
interesting part with this setup we
don't need to parse the body to get the
token we just need to have a look at the
header so in check off we now get to
token from the header so I'll first of
all simply try to get my token from the
header and I can do this by accessing
request header a headers authorization
if I do this let's simply lock to token
here if I now again sent my post request
to create a product it now fails here
because I removed the token from the
from the body remember I unchecked this
year I'm no longer sending it so it
fails in the console log we see this out
though so we did successfully parse the
header and that of course means we can
now use the token from there we just
have to make sure that we don't include
the bearer and the whitespace so what
I'll actually do is I'll get my request
headers authorization and split it by a
white space I then access the first
segment where the second one actually
with index one which will be this part
after the white space and then I can
pass my token here to the verify method
all safe doesn't go back to products and
now revert the order here again so I'll
now add check off prior to trying to
parse the body here
and now if we save this make sure that
authorization is set to your token with
bearer in front of it and if I try to
send us again it now succeeds if I
change to token by for example removing
the e and therefore all basically send
an invalid token it fails and this is a
nice middleware we can now use to make
sure that we protect our routes let's
add it to multiple routes then instead
of just adding it in front of or in our
post route here I'll also add in the
patch route
so before we there have our main
handling function and in the delete
route not in the to cat routes as I
mentioned and the same in orders there
I will now also import my check off
middleware by requiring this from the
middleware folder check off and I will
add it there to in front of all routes
actually because all should be protected
including the GATT routes so getting all
orders posting new orders getting a
single order and deleting order
everything is now protected and now if I
save this we can try it out we train can
try getting products and this should
succeed even if we remove that header
because it's not a protected route if I
try to delete a product though for this
let me quickly get an ID like this one
so if I now add this in the URL as we
have to do it
for a delete request and I sent this
without the authorization header I get
all failed if I add the authorization
header I still get it because it's still
the invalid token so let me reverse this
by adding de again now it succeeds and
if I remove it just to prove this again
and of course fails so this is now an
option and now let's check our orders
there we can't just try to get all
orders if I don't add the token it fails
if I do add it it succeeds so this is
how we can now use the token how we did
add our middleware which we can now
conveniently add to any route that
should be protected and we're using the
tray WT concept for this authentication
flow and for making sure that the client
can identify himself to our server and
access protected resources without the
server having to store any information
about the connected clients this is now
true stateless authentication
implemented in our restful service
through JSON web tokens now with that we
made a huge step forward we added
authentication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
