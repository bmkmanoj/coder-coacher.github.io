on board in the last video we added
users sign up so the functionality to
create users in this video I want to
make sure that users can also lock
themselves in and get such a token I was
referring to in the last video the token
which we then need to attach to future
requests which reach our protected
routes in our back-end we don't have
protected routes yet we'll add these
later but for now let's make sure we can
get such a token at least so that is
what we'll focus on in this video
time to you create some tokens in our
user routes file we got a sign-up route
now I want a second route before I
delete users where I also handle post
requests but to slash login and the idea
here is to all to get email and password
but not create a new user but instead
have a look at the database and see if
we got a fitting user and if we do then
actually create such a token so here
first of all I'll create response
request response and next and the goal
here will be to see if we got a user so
I can use my user model and simply find
any user for a given email address so
we're email is actually equal to request
body email and that approach is pretty
similar to the sign up route where we
also find such users in this case to
make sure we don't create a new user for
an email that has already been taken in
this case down here in order to lock the
user in so here we then have X act to
get a real promise with them and catch
and now for caching I'll use my default
error handling code and yes we could
outsource this into a separate method I
might do this later for now let me stay
to this more where both but also
understandable way of coding this now
the then block is of course interesting
to us because they're Estelle's where we
get our user and to be precise we should
name this users because as you learned
this will be an array it's just an empty
array if we got no user and I'm naming
it user because it will at most be one
user because we prevent the creation of
duplicate entries due to our check here
in signup so I get my user array and
therefore first of all I'll check if
user length is smaller than one so if we
got no user if that's the case then I
want to return a response where I set a
status code of 404 and basically tell
the user Ted login fail however
this might not be the best pattern
because what we could do is we could
send a JSON response where we send a
message like mail not found user doesn't
exist
whoops doesn't exist like this the issue
with this approach is that we open our
app to some kind of brute-force attack
users could now just try out different
email addresses and they will at least
find out which ones are there and which
ones are not so once they get a list of
available email addresses they could
focus on these two then get out the
password or things like that so this
might not be the best pattern not as
super big flaw if we add it but also not
great and can be a big flaw so let's not
do it like this instead let's just
return for a-1 which simply means
unauthorized and I'll also simply return
off failed which could fail because we
got no email or because the password is
wrong so that's the first check now
let's assume we make it past this if
block here so we don't return this
response and therefore this code gets
executed now we found the user the next
step is to make sure that the password
sent with the request matches the
password in our database the thing just
is we do hash our password here with
beak Ritesh and in the last video I
mentioned that we can't reverse this so
how can we match the new password which
is coming in plain text queue the
password in our database if we can't
rebuild it well be crypt of course used
a certain algorithm for hashing the
password and we basically have some kind
of way of comparing values even though
they're hashes won't be the same just by
making sure that a plaintext password
which we hash again with the same
algorithm in the end yields us a
comparable hash so this is a check this
package can do for us and you can dive
into the be trap documentation on the
get up pass a repository to find out
this works here with this compare method
for this we need to pass the plaintext
password and the hash we want to compare
it to and it will return true if it
basically finds out yeah both passwords
were created with the same algorithm the
same key and therefore they are the same
passwords even though the hashes don't
match so this is what we can do here so
in my part here after checking whether
we got the email I'll use be tripped
again and call the compare method and
first of all passed request body
password here plain text password and
then the hash which is of course part of
the user we retrieved so user and then
here we can simply access the first
element and by the way and alternative
to find would also be find one this
would ensure that we don't get an array
but just one user I'll just stick to
this general syntax but you could
definitely use find one so here we have
user is zero and this is the only user
we found this user will have a password
field we stored this in the database
because our user model has a password
field now with that we can compare these
two and now the third argument here is a
callback where we get an error or a
response
now our error is not returned if we
can't compare these it's just an error
we get if the comparison generally fails
so if we got an error here I simply also
want to return off failed don't need to
pass more information than that if we
don't have an error I'll check if
response because of that excuse we
shouldn't name this rest because that
again is a rest object so let's name
this result so I'll check if result and
as we see in the official doc this is
just true if it succeeds or false if it
fails so what I can do here is I can
simply check if result so this will be
true if it's exceeded so if the password
is the correct one in this case I will
return a response where
said status code to 200 and then I
returned my response where I say all
successful and of course the token is
still missing here I'll come back to
this
I also need another response here at the
very end if we don't make it into this
if block here then we return all failed
because then the password was incorrect
and we always return the same error code
and message to give no indication about
whether authentication failed because
the wrong password or an incorrect email
address and with that we get this setup
we should now be able to give us back to
Soph successful information let's now
save this and try it out again back in
postman I did create a user with test
free at test common to test for password
in last video so let's now target slash
login which is the route we created here
and let's send the same information and
we should get back off successful now if
I change the password and add one extra
art we get all failed and the same if I
enter a password and email which doesn't
exist we also get all fails then and if
I reword this to a valid combination and
again as successful so this is working
as it should now we're not done yet
though we want to return such a token
don't we now for that will add another
library to our project note JSON web
token it's a library that will do this
token generation and signing and so on
for us which of course is a bit of a
more complex process and we simply have
to install it and then follow the usage
instructions down there so to do that
I'll quit my process and run NPM install
JSON web token I'll also add - - safe to
add an entry to package JSON and now
this will execute and we'll add this
token to our project just as a packaged
or project I'll restart the server
thereafter and now how do we use that
now you see here we got a couple of
methods like JWT sign and signing
actually is what we need to create a
signed token
there you'll see we pass a payload so
some data we want to pass into the token
we then pass a secret key so that is the
key which only is known to the server
and we also can pass more options and a
callback that is executed once the
signing is done and then the options you
can choose the algorithm though I will
keep the default change how long the
token is valid this shouldn't be too
long for security reasons because the
token is stored on a client and if the
client somehow is insecure and someone
steals to token there he got full access
to your API so you want to make that
hook and short left and these are a
couple of harbor things you can define
and add the default should be fine all
tweak expires in though and I will also
make sure that we will sign the token to
begin with so you can also see some
usage examples down there to create a
token let's first of all import this
package I'll name it JWT and require
JSON web token that's the package we
just installed and then in my login
route here if we got a user so here we
return off successful I will actually
use JWT and call the sign method now
here first of all the payload what do we
want to pass to the client
maybe we want to pass the user email
address and ID certainly not the
password even though it's hashed but
don't do that so I will add an email
here email key and this will of course
be my extracted user email so I can
simply access user 0 which is the user
we got from the database and there the
email field and now the same for the ID
user ID can be user 0 and then
underscore ID so these are the two
values I want to put into my JWT so in
my JSON web token then we need a private
key and I'll again use an environment
variable for this so I'll add it to my
environment variable file there along of
my or next to my Mongo Atlas password
I'll add my che WCET
key and I'll name it secret here
obviously you would typically use a more
elaborate string than that but I'll just
use that here and then I will use it
here too as a second argument I'll
access process dot and dot JWT key so
that environment variable we just added
now let's continue adding arguments here
the next argument are the options so
I'll put this into a new line here and
then another new line will be a
JavaScript object where we can define
the options of this signing process and
here I'm interested in the expires in
field and this can be set as you can see
in the documentation to a value in
seconds or a string describing time
spans like one hour and one hour is a
good duration for security reasons and
finally the last argument here is a
callback where we get our token you can
however also omit this callback and just
assign it to constant like I do here
token and it will then run synchronously
and give you that token and with that we
can return the message but also the
token here which is stored in this token
constant and now if we restart the
server since I changed the environment
variables if we go back and we again
login for this valid email password
combination I get back off successful
and this token now if we copied that
token and I go to channel ut dot IO a
link to which can of course be found in
the video description but I guess the
URL also isn't that hard there we can
scroll down and copy in our token and
this will now give us a decoded value
because remember it's not encrypted it's
just encoded in a base64 string but it's
not encrypted and this is what's inside
our token the email address and the user
ID expiration information the algorithm
which was used and some verification
information which the end will be used
by the server to verify it and if we
were to change anything here like let's
say changed
email you will see the token on the left
also changed and therefore it wouldn't
be verifiable by the server anymore
you see that the verification the blue
part here switches if I switch that so
that is what ensures that our token
stays valid and we can't fiddle around
with it so this is how we now add a
token and return it to the user to the
client in the next video we'll actually
use that token to then also send it with
requests to resources we want to protect
you learn how we protect such resources
and how we can verify the token</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
