course and this video is not about to
react course but if you saw some of the
announcements you probably saw that NSI
react course we build an application
where we can build up a burger
dynamically now that burger is actually
not using a bunch of images for the
different ingredients but it's written
entirely in CSS this is written entirely
in CSS in this video we'll build this
burger together so let's dive in
so when I built this burger here and
it's written as I said entirely in CSS
we won't animated we won't add
JavaScript logic to build it up that is
what we do with react and do react
course but it is
I guess interesting to see how you can
use CSS to create all these these
ingredients here so for that let's
create a new pan here on code pen with
just the web editor I'm going to use you
could bolt this locally but here this is
a nice playing ground for exactly this
kind of project so why don't we use it
so in this new code pan here I want to
build the burger now this burger as I
said won't use JavaScript but it will
use HTML and it will use CSS obviously
to well make the burger look like a
burger in HTML I will not have that many
elements I will have a wrapping div
which I will give to class box and this
will just be like the container for the
burger and then in there I want to have
a div for each ingredient so the goal is
to have something like red top maybe and
then also have something like sell it
and then Brad bottom and we're going to
add more ingredients than just ease free
this wouldn't be that delicious of a
burger but that is the idea having all
these ingredients set next to each other
and styling them with CSS so this our
HTML code how does these CSS code look
like then well I go I'm going to create
all these classes I'm using here I'll
start with the box which is the most
boring one because it's not an
ingredient this box should just be the
container for the burger and the burger
then all should be built in a way that
it's really flexible and grows with the
box
so therefore to start off I'll give this
box a width of let's say 500 pixels and
the margin of auto to just Center it and
a height of 450 pixels and you can
always adjust this later now let's work
on the bread
top so this is the first element I got
here on the left and now the bread top
should be well box with round corners on
the top left and right corner so that we
have a straight line at the bottom and
clear edges on the sides on the bottom
edges but then on the bottom corners but
then this rounded look at the top like a
burger bread you cut into pieces where
you then will take the upper piece in
CSS will obviously always work with
boxes and all these ingredients are
nothing else than boxes with some
rounded edges some round corners from
time to time so first of all let's give
this red top a height and let's say this
should be 20% keep in mind it's inside
the box it will be 20% of that height
here
let's also give it a width and let's say
that should be 80% and we can always
tweak this later now we want to have a
background color for this bread top so
I'll assign background color and of
course you can make this red so let me
now see this box red doesn't seem to be
the most optimal color for Brad though a
brown probably would be better but I
actually want to use a linear gradient
to give this also some three-dimensional
look so that we don't have the same
monotone color for the entire bread and
if we want to use linear gradient we
can't do this on background color
because it's not treated as a color we
do it on the background property instead
now a linear gradient takes all the
different shades you want to well
transition fruit and here only one I
have two and I picked two brownish
colors the first one the hashcode for a
TD hex code for the first one is BC 581e
and the second color I want to
transition to is e2 7 b-36
like this so lose the brown color I
picked and of course you can always pick
a different
one now here we got the D look but of
course we're missing the D round corners
and so on right so we should probably
add some border radius to this and now
we could say ten pixels this gives us
round corners everywhere we only want to
have two top and the top two corners to
be round though so what we can do is we
can say 10 pixels 10 pixels zero zero
the first two numbers or basically these
numbers go from top left to top right to
bottom right to bottom left so one time
around the burger if we do it like this
only the top corner corners around but
10 pixels isn't enough actually I'm
going to use percentages here so we can
use 50% here 50% basically looks much
closer to a burger a bread a cut-up read
look as I want it now in this this bread
almost already looks pretty good but now
I also want to give it some
three-dimensional look so add a box
shadow but not one which goes outside of
the bread but an inset shadow so which
falls onto the bread so to say then I'll
use 15 pixels and 0 here as dimensions
for the shadow and this black shadow
actually doesn't look too bad but I want
to have some dark brown color here which
I can get with c1 5 7 1 1 and this now
looks really good for me at least and as
always you can tweak this around now
with that we got the bread top finished
for now all these seeds on the bread are
missing for now we'll add them later
let's next work on the salad now how it
should the sell it look like how should
the sell it be stalled for the salad
let's first of all define a width and
the bread top had a width of 80% I think
it would look nice if the seller is a
little bit broader than the bread so
maybe we take 90% here we also have to
say assign a height and there let's try
7% so much smaller than the bread
because salad obviously is isn't as big
now the next step is I want to give this
a background color and here again I'm
going to use a linear gradient you have
this nicer look than just one single
color and there I picked some green
colors in advance two to eight C one D
is the code of the first car a color to
color or where we are starting at and
then I want to end at hashtag nine 1c
e50 this is now a green color it also is
not positioned correctly for one we want
to use margin Auto to Center it the same
should of course then be done on the
bread on the top here we all just shut
Center this now it's centered but it
also doesn't have any space between the
bread and the salad so we probably want
to add some spacing maybe two percent of
the total height of the box to the bread
and maybe add the same amount of spacing
to the cell it and s so often you can
also find you this of course so this is
now the style I wanna use one of things
missing I don't like the edges here the
corners of the salad so it makes sense
to also give dad a border radius of
let's say 20 pixels and you can just
play around with this number until it
looks good to you I like this look you
can of course choose a different one so
now we got the salad finished let's now
work on the bottom bread so I'll add
bread bottom here to target this last
death and on this bread I'll also sign a
height let's pick 13% so that's smaller
than the top bread but we also won't
have this round part on the top here and
let's pick a width which probably should
be equal to the width of the top bread
so 80% was our width there let's go with
the same width all
the bottom breath now so that we can see
something I'll also use a background
here and I also want to set the
background to a linear gradient here and
I will use the following color f08 efore
a and then go to e27
be free 6 and I simply picked all these
colors aids and color Pickers before I
started recording this now we got the
background color for that let's also add
a margin of 2 percent to 2 percent an
auto here to Center this and have some
spacing and that's also at this inset
box-shadow as we use it on the top bread
so inset - 15 pixels 0 and then c1 5 7 1
1 so we get the same look as we have on
the top some border-radius can't hurt
your tooth though a little bit too edgy
for my taste so add a border radius but
I won't use as round of a corner as we
did further the top Brett
instead the top two corners shouldn't be
rounded also I'll assign a value of zero
but I want to have round corners at the
bottom so I'll use 30 pixels here and I
like this look of course you can have
we're making a little bit less round
with 20 maybe also looks good whatever
you like I'll go back to Ferdie but
again you can tweak this to your needs
and with that we got our bottom rat
style to you this already looks nice in
my opinion but we haven't gotten that
many ingredients so time to add more one
great thing we can already see though is
if I simply duplicate the salad Dampier
well we got two salads in there so that
really works great it's reusable still
let's add more ingredients let's add
bacon below the salad let's add cheese
but maybe start with 2 slices of cheese
and let's add meat here maybe also two
slices these are all the ingredients I
want to support and well build here now
let's add them step
my step let's start with the bacon I'm
going to add this class right below the
sell it so the bacon also of course has
to have a width and here I'll use 80% to
have it as width as the bread you can
make it smaller you can make it bigger
whatever you want the height should be
really small because bacon isn't that
fat at least not from a height
perspective and we also want to assign a
background here and as always I'll use a
linear gradient here tube to have nicer
colors the linear gradient here should
go from bf3 8 1 3 qc4 5e 3/8 like that
and let's also add our margin of two
percentages and audio to Center it
that's my bacon now here I don't
actually have round corners you could
add them you could add rounded corners
here but I like my bacon do you have
rough edges rough corners like it has
here again as always changed as if you
want a different look let me move on to
the cheese and you probably already
understood the pattern we can copy the
code from the bacon here and just adjust
these values for example I want you have
cheese which overlaps or which goes
beyond width of my bread so I'll pick
let's say 91% here the height of the
cheese could be 3% but let's make it
slightly bigger maybe 4.5 and the color
of course is off it should be in the
yellowish reaching so there I'll pick F
4 D 0 0 4 and then d 6b B 2 2 and
obviously I know all these hex codes by
heart
no you simply lock them up and pick a
color you like so that's our background
now for the cheese I want to have round
corners again so I'll add a border
radius here and I'll simply set 20
pixels for all
corners this looks nice to me looks like
nice cheese as always you can tweak it
but I like the look of these cheese
pieces here and that already is the
cheese now of course that's not although
we all to get the meat so I'll duplicate
the cheese because meat also will need
width and height and so on so let me
name this meat here now let's think
about the width I'll go with maybe 78
percent slightly smaller than the bread
I'll give it a height of let's say a
percent you have red but bigger slices
of of meat the background here again
will be a linear gradient and here I
want to go from 7 F 3 6:08 to 702 eo5
for this look off my bread the border
radius may be a little a little bit less
round maybe 15 pixels looks nice to me
and I think the width should be a little
bit bigger maybe 82% yeah that looks
better and with that I'm happy with the
look of my of my meat it looks good to
me I got my meat here looks fine so as
you can see we basically have a lot of
similar properties in all these
ingredients I would just assign
different values for them but besides
that all ingredients work in the same
way what we can also already see us if I
go up to my box and I decrease this to
300 pixels it all adjusts of course the
burger can look a bit skewed depending
on how you set the aspect ratio here but
in general it adjusts nicely so that is
really good I'll go back to what I used
before though now this is the burger in
general but the seeds on the top bread
are missing and the seeds are actually a
bit more work to do we have to look good
so the seat will be wrapped elements in
this bread top death I'll add a seeds
element and a seeds two elements so two
devs with these two different classes
now the reason for this is that I of
course want to have more than one seat
and I will take advantage of a CSS
feature to actually convert each dev
here
into you up to free seats if I want you
but I can't go above these free seats
easily so I'll use this approach and
here how do we make this work I will add
my seats class here below brad's top to
start working with that I want to
position it inside the bread top and I
want to be able to use this like
absolute viewport so I want to use
position:absolute here to really display
or precision these seats as I want now
for absolute referring to my outer div I
need to give my bread top class the
position relative then the next absolute
position will refer to this now we can
start working on the seats
I'll give them a width of 10% and this
will now refer to the width off the
bread top not to the box with and I'll
give my seed let's say a height of 15
percent now I also need to give them
some color and here I will simply use
white as a background color with that we
don't see the seed yet because I also
need to position it I do this with left
and top now I'll try left 30% and top
50% and now we see the seat appear here
30% into the burger and 50% from the top
now of course my seat all you should
have round corners so I'll give it a
border radius of 40% to not have an
entire ellipse but some edges but
overall very round corners now the next
thing is I want to rotate it a little
bit so I'll use the transform property
and then rotate the rotate function and
let's say by minus 20
Griese so that it's not sitting parallel
in parallel on the burger
and finally I'll also give it a box
shadow and inset shadow - 2 pixels - 3
pixels and then let's say C 9 c 9 c 9
which is like a greyish shadow I like
this look here and you can always tweak
these values to reposition the shadow so
that's my first seed but I want to have
more than one and now I'm going to use a
little well trick but not really a trick
I'm using a pseudo selector I'm taking
the seeds class I just worked on and
I'll add the after pseudo selector this
allows me to create a new element which
is displayed after this seed element the
content should be an empty string this
is required to display something though
and then I'll give it a width of 100%
because this will now refer to the seeds
class so to dis with so not 100% of the
bread top but 100% of the width of their
seed and it should be equally sized
therefore 100 percent now height also
will be 100 percent and so leaded like
this and now let's also give this a
position of absolute let's give it a
background color off-white and let's
give it a left position and now this
also refers to the average seat so I'll
use minus 170 70 percent to move it to
the left
170 percent of the width of that
previous seat and let's move it to the
top by minus 260 percent this will move
it up by 2.6 times the height of this
seat now all I need to do is gift is the
the round corners we already used so for
the percent and I want to rotate this
differently so now form this and if I
now to rotate 0 degrees it won't change
because now the default rotation is the
rotation of the element I position it
after so of DC
so now if I wanted to make this well
convert this back to be in parallel to
my bread top I would have to rotate it
by 20 degrees so if I do that its back
to a straight element a straight line I
want to rotate it by 60 degrees though
swear to have it rotate in the opposite
direction essentially and then I'm going
to add a box shadow here also within
said one pixel two pixels and then C 9 c
9 c 9 like this so this is the second
seed I wanted to add now I'll add a
third one and for that I'm going to copy
these seeds after element here paste it
in and change after to the average
pseudo selector before now I can also do
the same and create another seed
visually so all the setup up here is the
same the position changes though I want
to move this to the right so let's use
180 percent and then I want you not push
this up as high so I'll use minus 50%
you move it up then all the rest however
stays the same I'll just adjust the box
shadow to come from an opposite
direction with minus 3 pixels now it's
coming from the bottom what's from the
bottom left and with that that seed also
looks good to me now we can work on the
next seat seeds too because I only have
after and before so I'll need my new
element seeds 2 and seeds 2 of course
just as style as the other seed without
a pseudo selector loss so I'm going to
copy the code from there and paste it
into seeds 2 like this and now let's see
what we have to adjust position absolute
with and height that's all great the
positioning here has to change I'm going
to push this forward to the right with a
distance to the left of 64
and I'll leave top to 50% set to 50%
though
I'll leave the border-radius but I want
to rotate it differently let's say plus
10 degree to have a slight rotation to
the right and adjust the box-shadow -
free pixels then maybe zero and the same
color as before now with that we got
this seat in place now I'll use seeds
after again so let me copy seeds to here
use tea after pseudo selector with as
you learned as height should be 100% now
the position has to change though first
of all let me add some content however
so that we can see something and now
let's move it forward to the right maybe
by pushing this 150 percent to well to
the right away from left and for chop
let me use minus 130 percent you move it
up a little bit
border radius is fine but let me rotate
it by 90 degrees really have it be
rotated totally different and I'll
adjust the shadow to use one pixel three
pixels here to come from the right like
this now with that I got this seat in
place and I'd say this looks like a nice
burger this is the burger we built in
the react app and the burger Boulder in
this react course and I hope you enjoyed
learning how you can't build elements
like this with just CSS this doesn't use
SVG doesn't use any images nothing like
that it's just CSS and as you saw not
even that many CSS properties we're
using so really I hope you liked this
kind of video I hope this was helpful
and hopefully see you in future videos -
you can of course find this code
