framework that makes the creation of
client-side web apps so running in the
browser easier and more fun let's have a
look we have the clients of the browser
and we have a server we send a request
because we enter some URL and visit some
page and we get back a couple of HTML
pages this is how the web traditionally
works now let's swap out the client with
a mobile phone and let's not think about
a web page but about a real mobile app
for a second download it from the App
Store if you think about that app you'll
recognize that it's highly responsive
you get a response almost instantly if
you tap somewhere it's really engaging
you have no page reloads if data needs
to be sent to a server that happens
behind the scenes so you have a user
never see a white screen and things like
that would be nice if we could bring
this feeling to the web to an angular
helps us with that so let's drop two of
the pages and let's assume our server
only returns one page a single page we
build a so-called single page
application and we can do this with just
JavaScript because javascript is the
only language that runs in the browser
after the page has been loaded now we
can use JavaScript to change the page
after it has been loaded and changed
things around re render the page give
the user the illusion of things
happening instantly
so we tap somewhere and with JavaScript
we can instantly change it with just
JavaScript this becomes cumbersome and
difficult and that is very angular comes
into play it makes that easier to
collect your tools that makes building
such apps easier it makes it easy for us
to react to events handle user input
output content rerender parts of the
page or the entire page give the user
feedback and so on it makes it easy for
us to build engaging front-end web
applications with JavaScript without
issues and that's important though we're
talking about the front end angular does
not run on the server it runs in the
browser if you need to send data though
you can do this with the HX request and
you can also send this to a totally
friend server than the one that served
the HTML file so that is possible so
angular is just that a collection of
tools like jQuery but more powerful it
uses JavaScript though angular has one
special thing it uses typescript in
between which is a superset to
JavaScript and compile to JavaScript
it's pretty similar and on a ketamine's
you find a lot of content on angular and
on typescript so that this shouldn't be
an issue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
