board my name is Max and in the last
video of this project series we started
working on our toolbar we learned about
theming and you learn how to create a
responsive navigation here now the
navigation isn't finished though I want
to finish it in this video and I want to
show you how to dynamically populate
your toolbar and your navigation drawer
in this application now for that I'll go
back to the app to view file where I was
working and actually I want to store my
menu the menu set up in a property in my
data property of the view instance so
here I'll add a new property and I'll
name it menu items and this should be an
array now I'll represent each menu item
as a JavaScript object where I expect to
have the icon because I need an icon for
both my drawer as well as my toolbar so
ad icon here and I will also add another
property the title so basically the text
I want to display we can start right
away I can grab the I can we have here
the supervisor account edit here and
save you meet us as a title does that be
my first object my first menu item of
course it's not being displayed right
now but we'll build your menu here and
then we'll display it so next I can
duplicate this and now it's all about
finding fitting icons and assigning
titles now for this application I
already searched for a couple of icons
you can of course search the material
icons page I showed in the last video of
the series to find the one you like the
most
the next item I want to add in the menu
is the room icon this is a fitting icon
for the organized meetup menu item which
will later allow us to go to the page
where we create a new meter duplicate
this thereafter I want to have the
person icon which is a fitting icon for
the menu point of profile of the user
profile which you should be able to
visit fruit
is button here in the end then I'm going
to duplicate just twice again the fourth
item actually should be face and this
should be the signup menu item and the
last one lock underscore open for
sign-in is there
well last menu item I want to add now
here's an important note in this
application I'll of course a doth
indication later and once we have that
implemented will only show menu items
which make sense
so for authenticated users we want to
show the first free and for adult
finical users the last two because on
opening credits users certainly need to
sign up or sign in before they can do
something with our application so this
is the setup I want to use now we have
two menu items stored in this array now
I want you output them dynamically here
in the template how do you output
content dynamically in a view chase
application how do you output an array
dynamically well with v4 so to the
wrapping list I'll which holds our
action in the text we can add v4 and
simply loop for our items so I'm looping
fruity oops
menu items here the menu items property
we just created it is a good practice to
assign a key then so lets dynamically
bind a key for each loop item and I'll
use item title which will be a unique
string so it makes up for a good key and
then I can start replacing your
hard-coded values here with the dynamic
ones like item icon referring to that I
can property we set up down there in our
items and of course replace the text
with item title here with that let's do
the same for the toolbar
here we got our buttons through which I
want to loop so v4 and then again item
in menu items assign a key here item
title and replace both the icon and the
text so I Adam icon and item
title like that let's save just let's
see if we worked as it should we have a
look at our application this looks are
kind of good I think we have some fixing
to do regarding the width of our toolbar
they will keep in mind in the final
application there will only be a maximum
of three items displayed because will
either have sign up and sign in being
hidden because we're authenticated or
yabber free because we're not
authenticated so actually it's not a
problem in the final application if I
decrease this in width and have a look
at the drawer this looks good q with
that we got our design finished or the
toolbar finished we got our items added
of course none of them does anything we
haven't set up routing so that will be
the task we have to check on next add
routing to your application to make sure
we can actually go somewhere when we
click these items so let's tackle
routing next we already have to router
install since we chose to do so when we
set up this project and we got one route
route by default the hello route
components hello file here and we don't
actually see that being displayed the
reason for this is that we have no
router view so let's start by reading
that in the apt of you fall in the main
section let's add router view here and
let's save this now we see our welcome
page this is what we started with now I
of course I want to use that I want to
use my own pages I will go back to the
application therefore and remove the
hello the view fall and I want to add
some other components there now here
I'll first of all create a subfolder a
subfolder named meetup with a capital M
here that's the naming convention I'm
going to follow here and in that folder
I want to store all the meetup related
components I'll also create another
folder named user where I want to store
the user related components and then on
the root level
I'll trade a file home dot view so
that's going to be to be the home page
on which we start eventually in that
home page I'll add a template
so therefore now we're I'll simply say
the homepage and I'll start with a
simple template like this and all the
components for now we'll then fill them
with life throughout this project let me
copy that
template and in the meetup folder I now
also want to create some fitting pages
which will need oops another directory
though here I'll first of all treat a
meet-up stub you file which will be the
page we visit when we want to see a list
of all meetups so let me quickly create
that file open it and paste in the same
content here I'll say the meetups page
of course now whenever we click there we
are on the meetups page
we all set a page to create a new meetup
though so I'll also create a new file d
create meetup the view file this
component here will actually contain my
create meetup page now the next
component I want to add is in the user
folder because there we also have a
profile a signup and a sign-in page so
let's add the profile that view file in
that user folder and as a side note
I'll later reorganize these files and
structure them a bit differently but for
now this will do so here we'll have the
user page then I'll also add the sign in
dot view file here let's add that the
sign-in page and finally let's add a
third file here sign up that view and
let let's add you sign up page here what
that I got all the pages I need for now
again we'll of course work on them
throughout the project now we can
register our routes in the index chest
file in the router folder as a side note
if you're wondering how that gets into
our project and you may not chase fault
we are importing that file web pack
simply is configured to automatically
fetch the indexed up J's file if we're
just referencing a folder as we are here
so this could be completed to slash
index but again web completes it
automatically in this setup here and
then the router which is exported in
that file keep in mind we're using the
router
we're exporting a new router that is
simply added as a router to a root view
instance so this is how that comes
together now in that router I want to
register more routes or different routes
the root path for example should lead to
the home component so first of all I
have to overwrite this import I'll
import home and you can assign any name
you want here from components home
here's another neat feature this
specific web peg set of offers us we
have an alias for the root folder the
root folder in the source project I
should say so at slash refers to Soros
which is why with add slash components
we reach this file here and there I'm
now importing the home valve dot view
also gets added automatically
so importing home get a couple of our
files and need for example meetups here
under components and there is under meet
up meet ups dot view refer it to this
file next I'll also import the create
meetup component from the create meetup
file in the same folder and then from
the user folder I'll need the profile
component so here that's from slash user
here the profile that view file is what
we're referencing and then we get the
sign up from user to sign up file and of
course to sign in file which I'll store
in a sign in variable here now what G is
all imported I can start adding routes
the first route I'll give it a name of
home and the name is optional you don't
have to assign a name we can simply omit
it here I guess I won't use it but we'll
see you can use a name to navigate them
instead of the path so I'll leave the
name for now and I'll add a new route
here here I want to set up a path of
slash meet-ups and I want to load a
component the meetups component of
course can also assign a name here
meetups to stay in line with the other
set up then a new path is meetup slash
new maybe and for
you can choose any parts you would
prefer oops don't forget to get the
comma here after the name I'll add a
name here of create Meetup
and I'll load the component create
meetup like that I'll add another route
here with a pop of slash profile I'll
give it a name of you guessed it
profile and I'll load a component here
the profile component finally we're at
the last two routes here these sign up
pop should load a component where route
loaded named sign up and I'll use my
sign up component here and finally the
last route I know you'll love adding
routes is slash sign in with the name of
sign in it's super hot here by the way
so that really is fun to record this so
let's add sign in here these are the
routes I'm going to use in this
application let's actually see if it
works we get the router view we got
routes so if we go there and we enter
slash sign in now click that we see the
sign in page if we add whoops slash sign
up there we see the setup page now
regarding that navigation drawer which
kept occurring that was related to the
way we load our routes um we could of
course also prevent this but I don't
want to use this route style
anyways using this hash Bank symbol and
therefore having a different section for
client side and server side routes this
development server actually is
configured to fall back to that
index.html file in case of 404 errors
anyways so we can use the prettier URL
style which you can set up in our
index.js file on the router after the
routes all set mode to a string which is
history and this uses the HTML file
history mode which is just a slash so
just these normal routes here instead of
a hash tag in between and as I mentioned
your server needs to be configured to
handle this because if your server is
not
this route obviously is always resolved
first on the server and it won't be
found there because we only set it up on
a client so your server needs to return
the client in 404 error cases please to
return the index.html file in such cases
so that your index.html file can take
over and can handle that route this will
become important later once you deploy
this application so far so good though
we have the routing setup
now let's hook up all these links so
that it actually works so back in the
app thoughtyou file here i want to
assign links to all my routes right and
we again need to do this of course in
our menu items here in the code so there
I'll quickly add a link property to all
of them and links should be a string now
for view meetups this should just be
meetups for organizing me that that
should be slash meetup new for the
profile that should be slash profile and
for signup it should be slash sign up
for sign in it of course should be slash
sign in having the links here is nice we
also need to get them into our template
though there's one other thing I want to
link up there the title if you click the
tile I when I go back to the root page
so here I'll actually also sign a link
to the title here and you can view this
by wrapping the dev meetup here into
something you know from vanilla UJS so
to say because it is what I love you
chairs a router link element so that's
not beautified that's when they love you
here we turn this into a link by adding
router link to that meetup we're
wrapping it in - to be precise then we
set Q and I'll just set it to slash and
that actually is it for now I want to
give it a tag of span though so that I'm
not using anchor tag to make it look
nicer and with that I'll also add a
style where I set the cursor to a
pointer so that we again get this
hovering in fact this this pointer when
we hover over it with that now you can
see it looks like a link works like a
link you'll also notice though that this
navigation drawer again pops up so time
to
this issue we can simply fix it by
adding the temporary directive to the
drawer which basically means that it's
not always present it tries to add it
otherwise if the page loads so with that
if we now save this and let's go to
another page first and click that link
again now we're back without the drawer
opening so that's all working but our
links still aren't hooked up so let's go
back there and now I want you add some
links now for that we need to link our
list tiles and our buttons here let's
start with the list tiles
I'll wrap these items here over multiple
lines and then we can add a useful
property or directive to that can add
router to the list how to inform you
defied that a click on this should use
the router and then the queue property
to bind to something now here we won't
just pass a string instead we need to
bind to the item link add a colon
because we need to add a dynamic value
here the link of the current item if we
do this and we shrink this application
so that we can see the drawer and we
click on profile now you see the user
page click on organize meetup to create
main media page and so on so now this is
working as it should and it's kind of
similar for the tool bar there I also
want to connect the router to it so it's
on the button now I'll also organize
that over multiple lines and here to the
button we also add the router directive
and you can't add this to any component
but too many - I am components where it
typically make sense to navigate and
just as before we also need to set Q and
bind this to item linked with that if we
now reload this click on View Madhav's
you see that all seems to work fine here
get the basic setup of our navigation
was a lot of work but with that we're
now well-prepared to start working on
the individual pages and I want to start
with the home page and this caruso of
different
