welcome to a really cool video because
so far in this series we worked in HTML
so we added content to our website right
here
and although adding content is fun I
think what's also fun is adding style to
your website and we will do that in this
and in the next videos of the series by
using CSS cascading style sheets now in
this video we will have a first look at
the theory and apply some first styling
steps to our website and well I cannot
wait to start that together with you
right now
so before we go back to our code let's
first have a look at this question why
CSS why cascading style sheets well you
kind of know the answer already but I
think it makes sense to type a little
bit into the theory before we go back to
the code now we use CSS for the
following reason basically because at
the moment we have HTML and because of
that our page looks something like this
now we have all the content in it which
is totally fine but style mm I'm not
sure I don't think this looks really
good
so how can we now change this into that
so into a page with as I would say a
little bit more style in it well the
answer is of course we need HTML plus
CSS now the question is how can we
achieve that how can we use CSS to style
this page and the answer is well if we
think back about our HTML code and all
these different elements well this might
be the key to achieve that because if we
look at Mike's world for example right
here we can of course find Mike's world
also in our stylized or into our web
page with the applied CSS right here so
there is kind of a connection apparently
and this connection by the connection I
mean the way CSS interacts with HTML can
be achieved via the elements in this
case this could be the header element or
inside the header element we have the h1
element if we go back to our code you
remember we have the header element
right there and inside we have the h1
element Mike's world so if we would be
able to kind of access or select these
elements well then this could be kind of
a way to define that the header for
example should have this purple
background and that the form color
should be white for Mike's world that's
one example but let's have a look at
another one because right here this part
of our website we
also have different elements and we can
also find this part again in our website
with the applied CSS now which elements
to behave right here
well these elements could be first the
main element because this defines the
element which includes all the content
in here and the content that we have in
this main element is basically an
unordered list let's have a look at the
code again and right here we have the
main element right there here we have
the unordered list we also have to list
right here and paragraph but we'll talk
about that later the important thing now
is if we go back to the slide that we
should be able to access or again select
the different elements to be able to
apply specific Styles to them now
because of that it probably makes sense
to have a look at the syntax of CSS but
before we do that let's think about one
question why is it actually called
cascading style sheets well the answer
is again quite simple actually cascading
simply means that if you think about
Decius s code from top to bottom that
the latest code or the latest styling
defined is applied about to remember
that let's say you define the styling of
an h1 element right here let's say you
say the phone color should be white like
in that case so you write this code on
top of your CSS code then at the bottom
at the last code line off is ESS code
you again specify a styling for an h1
element this time you define that the
phone color should be yellow therefore
the phone color won't be white anymore
because of the cascading structure of
CSS the last definition of that element
will be applied and by that the phone
color would be yellow now of course
there are more things or some more
things that we have to think about but
for the moment let's not make things too
complicated let's keep it like that and
let's now think about the syntax before
we go back to our code because the CSS
syntax basically looks well like this
well now you say okay
I have free words there I have some
curly braces a colon and a semicolon
what should I do with that well let's
have a look at this step by step because
the combination of what you can see
right here is the CSS code and this is
basically a rule so a CSS rule okay now
what are the components or the different
parts of this rule when the first part
is this header right here and if you
remember we just saw this header or we
know this header actually as an element
of our HTML code and that's the
interesting thing with CSS we can simply
select and therefore it's called a
selector the different elements of our
HTML code now CSS or the selectors are
not limited to the elements only but
we'll talk about other items you can
select in your code later throughout the
series for the moment let's just assume
that with the selector we can select the
different elements of our HTML code now
we need the curly braces as you can see
it right here and after the curly braces
we start a new line and then we see the
next word this case this is color now
what's that now well the color is simply
the property and the property in CSS
will basically defines what do you want
to change in this case we want to change
the color the property of our header
element so we selected the header
element of our HTML code
second thing property after property we
need another thing this red right here
now what's the red well you have a
property but you need to define a value
for the property because you want to
change the color I understood that but
which color and that's the reason why we
need that value right here and the
combination of the property and the
value so this part right here is simply
called that declaration important as you
can see it right here make sure to add
the colon right here after the property
and also don't forget to add the
semicolon after the value and in
and in the third line right here you can
see that you have to close the curly
braces of course but this is it actually
this is the basic syntax and the basic
idea how CSS works anything with that
theoretical background we can now go
back to our code and have a look at CSS
from a more practical perspective
actually so let's go back so I am back
on our webpage or in the code of our
webpage and if we look at it again well
we can see that it looks like this
now let's maybe focus onto this Mike's
world part right here we know that this
is the header it's maybe also open the
chrome developer tools like that
and by that navigate to the header right
here so this is the part we want to
focus on too right now now back to the
code and well now we know how CSS code
generally works or what it looks like
but where it should be added in our
index.html file well the thing is we
have two options how we can add CSS code
to our index.html file or better set to
our project in general let's have a look
at the first or one approach first and
this approach simply means adding your
entire CSS code to the index.html file
this leads us to the question where
should we add that well if you think
back about the logic of our HTML file
then you know that in the body element
we only want to have the content of the
page but as CSS is not really a content
it's totally optional because it only
adds styling to it but the page would
work totally fine without any CSS well
therefore it definitely has to go to the
head element and not three body element
which would mean that it is a real
content of the page so we should add CSS
right here now let's do this and well
what do we need now we need style so if
we type style right here we can see that
project studio code already shows it to
us so by pressing tab and maybe adding
some lines right here we can start
writing our first CSS code now how do we
start remember the first thing we need
is a selector and the selector should be
the header now we just talked about that
like that so we got the header what do
we then need you need the curly braces
and now let's type enter to start a
second line and what do we need them do
you remember we need the property so
basically what do we want to change in
this case we want to change the color
like that as you can see you have lots
of different properties available in CSS
but we will talk about that later let's
now focus on through color and press tab
as you can see the colon was added
automatically and now we need a value
for the color and this value could be
read like we had it in our example don't
forget to add the semicolon now like
that now if we save that and go back to
our website it's reloaded well then you
can see up here that Mike's world or the
font color of Mike's world now turned
into red and this simply happened
because we defined that CSS code right
here now can we add more properties of
course we can let's simply add a new
line or go to a new line and now say
background as you can see you have lots
of different options available again so
we will select background color like
that and now we will specify a color but
now we will use hex code because that's
also possible in CSS so we simply type
hash and now let's use five - one seven
five one and add a semicolon let's maybe
also change the color up here and simply
type white for example like that now we
got that let's save that again let's go
back to our side and we loaded and as
you can see now we defined the
background color of Mike's world and the
form color of Mike's world that was
actually quite easy and you might also
wonder well how should I know
which properties are available how
should a navigate through that jungle of
CSS well the answer is first it's not
that difficult because you will learn it
step by step
also in this video series of course
and additionally we again have the mdn
the Mozilla developer Network and in the
MDM you can find the CSS reference right
here a link to the CSS reference is of
course also attached down there in a
video description but if you have a look
at that and scroll down well then you
can see all the different properties
available in CSS well and now you might
say whoa how should I deal with that
that's a lot well as I just said no
worries
you won't need all of them of course you
will dive into that step-by-step and
basically use some of the main
properties most of the time for example
we used the color property and you can
find the color property right there now
we're gonna dive into all of these
properties now of course throughout the
series but into some of them in this
video I only want to show you one more
property and this property is this one
here the font size right there now let's
go back to our page right here and maybe
change the font size now of Mike's world
so let's go back to our code and let's
not change it by working in the header
but let's now add another selector the
h1 selector open the curly braces and
now specify font size let's say this
should be 20 pixels I will talk about
the different options we have right here
because we don't have only pixels of
course regarding the size in the next
videos for now let's just keep it with
the pixels so if we save that and go
back and reload the page we can see that
the font size changed that makes sense
right because you remember if we go back
to the header right here we can see that
inside the header there we have the h1
element and we applied this font size
now to the h1 element now let's go back
and let's think about another thing
because what happens now if I change the
color right here let's say to yellow
like that what do you think is going to
happen now
because actually we defined the color
appear in the header so if you go back
now reload now the font color changed to
yellow and you remember that cascading
approach I just talked about because we
first specified the color in the header
but after that we have the h1 element
and inside this element we now specify
that deform color should be yellow now
that's not the only important thing
right here additionally we know that h1
right there is nested inside this header
element this also has an impact on to
the way these styling is applied to the
different elements but this is something
we will dive deeper into in the next
video for the moment just keep in mind
that the definition up here for the
header element can be overwritten by
this h1 element h1 selector in that case
and because of that we can also say that
we delete that color up here because we
basically don't need it and maybe change
the font color right there back to white
now if you go back and we load it we can
see that Mike's world is white again now
talking about specific elements there is
one less thing that I would like to
change in this basics video because if
we jump back to our page once again you
can see that this contact right there
this link has this underscore right
there and I don't like that to be honest
I would like to remove that to do that
we go back to our code add another
selector this time I will add a e4
anchor because do you know why because
the anchor and let me create the curly
braces first like that because the
anchor is right here the element that we
have inside our list and the anchor has
a specific style automatically applied
and this style is for example that blue
color and an underscore this means if I
now refer to the anchor with my selector
and now say text - decoration and set it
equal with a value of none
save that now reload that you can see
that the underscore disappeared and as
you just learned if we now go back right
here define the color and make it black
maybe like this then we can also see
that our contact link now is black so
this is actually what I wanted to show
you regarding the basics of CSS we will
dive into a lot more detail in the next
videos of this series because as you can
see apparently we can refer to different
elements we can also refer to nested
elements and this all impacts the way
our style or our CSS code is applied now
for this video that's all the code I
would like to apply but there is one
thing that you can already see because
writing the code this way has two issues
actually the first issue is that well if
you apply CSS for more elements right
here well this kind of gets messy
because we have all that CSS code up
here and you have to scroll down to the
HTML well not really comfortable at all
another problem is the following
if I go back to the page right here
maybe close to developer tools now and
then go to contact to open our second
page no styling is applied at all
because how should it be we added all
our CSS code right here in the main
index.html file therefore our contact
HTML file right here has no styling
applied at all so what we should do is
we should actually copy that code paste
it into the image HTML HTML file right
here and then it would be applied but
imagine that wouldn't make any sense
because every time you change something
in your styling that should be applied
to both pages you have to return your
code again and again so this doesn't
make any sense and of course there is a
better solution for that and this is the
second approach how we can add CSS to
our project that I talked about some
minutes ago because the second approach
simply means that we
create a separate CSS file how can we do
this well as always we go to the
Explorer right here click right here to
create a new file maybe not in the
contact folder sorry for that so I just
press escape
let's click right here and now create
the file right there in the main folder
and call it style dot CSS just as you
prefer the important thing is that CSS
ending right here now what we can do is
we can go to index.html and delete the
style element right here and right there
now copy all that code or not copy cut
it actually and paste it right here into
our style.css file like that
now back to in XHTML we can get rid of
these empty lines and with that if we
save this and if we save that we can see
the dot disappeared and if we go back to
our page to home hmm we can see that our
style is gone now wise is happening well
because how should be in this HTML file
and now know that it should use that
style because there is no reference at
all if you look at our code we have that
style.css file but well how should
index.html know that it should apply the
style to different elements in there
and because of that we have to add
another information to our HTML file to
make sure that this style is applied
correctly and where do we add that
information well again we add it in the
head of course and what do we do right
here well we simply need to create a
link to our style CSS file and already
set it actually we simply have to write
link right here press tab now stylesheet
is totally correct
and the hyper reference is simply style
dot CSS like that let's save that and
don't forget to copy that and also add
it right here in the second index.html
file so in our contact HTML file
basically because otherwise the second
page so the contact page would be
without any style
and this is something that we don't like
however another thing we learned that in
the last video we work with relative
paths right here therefore we have to
add dot dot slash to navigate back up to
the main folder right there and
therefore being able to access this
style dot CSS file now if we also save
that right here and go back to our page
and reload it we can see that Mike's
world is now well formatted correctly
correct colors and if we go to contact
we can see that the same style is
applied right there and with that we
actually understood the basics of CSS
and we saw how we can use CSS on our
website now of course we will dive
deeper in the next videos into CSS and
show what else we can do and one really
important concept therefore will be
covered in the next video when we will
talk about boxes boxes and CSS are a
really important concept that you
definitely have to understand to become
a real CSS expert so I hope to see you
in the next video and as always the only
thing I can say right now is thanks a
lot for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
