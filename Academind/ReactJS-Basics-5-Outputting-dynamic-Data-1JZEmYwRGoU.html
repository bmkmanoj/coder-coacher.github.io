multiple components
- well nest em in each other and to
create a replication with different
components which of course is an
important step but we not only want to
display static contents or a static HTML
code here we also want to display
dynamic content and react.js makes this
very easy you can output dynamic content
in your template or in your render
method here by using curly braces single
curly braces that's important especially
if you're coming from an angular 2
background for example in these curly
braces you can write any valid
JavaScript expression for example 2 + 2
+ if I save this and then go back well
you see I got 4 here so that is how I
can output things here now what will
happen if I do this let's say I write a
multi-line expression like that that
doesn't work so you have to keep it to
one line but in the one line you may
write whatever you want if you have more
complex logic what you want a writer
that you would output you can do this in
the render method here before for
example half if condition and then do
something like flat or you don't have a
variable let content equals an empty
string for example and then you just
assign content to be whatever you want
it to be lets say a paragraph whoops no
a paragraph where you say hello well
then you could do it like that and then
simply output the content variable here
which allows you to output hello since
true is of course always true and here I
would have a more complex check outside
of the return function and only output
content the variable in my well retorted
function but again with the single curly
braces enticing
embraces are important here of course so
again signal calling races allow you to
output variables or output any code your
result of any cure you have in between
them could also be a string for example
that would also work if I save this well
then we see hello here
so again between the curly braces that
will be run as javascript code important
thing to keep in mind it may only be one
line you can use ternary expressions
though so you could check check
something like 5 equals 2 and if that is
the case then you output yes otherwise
you output no that would work and that
should display no of course since 5
isn't equal to 2 so that will work but
again it has to be one line and then you
can output any calculation or any other
variable and that is especially
important for the next video where I
will talk about props what props are and
how to use them and then you will see
many things off the well things I just
show you so see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
