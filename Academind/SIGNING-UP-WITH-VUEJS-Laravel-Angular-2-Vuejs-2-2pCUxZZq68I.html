this series now in the last videos we
set up our back end and we implemented
back an authentication so that we're not
able to create any quotes if we're not
locked in in the very last video so we
did this in angular 2 we added some
views which allow the user to sign up
and sign in and sent this token to the
server and now we're going to do the
same thing with view chess now for this
I opened the application you're in view
chess and if we open up the developer
tools and the console you see that if we
treat try to create a new quote like
here and you quote and we send this we
get an error and this error occurs
because well we're not authenticated
we're not sending a token with the
request so we need to make sure that we
do a sense at your token and for that as
mentioned before we need to sign up a
user I'll go back into my view chairs
project for this and I think it makes
sense you create a new component for
this because we have components for
creating quotes and seeing all the
quotes now signing up a user is brand
new task and therefore destroys its own
component so I'm just going to call this
signup dot view and in this file here I
of course need a template as an every
view component and of course we're going
to have a script section where we handle
the submission of this form so in the
template I'm going to create a form
element without an action of course
because we don't want to send HTTP
requests which would be the default if
we leave the action on that but instead
we want to handle the form submission
through view chess now four days for
more for the signup process we need a
couple of fields like the user name the
email and the password so I'm going to
use some bootstrap classes since we
install the bootstrap CSS framework in
this project here so the first thing
which I'm going to add here is a div
with a form Group CSS class on it this
is normal bootstrap CSS class and then
there we're going to have a label for
our user name or we say user name for
example and below that a input field and
this input field will be of type text
and it will be or will have a ID of user
name a name of user name and we'll have
a class of form control just to give it
some styling now with this with gooch as
we want to bind this user name to a
property of our view chairs instance
here therefore in the script section and
of course exporting my view chairs
object in this component
and they're all at the data method and
there we are always returning this data
object on this data object I'll add a
user name property which by default is
just an empty string and with that added
we can add the v-model directive to this
input and bind it to our user name data
field and I'm just going to format this
a bit differently so that it's easier to
read now with that in place we're
fetching the first field the first data
point we need the user name now let's
quickly duplicate this to also fetch the
email and T password now for the email
here I'm of course going to change the
ID and name of this to email let's also
put email or just mail on the label here
and let's change the property to which
we bind to email you now clearly we
haven't created that yet so let's
quickly add in our data field down there
email which is empty by default - and
then here for the password I'm going to
do this a very same change the type cube
password here and of course put password
on the label and bind to the password
data property again we need of course we
need to add this down there now another
thing I'm going to change is that I'll
set the type of my email from text to
email here just you get some built-in
validation and that's some important
step we could add a better validation
here with some third-party package
because view chess itself doesn't
include validation we could add a
package like V validate I'm not going to
do this year since I really want to
focus on the signup process but that
would be a great enhancement of this to
make sure that if the user enters some
wrong data you instantly show an error
or something like that
now with that we're binding all the
inputs we do have our form the missing
piece of course is that we need a button
to submit this form so I'll make this of
type submit and simply say sign up on
the button let's give it some bootstrap
styling like button button primary and
they're important let's add a click
listener and honest' click listener I'm
going to add a modifier with dot prevent
now what this does is it makes sure that
once we click this button we're not
doing the default of submitting the form
it prevents the default that is white
called prevent and instead we only
execute with the code we specify here so
I want to execute you let's say sign up
method you can call this whatever you
like so let's add this method here in
our view object under the methods object
I'm going to add sign up as a method and
this is going to get executed whenever
we can well click this button and try to
submit our form now before I continue
with this let's quickly hook this sign
up component up in our routing so that
we can actually see if it looks all
right so I'm going to add a new route
here in our routes array path could be
just well let's say sign up and we load
the sign up component which I of course
need to import here so at the top below
the average components here I'm going to
import sign up from top slash components
sign up dot view with that we do have
this route registered and in our
application if I now go at you slash
sign up here we see this form and yeah
it's a bit broad but you could of course
narrow it down but it has all the fields
looks alright and if we hit the button
right now nothing should happen which is
the case so this is looking good we
prevent the default now let's send this
HTTP request to actually create the user
on the backend or well before doing this
let me quickly add entry to our menu so
that we actually can go to the signup
page without having to type it in the
address bar so two slash sign up and
then simply add sign up here as a text
and with that we have a more convenient
way of going there yeah there it is
let's add a pipe symbol in between just
for styling reasons that looks alright
now to the HTTP requests we already send
HTTP requests for example when we submit
a new quote we use X yes for this and of
course you could use another package but
yeah I of course will stick to access
sets we already use it in this project
and we see how we can send a post
request here with the post method now we
also know which route to target I'm in
the backend code the label code in this
case here and there we created a couple
of user lighted routes these two routes
here now here I have to slash user
route and that is the route which when
receiving a post request will try to
sign a user up to create a user
targeting this signup method in the
controller so it's a post request to
slash user which will initialize you
signup process on the backend
therefore I'm simply going to copy this
code from the new quote component and
added an ease signup method in the
signup component with this we're always
there of course I need to import
Axios so I'm going to copy this import
statement here too so that we can use it
in this file
let me quickly put it in here and of
course the route is not correct
we shouldn't target API slash quotes we
should target API slash user or was it
users no just users so that is the route
we should target and the con that we
send of course is a different one tune
if we have a look at our back-end at the
controller which will receive this
request there's just a user controller
and their design up method we see that
we require a name an email and a
password so we should make sure that
these three fields are there when we
send a request so the name should of
course keep or hold our username the
email should store our well email and
the password should of course send this
password the user entered which we store
in this data property here so this looks
alright one more thing we need to do
though we have some validation in place
on the back end here which is very
important because we don't want to
create a user if any of these data
fields is not valid if email is not an
email or something like that so in order
for this to work correctly and for
lateral to identify that we're sending a
request via Ajax we need to set a
specific header and we do this by
passing a third argument to the post
method which also is a JavaScript object
where we can configure this request
now you could pass a lot of
configuration to that the configuration
we need here is the headers field and as
a side note if you want to find out more
about the possible configuration you can
pass of course the official page on
github about X's it's the right place to
get started now the headers field here
simply takes an option
as a value and there we need one
specific header and this is X requested
with we already sent this header in the
angular 2 front that you of course need
to do it here to the value of this field
of this property is the xml httprequest
to simply tell our back-end that this
ascends yhx requests now with this in
place we should be able to submit this
and to sign a user up so let's see if
this works as expected by opening up the
console
let me quickly clear it here and then
I'm just going to choose any user name
here and enter let's say a test email
address some password here
let's hit submit and this looks alright
we get back an answer where these status
text is created let's also have a look
at the database and there if we open up
the users table we clearly see that an
user was created the date looks about
right and we see that all the data was
stored the data we entered so with that
we create the user on the back end now
let me quickly show you what happens if
we send invalid data like for example
omitting the @ sign in the email address
if I hit sign up now we correctly get
back this error with status code 422 and
processable entity now of course you
could catch this error we already do
catch it actually but of course you
could use this error now to show a modal
to display it in the view here in our
template I'm not going to do this here
though because I really just wanted to
focus on submitting the data and that
works we're able to sign up a user now
that we have such a user on the backend
we can use this in the next video where
we will actually implement a sign-in
functionality to not only create users
but to use them to issue JWT tokens to
the front-end before we then have a look
at sending those tokens see you there
