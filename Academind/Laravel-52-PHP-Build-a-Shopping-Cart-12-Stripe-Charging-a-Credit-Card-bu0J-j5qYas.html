which we fetched here right which we
validated on the arm front end I go to
my product controller and I will create
a new function which I'll name public
function post checkout keep in mind this
is the action I'm referring to in the
routes file post check out here and this
post check out method here will actually
take a request or the request being and
check that into it since it is a post
route and with that I can now handle the
request which will have this hidden
stripe token send with it keep that in
mind to actually make a charge for this
I will first again check if we do have a
shopping cart just as security check at
the very beginning and kind the user
gets to this route or any other strange
way if we do have all that or don't want
to return a view though I want to return
a redirect redirect to a route named
shop shopping cart I think you all to
this route here I will redirect this
route so that's my security check but if
we do have a cart
well then I want to continue you already
know the steps with the old card and a
new card right this pattern we use
throughout this application and next I
want to use stripe now I can do this by
simply adding the import at the top here
use stripe slash stripe this is
important this line and then you can
access all these stripe methods here
basically now what does stripe offer me
well I can set my API key remember on
the front end and you check out dot J as
file we set this publishable key now on
the back end we need to set the secret
key and you can get the secret key from
your account the account settings the
API keys tab here and well I need to
login again
just a little security better and then
here it is hidden and for in the video
it is hidden it will be visible to you
just copy this key go back to your app
and then paste it in here now I'm not
doing it right now I will do it later so
that they don't have to blur this out
all out in post-production
that's all the reason but you may
already copy in your key right now and
then I will have a try-catch block where
I will try to make this charge so I will
make tripod using stripe create and then
try to make this charge however how does
this work let's go back to the
documentation let's have a look at the
API libraries and then here you can see
we get the PHP page and you can check
out the PHP API Docs as the link says
here you have a convenient way of
learning how to make a charge so let's
click on charges create a charge and on
the right you see an example request and
we already set the IP Ikey but now it's
time to create charge this part here now
as you saw I already created stripe
create I will now just copied that here
the argument an array and pass this
array Tudor's stripe create method now
of course amount shouldn't be 400
instead it should be card total price
now here's an important catch though
stripe will use sense as its default
unit now since the default unit in our
application however is well dollars I
need to multiply it with 100 otherwise
if it costs $40 in our app I would only
charge 40 cents on stripe I'll set the
currency to u.s. dollar and regarding
this toe kit here this of course is just
dummy data we need to use token send
with the request this token stored in
the hidden input field added fruity
checkout dot J's file so there's tope we
got back from stripe then we validated
to credit card information so here I
will basically access
request input and then stripe token
which is simply the name this hidden
input fillable 1/2 if you have a look at
your checkout J's file you see that it
has this name stripe token so that's all
I'm doing here I'm accessing this token
here and now the description set it to
whatever you want I will name a test
charge again this is freely settable by
you of course in a real application you
would probably set it to the user name
product ID whatever whatever you like
since we have a try plug here I also
need a catch block here I will get my
exception slash exception no import
needed here just slash exception built
in PHP exception and I want to basically
show this exception I will redirect to
the checkout route again and then I will
redirect with a message which I store in
the error object and then I want to
print DD error there so oops no string
instead II get message so just a message
of a potential error I got here of
course here no arrow should be used by
the comma since we have multiple
arguments here and with that I'm just
using again this charge error
div I set up earlier and I'm now
handling the case that the charge is not
successful as well next if well if I'm
reaching this point I'm not returning so
it seems like the charge was successful
because I'm not in the catch block
otherwise I would have left this
function here right next are therefore
want to forget my card which basically
means delete it from the session because
we checked out I don't want it to be
there anymore now of course I'm not
really storing the order in the database
right now that's something I'll add in
the future because currently we would
get the money but we we wouldn't do
anything else the customer probably
wouldn't be too happy but
now I would simply clear D card from the
session and then I will return a
redirect to another route let's say the
product oops the product index route so
this index page with let's say a success
message so with success successfully
purchased products like this that could
be a success message we show now in
order to show this message I need to
adjust my index page a little bit so
this index the plight or PHP file there
I will need to add something right after
entering my content here before and
looping through all the products I want
to enter a bootstrapper oh and then
let's basically say Col sm6 call MD for
just some food strips styling column
positioning here again call MD offset
for and call SM offset free something
like that and I will create a new div
here with an idea of charge error or
let's say charge message whatever you
want class alert and alert success
because it will show me cell success
messages in the end and then I will just
print session get success here but of
course I only want to show this if well
if my session has the success object
inside of it otherwise there is no
reason to show this block here so that
allows me to print out a success message
whenever we are successful and now we're
making this charge here now for me it's
time to enter my private key and with
that we should be good to go and see if
that all works so I will reload my
checkout page here I still have a valid
shopping
now I will fill in my my data here now
regarding stripe I will go back to the
our documentation here to the very
starting getting started page here to
just use that dummy data here it is
dummy
credit card number which has the right
amount of digits enter this here give it
any valid expiration month in here so in
the future it should be any free ditches
CVC here and click buy now and create
call to end the find function
controllers create it doesn't like that
let's see what's wrong yeah I definitely
need an extra colon here and I still got
a problem here I'm leaving this
individual because I think it might be
helpful the create method here is not
available on the stripe object here
instead it is available on stripe slash
charge however this wouldn't work too
because now I just need charge now in
order to use charge though I need to
import it and I need to import it from
slide stripe slash charge so I do have
to imports needed stripe slash stripe
and stripe / charge over solve that
before excuse me but I think it's
helpful to see this error here and you
will see that you will need to be
careful and that we are using two
different well pieces of the stripe
package here the overall stripe package
to set the key and then the charged part
of it to make the charge so back to the
application if I now hit submit we got
the successful purchase and if I reload
the page here in my dashboard at test
dashboard we should see yes
before we had 20 euros and my case years
since I'm in Europe and now as you can
see we made an 18 dollar purchase today
which I think makes sense since we
bought two books which each costs $10
and if you convert this to dollar do you
euros 18 euros sound
about right so this is how you can
charge with stripe as I said currently
we're not storing the order information
we're not able to really ship something
we're also doing this anonymous keep
that in mind the user is not locked in
which is one of the reasons why we're
not storing the order information so
there is still room for improvement but
you saw how stripe works and how to use
it and I hope this is useful and now you
might already try out implementing it
with a locked-in user instead of an
anonymous one and actually storing the
well-ordered
information in the database but I will
also do this in the next videos see you
there
