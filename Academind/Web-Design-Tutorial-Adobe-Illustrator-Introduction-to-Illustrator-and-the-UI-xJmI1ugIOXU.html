illustrator tree now this video I want
to quickly go over the more I of our
illustrator application here and I could
make this week of class two hours
because this why this very complex and
has a lot of features a lot of things we
use and I can make it shorter what I
decided to make it shorter because the
best way you learn how to use a tool
application is by my building things by
working with it and then you will figure
out things and you will see however it's
we will remember it because you just
used it so if I now start telling you
what each button does chances are even
have forgotten and when's this video
spinach therefore I'll just give you a
brief introduction how you work with
this application so this is the most
recent version of adobe illustrator the
2016 origin and the Creative Cloud I
guess so if you are version except a
different don't worry most of the
features will be fluid there too it just
might look a bit different when we start
a new project or new file and create our
first are awarded this is basically
where we start this is the screen as you
see now this Wi-Fi toggle here is our
art board let's give em up the very
first question what do I mean with
artboard artboard are basically like yet
all checks your any Adobe Illustrator on
which we can pay you or where we create
our objects but we could all to do that
outside of the art words though artworks
allow us to structure our file and once
we save our assets or whatever we're
creating or once you print it out it
will be the artboards which are
printable and savable so this light grey
area is basic like if you match the desk
where we put things you like to use when
working with it but which is not final
product where is your piece of paper the
bite area is what you're actually
producing and this is how you can think
about these artboards here now obviously
you don't have to make that sharp a lot
more you're here you don't have to draw
it that sharp you can obviously store
items you want to use later on your art
where it's cute it's all one area in the
end but this is how you differ them it's
very important as I said comes saving
and printing now if i zoom out and I do
this by pressing alt and then just
strong you see now I got an even lighter
gray area a darker area and the white
box the white box has said is you are
bored this dark gray area here is the
canvas so this is teo area we can use
forward for drawing for creating objects
and the light gray area there we can't
work but this canvas is pretty damn
grave as a qatari this white boxer is
too bad that is 1024 pixels wide so that
it's not that small now back into that
you're moving around what we have to and
I select this by pressing age we're
selecting it down here in this hand and
this allowed would be too well click and
hold and then move around without moving
any objects on which I might claim so
this is the way to if you move around
and all subsuming is done with old and
schooling as you can see I already
explained all these fix you use forward
yeah for navigating here and it is very
important because his shortcuts will you
make working in this video a lot faster
now switching back to the Select to
movement by pressing movie or selecting
it up here as it's a tool which will
allow us to select objects the Dragutin
occurrence if you don't have any
calculate the new one for example
rectangle which is a very basic shape by
clicking here on this rectangle icon as
long press we see you could create
different kinds of shapes too but I'll
stick to the rectangle
selected for pressing em rights reserved
agree to create a little of scene or
serve we would use L add to them create
the shape I just click somewhere on my
artboard and click hold and drag out and
this heart rate of shape I guess this is
how you create shapes and most
drawing-room reds or in PowerPoint or
whatever now I created a shape typically
be again I use the selection tool
another click somewhere outside of the
shape you can see the shape as you see
it has a white folk and a black border
now if I don't want this if I would say
want to have it no border and black
filled I can change this in several
places as this off vacation illustrator
that you go several lakes we can change
something now here are the easiest
quickest ways up here where I can select
a phone which is pretty wide I'm I just
black here as concealed is now black
home and order order it has black
selective I could use this red line here
which means non as you can see no border
and now it's a borderless rectangle
another place where every changes is
down here these two items through
exactly the same the right one is the
border the left comes the phone and if I
wanted to quickly swap the two so let's
say I do want a black border no foe I
just like these two arrows here boom now
it's about the design can create chains
and fill them add strokes and if I click
again on this shape still with my
selections will this tool of yours yet
selected can see it cannot only change
the color I can also change the width of
the stroke if I would have one let's
have a let's roll to see this and let
the thing if let me get better scroll
five now can see we have a fat red
border I can change well how it is
stroke is distributed those say but now
we know
see difference here is small but if i
zoom in closer EU see it's a little bit
figure on the left and I gets smaller
when it approaches to right edge so it
changed this and a lot more in the best
way to revert it really is just to play
around here with walking space you can
change the opacity on Zanzibar now
another place where I can change the
appearance of my shades is here on the
right under the appearance window if you
don't see that go to window appearance
and this is for all the windows we're
using broader scores as you see many
windows your are not visible for me
right now and I can always select them
or make them visible by just click on
here and then there will be your edit
here or it will just pull out your than
the pub in the main areas of you say ah
as I said in the functionalities you got
here will be something we'll learn on
the shop because that is the easiest and
most fun way to learn it but some basics
won't hurt to have right now so I'm
navigating our own professing age 4 has
to and I'm just clicking and dragging
assuming look all and scrolling or by
pressing set or hear clicking the magnet
magnifying glass to get the student room
and here if you press office mouth
everything don't press anything but just
left click resuming can also create can
also drag it all to it soon in
dynamically this how we travel around
here or we create basic shapes now what
are the other icons here many of them
will use very rarely or just for certain
yet use cases one important to us to
tend to hear or pee on the keyboard when
this tool is allowed to draw a shade and
you got some hoppers here too so if I
click somewhere I created the first
point of my shape
and then you can see I got this little
line here indicating where one of mine
would be for one if I now click again I
can hold shift to make that only jump in
45 degree at steps so that i can draw
straight lines and I could make here
click here then you're up and as you can
see i get the smart guides here click
here and click here and now i would have
a rectangle to it is pretty identical to
this one but this was straight off the
pen tool now obviously you would not use
the pen tool for creating rectangles but
rather to click to create different
shapes like let's say this one here
we're another very important thing you
can click then click somewhere else but
homes to let post button and then drag
to change in the curve of the line your
groin and yeah if you stretch it around
you see you can't bring speed ventral
all the shapes you worn by just cleverly
adjusting this and what this is a lot
and you will then get a lot more
exercise and practice with using this
pant but it's a great tool and yes you
can see it allows us to quickly create
rather complex or abstract forms for
standard force of course we've got our
circles as the one year so that's
basically it for a quick introduction
and now you might think that that's what
you feel like everything has been
covered you're absolutely right but as I
said when don't use while working on
actual project because that's more fun
that's what I see a limited supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
