want to share my personal highly
subjective list of top web development
trends for the year 2018 so let's dive
right into it and before we do so if you
want to read about all of that you can
find a link in the video description or
if you're viewing this video on a
catamite dot-com already you can just
read below the video so let's dive right
into it
so let's have a look at these trends I
identified eight major trends not
ordered by importance I want AHA lettuce
this is not ordered by importance let's
start with the first trend and this is a
boring trend the basics really you need
to know the basics yeah why is this a
trend because it's more important than
ever before the basics are something you
need to know otherwise you can't be a
web developer everything builds up on
that you don't need to be an expert in
everything but you need to know HTML CSS
and JavaScript and the roles these
technologies play especially JavaScript
powers everything and you will see a
couple of other trends where we see
JavaScript again so you need to know
that learning JavaScript alone probably
is a hot trend it already was in 2017
and that is still the case in 2018 and I
only code in JavaScript on Yaron doesn't
count you also need to understand the
rest and how it interacts with CSS and
HTML ok so back to the trends that was a
boring one but important
what's next trend nodejs now it's not
new and it's been trending for the last
couple of years but all the in
conjunction with self the later trends
we'll see it's really important it's
really picking up acceleration and more
and more web apps are transferring over
to node.js or using node.js code in one
way or the other
additionally we use Noches and a lot of
front and build workflows if we use
gallop or web pack all of that runs
through no js' in the end so it's super
important it's the front end number one
language JavaScript and nodejs all is
important there and being able to use it
on the back it makes a lot of sense you
learn JavaScript once and you use it
twice on the front end and back end it's
easy to get started either because you
already know JavaScript or because it's
not that hard to learn simply and it's
also used and a lot of our trends we'll
have a look at later maybe like serval s
and AI but let me come back to that so
that was no js'
going to stay in the JavaScript world it
is really important I'm sorry front-end
frameworks we already worked with you
and angular and react for this year and
the last couple of years but they're
also going to stay important now it
might be the case that one framework
becomes more important than the others
oh and react as a library sorry but in
the end right now all three have Bright
Futures have their niches their purposes
and their companies using it and
learning one of them were having a look
at all of them actually is a good idea
it allows you to learn a lot about web
development and to create engaging and
reliable and interactive web interfaces
you see that managing UI state manually
is horrible and that these frameworks
help you with that and in 2018 we see
more and more improvements on the
performance side new awesome features
being added there will be some nice
updates for view and angular if you read
Twitter messages off the team's behind
it so this should be an exciting year
forefront and frameworks again they're
going to stay important and probably
become more important because one thing
is important to understand we've engaged
with them a lot so you watching this
channel probably did and I did but web
development still mostly happens outside
of single page applications so there's a
lot of growth potential
since single page applications is of
course one of the major fields where
these frameworks shine so what else have
I got for you now this is something new
which I haven't covered too much on this
channel yet web components and compilers
for web components like stencil I have a
short Stansell serious on this channel
though on my ketamine channel what are
web components about the idea is that
with web components we can build
reusable custom components and now
they're supported with some polyfills
for some browsers in all major browsers
so we can save overhead JavaScript that
we might have when using a framework or
library and just write engaging you eyes
with just vanilla JavaScript by building
reusable custom HTML elements you
already build components and angular
reactant view but you can only use these
components within the scope of that
framework you can't use a react
component in a view app well with web
components where qu you build with
vanilla JavaScript you can use them
anywhere so they work together with
popular frameworks and that's all
important web components don't
necessarily mean that frameworks like
view and react become redundant because
these frameworks still offer things
outside of the component thing they
offer routing state management stuff
like that but they might change the way
we use such frameworks and maybe the
focus of such frameworks in the long
term so this is a hot trend still
evolving still there's not too much
material on that there are still some
things that need to be fixed writing web
components on your own isn't that much
fun for example but using compilers like
stencil makes it much easier
there's angular elements an initiative
which was announced by the angular team
which also means that you can build web
components with angular reusable
standalone web components I should say
so we will see a lot of development
about this a lot of things happening in
this area in 2018 now the next trend are
static web pages this of course is
connected to JavaScript being so
important and single page applications
static web pages generated with Jekyll
who go or nax J's for example to
generate a static view application heft
advantage tits you deploy and ship
pre-rendered HTML files you have no
server-side set up because your pages
are not rendered on the server
they are pre-rendered during development
this gives you great search engine
optimization capabilities because on
your server is to finish the HTML page
has very little latency therefore it
doesn't need to be built on the server
it's also not a single page application
where the index.html file is almost
empty and needs to be populated by
JavaScript which is hard for search
engines if that JavaScript first has to
reach out to some server and
asynchronously load some content search
engine crawlers won't wait for this so
this is all the fix because we have a
pre rendered version which we can still
update behind the scenes thereafter but
we have an initial version and therefore
this works great especially with single
page applications because it fixes some
of their issues mostly that well the
initial page was empty - search engine
crawlers and it can be a big improvement
for your app so looking into projects
like Knox Chasse therefore it's a great
idea because this allows you to turn
your view app into aesthetically
rendered application and I might also
create some videos about that in the
future so diving into static page
generators like Jekyll like next which
is more than just a static page
generator I should add and like Google
is a good idea progressive web apps is
another top trend for this year in my
opinion progressive web apps have gained
a lot of momentum in the last year
already
especially since July Google i/o I
released a course about progressive web
apps on udemy and progressive web apps
have won big and awesome promise to you
they use web technologies to build
mobile app like experiences they allow
you to implement offline support push
notifications background synchronization
into a normal web page which is not
installed through an app store and this
has one major advantage the reach
because apps distributed why an app
store are of course hard to find for
users because how often do you randomly
search for new apps you don't know
already not that often right the average
user the average mobile user installs
zero yes you heard this correct zero new
apps per month so deploying a mobile app
can be good in some use cases but for
app that no one knows that isn't
searched for its heart the web on the
other hand is searchable we got Google
we got other search engines so your web
page can be found if the content is good
and therefore we can combine the best of
both worlds we can build a website but
still implement native mobile app like
features make it work offline after user
has visited at least once and so on and
browser support for progressive web app
features like service workers which play
an important role is becoming better
recently Safari announced coming
supports it's already in the beta
version so this is awesome progressive
web apps allow us to build highly
engaging web apps that feel like mobile
apps and this trend is going to stay
important in 2018 and probably become
more important now what else have I got
for you server less server less works
nicely together with single page
applications and the other trends server
less doesn't mean that you have no
service it means that your server side
code can be shipped to services like AWS
lambda where you have no setup pain
where you don't have to worry about
scalability because you're not managing
a server on your own
that is done for you instead you just
apply your code let's say it's written
in node.js and it runs when needed you
also only pay for what you need
behind the scenes the service provider
basically spins up an environment for
your code whenever it needs to run and
it does so in a very efficient manner so
that you don't lose law a lot of time
for that this is a huge thing it allows
you to focus on your code and not become
a part time system admin it solves
security issues cost issues and planning
issues and gives you a lot of time you
can spend on your code so there is
great and why is the big trend for 2018
because more and more services offering
things around that idea are coming up we
have AWS lambda for quite some time but
now DevOps are becoming better so
managing and rapidly deploying server
less code is becoming easier the
ecosystem is evolving like server less
framework framework which makes building
starless apps for various server less
service providers easier is becoming
more mature or is pretty mature already
so these are all things we should keep
in mind and looking for server less app
development is definitely a hot trend
for 2018 it's a flexible backend where
we focus on our code what else could we
want now what's the last trend it's the
buzzword we hear everything artificial
intelligence and bots well it is a
buzzword but it is of course really a
hot trend our official intelligence is
becoming more accessible and easier to
incorporate for everyone you don't have
to be a studied data scientist or
anything like that
to start using artificial intelligence
in your apps just as with server less
more and more services are coming up by
AWS by Google that make it easy for you
to incorporate some features driven by
artificial intelligence into your apps
like image recognition machine learning
which is becoming easier with some
services chat BOTS which you can build
in a very easy way now we got all of
that and these things can improve most
business models maybe not all of that
but there are things that will fit into
your business model too and pretty sure
about that why not add a little pot to
your page that helps users navigate
around or solve the simples problems
they might come to you why not add image
recognition to sort out images user
uploaded to your service if they contain
content
don't want to have on your page these
are all things driven by artificial
intelligence and with artificial
intelligence models becoming better and
better these services become better and
better and we get more and more services
so we'll probably face a bright year
regarding artificial intelligence and as
being able to incorporate it in 2018 so
these are the eight major trends and now
you might say oh something's missing
here your favorite trend is missing here
well this is just my list but I hope it
gave you some nice ideas I got some our
points though so what else should you
learn what should you focus on besides
these trends and by the way you don't
need to dive into every single of these
trends pick the ones that are
interesting to you of course it's there
is there are enough trends for everyone
so what else is important well testing
testing is not a trend but it's becoming
more important I feel unit tests and to
end tests I might cover this on this
channel in greater depth in the future
too it is something worth looking into
you not necessarily a hot trend but
definitely something that I recommend
learning as next step in your career may
be tooling super-important we're using
webpack all the time we also use babel
and so on it's going to stay important
thankfully we have a lot of CL eyes and
so on that give us working setups for
web development projects out of the box
because learning all of that man on our
own is pretty cumbersome but still
having a look at how they work might be
worth it so that you understand what
that CLI created project setup you're
using is doing an optimization always
going to stay important dive into best
practices there to write better code to
handle images better optimized images a
lot of resources about image
optimization can be found online this is
something I also can recommend looking
at now what about other things like PHP
amber lateral angular 1 bootstrap Ruby
and so on are these all dead because
javascript is so important no they're
not dead
javascript is important no question
about that and PHP might have had
brighter days in the past still the
majority of the web is driven by PHP
never forget that if you plan on working
as a freelance web developer for example
might still be worth learning PHP for
that reason and additionally it's not
like nodejs is the best thing on the
world PHP has advantages ruby has
advantages angular one might be better
suited for your project and angular q is
though the use cases for angular one
might get less and less in the future to
be honest but definitely keep on
learning these things if you enjoy them
because enjoying stuff always is super
important if you think something is cool
and you want to learn it because it's
cool but you don't enjoy it you're not
going to get good at it so please just
because something wasn't listed on my
trend list doesn't mean it's absolutely
dead and you should learn it it's not
that it's just maybe not the hottest
trend right now I hope this video was
helpful and you enjoyed it definitely
leave any feedback in the comments and
I'd be more than happy to welcome you in
future videos again bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
