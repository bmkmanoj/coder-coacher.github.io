you I promise that we would have a look
at the different templating engines and
I'm going to start with shade which is
the default engine that shipped with our
what our boiler plate here basically we
set up I want to introduce you to that
language how it works or how does
templating engine works and how we can
create our HTML files with it and output
type content dynamically there let's
start
I open the lay out Dutch shade file in
our fuse folder and this is the kind of
route layout that our earth use are
extending and here's the first feature
we can well extend layouts and insert
content dynamically so here for example
in the layout the shape while providing
a bicycle basic skeleton for all our
layouts this is a basic HTML document
skeleton and there we can anomaly enter
well the specific content of our other
layouts we'll get back to this a second
because now you might wonder this is our
HTML skeleton it doesn't really look
like HTML right that's one of the most
important things about Jade we don't use
the standard HTML tags there but we use
indentation to structure our document so
the tag names are the same you have our
doctype HTML at the beginning but at a
normal HTML probably would have like
like days right this would be how it is
written a normal HTML type element and
yeah document our HTML element might
look like this and also we would have
closing tags we don't have to some shade
we don't have the smaller and greater
signs to create our tags which has tag
names and we use indentation to make
clear in which well level will currently
add and how we nest elements so we don't
have opening and closing tags we only
have the tag name and then you can think
of
all these tags which are indented one
indentation to the right are inside say
she melted therefore all these two
elements here are inside the head tag
and this lot of thing which I will
explain the second is inside the body
tag so for example if I want to create
an unordered list here I would create
our run or delays it as the default HTML
select your element tag just without
well the greater and smaller side
operators this is my own route list now
I'll hit enter it automatically indents
for me otherwise I would have chest you
well go one indentation to the right if
you read my list item and well now I
want to enter some text I want to
display with with the opening and
closing list item tag I just have its
base to have an empty space here and
then I enter my my text whenever I want
to output just like that normal text now
if I save this and reload this page you
can see we now get this bullet point
here and if I have a look at the source
code we can see it's inside this
unordered list element this is basically
how we structure our code here we were
using this indentation and we're
outputting text between two elements
just by writing it behind the element of
an empty space between now if we have
more text and we don't want to like
enter this all in one line you will say
like this it's very very long it can
also enter a new line but now we would
think of this as a new tag which you
would not recognize therefore I enter a
dot here indent indent is to the right
and now I can have more lines here if I
save this and reload you see you get
this new list item and all this text is
inside this one list item element here
even though with multiple lines here if
I remove the dot you can see now it's
picking this are separate elements can
already see you here my editor and if I
will
well it's kind of broken because we have
this DSM whatever element which are
obviously not recognized so the start
here is important to have a multi-line
string following this tag so I hope this
is clear we use our HTML tags here how
invitation is important for nesting all
these elements and that we don't have to
open enclosing elements now we can out
text there now you might say okay this
is very nice
but I also might have some CSS classes
or some attributes I want to attach
right well you sure have so let's go one
to the left so that we run the same lab
less unordered list and here I want to
create an input element and it should be
of type text how do I do this we use
parentheses for this now in these
parentheses we can specify all
attributes you want to attach this HTML
element Blahnik type equals and then
string text let me save this and reload
no now we get this input element here
and as you can see you got this type
text element attached to it now if you
also went to want to add a class and
let's say an ID we do this a class set
by just adding a dot and then the class
name so class name this will add the CSS
class class name and then if we had a
hash tag we can't add an ID saved us
know again inspect this as you can see
it has the ID Eddie ID and the class
class name if you're using a mat which
is a plug-in for many editors which you
see that the - tool allows you to write
kilobyte or an engine or Mille in their
HTML tags by just writing dot class name
getting tablet
if that's a similar syntax here were
adding CSS class with a dot in front of
the name and IDs with a hashtag in front
of the name so that's one important
thing now here's another important thing
in the title of our layout here you see
that I got title equal and not titled
space if I remove the equal sign I
reload this page watch this tile on the
tab here it's now titled if I add the
equal sign and reload it's expressed
because title if we have an equal sign
right after the tag name refers to a
variable which is injected so to say
into this template which is added and it
is done through well known in this case
you're in our index wrote here what
we're rendering already x-file referring
you to our index layout or index jade
file we're setting this title variable
Express so if it changed this year to
cool huh and save this and reload o
restart my server and then reload you
can see I got cool huh so this is how we
insert variables this chava script
object already set is the last video of
the thing into our template and in the
template we cannot output it with this
but by using just a variable name we set
in this chava script object but this
equal sign is important to tell Jade hey
don't render the following thing as text
use this variable is a variable and use
whatever this variable contains now
report the feature is we might have if
statements here so we might have if
let's say condition is true then we want
to display just let's say paragraph
which says it's true obviously we don't
have condition yet and you could either
just specify in a row
and add another variable you let me do
this condition should be let's say it's
true restart the server and reload this
page now you can see it's true and if I
set it to false here and again restarted
do this it's gone even though it's still
in my shade farm because here we check
on this condition very important now
this is we can if use if conditions by
the way we can also define variables
inside this shade template if we need
you for any reason we can quickly do
this by adding a - a - a den of our
condition equals true now this is always
true if I and I only does the template
that we need to know need to restart my
server if I'm not reload we can again
see this even though we're still passing
it as false here but I'm overwriting it
in my layout by well setting it
basically as a new variable okay so this
is clear we can set variables we can use
these control structures we are
obviously not classic HTML tags or so
tags but added by try and change
templating engines
we may also loop so let me say I have a
number variable oops
thank you variable which I will call
just any array and this should just be
well an array of three numbers now
notice that I never have a semicolon
anything like this at the end because in
Jai templating engine you do everything
with indentation there is no need to
tell what an end a word when a line ends
because what indentation and line breaks
are the way how you structure your
element or your document so this is my
variable and now I want to create a new
loop I can say for each value this
we'll be dynamically created in my any
array here I want to do something let's
say I wanted to long after the new
paragraph with this value now again
using this equal sign make sure I don't
want to output a text of value but I
want to refer this value variable which
I'm creating here so let me save this
and reload and now you can see I got one
two three here just how we use loose now
the last important thing I want to cover
this with you is this block thing maybe
you already wondered that in this
index.js file in our route we're
rendering a route or a few called index
and we do have an index file here in
next shade but I was making all changes
in the layout of change file and yet
well it appeared here the reason is let
me get rid of all of that that as I said
at the beginning this layout serves as
our basic layout as the skeleton which
outer layers reuse and extend and add
their content into it and we can provide
basic hooks in our skeleton where we
want our inheriting layouts or views to
be able to insert content we define such
hooks with block keyword so we're
setting block content here and this
means this is a Content block which can
be used by our views extending this
layout to enjoyed something let's see
how this works in the index touch a file
here you can see we're having a
declaration begin moves as extends
layout which just says this view this
document is based on this layout of a
file it's the same but add something to
it it inherits from this file so we're
extending the slay out this layout name
obviously has to match this layout name
here before the dot shade and then we're
saying and what we add something
document but I can't just write it here
right this doesn't not work because this
layer Chaffin is closed in itself we
only provide these hooks where an
extending layout may enter something so
recording this blog content here and in
here work again having this blog content
and by desperate and if I hey I want to
enter something into this blog content
and this is what I do insert I again
insert a title expressed along that's
why it's appearing YouTube and then
again I have a paragraph with again
using this title oh and here we see
another notation if we have a mixture of
normal text add a variable we enter this
variable by using hashtag and then curly
braces and the variable name between the
curly braces too well basically injure
this variable T content of this variable
inside a normal text this is how we work
with the J templating engine to serve
the very basics and I will start working
with that in our no chairs projects but
I will show our templating language is
food out the next week is two so I hope
this helps you understand this
templating language and of course you
will also learn more when we're actually
using it in the next videos see you
there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
