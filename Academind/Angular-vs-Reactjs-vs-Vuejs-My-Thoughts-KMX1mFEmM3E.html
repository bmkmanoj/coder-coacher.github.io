aboard in this video I want to share
some personal thoughts on angular vs.
react towards its view because I get
these questions a lot which member
should I choose is angular better than
react what should I learn and I try to
answer some of these questions by
sharing my thoughts on it now a little
bit of advertisement rights to start if
you are interested in diving into a very
technical comparison having a look at
the performance and so on and once you
get an introduction to each of these
free frameworks I created a course about
that which you can buy on yulie you
don't have to though I will also share
my thoughts here my personal thoughts as
mentioned let me start with angular and
with angular I mean angular 2 or now for
the latest version of angular therefore
what do I like about angular I like the
general concept of angular
I like the modularity I like the way we
use components with modules I like that
we use dependency injection how that
works the high level of control we have
I also like that I like that it's easy
to add routing or for validation that we
have this all in one package even though
I know it's technically split up over
multiple packages but it's easy to add
or validation zone for example I know
that this can also be confusing for
newcomers though that might be a
disadvantage another advantage I see for
angular is just that it has is very
successful forest version angular 1 it's
still getting used a lot it is very
popular and a lot of webpages use it
angular Q in theory at least it's better
than angular 1 faster better performance
so that should be a big advantage in the
future however I will just say that the
angular team messed something up during
the development of angular 2 mostly
their communication wasn't that great
and they also gave me a shot in the back
when they changed something in release
candidate phase and just to you know
release candidate normally means we
don't make any braking changes to the
API in general unless it's
absolutely needed I guess it was
absolutely needed but still everyone was
relying on some continuity I guess and
they made breaking changes very breaking
changes to Engler multiple times and
again the communication wasn't that
great it was like new release breaking
change here you go and I think that
really destroyed some trust or some
people really don't trust angular and
the team behind it anymore because they
fear that when they create an app with
angular it's going to be useless in one
year because angular 5 or 6 or 7 or
whatever is coming out and will render
everything deprecated or well useless is
what they wrote and that is a problem
now I don't believe it's going to be
like that
yang our team is saying that they will
do their best to provide backward
compatibility
they will also release long-term
stability releases so releases which
will get security updates for a longer
time still they will have to prove this
and that is definitely something which
gives angler a harder stand that it
would need to have due to its very
famous history with the angular one now
whatever thing angular introduced which
certainly isn't liked by everyone is
typescript now I like it I believe it
leads us to write better code it forces
us to write better code and that is good
in itself however if you have a vanilla
only excuse me a JavaScript only
background adapting two types of can be
challenging if you however already knew
language is like c-sharp or Java or any
other language which uses types and
interfaces you won't have that heart of
the transition and since I do have that
background I really like typescript as
mentioned I think it allows us to write
better code now that's it for angular
and of course you could say way more but
that is what I like and don't like about
it angular now how does it compare to
react and view to answer this let's have
a look at let's say react next I'll be
honest I'm not the biggest fan of
reactant that's just a personal thing we
act as a great framework and if you like
it definite
go for it nothing bad about it we see it
being used by Facebook obviously and a
lot of other companies too it is a
framework which has proven itself
however I don't like it that much I do
know it I create some projects with it
but I'm not the biggest fan of react
whenever I had to use it I really had to
force myself because I don't like the
general idea in theory I would like that
we use JavaScript for everything but in
practice that JSX thing just isn't my
style and not because I don't like
mixing HTML and JavaScript that wouldn't
be my problem here or not my main
problem the problem I have is that since
JSX
is just some some tactical sugar to
write HTML with javascript we can't use
normal HTML there this is why we have to
use class name instead of class if you
want to assign a CSS class I understand
why that is but I don't like it we have
HTML we have CSS why would we start
writing everything in JavaScript and
sacrifice all the features HTML and CSS
there native versions give us I don't
get it I don't like it so that's just my
opinion though you may like it a lot of
people like it not my style though and I
think it's due to this strange mixture
of JavaScript and wannabe HTML that can
be really hard to learn and master react
it's easy to create your first
components but really right and correct
react code and understanding how
everything works together how you loop
through a couple of elements and output
a list item for each for example
definitely is challenging for newcomers
and that per se is not a bad thing
angular certainly is challenging to you
but the overall idea behind react really
has to connect you if that's the case
there's nothing wrong with it and it's a
great framework one of the most popular
ones right now and if anger Q should
fail to follow angular ones path reacts
might very well be the king of the
framework so to say but again the
reasons I mentioned might be reasons
why you might not like it too and again
that's just my opinion now how does it
compare to angular then well react has
one advantage obviously it uses
JavaScript however typically es6 so you
will still have to learn es6 and you
will have to learn how to set up a
development environment where you can
use es6 but still that might be easier
than learning typescript so I guess that
is definitely something maybe which
makes it easier to get into react and
work with it additionally a lot of the
optimization stuff you have to do with
angular offline compilation and so on
doesn't have to be done in a reactive
because everything is JavaScript already
on the other hand since we have a clear
separation between HTML and typescript
for example in angular you can use
normal HTML code than writing your
template you can't do that in react
since you use JSX which is just
JavaScript in the end and it's that
general idea of using templates and the
logic in an extra file or in the
typescript code in general or mixing
everything which may really not be your
style or you may prefer one of the two
styles for me it's clearly angular style
react also doesn't bring all the
features angular brings you have to add
an extra router which is developed by
the community you have to add extra form
validation packages that's all possible
but since for angular all these things
are developed by the angular team you
have a higher chance of these packages
getting regular updates and working with
the latest version allure for react that
might not necessarily be the case though
I will say that react has a very active
and vibrant community such chances are
highs you will find the packages you
need you could of course say more and if
you get something to share in general
related to anything of that video
definitely leave us in the comment
section so what else might we have a
look at when comparing react with
angular well they could have a look at
the chopped perspectives that will in
general be equal though we have to be
careful angles you will
are relatively new so definitely right
now there are more jobs available for
react than they are for react F for
angular 2 for example what about
performance well there are a lot of ways
to matter that again I can only point to
the course I mentioned at the beginning
of the video you can also have a look at
a benchmark I'll link here in the video
description where you can run your own
benchmark with some predefined tests
comparing these frameworks and for what
maybe use these frameworks well for
angular for example we're pretty much
limited to creating single page
applications you can't just drop it into
your full stack or multi page
application and try enhancing the
individual pages that's not what it's
made for and it won't be a great app if
you try to do that with react however
that is definitely possible whilst you
can create signa page applications with
the tool unless you might argue that the
focus is kind of shifting to that you
can definitely just drop in do you react
and react on imports into some HTML page
some existing view of your back-end so
to say and start using react features on
that view without having to create a
fully fledged single page application so
that might be an advantage if you're
looking for that ladder functionality
enhancing your full stack app then react
might be your choice so that's it for
react versus angular how about view
I like view chess a lot for me it's a
bit like if react and angular has sex
and we really have a great framework
there with a lot of great ideas from
both our frameworks from angular and
react view chess isn't perfect of course
it still has things which are which you
might not like but what I do like about
it is you can use es 5 and it will be
absolutely fine you can use es6 and will
be great you can use typescript though
is a bit harder but that's not redo able
to set up and not that hard anymore to
be honest but you can use all these free
languages and pick the one you like the
most we have a separation of template
and the JavaScript code which as you
already heard in the studio I like it
allows us to use
HTML normal CSS and JavaScript to
connect all these things it is very lean
just like react but unlike react a
router for example is provided by the
view team which is great because again
we have the argument that we probably
will receive timely updates in general
though it's also kind of like react
there aren't a ton of packages shipping
with view you will have to bring a lot
from the community for example for
invalidation something which isn't built
interview you will have to get a package
for that and that again leaves you open
to the same disadvantages we had for it
react that you have to rely on the
package offers updating their stuff and
so on what you also might not like is
that it is or it can get very much code
in bigger projects let me put it like
this we don't have dependency injection
stuff like that and therefore it it
doesn't have a as streamlined concept or
as as modular concept let me put it like
this as angular has it has a great
concept and you can write modular code
you split your code over multiple files
we have view x4 state management
official package all great but when it
comes to certain things
angular might still be the framework
which allows you to write a bit more
lean or focus code you could say on the
other hand that might not really matter
for you because maybe you're not writing
their next super big enterprise level
application or you are doing that and of
course you can still find ways to manage
your code when we have a look at
performance again there are thousands of
ways of measuring that have a look at
the benchmark I mentioned earlier link
to the video description
what about viewers react well if we have
a look at view and react they are very
similar in some regards we have again
this clear separation between template
and JavaScript and view though we have
two very lean frameworks and for me the
reason why I like view J's more really
is that SAP
raishin of template's CSS code and
javascript code that is really for me
the tipping point i guess i may be
combined with the fact that we have an
official state management package ux and
an official router these are reasons why
I really like view view chest also has a
very vibrant community very active
community very friendly community too
and it has a great documentation I have
to give it that it has the best
documentation of all the free frameworks
if you compare it to the angular or
react Docs you will know why a lot of
people love learning new chairs it's
just awesome it makes it very easy to
get started it gets a lot of things
right one major disadvantage certainly
is that it doesn't have the backing
angular or react have angular is backed
by Google developed by Google and react
obviously by Facebook view chess by even
you great guy X Google employee but no
big company beauteous q which is the
most recent version it's also pretty new
and we have way less jobs available for
view than we have for react or an angler
that might change though of course
because it is a great framework and if
more people are picking it up more
companies will start adopting it and we
will have more jobs and especially in
the Asian market we have great companies
like Alibaba using view chaos already so
I think there is light on your isin but
right now it's definitely worse from a
job perspective though that's important
if you have a look at the get up
activity github stars and so on you will
see that it's very popular already so
that was me just rambling about all
these frameworks and which one you might
choose and how they compare to each
other and again just my thoughts your
thoughts might differ maybe you get
things to add I'd be very interested to
hear your thoughts please share them in
