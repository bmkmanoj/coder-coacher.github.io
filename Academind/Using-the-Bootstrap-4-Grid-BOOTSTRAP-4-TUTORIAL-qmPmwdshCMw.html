here in the last video of this series I
had a look at what bootstrap is and how
we add it to our project in this video
we'll take a closer look at the
bootstrap grid I'll explain how it works
and how we can use it to layout our page
and to make sure everything is
positioned where it should be so let's
start
now how does the bootstrap grid work
behind the scenes it uses flexbox to
position elements and to make sure that
everything is where it should be
you could of course use flexbox yourself
and my colleague Manuel actually
triggered a video on flexbox that might
be interesting to you feel free to check
it out
but writing flexbox on your own was not
being super difficult is of course more
cumbersome than simply adding some CSS
classes to your HTML code so let's see
how the bootstrap grid works a bootstrap
grid is simply created with a bunch of
HTML elements typically divs you have
one div with the container class and
this name is not chosen randomly it has
to be named container to be understood
by bootstrap in the container class you
now create rows and columns to define
your grid because that is how all grids
typically work so here we now add a
number div with the row class you can of
course add more than one row you can add
as many rows as you need in this case I
add two now in the row class you add
columns and columns are the places where
you put your actual content columns can
be as wide as you want as you will learn
and you use them to essentially create
cells in your grid
you got rows with columns well you got
cells so a column is in its easiest form
simply created by adding a call class in
the grid here like this
so another day for the call class and
now I could name this Row one column one
queue well print the address of this
cell so to say if I add an average
column here I could name this Row one
call to and in my second row let's say I
also had a column there but the only one
then this would be Row two column one
now if we save this and we go back to
the page we see that text here now this
is a bit hard to see I want to style
this and for that I'll actually add my
own classes I'll add my container to the
container I'll add my row to the row and
to all the columns here I'll add my
column
and for the second row I'll also add my
row this allows me to add my own styling
after the bootstrap import and
deliberately added to this fowl and
there I'll first of all style my
container to maybe get a border of one
pixel solid and green then I'll style my
row to get a border of the say three
pixels solid and red and then I'll add
the my column style here to give this a
border of three pixels dotted and blue
and let's also add a style for our body
our document body and give it a margin
of 30 pixels so that our content doesn't
sit right on the edges of the document
we now reload this we actually see our
grid like this and I should remove that
white space to also see the red border I
guess so now we can clearly see the rows
and the columns with the blue dots
around them and this is how we can
position our content now interesting to
see by default each column takes up an
equal amount of space so if we resize
this each column stays at 50% of the
available width and if I shrink this
down it's also the case though if I go
below a certain threshold for very small
devices here it actually breaks into two
lines but I have to go really really
small for that that is the default
behavior if I just use the column class
here just call now bootstraps grid is
actually more capable than that because
often you don't want to have a 50-50
distribution you want to have one column
that's one third of the available width
and the other one should maybe have 2/3
you can add with us by tweaking this
column class or this call class here to
get an additional ball piece of
information
so we basically changed the name
bootstrap defines a couple of different
column class names and this is another
one we can use column four we can then
add column eight to the second one and
now you have to think
of these numbers here as shares of the
available space they always and that's
important they always have to add up to
12
you got a 12 column grid by default so
we can add up to 12 columns where each
would then be column one or nothing at
all and it would automatically be
distributed now if we set this to column
four we tell bootstrap from the 12
available columns this column here
should take four so the width of four
columns and the second one should take
eight so together they add up to 12 you
could of course also use 6 and leave to
empty at the end of the row but with
this the full row is occupied but the
first column will have one third of the
space the second one we'll get the rest
if we reload the page we can actually
see this in action there we now see our
first row one third of the size and the
second row gets the rest now sometimes
you want to be even more precise than
that because you wouldn't have a
different layout for your small and your
big devices let's say for the small
devices so for your mobile phones you
want to stack these columns so they
should actually become rows so to say
they should not sit next to each other
but for medium sized or larger screens
you want to have them sit next to each
other now you can get there by tweaking
this name even more besides the share of
the available columns which should get
you can add a size name so to say to
define for which kind of screen sizes
this should apply for example I could
name this cow md4 to indicate for medium
sized or bigger screens this should get
four of the available columns I of
course can now also adjust the second
column here and add MD eight here
now there are five classes available you
can have medium sized screens with MD
like this but there also is large with
LG for bigger screens XL for extra-large
for very big screens and on the other
side of medium you got SM for small
tablet size and you also got X
for extra small that would be your
smaller mobile phones so these are the
available names you can use and you can
really combine all these numbers adding
up to twelve and the size classes to
control how your grid looks like if we
save it like this and we reload the page
now you see it's stacked on each other
and only on bigger screens it sits next
to each other with this four to eight
distribution now let's say we want to
have yet another design for small
screens which is not the smallest class
extra small would be the smallest class
and there I want to have them sitting
next to each other instead of stacked
which they are currently doing so I
simply add call sm6 to both columns and
now if I reload this we shouldn't see a
difference for this screen here but if I
shrink it you see now it's evenly
distributed this is now a smaller screen
and only if I go to very small screens
we stack it and this is the power of the
bootstrap grid
you can't configure a lot and you can
really find unit to your needs with
these combinations of shares of the
available width and to different device
sizes and as shown at the beginning you
can of course also omit all of that and
just use call to distribute the
available space evenly across the
columns you defined now if that we
covered the bare basics of the grid but
we can do more let's assume we have
column widths that don't add up to 12 so
we got some empty space maybe in row 2
if I copied add row there and I now give
it a share maybe 4 and 4 so together
they don't add up to 12
you can see if I reload this and I may
be named as column Q here to be correct
now you see we got Q columns with the
same width since they both have 4 but
they're not taking the full space
because they're not adding up to 12 now
sometimes that's just layout you want
because typically you're not creating
tables here but you're creating a header
a sidebar and other content so therefore
you don't always want to take the fall
with but maybe you now want to Center
these two columns here so in row two you
want to Center them horizontally now
that's easy with the bootstrap grid you
can add an additional class class not
named two row but additional a class to
the class list on the road div and the
classes you can add here are actually
inspired by the Flex box settings that
are happening behind the scenes so if
you know flexbox they're going to sound
familiar to you if you want to Center
everything you can call this justify
content center with dashes between the
words now justify content is the flex
box rule for well setting where the
content should be positioned and with
that you see the indeed is centered now
alternatives to Center are start that is
the default though you don't need to
explicitly define this this will simply
move the elements to the left and well
you already guessed it we also got end
besides that we got two other ones
though we also got around which will put
some space between the elements or put
some space around them to be precise so
to the left to the right and between
them and now ever reload this you see
they're kind of centered but these
spaces also between them so the empty
space is basically divided up equally to
the left to the right and then to the
left to the right of each column making
it double the space in the middle and
sometimes you just want to have each
item be pushed to its nearest edge so
column one to the left and column two to
the right this can be achieved by using
the between name so justified content
between this will put all the available
space between the two columns like this
this makes the alignment on the
horizontal axis really simple but what
about vertical alignment this has
historically been very difficult in CSS
well it's super simple with Flex box and
therefore also with the bootstrap grid
let's give our rows some height so that
we can see this so to the my row class
which is added to each row I'll add a
height of 300 pixels if I now reload the
page you see the columns take the full
available height dad might be an
default behavior you want but sometimes
you just want to take the height you set
for the columns or the content requires
now therefore you can also define how
they should be positioned vertically you
can again go to the row let's stick to
the second row and there besides justify
content something you can also add a
line items something again coming from
that flexbox property name that is used
behind the scenes and there you got
start for example if you take start and
reload the page you actually see that
now for the second row the columns only
are as high as required by their content
and they're then pushed to the start
vertically off the row now we of course
also got Center and and here so let me
quickly show Center I guess you can
think what end is Center center sit and
that's awesome because vertical
centering not that easy and CSS at least
in the past but one thing we also got is
stretch so if I set this to stretch here
and I reload the page now we are back to
default that is why we also actually
don't have to set this now sometimes you
want to change the behavior for only one
column and not for all and therefore
setting this on the overall a row is the
wrong place well you can always go to a
column let's say the second color here
and there you can add a line self-start
maybe now this should get pushed up so
this second column should get pushed up
well it's the first one stays stretched
so let's reload and indeed that is what
we see so this is how you get the full
flexibility over how the items are
aligned and positioned in your grid
which of course is an hour awesome tool
in your toolbox now we covered a lot and
your official Docs which are linked
below the video are a great place to
dive even deeper but one other thing I
want to show you is how you can actually
switch to order of columns now you
should be careful with this it's
possible as you will see in a second but
it's also confusing sometimes it's
really useful though sometimes you want
to have a different order on your mobile
phone than on your desktop device let's
say
you can easily switch the order by
adding another class to your column so
to the first column which actually right
now is obviously the first element from
left to right
I could add order 12 and this also goes
up all the way to 12 because we got a 12
column grid and then I could give my
other column here order two maybe so a
number smaller than 12 now keep in mind
right now column two is on the right
which makes sense if we reload they
switched because the order of numbers
matters here the lower number wins and
is moved to the left the bigger number
is moved to the right which is why the
first column goes beyond the second
column if we had more columns then all
these orders would be taken into account
and it would be order respective to
their order number now this could be
used in conjunction with the device size
breakpoints we could say we only want to
switch the order for medium sized or
bigger screens so I add the MD part to
the order name for devices smaller than
that the default order from left right
so as to finally the HTML code will be
used if I now reload this you see it's
switched because we're on a medium sized
or bigger screen size here but if I
shrink this it actually goes back to the
normal order because we're on a smaller
than medium size screen and this of
course great for a creating responsive
layouts where you maybe want to switch
some element to the top for your mobile
devices you would coach this in a
mobile-first way so code the order you
want to have in a mobile phone and then
you can switch the order for bigger
screens as we do it here by adding the
order class now the last interesting
thing I want to show you is offsetting
this means pushing or moving your
columns to the left by a certain column
count which you can kind of achieve with
the justified content between or around
part but there the available space is
just split up evenly now if you want to
say I got two columns with
with Ford and I want to move them to the
left by let's say two columns by default
and then only treat the remaining space
thereafter as the well remaining space
then you can add the offset - to class
here this simply tells bootstrap move
this two columns to the right if we save
this and reload you won't see anything
here actually because we switched your
order which will overwrite this but on
smaller screens you see there is an
empty space to the left and then we
still get that space between setting for
that remaining space there after but we
got them pushed in two columns and of
course there could be any number of your
choice and that can also be made
responsive by adding the breakpoint
names so we could say only push it in on
medium sized devices so now if I reload
this you see its back to the left
because this is on a smaller than medium
sized screen but if I increase this we
does still don't see anything because
the order thing here actually overrides
this and to be very precise the order
doesn't override that offsetting but
keep in mind that we switch the order
and we offset this first column now this
is only the first column on a mobile
device so we also need to add this
offset code to our second column or
actually we only need to add there
because this will be the first column
due to our switched order on medium
sized or bigger screens I hope this
makes sense so now if you put the offset
code on the second column and I now
reload this it's pushed in but if you go
to a smaller screen that's no longer the
case and was dead you can really now
fine-tune your positioning you've got a
lot of tools for alignment for
distributing available space for setting
the available space by moving columns in
like we just saw for reordering your
elements for defining the widths of your
columns defining different widths for
different screen sizes and the official
talks hold a lot of examples on this if
you want to dive deeper I hope you got a
first impression on how this works
though and a great ways
to always build a grid like this like we
did here in the video color your borders
and then play around with the different
classes to get a feeling for how it
actually works and behaves I hope this
was helpful and with that we're well
prepared to style our mini project in a
nice way so let's dive deeper into this
in the next videos off this serious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
