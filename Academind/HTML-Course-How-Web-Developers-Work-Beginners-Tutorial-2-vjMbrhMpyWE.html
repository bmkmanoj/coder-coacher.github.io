the last video we had a look at how do
web works and we wrote our first HTML
code this one right here now in this
video it's time to take a look at how
web developers work because as you can
imagine as a web developer
we don't write our code like this we use
specific tools which make writing our
code a lot easier
these tools are called IDE integrated
development environment let's have a
look at these in this video
so that's again the code that we wrote
in the last video you remember we just
used the integrated text editor in my
case on the Mac this was TextEdit and as
you can see right here although this
code works we can see right here we have
these four lines and the header hello my
web page and this is line two
well it's not really well structured
it's basically only black and white text
and if we take another look at Apple
comm right here you remember we went to
Apple comm used the chrome developer
tools went to the network tab and then
went to preview right here after opening
the index.html file well if we scroll
down again
we can see that we have of course a lot
more code but this code is structured
already you can see this body tag for
example right here and you can see a
side then the indented ifs and you can
see some colors in there so all these
things that make this code easier to
read and better to understand now as you
can imagine if you have to write a lot
of code then you need these helpers to
make sure that you can really work with
that code otherwise it would just be a
wall of text basically now as already
the browser integrated tools offer such
functionality of course we as a
developer also can use specific codes
when we want to write that code because
in that case we only display the code
but I've been writing the code you also
need structure now for this purpose we
use IDE s as said before integrated
development environments before we
continue one important note
actually we should differentiate between
text editors like notepad then we have
text editors which make writing our code
easier or more convenient let's call
them code editors maybe and then we have
IDE s which have these code editor
functions so to write the code in a more
convenient way but these IDE s also have
integrated tools for debugging or
compiling if you don't know what that is
at the moment no worries will not talk
about that at this stage of the series
the important thing is that for
simplicity reasons I will just refer to
ie
whenever I talk about tools which make
writing oral code
more convenient or easier just to keep
that in mind now that we defined IDE
let's have a look at why we might need
such an IDE because as I said before an
IDE makes it easier for us as a
developer to write our code so we can
differentiate between notepad or
TextEdit so the editor we used so far
and the IDE now what are the advantages
of the IDE then well the first advantage
is the better structure because if you
think back about the text editor then
the structure was something like that
you have the body opening and closing
tag and in this body element you have a
paragraph and the header now this is
still a lot of code but structure well
not really there with an IDE you get
this structure automatically and you can
immediately see that you have this body
element with the opening and the closing
tag again and inside this body element
you have the paragraph and the header
this will become really important later
but for a moment the important thing is
that you immediately see that the IDE
allows you to structure your code more
efficiently because as I said before
this structure was basically created
automatically by the IDE that's the
first thing an IDE helps us to improve
the structure of our code what other
advantages do we have well the second
advantage is that an IDE is adding
colors to our code again if you think
about an example in text editor well the
only thing you see is black and white
text now with an IDE this would look
something like that and all these colors
are automatically again now in
combination with the structure in the
first step and the color in the second
step this becomes already much more
readable and better to understand for
the user so that's the second advantage
we have colors in our code and the
further advantage is the file management
because if you think back about the
structure of our project this could look
something like that on our computer we
have folders with images with scripts
and styles we'll talk about that later
fraud is serious and we have some HTML
files now if you want to open another
file we have to open that folder and
open that file with the text editor
again that's not really comfortable and
therefore with
IDE we have all these folders integrated
into this tool and this makes it really
easy to navigate between the different
folders and files and also to open
different files inside the IDE and as
you can imagine right now
just these three points show us that
using an IDE is probably a good idea if
you want to write your web application
in a really comfortable way
because the important thing about the
page should be the code the structure of
the code the logic of the code and the
functionality of the page and not things
like how can I get the basic structure
into the code just to be able to read it
that shouldn't be the focus of us as web
developers this should be done but a
tool that we use now talking about the
tools that we should use now which IDE
should we use or which I des are
available well the answer is we have
lots of different ideas available on the
market just to name some we could use
atom or sublime text or webstorm or
visual studio code and as you can hear
by my voice we will use Visual Studio
code throughout this mini series now
what will we use Visual Studio code
right here well the first reason is it's
for free which is always good the second
reason is that it's really easy to use
and it's a nice working environment
actually and the third reason is that
Visual Studio code is actually a code
editor you remember we talked about code
editors versus IDs but it comes with
some IDE like features and therefore
it's kind of a hybrid between the code
editor or a pure code editor and the
real IDE so because of that we will use
Visual Studio code now where can we find
it actually well the answer is quite
simple we can simply go to
code.google.com and here we can find the
latest stable build as download now the
important thing is that if you click
right here you can also find insiders so
these are the pre-release candidates of
Visual Studio code to download but for
the purpose of this miniseries we will
just stick to the stable release version
of Visual Studio code now simply click
download to well download Visual Studio
code for your operating system and if
you then open visual studio code this is
what you should see now in case you
cannot see this Explorer right there
simply click onto the symbol right here
so in my case it's now hidden and if you
click again it should be visible now
with that we made sure that you see the
same screen that I see and before we now
think about the question how can we now
open the index.html file that we created
in the last video let's have a quick
look at code up here go to preferences
and go to color theme right there
because right here you can see that you
have lots of different color themes
available in Visual Studio code which
helps you to well kind of define the
look that you want to have to make sure
that you can enjoy coding now in my case
I will stick to the dark plus default
dark theme right there now back to the
question how we can open the index.html
file now well as you can see right here
we have this open folder button and if
we click onto that well then we should
navigate to the folder that we created
in the last video and where we save that
index.html file to in my case this is
the howdy web works fall over there here
you can see the index.html file now if
you now select a folder and press open
well then you can see that you have two
folder name right here so how the web
works and we can open this folder by
clicking right here select the
index.html file and we can see it right
there in this ribbon right here now as
you can see this is exactly the content
that we created in a text editor but you
already have some color in here because
we see that the tags were automatically
colored blue and with that we now have
all the tools we need to start our first
little web development project and by
that I mean creating our first basic web
application for this purpose we will
dive deeper into HTML CSS and JavaScript
throughout the next videos of this
series and after finishing the CSS part
we will have built this web app as you
can see this is of course a basic web
app but we have some images in it we
have some styling and we also have a
desktop and a mobile design implemented
and this is quite awesome actually I
think because these are our first steps
in web development so I hope to see you
in the next video but
we will start creating this web app and
dive deeper into HTML by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
