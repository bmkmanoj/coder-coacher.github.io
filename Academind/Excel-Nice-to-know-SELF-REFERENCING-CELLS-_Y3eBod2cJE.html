finally talk about business projects so
we will talk about balance sheets income
statements cash flows the work the capam
no no worries
we want the only thing I want to show
you is a function named self referencing
cell and this might be really helpful if
you have to work or create financial
models in this video we will not create
a highly sophisticated model we will
simply create an income statement well
to be honest with only three lines
revenue cost and profit and then think
about the planning of this lines for the
next years and for that we have three
different scenarios and in connection
with two scenarios a cell for instance L
might be really helpful sometimes this
is it actually let's start now
so here I am in an empty excel sheet now
this means we will build everything
together from scratch now I said that we
want to plan our income statement and
for that we have three different
scenarios or cases now let's start with
the case selection right here then so we
could write case right there and then
right selected right here for example
and now could format this cell for
example with some border and write one
into this so we could write 1 2 3 here
in the end could select a specific case
let's maybe also format that a little
bit that it looks a little bit more
beautiful in the end make it white maybe
and bold like this now what else do we
need well we could again write case
right here and total profit now why am I
writing this let me increase the width
and also format that maybe orange right
now now the reason is that we will see
case 1 2 3 right here and in this area I
want to see the total profit of all the
planning periods sort of some of that
profit for the selected case so this has
not a lot to do with valuation or
something and we will also not consider
things like discounting I'm aware of
that
it's just an example how you could use
the self referencing cell just keep the
demand when we build the rest right now
now we cannot build that total profit
right now because we don't have an
income statement yet now let's create
this so we could build that here maybe
and name it business plan so it sounds
more important and also format it a
little bit you see I just want to keep
this struct UPS I just want to keep this
structured and make it bold also and now
we need the years that should be
included in that business plan well and
this could be 2017 and if in all right
equals the previous year plus 1
and direct it to the right then we have
our planning right here and we could
also select that and make it bold maybe
like this now what else do we need
well the items in our income statement
and this could be for revenue cost and
the profit as you can see if not a
really sophisticated income statement
but that's not a problem right here now
let's assume that we have a revenue of
100,000 in 2017 cost of 60,000 and the
profit well this should be then the sum
of these two items so 40,000 so that's
2017 let's say we know that this is
going to be the case but what about the
planning periods well right here we need
to make assumptions for both revenue and
cost so for our revenue assumptions this
we could say we have case 1 case 2 and
case free so the cases we created up
here and that we will select in this
cell so C 3 now we can do the same thing
for our cost let's say cost as
percentage of revenue and we can simply
link that to our case 1 2 3 and copy
down because it's going to be the same
in the end now what else can we do we
can format these cells first to make
clear that these ourselves may be as
presented that these ourselves that are
kind of inputs for us where we will make
our assumptions and now we have to make
some assumptions well first I should be
more precise with the name right here
and it may be named that revenue growth
assumptions because now it's clearer
what you want to do right here we want
to specify growth rates for our revenue
now this could be in case one let's say
the optimistic scenario so the great
case where we say everything is going to
be awesome
this could be 10 percent growth in 2018
15 in 19 and 20 percent in 2020 so great
k-stew could be the more conservative
case let's say we have a growth of 8% in
the first year 10% in the second year
and 12% in the third year all the grade
but not as good as case one in k3 this
could be the worst case let's say we
only have six percent in the first year
four in the second and only two in the
last year so still growing but not a lot
compared to the other cases so these are
the assumptions for the revenue growth
now what about the cost as percentage of
revenue as you can see right here at the
moment we have a ratio of sixty percent
so 60,000 compared to 100,000 third year
let's maybe say that in the best-case
case one this ratio decreases so our
costs decrease by that so we could say
we have cost of fifty five percent in
2018
50 percent in 2019 and forty five
percent in 2020 in case two so the base
case so the normal scenario we could
also say that we have fifty five percent
cost in 2018 but then well we don't have
a big decrease we only have 52 percent
in 2019 and 50 percent in 2020
and in case three or worst-case scenario
well the cost are even increasing to
let's say 58 percent in 2007 and 2018 to
60 percent in 2019 and to 62 percent in
2020 so this is it this is now what we
did with our assumptions the only thing
we have to do right now is we have to
incorporate these assumptions in the
income statement right here now how can
we do this well we have different ways
to do it of course but I will use a
choose function if you're not sure how
the choose function generally works and
how you could use it when comparing it
to is just take a look at this video
in all other cases or if you simply want
to see it right now just stay here and
create it together with me so we will
now select the revenue in 2018 well and
what
should that be it should simply be
equals choose right so we will select
now cell c3 as the first value in our
syntax so depending on what is displayed
right here we now have to specify what
should be calculated this means if c3 is
equal to 1 which is the case right now
by the way then value 1 so again this
means value 1 means if this is equal to
1 then we want to calculate 100,000
multiplied by open bracket 1 plus the
growth rate right because this should be
the value the revenue increases when
comparing it to the previous year now we
can close the bracket write a comment
and make sure that we fix c3 because
this should always refer to that cell
and now we can simply copy that once
twice and delete a loss come up and now
for the second argument value 2 so right
here we only have to change D 14 to P 15
right here like this and like that
because this should be case 2 when we
write 2 into cell c3 and the last thing
we should change is D 14 so for our
value 3 it's okay 3 this should be equal
to D 60ml let's eat that and I think
with that we should be fine let's see
press ENTER and now we forgot a bracket
but that's automatically corrected this
is fine and if we now drag that formula
to the right and copy it then we see it
that this worked
it can also like a different case so
case two for example we see that we have
different values because now we have
this Grove assumption in our revenue
line the same thing is true for K 3
which will not incorporate the third
case and if we go back to 1 then we have
our best case scenario now that's the
revenue but what about the cost well we
have to apply something
actually now let's select cell e 10 now
and write equals choose sort of same
logic we again select cell c3 and six
six f4 now in scenario 1 we simply want
to calculate minus because it should be
a negative value as you can see right
here that's why I write this minus right
now so - the revenue times case 1 in our
cost assumptions down here now we can
again write a comma select the formula
copy twice we leave the last command and
now simply go to our value 2 right here
and replace the 19 with D 20 right here
then do this like that and now do the
same thing for value free so our third
case this means you have to replace the
19 with D 21 right here now this should
be fine
let's now close the bracket and not
forget it again and if we press ENTER
and drag that formula to the right now
then we can see that we now also have
our assumption for the cost line for
case 1 again if I changed it right here
to case 2 then both items change so
revenue cost and the same thing is true
for case free like this now the only
thing we have to do right now is we
simply have to take the profit line
right here and copy the formula to the
right like this well and now we are
finally at the point though we will need
these cells reference himself and why
would we need that well let's think back
about that total profit cells right here
what basically should be displayed right
here is this equals sum of the profit
like that as I said we forget about
discounting and many other topics right
here but that's not the point the point
is that if we fix now the rows right
here
and now copy the formula down well we
have the same value in here for all
three cases now of course I can change
the case now so case one case two okay
three and back to one but the problem is
that this shouldn't be like that
what should be displayed right here are
the different profit or the some of the
different profits for the selected cases
and this is where we can use such as
self referencing cell now how can we do
that let's simply apply it then to
understand it let's select the first
case right here if we now go into the
formula and right if this if this so the
selected case is equal to the case you
want to display or right here
so the first case and write a comment of
course and fix that again well if this
is equal to that then yeah of course
please give me back to some that we can
see right here but if that's not the
case so if we select a different case
well then simply refer to the value that
is already in that cell so you write the
formula in cell f3 and in the case that
the selected case is not equal to the
case of cell f3 so case one then refer
to the cell that includes the formula
sound strange but let's try it so if you
press ENTER now again I forgot the
brackets for that now we got that let me
now change the case so let's not change
case two and what we get right here is a
circular reference running and that's
one of the things that have to be aware
of when you create such a self
referencing cell because of course you
create a circle right here in that case
it's not a problem you only have to make
sure two things the first thing is to
press ok right here and to see that down
here we have a message that we have that
circular reference if you don't want
that because you know that it's in here
you can simply go to file now go to
options
formulas right here and now enable the
iterative calculation if you now press
ok you can see if that this warning is
not appearing any longer because in
other that iterative calculation
activated however the problem is if this
is a big financial model and you do
something like this it's always
important to note somewhere that you
created that circular reference because
otherwise people might wonder what you
did right there and in the end they
might unable the iterative calculation
and find the circles in here so what we
could do is we could simply write here
cells referencing cell and copy that
down for the other two because we will
add that of course for the remaining two
cells but before we do that let's see
what happens now so we created that cell
referencing cell right here and if I now
select case one then all three cases are
the same but if I now select case two
then only the other two cells change so
the ones where we didn't implement that
self referencing cell at the moment and
why this is happening once again because
in this case we only get a recalculation
of the formula if our if condition is
true so if our selected case is equal to
the case that this cell refers to so
case one in all other cases the
previously calculated value so in our
case the two three six two four zero
will simply remainder because the cell
retrieve the value that's already in the
cell now if we copy this formula down
now like this then you see that this
looks kind of strange because case one
in case three shoulders n value so
something seems to be wrong and that's
an important thing to make sure that
this self referencing cell works
correctly you have to recalculate it
every time you make a change or in this
case when you created formula so if we
now select case 1 case 2 and case
you can see that maybe we should change
that first you can see that now we have
different values for all three cases so
this is fine and what you can do right
now of course is you can select a
specific case let's say case - in our
case which is fine and now think about
your assumptions in your model you could
say that you would assume that the
revenue growth in the last year in case
two is not first percent but maybe
fifteen percent then you simply change
that like this and the value
automatically updates but this is only
true because we selected case to know as
I just said if we change to growth
expectations in case three let's say we
have ten percent in the last year now so
we change it to ten but nothing changed
right here but if we click right here
and now select k3 like this then it
updates and that's it actually that's
what I want to show you of course this
is a really really simple and small
example but this is a function that you
can also apply to bigger financial
models only be careful about the
functionalities or about the way the
formula works now this means that we
have that circular reference so you have
to make sure to enable the iterative
calculation and to leave a note
somewhere to make sure you and other
people see and remember that
self-referencing cells and that formula
you created and additionally make sure
that each time you change something in
your case you have to reselect it right
here in our case this is it actually I
hope this was interesting for you and
that you might be able to apply it in
your own financial models so thanks for
watching and see you in the next videos
