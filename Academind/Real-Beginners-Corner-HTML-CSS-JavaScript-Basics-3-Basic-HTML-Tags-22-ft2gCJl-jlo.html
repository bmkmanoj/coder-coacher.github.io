headings we got our paragraph you get a
link what else might be very basic to an
HTML document not sure if you know it
but lists are also quite common if we
have a navigation like this with a
drop-down like this that's basically a
list and that's basically a list right
it might not have bullet points or
anything like this but it is a list of
items and therefore we get this
unordered list tag which is ul for
unordered list and this tag alone won't
create a list a list also needs items
right so this tag is used in the way
that we defined a list and then we
define a list item Li for list item list
items now let me just copy this line to
create a second list item and if we
reload our page we got our list here
with the two list items we just you find
as I said this one does have bullet
points because we're not applying any
styles to it where this page clearly
applies some styling which says okay no
bullet points gray background when we
hover over it it should have a dark grey
background and so on this list also has
links within it as you can see we could
do this too we can say okay let's add a
link here H ref point to Google again as
you can see I can leave out the www so
let's create a link again list item
should be inside this link and if we
reload we got a little side them with a
link in it so we can really encapsulate
our text within each other and this is
quite common in HTM
that you've got several levels of text
so you get an unordered list of list
items in it with links in it for example
so that's the structure of an HTML
document I was talking of so headings
paragraph links lists what else do we
have by the way I just recognized
something which is a bit embarrassing
your whole document HTML document the
head and body section is encapsulated by
an HTML tag which basically tells okay
this is all HTML as you did see the page
worked without these tags - but we're
writing semantically correct HTML
therefore it might not be better I
forgot it because you could really see
the difference it's working the other
way too but we're gonna create a correct
structure here which again has its
reason in a sense of how it is displayed
on different devices or accessed by
things like screen readers okay so back
to our important HTML tags I just saw
that and wanted to inject it really
quick another important thing we
definitely have for many pages are
images here we got our image tag which
is just IMG for an image short form and
there's a special tag because it is self
closing which means we don't have this
structure here with opening tag closing
tag but instead we got image and then in
the same tag we got a slash and the
closing attacked a relative greater than
sign immediately this is because an
image tag doesn't hold any content which
you would write between the opening and
closing tag instead an image is all
defined by the attributes you give it
such as the source of our image now I
looked up some random image on Google so
just inserting is just
blinking here so we get our source now
let's refresh our website and we got
this image here I'm going to do that now
additional attributes we here I have
here are an alt text for when the image
is not loaded corrected there's a text
which will be displayed instead we go
also get a width of which gives us the
possibility to override the default
width of the image so this is just the
sized image normally has and if I give
it a width of 200 an automatic
automatically scales down so it keeps
its height and just changes the width
now if you also define a height of let's
say 400 pixels oops
let's click click today then we got this
skewed image here because these
attributes override the default behavior
of first taking the standard normal size
of the image second adjusting it if we
give if we define one dimension if your
height or width and adjusting the
different the other one and then if we
give both it uses both so just removing
that oh by the way this px is one of the
available units we have and we will come
back to those when we are actually
discussing CSS so that's an image we got
some more attributes we could use but
let's stay basic here now another thing
we definitely have on many pages are
forms where a user has to enter some
data forms all the consists of several
tags so they start with a form tag which
also has a closing tag and between this
form tags we define the elements of our
form so for example we get an input
for an input element where a user can
input data of a type which is an
attribute we have to provide let's say
text it could also be password for
example which is also a input box but it
automatically turns all characters to
stars through our people linking as your
screen can't see your password and this
also is a self closing tag so it's just
with the errors with the image we just
write slash and then greater that and we
also provide a name attribute which is
important when the form is actually sent
to the server that it can identify which
input element got which value by the
user and this is a kind of identified by
the names let's just name this user name
for example I am going to copy it show
you the password one just using password
here that's only for the way it
displayed that's the only way it's
important the type name is password the
names are purely optional that's not
that's important for the browser how to
render it that's optional because that
assumed as a certain name how you can
identify it on the server side on which
we're not covering right now and add a
button gives us also a type of submit
which basically says this partners meant
to submit this form that's important if
we would have several buttons within a
form and our buttons would do other
things and only one button should really
send the foreign to the server then we
would have to define which button is
responsible for this and just give it a
text of submit this is the text which
will appear on the button now reload our
page and here we got all four now we got
our user name field here and our
password field as you can see which
awesome automatically hides
our characters and if we hit submit well
it tries to submit it as you can see it
automatically created a get request
which might not tell you anything right
now we'll come back to that too and try
to send it to the server obviously we
don't have a server here so yeah nothing
really happened here now there are two
more elements I would like to talk about
but these are very basic elements for
styling or for creating visual layouts
for layout in our page and that's why I
will go into detail about them in a
later stage but for now just be aware
that the div and span tags are also very
important for a document when it comes
to laying it out and styling it so
that's it for this video and we'll dive
deeper into our HTML structuring and the
one in the next video have a nice day
