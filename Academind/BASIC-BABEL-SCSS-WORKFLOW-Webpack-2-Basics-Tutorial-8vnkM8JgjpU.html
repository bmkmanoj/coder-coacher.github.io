we're going to build a basic wetback
workflow compiling es6 code with able to
use five code so that it runs in all
browsers and compiling s CSS which is a
superset to CSS Q CSS code so that it
also runs in the browser so that was
developing we can use more features
features which make our developers life
easier using es6 features using s CSS
which really enhances the way you write
your CSS code makes it more fun to write
it code a bit easier gives you more
features and we still get an app at the
end which runs in all browsers because
we compile everything to code which can
be parsed which can be understood by all
browsers as mentioned we're going to use
webpack for that and if you're brand new
to web pack you check out the other
videos I made about it here on my
channel where I explain the basics to
core concepts on how to get started
I assume that you have that basic
knowledge in this video now here's the
starting project we're starting with and
in the video description you'll find a
link to a get up repository where you
can follow to find this Grunch holding
this starting project here so let's
start and of course since you want to
use webpack we need install it the first
step is to therefore initialize this
project with NPM notes package manager
which you will use to manage all the
dependencies in this project before
doing so though let me quickly walk you
through the project we of course have
our index.html file here and there we
have a couple of buttons in a paragraph
we don't have any imports neither a
script nor a CSS import as you can tell
and then we got our CSS and JavaScript
folder in the source folder in the CSS
folder we're using a CSS though we got
this colors variable where we define
some colors and store them in variables
just as varial file holds these
variables that's the SCS as future
variables if you want to learn more
about s CSS simply google for sass which
is the underlying language you could say
to learn which features you may use
there and then the main go to a CSS file
I'm using these variables to basically
get the buttons in the index.html file
them some stylings because the buttons
will have these IDs attached to them in
the JavaScript folder
we get the app.js file where i get
references to some dom elements like the
paragraph in the buttons and then we
have some functions which i want to
execute here I use ventilators to
execute them I use es6 arrow functions
here
I always cons which is a es6 feature and
I when I use the random generator which
is not a built-in JavaScript object or
class instead it's my own class you find
here in the random generator or
JavaScript file so here I'm using
another es6 feature class and export
that's the thing we're starting with now
as I mentioned let's initialize this
project with NPM to be able to install
some dependencies for that I will run
NPM in it and so that I don't have to
answer all these questions I will run -
Y which will answer them all with yes
this will give me a package of JSON file
it contains some things I don't want to
have here don't need that so that's the
basic file I'm going to go with that
setup here maybe put my name in here of
course that's purely optional and up to
you and with that setup I can now use
NPM to install some things so I will use
NPM install to of course start with web
pack so let's NPM install web pack and
let's all the graph you web dev server I
also created a video about that and this
server will be used to can see our
application run while we develop it so I
want to use webpack and web pack dev
server and I'll also store and enter the
package.json file by putting - - safe
depth behind the npm install command
this will pull down the file CDG
packages and give me an entry in the
package of JSON file now while students
running we can already create the web
pack config files a web config dot j s
this is the file where we will configure
our web pack workflow and as you learned
it in my other videos we will use module
exports to export our configuration a
Java Script object and there we got some
basic building blocks at least we need
an entry and the output element so that
we can tell weapon where to start and
what you create so let's start with
entry
and I want to start with the fjs file
this should be where weapon starts
analyzing my project because this will
later be where I put all my imports so
let's reference it as a relative path
seen from the config file on dot slash
then the source folder and then it's in
the JavaScript folder the app dot J's
file and this will be what WebEx starts
analyzing a project since starts there
this is where we should use some imports
and we need them anyways if we have a
look at the app such as fall we're not
importing the random generator we are
exporting in this file so let's add
import at the top I'm going to use a es6
import which is supported by web pick by
default even if you're not installing a
es6 transpiler as we will do so that we
can also compile the rest of this code
which will not be supported by web tech
out of the box so let's import from our
random generator file which lives in the
same folder and we don't need to put the
file extension there because dot
JavaScript is extension automatically
detected by web pack and you don't want
to import the random generator class
that's one thing we also need to take
care about the s CSS code here in the
main dot s CSS file I need to import my
color variables and we can do this by
using at import s CSS feature and then
referencing colors like that this will
grab our colors file and imported and
added to this a CSS file so that is a
CSS code up here now with that added we
also need to import the main dot s CSS
file into our javascript file and whilst
it might sound strange to import CSS or
s CSS into JavaScript this is just how
wet eggless works and it will not put
the code into the javascript file in the
end of course you can't mix it like this
but it will start analyzing it and if it
then hits these CSS files or a CSS file
we just need to ensure that we installed
the right loaders so the epic is able to
actually pull out the s CSS or CSS code
and then put it somewhere else for
example into the head of
Paige and you learned this in my other
videos too so let's make sure to go to
the app touch s file and at the top I
also want to add an import here using
the JavaScript import syntax pointing to
my CSS folder and then we may not a CSS
file like this this will make sure that
I also import this file and that web
pick will find it was it analyzes my
code because keep in mind after chess is
my starting point so it is there what we
need to reference all the files you want
to web tech to take care about so that's
the entry part now we want to create
something so we need an output here - an
output is a JavaScript object where we
define the path and then the file name
the pop should be an absolute path and
for that we can use a little note j/s
package to help us a package you
automatically have if you installed no
chairs as you did otherwise you wouldn't
use npm this is the path package and we
install it by using required path like
this so that is our import of the path
package and we can then use it and there
specifically you resolve method to
create an absolute path using a helper
variable we have available here - -
underscore underscore dur name which
gives us simply the current directory
but it gives us an absolute path to that
directory and then well the folder we
want to store our thousand and that
would be the dist folder which does not
exist as of now but which will be try it
created dynamically so that's the path
the file name should be bundle dot j s
for JavaScript code will take care about
the CSS part later with a specific
loader or plugin to be precise so this
is where we will store it what what do
you want what we want to create right
that's nice but right now it would it
would not really work if we create a
script in the package to JSON file let's
name it built and all we do there is we
run web pack def server like this let's
find out what happens if I now run npm
run bolt so if i now execute the script
you see a
gets us an error and if we broaden this
if we just make this a bit wider we see
that it can't handle the import syntax
in the SPSS file because it doesn't
understand
scss and that makes sense because we we
installed no help for web pack by
default it doesn't understand SPSS we
need a loader for that we need a couple
of loaders to be precise because once it
will understand es6 our browser wouldn't
or at least not all browsers would so we
also need to transpile the es6 code and
that is why you're watching this video
anyways right so let's make sure we
install all the loaders and libraries we
need to successfully compiled our code
I'm going to use NPM install again and
here for scss I need T SAS loader
because SCS SPN uses says this will kind
of translate SPSS to something well to
CSS in the end SAS loader needs node
sets which is a package which in the end
dusty translation says loader only to
plug in or what we put into web pack to
enable web pack to do so and besides the
SAS loader I then also need to CSS
loader to do something with the CSS we
get because CSS is nice but we still
can't handle this in JavaScript and now
we could use the style loader
to inject that CSS into the head of our
page and I showed this in other videos
but here I actually don't want to do
this instead I will use some plugin the
extract text web pack plug-in a very
short name which will allow us to get
all the compiled CSS code and put it
into its own file so that we can import
a separate file holding our CSS code
which make sure that it doesn't depend
on JavaScript getting loaded because if
you use the other approach well in the
end it will get injected into the head
part of your section as soon as your
JavaScript code was loaded in the
running page if for some reason
JavaScript was turned off or
and executes successfully this page will
have no styling to therefore this is the
approach which decouples to two things
so that's taken care about the s CSS in
CSS part but we're also using es6 and as
mentioned
webpack understands es6 but it doesn't
compile it to es5 so the browser or
older browsers Internet Explorer
obviously won't be able to handle it
therefore we need to compile es6 and for
that we're going to use Babel which is a
transpiler doing that we need to install
Babel core which is basically doing the
translation Geordie transpiling I should
say then we also need Babel loader just
like with nodes s and the sass loader
one does the actual job and the other
plucks it into our web Peck flow Babel
loader does letter it connects it to web
pack and we also need to install some
rules because Babel core by default is
able to do the translation but we need
to tell it hey which features do you
want to be able to compile for that
we're going to install a preset and
there are loads of different presets
like you can use I will excuse the Babel
preset es2015 which will unlock all the
year six features basically so datas the
preset that is the loader and that is
payable core and the same for sass now
with that I will add - - safe def to
also store some references in the
package.json file and just will now
download everything create entries new
package to JSON file and then we can
continue tweaking our webpage config
file to use all these features to use
all these loaders and so on so now that
it's finished I can go back to my web
tech file and obviously we want to do
something with the module so with our
files now here as you learn in the other
widgets we set up some rules which is an
array of rules and there we simply have
rules where each rule is a JavaScript
object now we want to test something so
test when this specific rule this
JavaScript object should apply test
takes a regular expression and I want to
test for the file extension here
beginning with JavaScript so all
JavaScript files should in the end be
compiled two years five so I test for
javascript falls and then I want to use
something that is an array and here I
specify all the loaders that want to use
now the short syntax is to just specify
babel loader here like this just a
string in this array and it could have
multiple loaders the problem is are also
want to configure this loader because
babel loader by default almost does the
job but what else did we install well
our preset and I need to tell beta
loader which preset to use we only have
one but the beta loader doesn't know
that so I will not use this shortcut
instead the longer version where I pass
a JavaScript object to this array then I
define the loader key where it's a babel
loader so that is what we could have
done with the shortcut but i'll define
an average key and that is options and
this allows me to configure this loader
and of course this is available for
pretty much any loader of course you
need to check out the options to
specific loader offers which can find
any documentation of the loader so here
in options that's an average javascript
object and we could define a couple of
things about the bay loader and check
its documentation to learn what you can
configure i'm interested in defining the
presets i'm going to use and that is an
array and here i only have one es2015
but you could have more presets to
unlock more features of es7 for example
already
that is our babel loader transpiling our
javascript code and that is all the
rules i want to set up for javascript I
will add another rule though of course
this one being responsible for s CSS now
here I will also test and as I just
mentioned I want to test for s CSS files
so we'll check for the a CSS file
extension with this regular expression I
then will also use something and now
here I will not just define my loaders
in an array the reason for this is that
I want to extract my compiled CSS file a
code into a separate file so just
running the code through the loaders
doesn't do the trick I need to use the
plug-in we installed this here this
extract text web pack plug-in now
correctly you could
say yeah what's your earlier videos we
have that plug-in property we can define
so after module here and you're right
and we will use it but this plug-in also
needs to know what it should extract and
that what should I extract part is
actually find here in our rules first of
all I need to install the plugin down so
here I will fetch the extract text
plug-in by using require and then
extract text web pick plug-in so it is
very short plug-in aim we installed and
then I will configure it a little bit
more I will name it extract plug-in here
- now instantiate it basically with some
configuration and in this configuration
you well can configure some things about
the plug-in again search the official
documentation by googling the plug-in
the thing I'm interested in is
configuring the file name because as a
Cal told you this plug-in will take our
CSS code and put it into a separate file
well obviously we need to tell it how to
name that file so I will name it main
dot CSS but of course this file name is
totally up to you with that configured
we can go down and back to this CSS rule
here in use I will use extract plug-in
the variable we defined here which holds
our initialized extract plug-in and I
will call the extract method cutis
extract method I now pass a JavaScript
object and in here I now again define
use and that is we're now set up to
loaders so that's just a pattern used by
this plugin that you use it in a rule in
the US section and then you wrap the
loaders you want to use in the end
that's just a pattern you can remember
for this plug-in here and of course this
is all the explained in the
documentation of this plug-in so here we
get two loaders and since I won't
configure these loaders in any way I can
again use the shortcut of just having a
couple of strings here in this array so
I will use the CSS loader but first I
want to run it through the FCSS loader
and keep in mind I told you that this
array is parsed from n
to start so the last element in this
array is the first loader which gets
applied
that's just how web peg works so we
first parse the SPSS code and trans
Paulo to CSS and then CSS would still
not be able to be handled in a
JavaScript file and remember we do
import it into a JavaScript file in the
end then we need to CSS loader so that
weapon is also able to import CSS into
JavaScript as mentioned before it
doesn't really add it to the JavaScript
file but at least it understands what
this import means and since we wrapped
us all in the extract like in this will
now come in and pick up the kampala CSS
code and put it into the separate file
to be precise it almost does this here
we simply tell the plug-in what to
extract but you really use it we need to
use that plug-ins property we also
define in our config object itself
plugins as an array and we define all
the plugins we want to run our final
code through and of course we want to
use the extract like it just like that
just a reference to this or just this
variable we instead really initialized
here and this will now pick up the
configuration from above and then here
what we wrap with it and at the end
we'll take all the pieces it has all the
information has to put them together and
store our CSS code in that separate file
and as our finished config file now
would be nice seeing that in action
wouldn't it so do you see it in action
there's one more thing I need to do for
the web pack dev server since our
index.html file is in the root folder
and our compiled files will live in a
distal der since that is what we define
here I need to add one other property in
the output and that's the public pop
where I say that the files will be in a
dist folder I do set up to pop up here
but that's an absolute path now here I
need to set up the relative path or the
path as seen from the index.html file on
so that the web pack dev server knows
where to look for these for these
elements basically so that is all the
setup I need now to also see something
of course we need to change our index
HTML file because right now we're not
importing anything we know that at the
end we will have two files we will have
a bundle dot J's file for the JavaScript
code and the main dot CSS file for the
CSS code both will be placed in the dist
folder so in the NX HTML file I'll be
able to import that by simply adding a
link here where I want to reference this
folder and then main dot CSS and at the
bottom to page a script import where I
will reference this bundle dot J s these
are the two things that when a import
now with that in place let's rerun and
Cameron build and see if this now works
and I do get an error because I made a
mistake it's of course not called s CSS
loader
it's called SAS loader and you could
have fully figured it out by having a
look at the package to Jason felt so
little mistake on my side let's
restartable process nice to see that
it's tiny things like these which fail
in the end this looks better now let's
go to the URL or web pick dev server is
running at your localhost 8080 and if we
go there we see a running application
styling seems to work and if I click on
that I indeed create a random number
switch output below so that seems to
work if we open the console we also
don't see an error also not upon
reloading and therefore our compilation
and the loading of the files seems to be
successful now as a final step I also
want to build this for production and of
course you can always tweak all these
things but we will dive deeper into more
advanced setups in the future for now
I'll simply add a build prod script here
where it will execute just web pack not
the dev server because I don't want to
host them on a server I really want to
get the artifacts which I can do by neck
area which I can deploy web pack - P
will build for production and also
minify the code again you can tweak this
all even more to control how
minification happens and so on so we're
running NPM bolt prot I now create a
dist folder in this root folder
here it is and there we get a bundle
Dodgers file and a main dot CSS file and
as you can tell this is magnified as is
really compact and now if you were to
deploy that in a disk folder and the
index.html file in the folder above this
of course you can also treat this
workflow to have it all in the image in
the disc falter and we will do this in
the future but this would tell you
deploy it right now and with that you
get a finished basic workflow using es6
and a CSS and hopefully seeing all these
things come together and how web tech
works now as mentioned this is a
workflow we can still tweak and which we
will probably do in future videos you
also have the index.html file in the
dist folder maybe to use tree-shaking a
feature I will explain in the future and
now with it all finished let me finally
go through what we're doing here step by
step again so that it is really super
clear if you already understand
everything you will of course already
leave the video and I hopefully see you
back in our videos now let's see what's
happening here we had a app touch chest
file at the beginning and we have the
random generator as file which we import
in the app shares form and then we had
some F CSS files we also imported main
dot s CSS in the app shares file we
imported the colors as CSS file the main
CSS file and now we want to use webpack
so how does web pack well go through our
files how does the flow look like we
could say we have two different
processes here because we have a SCSS
build process and that javascript build
process of course the end hand by web
peg in one file but these are two
different rules we apply so let's start
with the JavaScript process we use the
babel loader to transpile es6 to es5 and
babel loader uses some rules as you
learn some presets
yes 2015 preset that's nice in the end
this will result on a bundle or chase
vowel the SCSS workflow is a bit more
complicated here we first use the sass
loader
to compile a CSS fast to CSS but CSS
still can't be handled by JavaScript
so we need to CSS loader to tell web
pack it's fine this import is okay this
is just a CSS file which I will handle
somehow then we could handle it with key
style loader to inject it into the head
of our page but instead here we used to
extract text plug-in to extract it into
its own file into its own CSS file which
in the end will result and the main dot
CSS file and this is how you could
depict the process we created in the
last minutes in this video and with that
it's hopefully super clear how that all
works now I'm really looking forward to
type deeper into epic together with you
and future videos have a great time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
