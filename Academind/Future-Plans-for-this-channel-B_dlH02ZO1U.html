have 1000 subscribers video I do have a
lot of plans for this channel and now I
finally got more time to yet you make
these plans come reality what are these
plans well first of all I will continue
mile arable and my angular too serious
because I really like those and while it
has gotten a little bit more quiet
around angular to the series here I
still have a lot of ideas what I wanted
you there build more applications with
it going to some advanced concepts all
that stuff so that's the part you
already have now what is the upcoming
part we're going to have a look at
nodejs at express framework there and at
meteor which is using noches to on the
server and also has a strong connection
to the client site so which is a full
stack frame work so to say we'll also
have a look at our front-end frameworks
like react for example to yes see how
those frameworks work to enable you to
pick the framework you you like most for
your projects additionally i plan to do
some not really language to specific
videos but more general videos where I
for example compare different frameworks
where I give my view on the web
development industry where I try to give
some guidance where to start if you're
brand new into web development and so on
and share my thoughts really so that is
something like coming up where I'm
planning to do and there is another part
which is not related to coding now as
you might be aware i'm working as a
freelance web developer and what I liked
most about freelancing is freedom it's
in the world right and I always chose my
projects such that i can use the tools
and languages i want and that i'm not
doing the same and the same at the same
in each project and therefore i also do
a lot of designing so designing websites
and sketching them out
creating assets in Illustrator and so on
and now the interesting thing is why I'm
not capable of drawing a horse on a
sheet of paper for example web design is
something you can actually learn if you
learn how to use the right tools if you
get some basic understanding what works
for typing about colors and I want to go
into this direction a little bit and
release some content there you weary for
example build assets and illustrator
build icons or our things you might need
or evil wary will learn the tools you
need to create stuff like this we'll
also design websites in Photoshop and
sketch where we see how those tools work
and how we structure a website how we
come up with decides which colors work
and so on so that is really interesting
i think i'm very excited to roll out the
first videos there too i will also
connect that with the development part
and i plan on creating a series which
might be called asylum code or anything
like that where we start from an empty
sheet of paper and then we sketch out
the website we created this side and
then we implemented so that you see the
whole process I think that's very
interesting and I'm very excited to see
what you guys think of that so that are
all the ideas that I have and why that
might sound like a lot that it would
probably take a year to well fulfill all
these ideas or to do something about
them I'm very confident that I will be
able to touch your most topics very soon
because as I said now I finally have
more time that I can put into all these
things and therefore will pretty soon
start with all these new well serious or
videos and all the new content I'm very
excited to get started here and yeah
obviously I'm very excited to see your
reactions and how you like it so stay
tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
