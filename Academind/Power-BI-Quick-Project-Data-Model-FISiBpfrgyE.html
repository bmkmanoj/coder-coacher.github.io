the last video we worked in the theory
editor so we finished data preparation
and loaded the data into our data model
so time to take a closer look at this
data model right now so right here I am
back in our project and at the moment I
am in the report view you can select a
different use right here well the report
view will be covered later in this video
but before we really create our charts
we have to take a look at the data model
to do this we should go to the data view
which you can find right here well end
right there we can see our table
actually we have two tables but you can
select these right here by clicking
right there you need to click on to this
little arrow right here you can simply
see all the different columns or the
right here so let's start and work on
that data
well I selected our text model table
right here and the first thing I would
like to change is well I don't like that
date format right here so how can we
change that well as you could see I
simply selected that column right here
and if I now go to the modeling ribbon
then you can see both these formatting
options you can see that the data type
is already correct it stayed which is
totally fine but well the way it is
displayed is not the way I would like it
to be so if you go to format right here
and a time then you can select from a
broad range of different date formats
well let's select one I don't know maybe
this one for example like that so you
can see now the week date is not
displayed in here anymore but talking
about the weekday well I would like to
have an extra color actually in here
which displays exactly that so the
weekday and if you remember back our
first video then we created a table
which includes all the weekdays you can
find it right here our we disabled and
here we have this weekdays so how can we
connect these two tables now but maybe
we can create a new column in our text
model table right here which includes
numbers for the different weekdays
because if you look back in our table
you can see
we have a number for each weekday the
good news is that we can do that so
let's go back to our taxi model table
right here and now we'll add a new
column and we will add a calculated
column that's important because that's
what it's called in the data model
empower your desktop to add such a
calculated column we will simply select
the new column options right here this
one well as you can see you now have
that new column and you have that
formula bar so what you can do is you
can first rename that column maybe to
weekday number the same name that we
have in the weekdays table by the way
now how can we assign a number to that
weekday about the good news is that
there isn't implemented function in
power bi desktop and this function is
simply called weekday you can find it
right here by the way you can navigate
through the formulas using the arrow
keys the up and down arrow keys on the
keyboard and if you find the formula
that you would like to have then you can
simply press tab right here on the
keyboard then write that square bracket
and now select the date column you can
see it the first option right here again
press tab now write a comma and now
select the second option so Monday
should be one and sunday should be seven
this is what we want to have so if you
press tab once more and press ENTER then
we can see that the days were numbered
correctly right here but what have we
done actually we used a data analysis
expression attacks in the short form
this is simply the formula language that
is used in power bi desktop in a data
model now if you want to find out more
about the decks just take a look at your
official documentation right here right
there you can see lots of different
functions that you can apply to your
data model the way we did it right here
now in this video we will not dive
really deep into the X we will just
apply some basic functions just to make
sure that you get an idea of how this
generally works if you want to dive
deeper just play around into data using
maybe the data that we have right here
and the official documentation
so now we know what we did right here
and why we did it that talking about the
why we actually wanted to connect the
weekdays with the weekdays in our
weekdays table well and whenever we talk
about connecting different types of
information in a data model this brings
us to relationships because the great
thing is that we don't only have a
report for you right here and the data
if you right there but we have a third
option and this is the relationship view
right here and in there you can
basically see our two tables now in a
different format but if you click what
you have for example that can increase
the size and you can reduce the size you
can drag that around just as you prefer
but the important thing is that well if
you look at the different columns right
here we now have two equal columns we
have our a weekday number this one right
here and this one right there and if I
now simply select the week the number
column right here so I present all the
left mouse button and drag it right
there to that week this number column in
our second table
then you can see that this connection is
established and whispered we established
in our case a many to one relationship
because each week date number only
exists once in our week day table
buttocks is multiple times or many times
in our taxi model table that's basically
the many to one relationship that we
established you can also see that by the
star right here which is simply many and
the one right there so this is also
something you can do in power bi desktop
you can easily establish relationships
and when we create the visuals in a few
minutes you will see that this
relationship will be a great help
however we saw the relationships right
here so we can go back to our data model
actually right there and now think about
another calculation that we could apply
let's create a new calculated column
again right here let's maybe calculate
the distance too right because we have
the distance right here and we have the
rights per day
let's maybe call that distance per right
like that well and how can we refer to
that columns now well we can again
simply rights bill square bracket and
now simply write di and as you can see
we immediately see that this is the
column that we see right here so we can
press tab now divided by another square
bracket the right or the rights per day
actually right here if you now press
Enter
well then you can see that we have our
club average right distance per day
displayed right there in this column now
however the formatting is not the best
so we might want to change that well and
to do this we simply have to unselect
the column first and now we select it
now it's working because right here in
that modeling ribbon up there you can
see that you have again the data type we
have the format which could again be set
to decimal number right here and now you
see that you only have two decimals
right there if you want to change that
you can simply click right here so you
have three two one just as you prefer so
this is how you can format your data
right here in this data model however I
always talked about the calculated
columns this means adding a new column
and doing the calculation but there is
another type of what calculation that we
can apply to our data model using the
data analysis expressions tax and these
are measures now what's the difference
between a measure and a calculated
column well as you can see right here a
calculated column is displayed right
here so you can see it and it's
immediately calculated and by that it
consumes memory a measure is something
different and to show you how a measure
works let's maybe simply create one so
to create such a measure you again go to
the modeling ribbon and now you can find
the new measure right here if you click
onto that well then you can again find
your formula bar right here but you
cannot see that new column right here
because when we created a new calculated
column we could immediately see
is that a new column will be added so
there seems to be kind of a difference
between a calculated column and a
measure but let's create the measure
first and then take a look at the
details so what measure could we create
right here
let's first maybe delete that capital M
like that and let's maybe create a
measure with the total revenue now Oh
what's the total revenue in here but
this should simply be the sum of the
fare the extra the tax and the tip now
why don't we just try it again do you
square brackets and now write fair hmm
this doesn't work apparently so we
cannot calculate that no of course you
can do that we just need another formula
and this formula is called sum X like
that
if you press tab well then you simply
have to define the table as you can see
but here this is taxi model so right
here our table name and if you know
press tap again well then you can write
a comma so we have specified the table
name and if you now write the square
bracket then we can select the extra tab
plus another square bracket then we need
fair then plus and another square
bracket hmm and then well we cannot
select another column because with some
X if you write it this way we can only
add two columns and that's not what we
want because we want to add four columns
actually but there is a simple way how
to solve this problem the only thing you
have to do is well we have to kind of
delete that part like that now write
taxi or tax actually it's enough and now
we can again select the different
columns so we select the taxable extra
then write the plus again right taxi
then add the fare edit write text again
add text and one less plus and taxi and
add the tip so we have extra fare tax
and tip and Fe now press Enter
well then we see that we don't
see a lot this is not true because if
you look at the fields column now you
can find the measure increase the size
maybe the measures of revenue right here
so we kind of added that measure but the
measure is not calculated right now
because a measure is only calculated
when you use it in a visual and visuals
are not tradable here but created in the
report view right there and as you can
see already in the report view you also
have all your different fields available
including that measure so if I drag that
measure them into a visual then it will
be calculated we will see how this works
in a few seconds let's just go back one
last time to our data view right here
and maybe add one more measure to it
because maybe it's also possible to kind
of use that measure in a formula let's
try that and create another measure
clicking right here and again I don't
like that capital M so let's call that
and maybe revenue per passenger maybe
let's see if we can calculate that now
how would it work well we could write
divide ad and now what would be the
numerator well this should actually be
our total revenue now we have that
measure so maybe we can refer to it yes
we can you see I just wrote these square
brackets and now we have that measure so
we can press tab again now we want to
divide it so we have to write a comma
because we use that divided formula and
now we can simply write another square
bracket and then we can only select the
measure again but actually we want to
refer to a specific column to passenger
column but if we delete that and now
simply write some press tab but then we
can refer to that column that we want
you so we can go down right here to the
passengers well and if we now close the
bracket right here and press Enter well
then we can again see that of course a
column wasn't added
that because you created a measure but
we can see the measure if I criticize
right here right there and with that we
are actually done with our first
overview of the data view because we
learned that we can write different
formulas and add different calculations
by using the Dax the data analysis
expressions right here and we saw that
we can create relationships right there
in that relationship view so I think now
it's time to go to the report view and
create some visuals based on the
information that we created so let's go
to the report view here and see what we
can do right here now well the first
thing is we could simply create a line
chart and how do we create charts in
general right here well you see that
visualizations column actually and if
you now select a specific chart type and
I said let's maybe select a line chart
then you can see that chart right there
or that frame actually you can also
refer to that as a tile which is kind of
the area where the charge is going to be
displayed so if you increase the width
for example you can change that you can
play around just as you prefer let's
maybe make that quite big actually
because I would like to display the
following in that chart as an axis I
would like to have the date so our
initial date column that we have from
the source file right here hmm
now we cannot see a lot so let's maybe
add the passengers right here as a value
and could you see what I did you can
simply select the chart and then drag
the fields right here from the fields
column into the corresponding sections
of that visual
so it's an easy drag-and-drop logic
actually but now we have that chart and
we can now see the passengers by year
okay and we can also see that we have
kind of a hierarchy in here because it
is right here you have year quarter
month and day additionally you can see
that hierarchy right there with the
arrow so if you click onto that then you
can see I'll go back right here and we
have the annual data right here and in
the next
step you have the quarterly data
aggregated for both years if you click
one step further then you can even see
the monthly data but again aggregate it
for both years and if you go down once
more well then you can see the daily
data but only numbered from 1 to 41 now
this is one way how to display the
information right here and the important
thing is which you can see right here is
that you can add such hierarchies in
power bi to kind of display different
details regarding information in one
different visual but I don't want to
have that right here I would like to
have simply a chart a line chart which
shows me the daily passenger amount well
and to change this you can simply go
back to your visualizations column click
right here and now change that from date
have our team to date
and as you can see if now we have a
chart with the amount of passengers for
all the different days in each year so
in the two years actually that we have
data for and that's how easy you can
create a charge in power bi now let's
create another visual then why don't we
create a column chart for example so
let's select the column chart right here
for example oh now I change the chart
type why did that happen well if you
select the chart then you can also well
dynamically change the chart type that
should be displayed so you can change
the to such a bar chart or a pie chart
which is deliberately good or back to
the line chart so this is also great
function of power bi desktop you can
dynamically change the chart type that
you want you if you want to create a new
chart type then you can simply unselect
your current chart by clicking right
here in the report page now talking
about pages this is a report page you
can see that page 1 right here and this
page specifies the area where you can
place your visuals in you can see this
in this white area if the space not
enough then you can simply click right
here to add a second a third a fourth
and so on page if you don't want to have
the page you can delete it by clicking
right here and press that
in our project one page is enough I just
wanted to show you that however we
wanted to create a second chart
so let's now select maybe the bar chart
right here
drag it down and increase the size a
little bit like that maybe now in that
chart I would like to combine two things
I would like to have our weekday you
remember the weekday reiterated right
here in that separate table but that we
connected with our made to one
relationship so let's select the weekday
and drag it right here as an axis and
then I would like to have our measure so
the total revenue and the chore was it
this one yes this one so let's select
that and drag it right here as a value
and as you can see we now also create
that chart based on a measure that was
now calculated in that visual and based
on our second table so only because of
this relationship we are able to display
this chart and you can also see that the
order of the base is correct because of
the way we created that table now I also
have a video where I'll show you another
way how to create such a charge with the
week they stored correctly just take a
look at this video to find out this
different approach however we have that
visual now but I would like to show you
two more visual types in power bi so
let's unselect that again by clicking
right here and now add a card right here
right there it is like that well then I
would like to display one specific value
in this card if this value is our second
measure so our revenue per passenger so
let's I can drag that and put it right
here
well and as you can see that make it
smaller just as you prefer and as you
can see if now we have the revenue per
passenger for the total period the
average of course now if I select a day
for example right here in the chart then
you can see the average revenue for
Sunday you can do the same thing for
Monday for Tuesday and so on so as you
can see the chart types in power
I are kind of interactive and that's
also important to know right because
this makes your report a lot more
dynamic actually however if we click
onto that column again but here then we
have all the data selector again but I'm
still not happy to be honest because I
would like to be able to specify a date
range well and to do this we have
another great feature in power bi
desktop so let's unselect our visual
again and now select a slicer right here
let's drag it right there and make it
bigger like that and like this because
now comes something really awesome at
least that's my opinion because if you
now select a slicer and now drag the
date right here into that field well
then this doesn't look good first let me
select this one make it smaller like
that for that now I think you can see it
better because now you can see that you
have our total date range right here and
you can change it right here and right
there by changing the date that should
be displayed that's awesome but what's
even more awesome is that if you click
right here then you can simply drag
dynamically the date range that should
be displayed as you can see now we right
here until April 16th right here to
change that it changes dynamically and
by that changes our line chart our
measure with two revenue per passenger
and of course also our column chart
right here because only the information
that is within that range is calculated
and by that displayed in our visuals and
with that we are not done with the
second part of our project of course you
have a lot more options in the report
view in the data view and in the
relationship view but this project
should just give you a general idea of
how powerful power bi desktop actually
is but we finished the part in power bi
desktop or the work in power bi desktop
now and this means we now want to share
the results of our work with other
people and for this purpose we finally
have
to use power bi service let's see how
this works in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
