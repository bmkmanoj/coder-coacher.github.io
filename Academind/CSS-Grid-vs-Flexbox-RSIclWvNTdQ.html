flexbox
which one should you use now in case you
need to learn CSS Craig first I got a
full course on CSS which converts way
more than just a grid but all the grid
quite extensively I'll link to it with a
huge discount can be found in the video
description in this video I won't dive
into what the grid is but I'll answer
this simple question which one should
you use with the two grid or flex box
can you use them together and if yes how
let's have a look
so CSS grid where is this flexbox in
this video I'll also show you both in a
practical example without diving too
deep into it though but let's first get
the theory out of the way the CSS grid
is a feature a relatively new feature of
the CSS specification that allows you to
basically position elements in you
guessed it a grid so to layout items as
a grid on your page flex box on the
other hand is for laying out a single
row or column of elements so CSS grid is
about cute dinah mention all positioning
we got rows and we got columns
whereas flexbox is about one dimensional
positioning we got either a row or a
column now you can actually set up flex
box to wrap its item into a new line so
if you got let's say I'm set up in a row
and they exceed the space of their
container you can configure flex box
such that it automatically wraps the
items and starts a new line but it's
still one-dimensional it doesn't think
of rows and columns it's still a row of
items and it just happens to run out of
space and hence starts a new line this
is really important to understand with
the grid you really define a layout
which contains of rows and items and
which therefore looks the way you want
it to look now let's have a look at this
in a real example and there we'll also
see how we can actually use both
together because they actually do work
together very well as you will see now
here's a well visually okay web page
which does not have any functions other
than that it's awesome to show you how
grid and flex box work together and what
their differences are we got a header
the purple thing we got a sidebar the
orange box we got the main content the
white one and the footer the black thing
at the bottom here now clearly as you
can tell it's not really a sidebar
hands-on it's all stacked on top of each
other now this is exactly where the grid
can help us if we want to position the
things such as I just described them
which means the sidebar should sit next
to the main content for example
the grit can help us with that so if we
go to our code and quickly jump into the
HTML code we can see we've got header we
got our aside element for the side menu
we got the main element at the footer
and all its nested in the body now we
can turn the body into a grid by setting
its display property to grid and again
if you need to learn more about the grid
check out some dedicated tutorials or
for example my entire CSS course to
which you can also find a link in the
video description so we got this set to
a grid now and if we now reload the page
nothing changes which actually is a
default by default the great CSS grid
starts creating rows automatically and
adds the content in these rows which is
why the layout didn't change however we
can now change this by now adding grid
template columns here we need two
columns in our case one for the sidebar
and one for the main area so let's say
the sidebar should occupy 30% and the
main area 70 percent or just Auto to
automatically fill the remaining space
then we would add two columns like this
one column with 31 column with the rest
now we also want to have some rows and
we could also rely on the automatically
create rows capabilities of the CSS grid
but here we can also define them
explicitly with grid template rows and
we can say the first row is our header
so maybe we want to give this a height
of 60 pixels so for the header for rows
this is a height for columns the value
we enter here refers to the width so
here we got 60% 60 pixels height for the
first row which will actually be our
header later then we can also set up a
height for our main area and a sidebar I
actually want to calculate this
automatically though so I will set it to
auto because I want to give the footer a
height of also let's say 60 pixels with
this if we save that and we now reload
it's totally broken because right now
what happens is that it basically fills
our four elements header main sidebar
and our footer into the cells we created
and we created four cells because we got
two columns we created six cells we got
two columns and 3 rows and it starts
well occupying populating these cells
now we can override this with a third
property we add to the body great
template areas which has a rather
strange looking syntax but where we
simply give each cell a name and
therefore we can create so-called areas
for example I know that the first two
cells which are the two cells in the
topmost row should be populated by the
header so I'll name them HD or header
whatever you like HD like this so
separated with a white space in a string
this refers to the first row the first
value then refers to the first column in
that row so to the first cell and the
second value refers to the second column
in that first row now we got more rows
we got free so I'll simply add another
string you don't have to put it into a
new line but it's easier to read and
here the first column should actually be
populated by the sidebar side menu so
I'll name this sidebar the second colors
or the right one should be populated by
the main area so I'll name this main the
names are totally up to you though and
then the last row there I want to have
my footer in both well cells and you
don't need to name these areas as the
HTML elements for example for the header
I used a different name now we gave our
areas names we can now assign them for
dead we go to the header for example and
there we can add the grid area property
and now enter a name which we defined in
grid template areas for example or in
this case not example HD without
quotation marks though so grid area HD
will now ensure that the header goes
into both these cells so that it spans
both cells for deicide I'll add grid
area and set it to sidebar
furring - this cell here for the main
area which I haven't added yet so let's
add it I'll set this to main and for the
footer all the with grid area I'll set
this to fuller now if we save this and
we reload we're using the CSS script so
that we all of a sudden have to layout
we want and this shows us the power of
the grid since we think in columns and
rows we can perfectly transfer our idea
of the web page into a layout it would
be much harder to achieve this with
other means though it's of course
possible we've built pages like this for
ages and the grid is relatively new but
this is truly powerful as you can tell
now what we can see however is that our
items in the header and in the footer
are not positioned in a nice way this is
where we now can beautifully add flexbox
as I showed you on the slide flexbox is
about positioning elements in a one
dimensional area so in a row or in a
column we're not thinking about rows and
columns and this is exactly what we have
here in the header i want to position
the next huge hour so in a row three
items in a row there's no column well
there are three columns i guess but we
don't need to define them i'm just
adjust what you tell CSS please put
these three items into a row and
automatically position them next to each
other as I instruct you and the same for
the footer
I want to position these two next to
each other let's say of course you could
change this but here I want to put them
next to each other we can actually use
the grid for this too but it's a bit
overkill but we can beautifully and
perfectly use flexbox so let's go to the
header to be precise if we inspect the
header we want to add flexbox to the
navigation list which holds our separate
navigation items so we go to the
navigation list class here and we add
display flex by default this positions
them in a row we can set this with Flex
Direction row
more about flex boxes all the taught and
of course I mentioned as well as in a
YouTube video by Manuel my colleague on
this channel now we got flex box setup
and now if we save this and reload
we can already see that they're sitting
next to each other now both in the
header and the footer because the
navigation list class is actually used
in both places in our HTML code
obviously it's not positioned in the
middle anymore but due to flex box we
can really just say justify content and
put this to center now this will ensure
that on our main axis which for a flex
direction of Rho goes from left to right
they are positioned in the center and
you also Center them vertically we can
also say or add a line items Center here
this positions them on the cross axis
which is just the opposite of the main
axis so in this case vertically so now
this will Center in vertically for this
to work however I need to add a height
of 100% to navigation list so that it
takes the full available space to header
it gives it with that if we now reload
you see it's centered now they're
sitting very close to each other we
could change this with a simple margin
on the navigation items though or
alternatively we get that Flex container
with center the container and use a
value like space between for example
here for justified content so this will
be an alternative we could give this a
width of some pixels margin Auto and
change just a change justified content
but easier than that is just using
navigation item and giving it a margin
of zero top and bottom but 10 pixels
left and right let's say if we do that
and we reload now we got some spacing in
between and here we are using flexbox
because it's easier it has better
browser support and it's absolutely what
flexbox is built for so a common
misconception is that you use either of
the two grid or flex box the reality is
you should use both combined with each
other true you can find ways to achieve
something you do with the grid with Flex
box and the other way around
but if you use the strengths of both
concepts you get a way better result as
you can tell so I hope this video could
help you with diving integrative you
didn't do that already and understanding
when you should use which hopefully see
you in our videos too but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
