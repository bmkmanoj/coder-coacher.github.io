want to take a tour behind the scenes of
academy.com
with you we'll have a look at the core
technologies used by US which is vue.js
with Knox Jas and story bloc as a
content management system that's really
interesting we'll take a look at this
and I want to explain how we built this
website and why it works the way it does
work so let's start
so here's a ketamine calm the starting
page of it and if you haven't visited it
yet definitely do so you can never get
around read our articles watch our
videos this is how it works now let's
take a look behind the scenes this is
the project the source code of
academy.com
it's a next jazz project and therefore a
view J's project and of course the heart
of it basically is the pages folder here
all the pages of our application of our
webpage are set up we got that learned
page which is our most important one you
reach it by clicking on learn or the
content is actually also shown on the
starting page and then there we got all
our topics and for each topic we got our
content pieces like articles with a
video or just an article or just a video
and this is the structure you see here
the learn page with a nested topic page
which in turn has the content page the
topic page for example is the page
showing all these content cards so this
page here that would be the topic page
this index dot view file now here I am
as I said using next Jas and view J is
their fourth and as you can see in the
code already I'm of course using loads
and loads of custom components which are
stored in the components folder as in
any Knox project now here we get tons of
components for all the different things
which are rendered and displayed on the
screen and unfortunately I can't really
make that source code available but here
I just built tons and tons of components
each component is a single file view
component single dot view file so to say
has its own template which may consist
of our components or basic HTML building
blocks has some script logic here and
then the styling which is attached to a
given component this is the core
structure nothing spectacular really
just how an AK stand view application
works but might still be interesting to
see this behind the scenes
now besides all these pages and I will
come back to how we fetch the data in a
second besides all these pages if we
have a look at the next config you see I
use a couple of modules X yes to make
HTTP requests but then also PWA
to conveniently turn this into a
progressive web app we of course also
track you with Google Analytics because
we want to know how you work on that
page how you behave on that page what
you like and what you don't like so this
is the code and obviously we could now
dive super deep into that and analyze
all the code I wrote here but ultimately
these are just view components the
interesting part in my opinion is the
data how do we store and manage our data
did we write the back and for this on
our own how is it loaded into this page
and how do we ensure that its search
engine optimized so first of all we
didn't create our own back-end we're
using storey block instead storey block
is an API based headless content
management system which means it's a
content management system that gives you
an admin interface a nice UI where you
can create your content write your
articles link your videos and so on and
which should then fetch where you then
fetch the content why are a P I request
unlike WordPress where the views the
front end is really baked into the
system story block is a headless system
it focuses on the data on your content
and it follows a component driven
approach so that you can really clearly
define how content looks for you
how does an article look like does it
have a title creator a preview text you
can set all of this up and we will take
a look at our story block project in a
second and you can then fetch it in your
next front-end by sending a HTTP request
to your to a certain API endpoint given
to you by story block to get your data
in the form of an array full of Jason
full of JavaScript objects in the end
and then here on the front that I just
transformed it a little bit and
ultimately store in this case here to
load a topic because remember this is
this topic page here and the content for
this topic it's stored here in content
elements so this is densha's data coming
from the back and from story block a
little bit transform and then I use it
here to simply loop through for example
all my content elements create this
custom component for each of them and
passed information which I extract from
that story block data to that component
this is how the data is rendered to the
screen with my own front-end totally
built by myself not coming not made
available by story block but populated
with data stored on story block now why
did we choose story block and not create
this on our own because here we don't
have to manage anything the data base is
managed for us security is managed for
us the caching is done for us and it's
really really fast so they're doing a
great job when it comes to caching data
all of this managed for us and all we
have is just a nice UI where we can edit
our content in a really convenient way
now before I dive into this just a brief
word about search engine optimization
since this is a nextstep we can pre
render it and we are actually pre
rendering it in a static way which means
that we render all the routes to HTML
files at the end of our development
process so we regularly publish new
versions of our page where all pages are
pre rendered as HTML pages and once you
visit them you're back in a single page
application but we're not running this
on a server we're also not running it as
just a single page application but all
the pages are pre-rendered the config
for this is written in the next conflict
ojs file here there in the end we have a
function where we make an API request to
the story blog API and then transform
the data to extract all the different
pieces for the different pages we got to
then really render all the pages
dynamically even the pages which we
haven't hard-coded in here but which are
only defined by the content on the
backend that's why we fetch the content
so that we know which pages need to be
rendered and then all of that is done
here so that we always ship a
pre-rendered version so that the Google
crawler sees what you see and that you
also quickly get a page and don't have
to wait for it to fetch and load in your
browser so this is how we do search
engine optimization but back to story
block how does this work
if you log in and you can create an
account for free
if you check the pricing there is a
starter package available for free get
everything you need to get started if
you start you will see this screen story
block things in spaces and you could
translate space with project or
collection of content like here are a
ketamine space there we have the general
dashboard with the tokens that are
required to make these HTTP requests the
different subscription packages and then
the heart the content now in our case we
got the learn section and then we got
the different topics here as content
pieces if you want to put it like this
and each content piece here has the
different content elements like articles
and videos and so on as sub folders you
could say but the topic itself is just
some content to find by us if I click on
compose here you can see and you may
ignore this error by the way we'll fix
it in a second if you click on compose
you see this is how we configure a topic
with a title and image image I can
explanation video which is laying a
short explanation text and this is not
defined by story block they're not
forcing us to define our content in this
way this would be really inflexible
instead we're using the second big
feature of story block components you
define your own components so the
structure of your data if you want to
call it like that for your content like
for example here the top
that is what we just had a look at topic
is a component where we simply defined
that we will have these properties if
you think in JavaScript objects these
would be your object properties and you
can easily add a new one like this enter
a name and then pick the type of value
you plan on storing and depending on
which type you pick hear the story blog
you I will help you like for example if
you choose image here you will get an
upload button and the image will
automatically be stored in an assets
folder for you on storey blocks servers
so you don't have to manage that if you
pick number you can only enter numbers
if you pick markdown you get a text
editor with some formatting controls so
this is how this works and how you can
work with components now besides these
root components like topic or content
would be another one we also got nested
components like content text this is
simply something like a nested object in
a javascript object now content text
only has text so maybe not the best
example but content image is of
component where we manage our images in
our articles we have the image property
which is of type image which gives us
this nice upload button we define our
alt text and then the dimensions and all
of that can be fetched from the front
end and can be used to render it
correctly there and we do use it like
that we do use that alt text as the alt
text we render to the screen and we do
use the link that is ultimately stored
here for the uploaded image on the front
end to let's have a look at this let's
also fix that error that we had this
error message in the middle here let's
have a look at the web dev trends 2018
article there we still get that error
and that really is just stemming from a
feature story block offers us we can
connect our page to that story block UI
so that we get a live preview of what
we're working on and for that I'll start
my app here in development mode so
locally on my machine I'm not connecting
it to the live version because I won't
see changes there because we have to
publish them before they appear there
but for the development version we see
the changes right away and if I now
reload that
Paige you see a preview here and even
better than that set up correctly you
can click into a field and start editing
it and this actually is also possible
for images and here we see that content
image component I showed you a second
ago here you see some of the fields are
filled out and for example because I
chose the type image for that image
property
we got an upload button or we can choose
one from the collection of images we
have on that account so this is how this
works and how we can conveniently work
with the content and again this is in
development mode my project is
configured to automatically show in
development mode content in the
development mode of our project but once
I hit publish it would also be visible
on the live version of the website so
academy.com and all of the configuration
stuff and how you connect your project
to story block can be found in the story
block docks and you can of course find a
link in the video description this is
why we work with story block it's really
easy we can just focus on the content we
can get a live preview we can edit our
content we can publish it and that's the
coolest feature for us maybe
besides the speed which is awesome we
work with components and we work with
components in the front and - and you
don't just work with components if
you're working with next or view or
angular or react you can basically think
of any web page consisting of components
it doesn't matter if you use a framework
that calls it a component if you got
reusable building blocks which you use
in your webpage beat it a single page
app or a server rendered one or beat it
a mobile app you probably have reusable
pieces of content and story block things
just like your front-end which is why it
is a really good fit for us and which is
why we use it and I hope with that
you've got a an overview of how we built
academy.com it's a next view application
with a powerful back-end that is exactly
tailored to our needs but not because we
pay so much money to story block
because it's how story block works so if
you were building a comparable project
you might want to give it a try of
course you might also build your own
back end or find a different solution
that works better for you but this
component based approach is really
powerful and I hope this was a nice
brief glimpse behind the scenes of
academy.com
if you found this interesting definitely
let me know and we can for example build
somehow comparable project in the future
using story block and some front end
like viewer next so hopefully see you
there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
