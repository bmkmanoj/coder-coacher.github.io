a typical webpage with a client so the
browser and our server we send a request
because we enter some URL and we get
back a couple of files HTML files maybe
four different pages CSS files for
styling because HTML gives us the
structure CSS gives us the style and
JavaScript which is capable of running
in the browser to change content for
example after the page has been loaded
so JavaScript allows us to add a lot of
logic to our app because we can do stuff
in response to user events or whatever
one at you for example we could
dynamically add and remove elements to
the page without the user needing to
load a new page JavaScript also runs on
the server by the way for server-side
logic with node.js there we can also
interact with databases and so on
something we can't do from the browser
because we need the connection on the
server for that so let's do that
differentiation between the browser and
the server where we use nodejs that's
the name of JavaScript on the server
essentially on the browser we use it to
change content after the page load
that's the cool thing we have full
control over the page we can do with it
what we want we have full control over
the user input we can react to events
and use that input data and so on on the
server we handle requests and responses
we connect to a database we can do file
operations user authentication we can
render new pages so send new HTML pages
back to the client as a response and it
competes with PHP and Ruby there on the
client so in the browser it's exclusive
there is no alternative Java Script is
the only language to run stare overall
one cool thing about Java Script is its
high flexibility it's really a language
that's easy to learn and that's easy to
use as you will see on a catamite
