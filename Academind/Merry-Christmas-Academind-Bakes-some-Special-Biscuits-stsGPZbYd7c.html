channel this time a little bit of a
different tutorial because it's
Christmas so what are we going to do in
this video well II thought that
Christmas is about snow and maybe a
Christmas fear but also about food and
actually specialties
yeah like mac biscuits right and then we
have a lot of framework so JavaScript
frameworks topics on a channel right how
can we merge this yeah that was the idea
and so we thought let's bake some
biscuits but framework biscuits yeah so
let's see what's coming out of there
is calm letter
the receiver
so let's grab some ingredients and let's
get started right yeah what do we have I
mean flour you're a little bit yeah yeah
I also got a little bit of sugar right
in our private English German lesson Mia
and so cup TransAm foot I will meet that
to create angular and react and we need
green for you and we need yellow
JavaScript and since we're talking about
some biscuits we always need eggs and
other like that whatever yeah so let's
get started let's have a look at the
recipe
is Tom letter
the receiver
so if you just saw the first egg kind of
disappeared so I don't know what you
mean yeah that's and you want me cut it
out no we didn't we need a bowl now
which makes the stuff
yeah this is our caramel kitchen that
actually it's my kitchen shop so I
should know they're here
so we start by adding 258 Ram of flour
yeah well double well prepared we have 0
maybe you should put it a little more
I'm trying
yeah yeah with 100 that's really good to
read now yes roundabout it's right in
the middle between the two lines a
little bit more yeah it's not it's
rising anymore that's right say it's
fine so we got the flour that's really
good
what else do we need because actually
you know recipe and I just we need 100
grams sugar sugar that's yeah yeah but
the sugar I'm just put it in like that
it's really healthy as we can tell the
know like that 350 right yeah then we
need the yellow water okay yes the
yellow part of that because I yeah let's
think about that in the egg yolk yeah so
yellow yellow
yeah so it's only correct so we knew it
that we just wanted to make sure that
there is no other word for that okay so
now we did you separate it how do we get
that oh yeah we will find that yes well
prepared Oh
maybe we should just do the mic
tutorials yeah yeah do you know this
charity works actually every 7th in the
world
yeah but maybe let's let's fetch another
apps over for London and then see what
happens so we switch the egg
responsibility yeah now I find now we
have the fourth egg as I just said so
let's find it and I never did that but I
think from my childhood I remember that
this rug like that I mean you have to
open it yeah thank you space India can
you only put the egg white but then you
have to kind of switch it right like
that yeah
now cuz i wanna see now we have to
switch it back yeah I'm the egg faster
which is not the best thing to be the
yeah so we got the egg yeah it's very
nice out of the yellow a little bit of
you white is okay I don't think that's
okay and now the second act as you can
see it's a professional technique that
you need to knit like that and now we
have to shake it up shake it switch oh
there yeah see how this works well
you're doing great it's really - now
it's cool okay let me just quickly wash
my hand because it was kind of obvi okay
yeah you did so back in our cooking
studio now we've with the butter we need
half the butter block here and it should
be yeah we put it into small pieces and
throw it in the bowl and only it's
called we need to lock it yeah okay yeah
and I'm I'm sorry if some yeah egg white
egg right here yeah sorry looks like
over I thought they have these measure
things yeah but we know it's a cube you
can see this
to go yeah that's the great thing is you
buy this curry butter here and how it
could be then right here for the morning
and then now we need to put the two
smaller pieces should I maybe make ya
can walked it in there so like like that
and it's really awesome yeah I regularly
do that you know with a father
so next up we need to blend it so we
need to blender but you can keep the
tear actually that's okay now the only
target yeah but let me think because we
need to make sure that you guys we
didn't learn that too well we'll be back
in a few seconds with some electricity
in this blender so thankfully we found
well this little thing here so we can
now use our blender like this and like
that we can attack should remain perfect
in first
I don't know otherwise you might get an
electric shock I'm not sure no no that's
the wrong one it's the wrong
what there's always a bigger one and a
smaller one okay you seem to use it I do
think a lot as you could see when I
separated the egg yeah yeah definitely
wait a second please don't blend my head
okay wait
so how long has this take know until it
looks cheap
thank you for that really helpful useful
minutes you want to blend a little bit
too now I do it for the minute I think
this is really interesting I think also
for you because the things you can hear
us really good now so maybe let's pair
forward as forward now and then see what
happens here
we try something just a second yeah we
tried it was a good idea good idea but
maybe we switch back to the other ones
there is a reason my recipe is telling
you to do something in a circle yeah it
didn't need to because normally when I
make my things I there's normally when
you do yours cream right yeah I think I
switch to manual thank you
yeah again really exciting to watch for
me and for all the others everyone to
know it looks awesome by the way how do
you like these cups we recently bought
do we like them - Tamar than you
they are new yes actually they are new
and the good thing is that we had our
own Academy and logo on them so tell us
maybe if you like these kind of things
because we actually like them no they
produced that they do they do so next
it's not that I it's fine it's Christmas
so we're not that busy but how long do
you think this is gonna take like three
hours or so I'm going to continue yeah
amazing this yeah our English is I think
we are okay with our image when it comes
to coding we are not used to that baking
vocabulary
day-to-day in Cabul air is always
difficult
yeah yeah I have to continue that doing
until it has a clean and flat structure
in the future we are still here by the
way so yeah Max is still making our it's
all the time lapse anyway so after some
technical issues with the camera battery
and some issues with the name of this
don't go because you're gonna show how
it's called
we are know is done and now we need to
cut out four slices for the four
different colors meaning I make it spin
that away we wanted to take a break for
now but yeah right here some bother run
another ping
yeah okay I'm not sure if this will
distort yeah let's risk it borders so
yeah yeah so here are you chance and
JavaScript
it feels really interesting I thought
about an interesting part will be if
this works out with the color did the
best press also how much of the color
map I showed and there is some egg on it
by the way so it's kind of disgusting
yeah let's maybe not put everything
there because we might need a second
attempt myself mmm so uh smooth I'm like
ugh
but this your dough and me feel the
world we're not going to sell them to
you so you don't have you don't know if
you see yeah this is handmade it's
delicious
it looks delicious yeah the question is
do we need to I think we can just no I
really want to make it like that this is
between angular and react so we can't
make soap a that might be but I think
JavaScript into you are quite okay with
each other so that's okay it's next to
the head like hell we do angular yeah
I'll start with JavaScript oh I think
the yellow really well with the book I
guess I'm only going to do one react
logo so I think the first B is done I
mean it's yes I'm aware of that fact but
as you might have seen we have some
issue but I could use part of your react
dough it's yet but let me finish it
first I don't know if I ok ok ok so now
we got that and now I'll try to build it
let me maybe want to put the reactor did
you order
you know I think it's more you in the
end
thank you will bake for an hour until
it's done and it doesn't yeah if you
know what it should be
be honest I don't think it looks that
bad I mean it's it's if you look at that
make a big a maybe let's put the dog in
the middle here the reactor but love
that next to your honor chef Tom it um I
think shy s will be a little bit bigger
than the others
accidentially but we have to deal with
that I know it looks right yeah so I can
use this yeah you can also use that
actually makes you out of that it will
be a huge view so let me get gooey got
another me logos or I can put that maybe
yeah maybe you should yeah then I should
not use all the color eyes because if
you know who goes yeah and to make sure
that once this goes becomes figurative
well it the end like a blue broken you
can use the enter a culinology yes or
did we put someone is after baking but
Incas yeah we can
so here's the result what what do you
say okay bitch cool I mean we would
round not yellow and I mean I don't know
if everything is done already because we
had to take it out because JavaScript
will almost died so you know let's test
it yeah let's try them
Oh this foot let's try the same maybe
some react I'm not sure if it's done but
yeah no bad try the name it's like do I
have an idea what child it will taste
like but yeah baby yeah yeah right right
but then angular will get the cleaner
one where do you mixed one I'll take
that one and I'll take enjoy really yeah
HD hmm it's really good actually to be
honest that's good I'm compared to
recipe me we do description yeah and I
hope you enjoyed it and I hope you hope
you enjoyed the year actually because it
was a a Europe coming up changes
actually we have a new name we are we
and not max only anymore and enough to
work and not what you want to do what
you build I'm intent relax yeah relax we
wish you a Merry Christmas and really a
Happy New Year that your plans all
become true next year and did you just
