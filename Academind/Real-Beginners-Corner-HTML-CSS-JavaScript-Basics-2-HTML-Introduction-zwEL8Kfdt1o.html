we're still on our Microsoft page here
but that will change soon in this video
we're going to write our first HTML
document so to say our first web page
and I will guide you through the general
structure of an HTML document and we
will get to now our very first tags
which we can use as I said there is a
pool of tags which can be interpreted by
browsers and which is therefore
available for developers to use so let's
get into it
so we're going to start by creating a
new file and which we call index dot
HTML or index dot HTM doesn't matter and
you can create this file with whatever
text editor you like obviously I would
recommend that you use some kind of IDE
or an enhanced text editor like sublime
or atom or and web IDE like for example
cloud 9 or a web editor so to say like
blank ER or code pen you might just do
all these things because the default mac
and windows text editors are absolutely
enough to write HTML but it is very
stressful painful as they don't provide
syntax highlighting they don't auto
indent anything you have to really write
out and structure everything yourself
and this can be quite a pain so I'm
going to use phpstorm which is my IDE
I'm using for all my web projects but as
I said you're free to use whatever you
like so I will create this new file here
and as I said I'm just calling it index
dot HTML and this is yet this is
basically it now if we load this file
we don't see anything because we haven't
got anything in here and what we can't
do is just write some text hello world
save it and reload this page and now we
can see it hello world now that isn't
the most awesome web pages actually you
might correctly recognize that we didn't
write any HTML at all that's just plain
text right and that is basically enough
as to browser is able to render just
plain text doesn't need the our tags but
for a real web page you definitely need
more information you want to have some
layout you want to have some styling and
you want to give a browser more than
just plain text because of my plain text
it can't do anything more than just
write it out so your typical HTML
document consists of three things the
first one is that you declare the
document type so you tell the browser
this is an HTML document and
specifically you're telling them which
version of HTML you are using are you
using version 4 or 5 or anything like
this then you have your document hat
which is a part of the document which
will not be rendered to the screen but
which contains matter information
information for your browser so this
might contain information like the title
of the current webpage which will be
displayed here and your tabs for example
it might contain some information for
search engines like the description of
your webpage or for your device how to
render it the width to tell it the width
it should be using and so on it will
also contain scripts or styling sheets
you need to import into your document as
I told you in the first video so there's
our hat section
oops our head section and then we get
our body this is
content will live where we will create
all our layout and where we will not
only have our layout structure but also
to read the content so the document type
for an HTML document for for an html5
document as I should say is very easy
it's always just smaller than and this
basically is how you start every HTML
tag every HTML tag is contained between
smaller than and greater than signs so
that is a typical HTML tag so this one
the document type for an html5 document
is exclamation mark doctype HTML this
tells the browser it's an html5 document
that's just the way it has been defined
then we will have our head section and
this will live between opening and a
closing HTML tag most but not all HTML
tags do have an opening and enclosing
one for example the head section would
be a hat close it and now my IDE also
already entered the closing tag but if
this that hasn't been done for you you
would just write smaller them slash and
then type it out hat greater than now
that is your head section living between
this opening and closing tags the body
section similarly lives between body
tags so you do the same as what they had
section just right body and does your
body section so here the content will
live and here your meta information will
live for example the title which would
appear here would be entered by writing
title close it so you have your title
tags opening and closing tag again my
first HTML page save it and now if we
reload this page you can see we got our
content here and we got my first HTML
page as the title here now that's all
we're going to write in the head section
as of now in the content section let's
just start by creating a basic headline
and then a paragraph below it so the
headline would for example be an h1 tag
which is a predefined HTML tag which
says having 1 which is the biggest
heading we got available heading 1 to
heading 6 and all between obviously so
these are the defined headings we got
available to choose from having and
below we want to have a paragraph and
this paragraph is the P tag P also
opening and closing as I said this is
really the case for most HTML tags there
are a few exceptions and I will tell you
when we come to them
but most do have fun opening an a
closing tag some random text now we save
this reload our page and we got our
heading and some random text as you can
see the heading is already bold and much
bigger than the random text and this is
what I meant in the first video we have
some basic generic styling for a some of
our tags but only with CSS will we be
able to change these styles so we don't
have to use this size and this font type
we can't change that with CSS but for
now we're gonna live with plain HTML
which gives us gives us this and be
aware that the exact look really depends
on your operating system and browser
because these the browser and the
operating system these two components
define the basic styling
of your HTML technics now you might
wonder how do I know which HTML text I
can use and what they do now I could
send you two for example this page here
w3 schools outcomes flash tags which has
a reference of all available html5 tags
and it might be worth looking through
them but you might get intimidated by
this list because it contains a lot of
tags and to be honest there are some
text or you rarely use some of them are
not for use anymore some of them are
cheap things which are better than with
CSS for example there is a small tag
which makes text smaller but it's better
practice to do this through CSS styling
and that not through small tags and
there are on average the text which
won't alter the view of your page but
instead they provide you with the means
to create a more semantically correct
web page which is important when it
comes to things like screen readers for
disabled people and these screen readers
need to be able to interpret the text in
a way that they know what these tags are
doing or which section is these tags are
defining so there are as I said tags
like that which don't look different but
have a different meaning and therefore
it's better practice to use them
although you could achieve the same look
with death different tags and that is
the case quite often that you have
several several ways of achieving a
certain look in your document and then
you should obviously always pick the
semantically most correct but if it is
only that you want to look it great and
don't care about things like
accessibility of your web page and so on
you really got a broad bandwidth of
options on the other hand there are some
tags which are absolutely necessary if
you want to achieve a certain a certain
thing likes for example if you want to
insert a link there is only one link tag
and you have to use that and in the next
video I will guide you through the most
important basic text you will need to be
able to create a web page which is fully
comparable to two one like this not by
the look obviously as we're just taught
talking about HTML but from the HTML tag
side the pool you got available to use
so see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
