user to login when actually checking out
so right now we're I'm not logged in
if I click check out I want to be
redirected to the sign-in page instead
of the check out page but I also want to
remember that the user wants to go to
the checkout page to redirect him to the
checkout page after successfully logging
in to provide a better user experience
if the user wanted to log in Fruity drop
down here though I don't want to
redirect to the checkout page afterwards
because the user never wanted to go
there right I only want to do it if we
were on our way to the checkout like so
so that requires a couple of things
which need to be changed and let's start
right now the first thing is that I want
to protect my get check out and my post
check I draw checkout routes if we have
a look at the user chairs file so at the
user routes we get this is locked in
function here which we can use as kind
of a middleware attached to our routes
to check if the user is logged in and to
prevent access if the user is not so I'm
copying this function to my well index
dot J's file and of course you could
also refactor this into a separate file
or something like that and then I'm
using this is locked in here on the post
route so that we're preventing any well
fishy things going on and most
importantly to the get route which would
be triggered if we click the checkout
button so here I then want to redirect
to let's say user
sign in in this case here and if I then
reload this page well nothing happens if
I restart the server and then reload
this page you see we're redirected to
use recite in so now if I click this
checkout button I'm going to sign it
we're almost there but remember I also
want you keep the original route in mind
so back to my is locked in function here
I want to add something for the case
that we are not logged in so that we are
redirected to the users sign in page in
this case I want to store something in
my session I want to add let's say a new
field named old URL which I want to set
equal to the URL the user try to access
like this I can access the URL on my
request object with the URL field or the
URL property here but that I'm storing
the old URL and I will use this later on
when we actually do sign-in so that's
the next step in the sign-in route here
in the user J's file here when I sign in
in this post sign in the route I will
change the code a little bit currently I
do have my redirects here success
redirect and failure redirect well
failure redirect and failure flash are
fine as they are but I will delete a
success redirect and instead add a firt
parameter to this function to this post
function here this will be a normal
middleware function as you know it from
all a Burroughs which will be executed
whenever this middleware does passport
middleware here is passed successfully
so if we fail to authenticate we will
not reach this third function then
instead we will go well wherever this
failure redirect leads us however if we
are successful then we will continue to
disperse parameter here to this function
here and in this function I can then do
whatever I want to do in the case of a
successful login attempt well what do I
want
well I want to check if I stored an old
URL in my session so I will check if all
URL is present if this is the case then
I want to redirect to this old URL and I
can do this like this using the redirect
method and since I'm not returning here
I can also execute code after that and
here I simply want to set old URL in my
session to now to clear it because I
don't want to store the old URL here
because I don't want to redirect the
user to the checkout page forever I only
want to do that if you wanted to go
there in the first place but not if he
was just logging in through the
drop-down for example I'll also set up
an Al's case where we don't have a
you'll old URL set again that would be
the case if we're not coming from the
checkout process in this case I simply
want to redirect the user to the user
profile page I'm copying all that code
here this whole function indeed to the
post signup method where I want the
exact same behavior so if we are signed
up successfully I don't want to redirect
here in the passport milla where instead
I want to execute this third function
here or this for parameter where I do
the same thing as in the login case now
why do I add it here - well for the
simple reason that maybe our user hasn't
signed up yet so we're presenting these
sign-in view but we also want to
redirect him once he is signing up now
to make signing up a bit more convenient
since we only showed his sign-in page it
would be nice to have a link at the
bottom which says something like don't
have an account sign up instead to make
this process as smooth as possible so
I'll go to the user views to the sign-in
view and below my form I'll then add a
new text new paragraph where I say don't
have an
count loops like this and then just the
language says sign up instead now in
this link here of course I want to link
to slash user slash sign up like that
now here in my user routes there is one
problem though if we have a look at this
setup we're setting all your L to null
after redirecting and once this code
will get executed we will have a problem
because our request will not be as
accessible as it was before redirecting
so I need to execute this code before
well issue my redirect though here of
course I'm then setting this to now
before using it so that would give me an
error to or would not lead to the
desired result so actually I will first
simply extract my old URL store it in a
new variable and then use this variable
here like this now I can copy this code
also use it here in this sign-in route
and with that I'll make sure that I'm
always able to retrieve the old URL then
clear it and then redirect so with that
if I go back to the application let's
say I add another element here and then
I click on check out I'm going to be
signup page let's create a new user here
like this
I hope this email address isn't taken
yet click on sign up and we're going to
the checkout page which is what I want
however if I log out and then log in
again with that email address again
let's see then I'm going to the user
profile so I'm not going to check out
page 10 which is exactly the behavior I
want I only want to go there if I was on
the way to it anyways now that I'm
already signed in I can go it you check
out enter my data here and make my
purchase as you saw before
so let's finally do this to enter all
that Tammy data here enter some dummy
data down here web status an invalid CVC
code so with data should work make the
charge does clear to shopping cart and
if we again have a look at all our order
you see we got a new order added this is
certainly more as before and well with
that we're forcing the user to login
we're providing a clean process for all
of that and we're storing the order in
the database the missing piece of course
is that it would be nice to well show
the user his orders if he goes to his
profile page here so that's something
I'll work on next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
