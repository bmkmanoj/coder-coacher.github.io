about behavior subjects in rxjs I
already do have a video about normal
subjects and the starting code here
which you can find a link in the video
description I am using a normal subject
as you can see here now
in this setup we have a button click me
and when we click the button we actually
have this event listener which will emit
a new value through our subject to which
you subscribe here at the very bottom
therefore we print clicked since that is
what we do in our subscription nothing
spectacular we're using a subject there
is one limitation a normal subject cast
though it doesn't have an initial value
or a starting value if we reload this
project waiting control enter again we
don't see any value by default below the
button that is because there is empty
now obviously I could go into HTML and
simply oops ad not clicked here and we
would have not clicked which changes to
clicked when we do click now we have a
default value but it's hard-coded into
HTML and this might not be the behavior
you're looking for in your app an
alternative would be to go to the end of
our code here and simply use click omit
it and omit a new value where we say not
clicked
now since the subscription is already
setup in the free head control enter we
see not clicked because we already have
a subscription which will replace the
dev text content whenever we omit a new
value which we do here again this is
some extra code we have to write because
we have to manually omit a value to set
the default at the beginning and
technically it won't have this value
right from the start only once we reach
deadline so that might still not be
optimal the great thing is rxjs has a
special type of subject we can use the
behavior subject so if I turn my subject
into one a new behavior subject I now
can pass an argument to that subject
constructor that was not possible in a
normal subject here I can assign a
default value for the subject like no
clicked if I now hit control enter you
see not clicked appearing again even
though we're not emitting it and we did
not set it in the HTML code but instead
this argument will populate our subject
with a starting value which is
automatically emitted you could say so
that our subscription automatically
triggers right it start up of course if
I then click all the other code still
works as expected but behavior subject
takes care about the initialization so
when would you use it you typically use
it whenever you do use your subject like
a normal variable which should hold the
value but which you want to change
eventually and which should then inform
other parts of your application about
this change that is a perfect use case
for behavior subject I hope this video
was helpful see you on the other videos
hopefully body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
