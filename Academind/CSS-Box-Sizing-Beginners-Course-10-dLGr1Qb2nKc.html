of our beginner's guide the good news is
that we are coming closer to the end of
the CSS part of our beginner's guide but
there are still some more topics that we
should talk about and one of these
topics is box sizing a really important
concept in CSS because we have to
understand what it actually means if we
apply a width or a height to a specific
element for example and how this is
actually calculated let's have a look at
that in this video
so how can we understand box-sizing or
the basic concepts behind it well we'll
have a look at our website of course our
course project or video serious project
as I would call it and this works quite
well so far but maybe we can get some
knowledge in this video which we can add
to this side to make it work even better
and we'll also have a look at this site
right here this is basically another
example project which should just help
us to get an idea of what happens if we
change a specific property or a specific
value as always you can find a link to
the code in the video description now
how do we start though how can we get an
idea about box-sizing well as you can
imagine I think it makes sense to have a
look at some theory first because what
is box-sizing actually well let's think
about the following situation we have an
element for example and we know the box
model in CSS we talked about that front
is serious so make sure to have a look
at this video if you don't know how the
box model works and the box model has a
content and for this content we can
define right here the box height and
this content also has a width and
therefore we can define the box with now
the interesting thing is that whenever
we specify a width for example let's say
one of the pixels these 100 pixels refer
to the content and what's the reason for
that well the reason for that is that
the standard declaration that works for
the box sizing is this one it's box
sizing that's the property content box
and that's the value that is applied and
this simply tells us that whenever we
apply as I just said a width for example
of 100 pixels that the content of our
box should be 100 pixels wide so that's
the first thing you have to understand
normally if you don't change a thing
width or height always refer to the
content of our box model but we have
more actually right because we also have
a padding and a border we also have a
margin but that is not
but here the thing now is that you could
say hey i define a width for my element
for example let's again say 100 pixels
and I want to make sure that my element
so basically my content my padding and
my border in total is only 100 pixels
wide then now the problem is that with
the normal standard setting so
box-sizing content box this doesn't work
because we saw that the width and height
properties always refer to the content
only the good thing is that if you want
to change it so if you want to say that
this should be pure boxwood and that
this should be your box height well this
can be changed by simply adding this
declaration so you don't write
box-sizing content box or nothing at all
because as I said content box is the
standard but you simply add the border
box value to the box sizing property and
because of that you will have the
behavior we can see right here and with
that we have the theory of that first
concept that we have to understand so
let's go to our example website and see
how this actually works so that's the
example project we can see we have
different elements right here let's have
a look right there my beam I created
some nested elements so the nested
element right here is the cond and so
that's the element we have a in the
middle right there then we have another
nested element which I called nested
like a 50 class nested then we have the
element navigation then we have the body
which you can see right here and we have
of course HTML that's the basic concept
that we have as I said it's not really a
website right here it's just to make
sure that we understand what we just
talked about if we change to our code we
can see in the index.html file but
that's basically the structure we just
talked about we have body we have the
first Nestor element the second master
element and the third nested element and
we have a CSS file as in the other
videos I only applied some general
properties to make sure that our website
well looks like that the important thing
now is that if we go down
right here to content so to our content
class right here so basically this
element nested inside that we could not
play around with the width and with the
box sizing I mostly will refer to the
width in this video but of course you
can also change the height of an element
but which is easier to show and I think
it's the better example for you to
really see what happens therefore will
mostly stick to width
now as I talked about with let's add a
width maybe let's say this should be 200
pixels and let's save that and if we now
go back we see that in the beginning it
was just a normal block level element
and if we now reload the page we can see
that our box size decreased and now you
might say well of course it decreased
because we specified a width of 200
pixels but if we inspect that right here
then you can see something interesting
because we can read that the width of
our box actually is not 200 pixels it's
210 pixels you can see it right here and
the reason is that if we go back that we
have this width of 200 applied but only
to our content because as we just talked
about in the theory part the default box
sizing value applied is content box and
therefore if we go back to the code and
now select the element right here we can
see that right here down in the lower
right part of the screen you can see
that 200 is indeed applied but
additionally we have a border of 5
pixels and we talk about the width only
soit's 5 pixels to the left 5 pixels to
the right and therefore well we can see
that our box now has a width of 210
pixels now if you think back about the
slides again we saw that we can change
this behavior and make sure that our box
on by that our element only has the
width that we specify now to do that we
can go back right here and simply add
box-sizing like
and now you already see the options
right here in Visual Studio code we will
now use border box like that and if we
now go back to the page and reload it
then we cannot see that something
happened but if we inspect it we can now
see that the size or the width of our
entire element now is exactly 200 pixels
we can again check that right here
because now we see that CSS
automatically reduced the width of our
content to make sure that it can include
d5 pixels to the left anti 5 pixels to
the right that we saw or that we defined
for our border so that's the first
important concept you have to understand
when you talk about box-sizing how this
box sizing works and what's the
difference between content box and
border box however if we now go back to
our code and maybe leave the border box
for now that's ok and now say that our
width should not be 200 pixels but maybe
50% and safe that we applied that
percentage value already in our project
by the way well what's happening now
because if we go back to the page and
reload it now we can see that the box
size changed we now have 200 6.5 pixels
as a width for our element right here
and now you might ask yourself what do
these 50% of width refer to and for that
it's again time to go back to the slides
and have a look at the theory behind it
because the question is how is the box
size calculated and our situation is
kind of as the following we have a
definitive one right here and this stiff
one is nested inside of a narrative and
another div and if but that doesn't make
a difference right here to get the basic
problem or the basic concept that we
have to think about because now the
question is this one right here
what is our box height and we saw that
we can define that by pixels or by
percentages and we have the box width we
can of course also define that using
pixels or percentage values and one
important information
right here there are more values
available than pixels and percentages
but for this video and to get the basic
concept I think these two values are the
best ones we can use to make sure you
get an easy a nice overview of the way
the box size is calculated
therefore we talked about pixels already
so we don't have to focus onto this
right now but will solely focus onto the
percentage calculation as we just saw it
in our example now that's the issue
right how is this percentage now
calculated what's the reference point
for this 50% width that we just applied
unfortunately the answer is not a single
one as sometimes in CSS the answer is it
depends and what does it depend on well
I thought that free rules to remember
would be a good name for the following
slide because right here we'll have a
look at three different swell situations
and how the size of our box depends on
something we'll talk about that
something of course and if you keep that
in mind I think you really got the solid
knowledge you need to really work with
that however there are two disclaimers
that I would like to make right here
the first disclaimer is that as always
in life there are not only these free
rules there are some additional rules
that you might consider in specific
cases when you want to change the size
of your box so I will not talk about the
details regarding that right here
because as I said with the free rules we
talked about you really have two solid
basic knowledge that you need the second
disclaimer is that from now on I'll only
talk about the width when I talk about
changing the size of our box the most
concepts we talk about right here are
also true for the height but I simply
think that working with the width makes
it easier for us to understand the
concepts therefore I stick to it so now
that we talked about these disclaimers
let's have a look at the free rules to
remember because the starting point is
actually the following we have an
element and this element could be nested
inside of other elements now how can we
now specify what the 50% width that's
what we want to apply
right here depend on so what's the value
we have to use 50% from the answer is
well it depends and the first thing it
depends on is the position property
applied to this element now you might
say positioning we talked about that
right yes we did we talked about
positioning to well position the
elements on our page
but position also has an impact on the
size of our elements now let's have a
look at a first easy example to get an
idea of how this could work because we
could say that this element has the
following declaration applied position
fixed now if that's the case and we use
a word for 50% then the 50% is simply
calculated by using 50% of the viewport
so basically of what you can see on your
screen and that's another important
thing you have to understand you have
the element where you want to change the
width in our case and there the position
property is important but then you also
have the viewport in our case and this
is the so called containing block so the
containing block simply means that the
size of the element we want to change
the width for no example depends on this
containing block and the containing
block in our case or in the case of
position fixed being applied to the
element is the viewport now I know that
this can be quite confusing and we'll
have two more examples you see how this
works the worries but I think now is a
good point in time to jump back to our
example project and simply do that so
apply position fix to our element and
see how it's calculated so let's go back
send back right here and working here in
the content selector and now I simply
add position fix as we just talked about
so that's the element we're going to
change the width for to 50% now let's go
back to the code and reload the page and
now you can see that our element is kind
of in the middle of nowhere
that's simply due to the fact that we
applied position fixed so let's add
left:0 right here and go back if we now
reload the page yeah we can see it's at
least a little bit better positioned so
now we can see that this element has a
width of 310 pixels and our viewport so
what we can see right here has a width
of 620 pixels so our element has exactly
a width of 50% of the viewport now you
might say well that's not the viewport
that's just the HTML element and you're
totally right
but if you now keep in mind the 310
pixels and we now go back to our code
and increase the width of the HTML
element to maybe 2,000 pixels like that
and save that and go back and now reload
the page you can now see that our
element still has a width of 310 pixels
because well the viewport didn't change
but the HTML element
well this now has a width of 2020 pixels
including some heading right here that's
what we have 2020 the important thing is
that if I now increase the viewport
right here our element also increases
too well 50% of the width of the
viewport so that's the first important
rule you can remember if you apply
position:fixed your element then the
so-called containing block so simply the
well element your size depends on is the
viewport now if we go back right here
and maybe delete with 2000 pixels like
that because I don't think we need that
then you can say okay I understand that
but we have more values that we can
apply to the position property and
you're totally right so let's have a
look at another example in theory first
back on the slide and we again have our
element right here but now we don't have
position fixed but now we have position
absolute applied to this element now the
question again is if we want to say that
this element should have a width of 50
percent what is the containing block
what does this 50 percent width actually
depend on well and the containing block
in this case is an ancestor
and off this answer it will be the
content and additionally the padding so
this basically means that we want to
change the width of our element to 50%
and if we apply the position:absolute
declaration then this 50% is calculated
again based on the containing block
specifically of the content and the
padding of this ancestor and that's
important to keep in mind what's even
more important to keep in mind is that
we still don't know what the ancestor
actually is or which element is the
enter sir
well and the answer is actually quite
simple because the ancestor is sympathy
element which has one of these values
for T position properties applied so
basically the closest element which
doesn't have position static being
applied I put position sticky in two
brackets because we didn't covered it so
far throughout the series I just wanted
to make sure that you can also find
position sticky right here so that's the
thing we have to keep in mind and that
we have to try out right now we need to
apply position:absolute to our element
and then apply position absolute
relative or fixed to our containing
block or to the element that we want to
specify as the containing block let's
try that out so back in the code and the
first thing we do is we should change
position fixed to position absolute as
we just learned it and we can also get
rid of that left zero now doesn't play a
role and now let's add position oops
position maybe relative right here to
our nested selector by that to the
element with the nested class right here
if we now go back to the code and reload
the page well we can see that the width
again changed and let's now see what
exactly happened because we have a width
of 240 6.5 pixels and the element with
the nested class right here has a width
of 703 pixels which is basically not
twice the which we have right here for
360 4.5 now let's have a closer look at
that and let's go right here to the
nested class right there and scroll down
maybe increase there a little bit let's
see
because you can see how the width is
actually calculated we have six five
three as the content width and then we
have a padding of 20 to the left and 20
to the right so this means that the
total width of that element with the
nested class is 693 pixels and if you
nothing back about the width of our
content right here this is 300 46.5 well
and times 2 this is exactly 693 pixels
so exactly the content width plus the
padding of the element of the closest
ancestor which has in our case t
position:absolute declaration applied as
I said this also works with absolute
fixed or sticky being applied as a value
for the position property now let's have
another look and let's now add the
position:relative declaration right here
to our navigation element and let's see
what happens now if we save that and go
back and reload the page we can now see
that the size here changed
we now have 370 1.5 and if we now go to
our navigation element right here we can
see that we have 703 plus 20 plus 20 so
743 as a width and if we go back to our
content well you can see 370 1.5 to is
exactly these 743 that we have right
here so that's the second rule that you
can remember if you have
position:absolute applied to the element
you want to change the size for then the
containing block for this element is the
closest ancestor which has the position
property with a value
from static applied select what's the
second rule as I said now let's have a
look at the third rule again our
starting point is the element that we
want to change the size but now we have
either position static or position
relative applied and now again what's
the question what is the containing
block well and in this case it's again
an ancestor but this time it's only the
content of that ancestor and now you
might ask again okay and what is the
ancestor or what is the Criterium for
that ancestor to be the containing block
well the answer is it simply must be a
block level element so to summarize that
if you apply position static or position
relative to your element and by the way
position static is the standard or the
default value so if you don't apply the
position property then this is always
true well then the containing block is
simply the ancestor or the closest
ancestor which is a block level element
and of this ancestor the value that will
be used as a reference is the width of
the content so that was quite a lot but
I think with that we got the basic set
and you're not able to work with the box
sizing in a better way let's now head
back to our code and have a look at
these third rule in practice and then
there is one less thing that I would
like to show you in this video so back
in the code and now we said that we will
change our position from absolute to
either relative or static so let's say
static so I'm not adding anything right
here and we still have the width of 50%
applied so if we go back to our code now
and reload the page we can see that it
almost looks like in the beginning
actually of this video but now we should
understand why our content element right
here has the width that it has because
if we inspect that we can see that the
element has a width of
26.5 pixels and if we now go right here
to our nest that element I think it's
this one yes and now go down we can see
that this has a width of 653 pixels the
important thing is that it only refers
to the content as we saw it on a slide
and if we now remember back what we saw
for the content element right here with
320 6.5 pixels well this is exactly 50%
of the content width of the containing
block which in our case is the ancestor
which is the closest ancestor which is a
block level element now feel free to
play around with the things we just
talked about because it really makes
sense to practice that to get a better
feeling for the different
interdependencies reffered here but as I
said with the free rules to remember I
think you really got a solid basis but
as I said there is one less thing that I
would like to show you and for this last
thing we will switch to our web page
right here and now focus onto this part
so onto these two images and these two
images are here in the main part and in
the trip images class because what do I
want to show you let's go to the road
well if we go down right here to Maine
and to the images well then we have this
width property right here important we
are working here in a flexbox
environment but what I show you right
here can also be applied if you're not
working with Flex box because I want to
show you the min width and the max width
properties it's also available for the
height min height max height but as I
said before I will stick to the width in
this video because what do I want to do
right here well we have the width of 50%
apply it right here so 50% this means
50% of the width
of D let me show you I think it's better
right here 50% of this trip images class
right here so 50% you can see this image
was 50% and that image that's nice but
the problem is that if I go right here
for example I don't like that I think
the images are way too small and this
means if I would be able to specify
something like now it comes something
like a minimum width well this could be
helpful right I think it is so let's go
back and let's now add right here the
min width property and let's say the
moon width should be I don't know let's
say I don't know how big this is right
here yeah I think 200 pixels maybe
that's also really important you need to
have two different values for the width
and 40 min width because otherwise if
you specify a width of 200 pixels and
the minimum width of 300 pixels I don't
think this makes a lot of sense because
then only the men would will be applied
therefore make sure to have something
like that like 50% of the width that's
the general rule so basically to make
sure that 50% of the space available is
the image but as soon as you go below a
certain minimum value in absolute pixels
right here well then it should change
because if we save that go back and
reload the page now nothing changed but
if we now decrease the size you can see
that once we reach the 200 pixels the
page or the image won't get any smaller
problem though is that we cannot see the
image anymore therefore that might not
be the best way to do it but we know how
to solve this quickly from the last
video when we talked about flexbox
because we can simply say flex wrap
right here and set it to wrap loops like
that if we now save that and go back to
our page and reload it
we can see that if we make it smaller
that the image is now displayed right
here below and it won't get any smaller
once we reach our minimum value of
course and I will totally agree a few
years could say this doesn't look good
right now and we'll work on that when we
talk about media queries from the series
no worries for the moment the important
thing I want to show you is that with
the combination of width and min width
you can make sure that your pages are a
little bit more responsive already now
there is also a max width property let's
have a look at that maybe because we can
also say right here that the max width
like that should be let's say 500 pixels
like this just save that and if we go
back and we load the page then you can
see that we have our min width it may be
unselect inspector we have our own min
width right here now we increase the
size it increases it increases it
increases but once we reached the 500
pixels it won't get any bigger
the rest is same thing true with that I
just said a few seconds ago we'll fix
that when we talk about media queries
the important thing here now is that by
using min width width and Max width you
can make sure with width that your
elements are displayed correctly on
let's say normal devices you can specify
that you want to keep a minimum width on
smaller devices like mobile devices and
you can also specify a max width because
our displays or our TVs are getting
bigger and bigger and you don't want to
increase the image size without any
limits therefore setting a max width for
big devices also can make a lot of sense
now we only touched it min width and
next with properties right here because
the problem is that we don't only have
free device sizes we have multiple
devices
additionally we don't only have the
width or the height that should be
changed it could also be that you want
to have I don't know different
colors on a different device or you want
to have some elements to disappear on
specific device sizes things like that
or getting things transparent there are
a lot of different options that you have
so basically you might want to change
multiple properties depending on the
device size and this brings us to media
queries I talked about that already and
I have to repeat myself we'll have a
look at that well not in the next video
but in the video following the next
video and there will then talk about the
details behind media queries what you
can keep in mind right now is that using
min width and max width gives your page
a more responsive design already but
it's limited to these properties however
as I said we'll talk about the details
in the video following the next video
and in the next video we'll have a look
at fonts so font sizes how we can change
that and how we can import different
font styles to our website because I
think both the font size and the font
style is not perfect right now
so therefore hope to see you in this
video hope you now have a better
understanding of box sizing in CSS well
and as always thanks so much for
watching hope to see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
