since my last thing what's your with you
but no I fought I have a good idea what
I might do next with Englert you and
here is what we're going to do next
this angular 2 weather app now what this
app will do is basically it allows me
here to let's say enter a city name like
winch in Germany click add city and then
we see well the Weber there that it is
cloudy and have five degrees Celsius
there and if you hover over the degrees
here you see over the temperature that I
also got a conversion to Fahrenheit
going on and showing this in this
tooltip which sticks to the mouse now
additionally you did not see it here if
you mention but let me use a number city
like let's say Sydney you can see that I
already got this city found thing here
which updates while I types if I type s
we get this and then yeah well I don't
know how it finds this when I types it
but basically it updates while typing
and then allows me to well add it once I
got the city I want like Sydney in this
case I can also save this as a profile
as CN I got it as my new profile over
here and I can of course also load
profiles like the Stifel profile which
covers New York London and Berlin or
well my safe profile I can also delete
profiles this is what is apt s and it
covers a lot of things that are awesome
an angle at you and that I think will
really help you build your applications
we're going to use observables were of
course going to bold components work on
do you use directives we're going to
build our own directives for this
tooltip our effect here and much more
and the next visible first start of
short refresher so if you've watched all
my YouTube videos
there probably isn't that much new
information but there might be some and
thereafter we're going to well really
dive into some new advanced stuff see
you on the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
