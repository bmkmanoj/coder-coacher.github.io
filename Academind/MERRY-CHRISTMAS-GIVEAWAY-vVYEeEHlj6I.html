ah merry Christmas everyone it's that
time of the year and it's that time
where we couldn't think about how do
your boss what are we good what didn't
kill that good and I have to say I'm
really happy with the year you made it
an awesome year you seem to like what I
create you watched all this video's and
it's absolutely amazing to see this
channel now has 26 thousand subscribers
which is the number i would have never
imagined at the start of the year now
for next year i got loads of plans
exciting ideas regarding you types of
videos regarding you content i want to
cover of course also old content i want
to continue covering like level and so
on so loads of plants there and since
this channel now exists for one year i
thought it would be time to set up some
upload schedule so some schedule you can
keep in mind if you want when new videos
will come out and that will be on every
Monday and Thursday it will release a
new video and occasionally I might lose
a third video probably on friday or
saturday then which might be some extra
topic so not an ongoing serious or
something like that that's an extra
video and I'll see what I'll do there
don't want to put myself on a hard
schedule there just some general outline
or its structure I want to follow but
the video non there through say that is
a set date besides that I want to use
this opportunity to give something back
to you you made this an amazing year for
me and now I want to try to make it even
more amazing for you I use web store and
phpstorm and all the videos or in pretty
much all the videos I have on this
channel phpstorm obviously for PHP and
webstorm for the JavaScript development
now the awesome guys at jetbrains the
developers or the company behind
phpstorm and web storm
gave me the opportunity to give away
some free keys for a one-year personal
subscription for phpstorm and webstorm
so in total I got four keys to four
phpstorm and 24 webstorm and I want to
give them away to you now how do I give
them away I simply want you to write
something in the comments I want you to
write what will you do what will you be
able to achieve with those tools that
doesn't have to be anything
extraordinary that can simply be your
new project that you want to get better
in some language that you want to
practice for your job whatever it is
write it in the comments and from all
the people writing what they would do
with phpstorm war webstorm i will choose
for people to for phpstorm 24 webstorm
to let them know well that they get
there at ease that they get their
one-year subscriptions also have a look
at the video description to read the
details about this christmas raffle here
also note that you should of course
right which two will you prefer phpstorm
or PHP level or webstorm for no chairs
javascript in general so really looking
forward to what you're writing in the
comments section what you plan to do
with those tools and I'm even more
looking forward to next year to all the
exciting new things we'll be doing there
and to see you there again and well that
sounds like the years over of course
there are still some videos to come this
year so see you in those videos and in
next year bye Oh finally the beard is
gone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
