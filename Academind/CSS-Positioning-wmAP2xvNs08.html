about a specific CSS property the
position property because if you are new
to CSS it might be clear that with
position you can well kind of change the
position of an element on your website
but the different values we have for
this property and how they interact with
each other I think this can be confusing
sometimes so let's have a closer look at
that in this video
so why do we use position well let's
think about the following setup we have
a website so we have an HTML element we
have a body element and we have one two
three devs in there so block level
elements which means that they occupy
the entire space where they are located
and each block level elements starts in
a new line that's clear so far now the
question is is already some kind of
position property applied the answer is
yes the automatically applied position
property is this one it's static static
simply means that the elements follow
the normal document flow and the normal
flow for our block level elements is the
one that I just described now the
problem with that position
static declaration is that if we want to
do something like this or like that
hmm that's not possible because that
cannot be done with that static
positioning because as I said static
simply means that we position the
elements in the normal document flow so
if you want to change it like this we
should forget about static for now
because we need other values that we can
use for our position property
these values are absolute relative and
fixed now there is also another value
that can be applied it's called sticky
and it's kind of a hybrid between
absolute and relative but in this video
I really want to focus on to the basics
therefore let's forget about sticky for
a moment and let's focus on to these
free values because with these values we
can achieve kind of what we saw right
here and more but before we dive deeper
into these and have a look at how we can
apply them on a website let's think
about this question what do we change
and we basically change the document
flow and we change the positioning
context now we talked about the document
flow and we learned that the static
value simply means that we follow the
normal document flow but if we use
another value we can change that flow
and add these properties so the top left
bottom and right property and with these
properties we can then change Deepa's
the element top/bottom and so on now the
problem is that if you apply something
like top you need kind of a reference or
a positioning context as written right
here because we want to move our element
down from the top of what so what's our
starting point and the starting point is
defined by this positioning context this
could be the viewport this could be HTML
body or any other element so let's keep
these two things in mind and let's now
switch to some basic code and play
around with that different position
properties that we have with this code
right here you can find a link to the
code of course down there in the video
description now this is a really basic
code actually we just have an HTML file
with free block level elements I didn't
choose this I choose header nav and
further but the idea is the same like
the one that we saw on the slides and we
have a CSS file right here with some
background color and some change padding
and margins just to make sure that it
kind of looks the way we had it on the
slides let's not look at it maybe right
here
I also open to Chrome developer tools to
make things clearer and yeah we can see
that we have our HTML element in the
orange color its inspect that so here we
have HTML here we have our body and here
we have the three divs that we saw so
let's and select inspect right here and
now the question is how can we change
the position of these block level
elements that we have let's maybe say we
want to position the header right here
in the top left corner of the HTML
element now let's go back to the code
and let's change that so let's add right
here position:absolute like that if we
now save that and go back to our page
and reload it well we can see that the
nav element apparently disappeared of
course didn't because if we click orient
our body we can see that nav is still
there but it's somehow below our header
element now now why is happening well
with position:absolute we kind of
excluded the header element from the
normal document workflow and SDL element
is page
not existing anymore it's still there
but not from a document workflow
perspective this simply means that the
nav element moves up one line and the
same thing is true for the footer
element so this means we were now able
to kind of take header out of the normal
document workflow but still we didn't
position it really how can we do that
now well if we go back to our code and
now apply top this could also be bottom
or left or right of course so we have
all the four directions available but
let's start with top and write zero and
do the same thing with left right here
and also type zero if we save that and
go back to our page and reload it well
we can see that a position change now
because now the header is in the left
top corner of the HTML element HTML
element this looks like the body element
right here well the reason is that we
have a margin around our header element
right here so let's maybe quickly get
rid of that margin right here save that
now go back and if we reload that now
now we can see better we positioned the
header element in the top left corner of
the HTML element now why is this
happening well with the
position:absolute declaration we now
positioned the header element relative
to its containing element and the
containing element in the structure we
have right here is the HTML element
that's important and this means as the
absolute positioning with top zero and
left zero now refers to the HTML element
well we defined that header should be
positioned relative to our HTML element
with a distance of zero to a top and a
distance of zero to the left and
therefore we have the positioning we can
see right here now this is how absolute
positioning basically works let's now go
back to our code and add something to
the body element you will see in a few
seconds why because right here
I will now also add position:absolute
like that
save that and let's go back to our page
and let's see what happens now if I
reload the page well then you can see
that two things changed the header
element is now in the top left corner of
the body element because by adding the
position property to this containing
element and body is the containing
element of the header element this now
means that the position that we apply to
the header element now refers to the
body element if we wouldn't add this
position property to the body element
position:absolute would still refer to
the HTML element so this means we are
also able to change the positioning
context with this positioning property
of this position property we also see
that we've position:absolute the general
structure of being a block level element
well kind of is not existing anymore
because now the elements neither the
body nor the header occupies the entire
space so this was also changed as I said
before this is due to the fact that with
the position absolute declaration we
exclude this element from the normal
document workflow in this case of a
block level element now let's go back to
our code again and change another thing
let's now change the body element and
add top zero right here like we did with
the header press save and go back and we
load it and let's see what happens
well now the body element is positioned
without any distance so top zero to the
HTML element that's also interesting
right because for the body element the
containing element and therefore the
positioning context is the HTML element
so our positioning top left bottom right
is applied relative to the position of
the HTML element in this case this means
the positioning of the body element
refers to the HTML element and the
positioning of the header element refers
to the body element again if we go back
and remove that right then we change it
this means that if we go back and reload
the page
here that header is again positioned in
the top left corner of the HTML element
because the positioning context of the
head element now isn't body anymore
because body doesn't have any position
property applied but now again is the
HTML element this is how this generally
works now of course we don't only have
position:absolute we can also use
position:relative for the body right
here and now type relative like that if
we take this and go back and reload the
page we can see that well it kind of
looks like we had it like maybe and
select inspect tool it kind of looks
like the same we had it with absolute
positioning because now again the header
element refers to the body element
because you applied that position
property and the position of the body
element didn't change at all actually
now what if I go back and now again
apply top zero like we did it before
when we had position absolute right here
that's safe there let's go back let's
reload it hmm nothing changed that's
strange right because when we applied
position:absolute to our body element
and then defined that topshop is zero we
saw that the body element was kind of up
here so without any distance to the top
of the HTML element now we've positioned
relative this top zero didn't change a
thing let's maybe go back and change it
to 50 pixels and save that and now go
back again if you reload that then we
can see that the body element is moved
downwards by 50 pixels and that's the
important difference using the position
absolute declaration in the body element
and then applying top zero simply means
that the distance to the containing
element so in this case then the HTML
element should be zero applying
positioning relative to our body element
and then applying top zero simply means
that the position of the body element
should change by zero applying top fifty
simply means that we kind of move or
kick down the element by 50 pixels that
an important difference you have to
understand and this sounds important to
understand when you use position
relative or position absolute now let's
go back to our code and think about more
things that we could change because now
that we added that position relative
declaration right here I would also like
to show you something else because if we
add position relative also right here
in the nav element so position relative
like that you can see I didn't change a
thing just edit the property and I say
if that is I just said and if we now go
back and reload our page well then you
can see something interesting again
because we saw that with body when we
applied position relative to the body
that the body apparently didn't move but
now we can see kind of the same behavior
because we applied position relative to
our nav element so right here and we saw
that when we applied position absolute
to header in the beginning that the
header basically was taken out of the
document flow so the nav element moved
to the first line because for this
element well Heather wasn't there
anymore
now we applied position relative and
apparently the element let me unselect
the inspector and the element is still
here so footer is not moving up to the
first line now let's try something else
let's go back and let's now add chopped
maybe 100 pixels so that we can see what
happens save it and go back and now if
we reload the page can you see that the
Neph element now move down from its
initial position by 100 pixels but the
footer element saw the block level
element below this nav element didn't
move up because although we are able to
move our element with the relative value
applied the element is not taken out of
the document flow basically so for the
other elements the nav element is still
existing this is also something
important that you have to keep in mind
when you work with relative and with
absolute because as you can see they
differ in a lot of
ways however let's maybe go back and
change that 102 I don't know maybe 10
like that let's go back and we load it
just to make sure our page looks a
little bit more structured now this is
absolute and relative but there is one
more really important value that you can
apply to the position property that I
would like to show you and that we
talked about on the slide it was this
fixed value now let's apply fix now and
let's maybe do this right here in the
footer there
so let me write position fixed right
here and let's save it and go back and
reload the page and now you again see
something interesting fixed or a fixed
element it's no longer part of this
normal workflow again because as you can
see right here we are not part of the
body element anymore
but we are somehow well kind of in the
middle of nowhere at the moment let's
maybe change this by going back and now
again add top zero like we did it in the
beginning with our position absolute
declaration right here let's go back and
let's read note that and now it seems
that the element is well kind of again
in the middle of nowhere but if we
inspect that we can see that again the
margin is the issue that we have so if
we now also remove the margin we had
here in the beginning right there and
now go back to our page then we see that
with position fixed we are able to kind
of well add our element to the top of
our page and to the top of our page is
not correct actually it's not the top of
our page position fixed always refers to
the viewport that's really important
because we saw that with position
absolute we could position our element
on top of the HTML element if we want
you or at the top border of the HTML
element but if we change that so if we
added position relative or absolute to
the body element the positioning context
changed and
therefore we were not able to add our
element to the top of the page for
example and with position fixed we can
do that because as I said before it
always refers to the viewport now that's
interesting but there are two more
things that I would like to show you
right here the first thing is that with
position fixed we are not only able to
kind of position our element depending
on the viewport there is also another
cool thing and to see this thing we
should go back to our code and just add
a height or for example 3000 or
something like that to the HTML element
the reason is just that I want to be
able to scroll through the page now to
show you that thing that I actually like
actually so going back to our page and
loading it we can see that basically
nothing changed but if I now scroll down
can you see it now we see that our
footer element so the element with
position fixed applied kind of sticks on
top of our page and this is pretty
awesome actually because with that we
can easily create some fixed navigation
bar on top of our page if you wanted for
example now that was the first thing
that I wanted to show you but there is
one last thing in this video that I
would like you to know and this last
thing is relevant if we apply the
following let's go back and let's now
change the header maybe right here and
let's say that this header now also has
a position fixed right here like that
and let me now apply left maybe 100
maybe that's too much but we will see
because I want to show you something
special save that back that was too much
because now we can see that we have both
the footer and the header on top of the
page because both are related to the
viewport and top is defined as 0 but if
we now change that to maybe 20 pixels
let's see if that's better now yes then
it's fine because now you can see that
photo and header are kind of at the same
position right now but the problem is
that footer is on top of header now of
course you wouldn't keep it that way
but the thing I want to show you now is
that you can change that order basically
because what if you want to have header
above the footer or the other way around
like we have it right here well then you
have to change the so-called Z index how
does this work well let's go back and
let's apply a Z index right here of one
so always just simple numbers could be
100 also or something like that but
let's use let's use 10 maybe like that
and if we now go back right here and
reload the page we can now see that the
header is kind of a head of the footer
element because we gave this Z index
which kind of defines the well Esther
name says is that index so if you
imagine a page like this then you define
if it should be right there or right
there that's what you basically do with
the Z index and if we now go back to our
page and now apply a Z index also to the
footer like that for example let's maybe
applies that index of 11 so a larger
number than the one you applied to the
header right here if we save that go
back and reload the page again we can
see that now footer is on top of our
header element now that's also something
that can be really helpful when you want
to position the different elements on
your page to make sure that your website
looks the way it should look and that's
it actually
that's this positioning theory video I
hope that with the concepts we talked
about and with the examples simple
examples actually be applied you got a
better idea of how the whole positioning
in CSS works now with that you are free
to practice of course and to also apply
the positioning on your website and with
that the only thing I can say right now
as in all of my videos thanks a lot for
watching and hope to see you in the next
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
