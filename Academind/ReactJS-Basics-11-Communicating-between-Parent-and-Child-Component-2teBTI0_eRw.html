props ends up on there's still one thing
I promised a couple of videos ago and we
still haven't seen it yet how can we
communicate from a child to a parent
component so in our parent component we
can pass data to the child with props
but what's the equivalent for passing
something from the child to the parent
is that not possible yes it is possible
and actually we use props for this too
and how well this video shows you let's
start simple and say my index file the
app component here once you pass a
function into the home component which
should be executable from inside the
home component so I'll add the method
here and I'll call it on read and all I
want to do here is I want to throw an
alert so open this alert dialog where I
say hello like this now I want to call
this function or this method from my
child component so this is kind of from
child to parent interaction right
because of course I could also pass data
from the child to the parent and I will
show this later on to you so I call on
greet where I want to call on read now
in order to do this I need to pass a
link to this method to my child and I
can pass data with props of course so
I'll pass something called greet does
the prot name I choose and then in
single curly braces I'll link to this on
say hello no need to bind this here
because I don't use this keyword in this
method if I were to use it there you
need to bind this so with that I'm
passing a reference or a link it's not
cold on say hello by the way
on read I'm passing a link to this on
grid method as props to my home
component so back in my home component
by then one two useless
link so I will add a number button here
add a horizontal line maybe then a
button like that where I just say greet
and then I want to fire this greet
method in my parent component so course
first some bootstrap styles here like
that primary but then more importantly
of course I add my on click listener on
click like that and what do I want to
execute well of course I want to execute
this props greet greet is when I got
passed in here and don't add parentheses
of course this props greet now since I
get these props I should also configure
them here so I'll set greet to be of
type react prop types and then func like
this now with this setup in place if I
safe doesn't go back to my application
and click to greet button you see the
alert getting opened so I'm successfully
interacting between child component and
parent component I'm reaching out to my
parent component from my child component
by using this link reference I got
passed by my parent cuter child because
that is how you
well do this in react.js you pass
references from the parent to the child
that's the only direction possible but
by passing links to functions or methods
you of course create a way back for your
child you give it a way to execute
something in the parent component class
and that is how you set up such
parent-child communication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
