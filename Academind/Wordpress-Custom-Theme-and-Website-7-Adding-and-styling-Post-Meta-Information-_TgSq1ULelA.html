last time we left when we just finished
our overall styling here and our post
index list when we got our extra pages
for our about and sample page here with
our nice box here and today we're gonna
focus on our posts a little bit more
first thing first is I want to display
the offer and the categories of a post
just below the title in our like a
little bit more tiny grayish font and
then when we click on a post actually I
want this post title to be here instead
of the our posts because we're no longer
in the list of our posts but we're in a
single post so let's do this now let's
start by displaying the offer and the
categories of a post now we want to
display the offer and the categories as
in the index as well as in a single blog
post so the right place to put it is our
content of PHP right below the title but
above our content or excerpt split here
where we check if we're in a single post
or not because it's well it for both
posts so let's just enter it right below
the title and I want to use a heading 5
h5 tag here which I want and style to my
needs that we got this subtitle ish look
well basically want to see the offer and
that's the categories and obviously
these words are only placeholders but I
want to see everything just like that
now let's do the styling first in our
style of CSS at the top where we style
our h2 let's let's style our age 5 as
well and what do I want
M it shouldn't be bold it should be
in a normal phone wait and should have a
font size of let's say let's try out 14
pixels and I want a color of dark gray
maybe how does it look
excellent that's exactly how I want it
so let's start by implementing our offer
no all we need is a PHP function within
PHP tags obviously the offer and if we
now reload our post page we'll see max
our offer so we can change the name
which is play here back in our back-end
under users your profile if we enter it
Mike has my full in Maximilian and then
select from the drop-down update the
profile and then reload here we now
changed our name which will appear next
your posts now let's print out all
categories this post belongs to next and
first I will go back to our posts and
make sure that we actually have
categorized added right because
currently we don't so we only get one
category eyes now and now I want to add
a category let's call it sports and also
add a slack which will be basically what
will be displayed in the URL if you
filter for a category added now let's
also add a health category and you can
leave the slack felt empty as well it
will automatically just use the
uppercase name or the name and put it
all to lower cases here the third
category which might be
Tech and last one which I will call
gossip okay so we get these four
categories now back to our posts let's
take this post here edit it
no more here we can assign categories so
this one should be lets say gossip and
tack updated and the other post I will
move over to health
okay so we got the offer now let's work
on the category lists next and here
WordPress as in so many cases also has a
neat little function ready for us to use
which we just use by typing echo because
this function returns as a string which
we have to echo out the category then we
specify with which separator we want you
yet separate our category items which
will be a comma in the space in our case
here and then just close the function
with a semicolon
if we now refresh now get our list of
categories here as links which will
directly lead to our category archives
and we will go into detail to these
archives later but as of now we got
these nice links here and all I want to
do now is just make sure they also have
our subtitle styling therefore I'm going
to replace this h5m for spam tag give it
a class of post info and another style
later just take this to organize it I
will you below our blog post classes
here and give the entered a class here
post info now if we refresh here still
see the offer is the same now to make
sure the link styling is used post info
a will also have the color of dark grey
and text decoration of none so we remove
the underlining below our links okay
and our last thing I wanted to have is
to add effect if we exposed info a:hover
when we have our links over if they are
active
I want text-decoration:underline now
refresh here and now what we get
underlining spec when we hover over a
link nice see that's it for our post
info and now the next last thing for
this video is that we want to create
earn and never few another template for
a single toast here therefore here in my
theme folder I'm gonna create a new file
which is called single the PHP this file
will automatically be used when we have
a single post file own and so very fresh
now we see that everything disappears
because this file obviously is empty now
I'm just gonna copy the template slack
here of our home dot PHP file which is
for our post index copy it here now I
want to display the post settle here so
I'm gonna enter into PHP echo mode and
fYI if you type question mark PHP you're
entering in terms of the PHP mode you're
entering with PHP tags and now you can
write PHP code but if you want to print
something to the screen you will have to
write echo anything like we did before
of the categories and if you were no the
only thing we're gonna do is echo out
something you can always use the
shortcut by writing question mark equal
which will directly print anything
followed after the equal sign out of the
screen so you only may use
one winner here you can't write if
complicated if statements or anything
like this because this expects something
after the equal sign which can be
printed out to the stream so we print
out the title oops
title that now if we refresh we have it
here but we still have it here so what
we will have to do is go back to our
content dot PHP and basically just
structure this a little bit differently
so we only want the title to be printed
out like this when we are in the index
and otherwise if we were in the single
mode we will only print out the content
because we'll take care about the title
in our single template now as we want
our post info to be shown in both
templates I will just copy it into each
of these if conditions here right if we
were fresh we got it like that that's
exactly the result order to achieve this
with you so in the next video we will
create a little search form over here
and I will show you how you can run the
tree search and display the results in a
list like this like this just for the
results the fit search so you see you
there
have a nice day and goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
