you here in this video I want to share
my new udemy course with you it's about
styling and animating angular apps and
in this course you will learn which
tools and features angle offers you to
style your whole application but also
the individual components in your
angular apps you will learn how you may
change your Styles dynamically which
special CSS selectors you can use to
apply specific styles to certain
components also taking into account in
which environment they sit in which code
they are embedded and of course as the
name suggests we're going to have a very
detailed look at how you may animate
your angular apps both with CSS
transitions and animations but of course
also how to use the angular and
animations package to create powerful
and smooth transitions you will learn
all about these animations how they work
and which features you may use and how
you may create both simple and more
complex animations and since learning
that in theory or with tiny examples is
nice but not everything you need we will
build a full project this course to be
precise we will start with one a working
but very ugly one and then we will turn
it into a beautiful one we will step by
step implemented features we learn like
styling CSS animations allowing us to
select elements that highlight this and
then also very complex animations when
we change to route or animating the list
animating a staggered list all these
nice features so that by the end of the
course you should be able to really
enhance your app with stylings with
animations build reusable components
with their own styles and closed in them
you could say and therefore created
great applications which provide awesome
user experiences would be great to see
you there you can find a link with a
discount in the video description if
you're interested well and if you're not
see you on the other videos here on
YouTube hopefully have a great time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
