this request session validation stuff
we're finally reaching the point where
it I think makes sense to store some
data to well manipulate some data to it
do more with the data than just dumping
it after each of our dummy requests so
we'll introduce a database on the server
now know chess often used with MongoDB
together with MongoDB but you can use it
just fine with sequel databases as well
but in this video we will have a look at
how we install MongoDB which is a no
sequel database so let's get started on
the MongoDB homepage MongoDB org we just
download a MongoDB just pick your
operating system hit the download button
here you don't need to fill out this
form then just save it wherever you want
and let the download finish see you in a
second okay my download just finished
now I'm extracting this and just just
happened on another window let me bring
this in and now I'm inside the extracted
folder here this is how this will look
like you have this binary folder and
some other files now in this binary
folder you have the things you will use
to work with with MongoDB so on Windows
you have several executable files on Mac
you can run these files where the bash
command or over by the terminal and it's
that this will be for example Mongo D
will be a server you start up Mongo will
be declined with which you connect the
server but why talk about it let's see
this in action you may copy this whole
file this whole folder excuse me - where
whichever location you want on your
operating systems don't or it where you
want doesn't have to be in your
downloads folder just be sure to
navigate to the right folder when you're
using it later in the terminal for
example so in my case here let me open a
terminal and here I navigate it into my
MongoDB
binary folder on Windows you may just
run the executable on Mac or Linux what
I do is I run dot slash Mongo D to start
our Mongo server and now it's running
this can see it's not exiting here
because well it's continuing to run now
I will open a second terminal window by
the way all the installation process
already finished as is just to show you
how it works and in this window I'll
also navigate it into this MongoDB
folder so in here I'll also exit
navigate into the bin folder here I will
run Mongo oops dot slash Mongo which is
the client range this nicely here and
now on the right I got the server
running I'm not doing anything there and
on the Left I have two client and of
course later in our Express app we will
let know learn Express handle this but
just to show you how you generally work
with Mongo inside my client which is
connected to the server I got running on
the right I can type DB to see the
current database I'm on and this is a
test database what ships with MongoDB
and here we can just well test some
things try out some things so what all
the years I want to insert something new
I do this but having DB which refers to
this test database then dot and now I
will specify the name of the collection
which I want to use MongoDB doesn't have
tables
it has collections because it's a no
sequel database it has this JSON
formatted approach and well therefore we
talk of collections let's say I have a
collection data and here let's say I
want to answer the user name I would do
this by accessing my data collection
with the dot notation on my database
then dot insert and then I insert my
JSON object
so for example it has username
oops name max close the object was
parentheses hit enter and now you can
see we wrote one entry to the database
in order to see that data I can also
query DB data not fine with empty
parenthesis to see all the objects I
have my database in this case only the
user name and as you can see there was
an ID automatically added to ders and
via unique ID so and that's that for
this video of course you can do a lot
more you can execute all the operations
you want in your database database with
the command shell or command line here
but we will do it as a node of course
just wanted to show you how to set up
how it works that you got this server
and client and the server the right
terminal window is something we'll keep
running for our development because we
need that server and we're developing on
our local machine at the moment but a
client is something we won't need in the
future because we are not using this
command line client or this MongoDB
shell client but instead we will use
Express and the respective MongoDB
package see you in the next video where
we will actually do this bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
