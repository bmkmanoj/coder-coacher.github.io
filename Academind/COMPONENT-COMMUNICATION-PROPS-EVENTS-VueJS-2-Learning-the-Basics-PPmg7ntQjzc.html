this video we're going to learn how we
can have two components communicate with
a jabra like in this example app where
we have a message and then in the
network component that input where I can
enter is something and it will be output
in that same component but what if I
wanted to get it to my message component
or get the message into the input
component in the beginning well let's
take a closer look in this video so we
have this example application which I
set up on the last video in this
playlist if you want to go back there
and see how this was set up so I do have
two components input and message and an
input I have this input field where I
output the message which is pound wire
two-way binding and in the message
component well I just have my message
but here I also do implement the input
component now my first goal is to get
the message I'm using here into the
input component at the beginning and I
can do this by setting up my data
property here using es6 which I can do
in my web pack setup here and here I
will return an object where I store this
message and I will just copy the text
I'm outputting here so just cut it enter
it here and then use string
interpolation up there to output message
now the goal is to get this message into
my input component and we can do this
using the data binding syntax we also
know from native elements so for example
if I had an image I could bind back to
its source
by using : source I can do the same for
my own components I could say I want to
bind to let's say MSG and I want to bind
my message referring to this message
property the problem though is MSG of
course is not known yet it's my own
component how would it know that MSG
means I'm passing you the message well
we have to tell it so let's go to the
input component and do tell it I do this
in my JavaScript object where I
configure this component and here we
have the props property props takes an
array and props Stan
four properties it means which
properties should I be able to set on
this component now I'm setting one
property right now MSG and 40 to
understand this to be able to get this
data I have to add it to this array of
known props so here we add it as a
string msg and of course this text here
has to match the text I'm using here now
with that being added
I can output MSG just like this by
adding a paragraph and then outputting
msg like a normal data property but now
set from outside let's save doesn't take
a look here you see this is a great
message and this is in the input
component the message I'm passing in
next of course it would be great to
let's say see this is a default message
in the input field which we then could
change and then propagate this change to
our parent component where we output
this message in the first place let's
work on this so here we output it in the
paragraph right now but now I want you
out put it here now queue way binding
wouldn't work in the way we expected to
work if a bind to message here you see
this is a great message but if I change
it this is not reflected and also if we
open up the console we see an error
because we're trying to mutate to change
a property which is set from outside and
your chest doesn't like this for obvious
reasons because what happens if we do
that well it gets overwritten from
outside anyways so we change it in the
input component but this does not
propagate up instead from the upper
component from the parent component it
is constantly overwritten so this is not
how it works where we can't you bind to
it a work yes we can but it's not
behaving in a way we expect it to behave
well we can use a number route here we
could say we want to set a value of
message so I'm removing two-way binding
for the time being value and of course
make this bundle or bind with a colon
the beginning which of course just a
shortcut for a V bind so if we save this
we see this is a great message of course
still no two-way binding but now we can
listen with we on or just at to the
input event which is fired whenever we
type something whenever we change
something there and here we could simply
update or because a simply fire some
method so let me add methods property
and here I could simply say change
message choose any name you want your
six syntax here for the shorter version
of this alternative so change message
and here we of course get this default
event object passed into you so here I'm
calling change message and passing the
reference and view test will
automatically give me this event object
and here I know that event the event
object has the well target of the event
which is the input and then the value
therefore here I can say this message
referring to my message property here
which output with string interpolation
this message equals a went target value
this is kind of my own two way binding
but the key differences I'm binding to
do different properties the input comes
from outside but from my prop here msg
and the output goes to another property
the message property here so if we save
this and I start changing this we see
that now this is reflected down there
but not really I can type but as soon as
I start typing well it instantly gets
overwritten again and the reason for
this of course is MSG which sets the
value of my input here comes from
outside so it still constantly overrides
this so I'm technically changing my
message property here but then again it
gets immediately overwritten from
outside and this is a DTD behavior we
want to see here it would be bad if this
would get only get passed one time so we
also need to inform our parent component
that this changed and for
it is I can use another function view
chess has built in dollar sign amid
dollar sign always indicates this is a
built-in method and Amit allows me to
emit my own event Amit takes two
arguments the first one is the name of
the event let's name it message changed
this is totally up to you and the second
is a potential value I want to pass with
this or multiple values even here I want
to pass my changed message so this
message now that allows me to inform my
parent component that something changed
here now the goal is to go to the parent
component which is my message do you
form a message component and I not only
have to pass in appropriate here
now I also have to listen to my own
event with Veon or alternatively at and
then message changed because that's the
name I gave my own event here message
changed so if that I can listen to my
own event thrown by my own component and
I know I get some data passed here the
data in passing is the changed message
and therefore here I can simply set this
message not this just message this
message here in the data property equal
to dollar sign event because I know
again dollars an event st reserved word
for the data in passing with my event
here and i know this will be a string
which is exactly type i expect here
it is a string because again this is
what i'm passing here this message which
holds a string in the end now with this
in place if i save this and we start
changing this again you now see it's
reflected in the parent component i am
able to update this now because now i'm
passing data in with props and i'm
passing data out you could say i'm
propagating any changes with my own
custom event with the emit function that
being said there are other ways of
sharing data across sibling components
for example by using like
airView instance which emits and then
you could subscribe in an avro component
you also have the concept of slots where
you can pass in some data into a
component and it will link these
concepts in the video description you
can also find a fully-fledged
explanation in my more than 16 hours
course on udemy for this video here i
focused on the core idea behind
component communication which is about
props and custom events a very very
basic and key concept to understand when
working with components and view js2 I
hope you liked it see you in our videos
