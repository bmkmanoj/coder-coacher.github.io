we left when we just finished the basics
of our grid and had this status here
that we had two columns one half of the
container on one third spacing around or
with our space around class and so far
we really got a nice grid and how nice
it is I want to show you by adding some
more rosin and different color sizes so
let's create a new row here let's all
give it gather and mark it and within
I'm going to create a coal coal one of
four with padding and also marked and I
will also create column with column 1 of
3 so really combining those different
sizes doesn't have to be one of 4 and 3
or 4 I can mix up 1 of 4 and 1 of 3
because remember all that changes as the
width of our column will to give this
padding and our mark class so that we
can see it ok and now we get our quarter
sized container here and one third of
the row here and let's another row to it
or another column sorry column we still
got space for say one of four padding
mark ok so now we get this added and my
thing just doesn't look too bad
now let's see just a short check for ad
space around here we see ok no empty
spaces added here
but when we resize our window we can see
endeavours because if we have our window
size this width here
we barely if at all I don't think we
have any empty spaces here so space
around isn't doing anything in this case
and this is because we got 25% of our
wave for this column and for this column
so that's 50% 33.3 for this column so we
are at 83% and now it's a ok so we
should have 60% left over space
well we got our gather here right
together our spacing here we can all
gathers here and as our overall width of
the window isn't very broad these
cutters might well take up the remaining
16.6% of our space and therefore only if
we make it broader we get left over
space which is then divided up between
all yeah free spaces here okay so I know
vice versa if we resize it to very small
it shrinks because by default every
element inside a Flex container is
allowed to shrink so we would have to
prevent this by setting Flex shrink to 0
if we wanted it to overlap to the right
so ok we get our next grid here I'm just
going to add some numbers again but
actually no let's add some text in the
middle some lorem ipsum dummy text now I
can see that all three children are
stretched out vertically and they are
sized equally even though only the
middle one really needs the space so if
we want to change this behavior we have
to add some additional classes that's
what we're going to do now and now we'll
control we will take care about
controlling the vertical spacing so back
to our real stuff we got our space
around Center
and so on classes now to take care about
a vertical positioning I'm going to say
row and first class I want to give it as
vertical start and we need to flex
property for the container the row of
our line items flags start row dot
vertical oops
and will be aligned items flax and now
we also got Center and and stretch which
is the default vertical Center which is
a line items Center Road stretch just so
that you could overwrite it if you
wanted vertical stretch all items
stretch so we as that this is different
we don't have to set that for our row
because yeah it's already happening so
let's say one piece should be at the end
very clan okay so I've now set it to
vertical and honor didn't work at the
beginning and that was because I
actually forgot and I here I just had
oops I just attempts so I now it works
or it was at vertical and yeah I was
missing but now it works we get the left
or the right box aligned to the bottom
of our row and only the middle one
stretches out the whole size that's
logical because it's the one which needs
this science never that row is flexing
it's it's it's increasing in height to
be able to hold this container and
therefore this container takes all of
its height I think that's make sense I
hope so um LSAT vertical start would be
another possibility and if we were to
set it to centre
I should say if we say 32 vertical
Center never everything centered okay so
that's our vertical positioning and now
there's there are really only two more
things I want to add the first thing is
a tiny back fix we have to do as you can
see we get our empty colored glass here
and we really only need one property in
up here and that is we need to set the
box sizing to be border box so that the
padding is actually included in our box
now can the Z that the directly changed
so that we now got our space on the left
and right here - and that bigness
because I explained to you why it could
disappear if we have a very small stream
like soap right but this screen wasn't
actually small enough the reason why we
had no empty spaces here was that not
only the margins from the gutter was
there but but this margin wasn't enough
to take up the 60.6%
we have on leftover space here remember
25 plus 25 plus 4 - 3 point 3 leaves us
16.7% empty space this is not taking up
by the margins but as we didn't set the
box sizing to border box actually
padding of our containers wasn't added
to its width and therefore not only the
margins were part of the remaining space
but also the padding's even though we
couldn't see it
because for our eye the padding is
included on a border or a box or in a
box of the sediment right and that's why
I set the box sizing to border box which
tells us hey you should include pet
bedding in your total width and now the
width of 25% includes petting of 16
pixels and therefore we get leftover
space on African right the last thing is
when I add is another account class we
got
of two to four and so on I want to add
one which is called Coffelt
and all I provide here is the Flex CRO
property and set it to one now if we
were to give this column here does cow
fill class would tell it that it should
thought the remaining space and you can
see this by it will fact that we don't
have our empty spaces on the left and
right so we can totally remove space
around here because there is no empty
space to divide it up but instead this
box here will take all our empty space
if we were to set this to call fill
these two boxes what you write up the
empty space and you've already guessed
it if we set this to Col fill the middle
box will do it now you think okay I'm
all three boxes got a colorful proper
heat of one or Flex grown property of
one now if you watched my flex box with
you you will know that they should
divide it up equally right because
everyone got a flex flow property of one
which means you take a share of one in
proportion to the other boxes of the
remaining spaces and you take one and
you take one so everyone should take
one-third well that's not the case
because the middle one got this text in
it if we were to remove this text now
every box would be of equal size but as
we have two stacks your flex box
recognizes okay this box probably needs
more space because of this text whereas
these boxes only have one character so
this will take up the most space so
let's set it back to one of three now we
got these two divide up the remaining
space between them so now with this grid
we created here you're really able
to create a full working website
obviously you've got a possibility to
add four functionalities to find unit
but this grid will really enable you to
create a dynamic scaling layout I for my
site have to say for my client project I
most of the time start up with my own
code my own with my own layout and I
don't use frameworks like bootstrap
except for when it really has to go very
fast or it's a very standardized job a
very generic website but most of the
time I really wreck it out myself
because you learn a lot more and you're
a lot more flexible and in the end it's
it's less or as your customer or ever
any wizard visitor of your site has to
download mine so you should really
consider this and I'm interested in what
you think about the serious and about
the street and if you got any positive
experience experiences rebuilding it
using it happy to hear from you so have
a nice day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
