video we had a look at Jade the
templating engine Jade and we kind of
played around a little bit with express
so far and I thought well it might be
the best idea to just show you an
alternative to shade right now as Jade
is well you have to kind of like it I'm
not the biggest fan of completing
engines like Jade with white spaces
controlling the flow in the structure of
the document I'm more a fan of classic
HTML and then you just insert some
template expressions to manipulate that
but that's just my preference you may
choose whatever you like therefore
however in this video I will show you
how we can replace Jade with another
templating engine handlebars and I will
show you how to well use handlebars
let's start don't just start by copying
my old folder here and we name it to
handle ours that's just as I said in
earlier video I have this file structure
for my repository where you can find all
the code now that I copied it I will
just appoint by terminal and the first
thing is I will uninstall Jade I don't
have to do that I could let let live
there but I'm not going to use it so on
well I will just get rid of it I will
type NPM uninstall shade and I will
provide the - - save tag to also remove
it from the dependencies in my package
to chasten
and yeah it always helps to be in the
right folder so let me just repeat it
there so now if we open the package of
chase' file you see there is no more
shade in the dependencies area next
things I will install handlebars and I
will install Express handlebars which
again with the save tag to add the
dependencies which is well handlebars
optimized or porridge it to Butte work
really great in a node where it's
specially above Express like the name
implies so now you can see we get this
Express handlebars dependency here and
it's also installed here in our node
modules if we have a look at here
Express handlebars okay so now with that
set up I have to adjust my few engine
here because I'm no longer using Jade to
do this I'll add a new step here first
thing is I will require Express
handlebars which we'll just name is HBS
require Express handlebars there it is
and after doing this I will add a new
entry here where I kind of create a new
engine for our Express app let it know
that I have a new engine available and I
will give this engine an internal name
of HBS and I will use this well this
package just required queue while create
this engine basically and here I want to
give to some options some configuration
the first is the Xtreme property here
where a chest will basically specify the
extension of the files so that Express
is able to recognize which files are
kind of written in handlebars or should
be run through the template and I want
to have dot HBS's extent ads as an
extension and therefore I add HBS here
next thing is
I will set my default layout folder my
default layout name your - layout so I
will show this in a second handlebars
also offers us the possibility to define
layouts where we have a specific block
where then the content of the individual
page will be kind of injected and I'm
telling handlebars here that default
layer to be used is the layout layout
file so like we have layout shade we
will have a layout HPS and this layout
file should be the default they are used
if I don't overwrite this that is
basically what I'm saying here now with
that out of the way what I do here is I
will set my view engine to HBS because
well I set it up here as an engine I
registered it as an engine here in my
Express app and I want to add one more
parameter here this is the layout
directory where layouts will be found
and this should be your name which
always points to the well root directory
of our know chairs up here and then
we'll find it in views folder slash
views and then I will create a subfolder
layouts where all my layout should
should be now with that setup I will
create a folder in my few folder here so
layouts is of course purely optional you
could also just point to the fuse for
itself and not to the layouts subfolder
next thing is I will move my lamps to
shade file into there and I will well
change the the name or the extension of
this file to HPS and of course I also
can't use this so what I will do here is
I will set up a new well html5 skeleton
which I want to use in here I will
output the title
in a second and between the body tags I
want to have the part where the
individual pages can well inject or put
their content into like ones with Jade
we did with this block content statement
here I also will add well the style
sheet which is still in the style sheets
folder style sheet style CSS so how do
we do this how do I insert a title here
and set up the section for the
individual page parts in my body here
let's begin with the title I can just
output variables or data pass to the
template by using double curly braces
that's by the way where the name comes
from these handlebars here and then I
just specify the name of the variable I
want to output here title because
remember in my routes file here I'm
setting this title variable here and
well this is just what it will output
here next thing is the part worthy
detail part where the block content
where the individual pages can inject
their content is set up by using free
Kali braces to escape HTML or to not
escape HTML to be precise because using
double curly braces make sure that only
text is output and if I would have HTML
tags in this variable it would just
render them as text but using free kolja
braces says no no render the HTML and we
definitely want that to be the case in
our content here which comes from our
individual pages which will of course
not only contain plain text but HTML
themselves so I have free quality braces
here and then we name this body because
body is the reserved name so to say the
reserved hook handlebars will look for
and which will be a kind of overwritten
or replaced with the
of the pages so this name is not
optional or not freely chosen it has to
be body here because we set this file up
as our main layout if you remember the
app touch as file and therefore
handlebars will then look for this body
part here to insert the actual content
of the individual pages so I hope this
is clear how this works
so this is how we set up our layout now
let's change our index dot change change
file to index HPS here again we can't
use this but we of course want user
layout we don't have to extend it
because if you remember in the appliques
file we set a default layout of this
layout file now we could overwrite us
when rendering our page and we will see
this in future lectures but as we have
this default layout I don't need to
extend anything I also need don't need
this blog content because as I said
handlebars will always take the content
in this file and just insert it where it
finds this body part this body hook in
the layout so all I have here is an h1
title which again should be the title
and then let's say you to create the
same view as the last lecture I will
have a paragraph which says welcome and
welcome to you and then again Thailand
you can already see good thing is
compared to Jade well it's normal HTML
again and we always have this double
curly braces syntax it doesn't matter if
it's the only content between two HTML
tags or if it's nested in normal text so
I save this and now let's let's run the
app shall we so I run my server here and
I reload my page and as you can see this
works and this is now rendered through
handlebars not Jade so last thing is I
will
also rewrite my error file here again
replace the file ending get rid of this
and let's justwell output the error
message here like that and I will get
rid of the other stuff I had here
because yeah it's only that we have a
valid file which can be used so this is
general how we set up how or so how we
use it overuse layouts now let's dive a
little bit deeper into that templating
engine and the MX file here we currently
have well days now I want in my routes
file I'll get rid of these routes
because currently they don't lead
anywhere I want extra of my conditional
I will use this and I will pass an array
your queue which should just hold well
free numbers now in my index file again
let's first say I want to check if a
certain condition is met and as you saw
I'm passing this condition variable
which to us just as false how can I do
this handlebar handlebars has this
concept called helpers we can write our
own helper functions which basically
transform code or which well add a
certain functionality to the templating
engine we can use it also has some
built-in helpers like well things you
often use like if statements or each
loops so what we need here let's start
with the if statement this helper will
be a block expression because it will
have multiple lines and normal or non
block expression is well something
likely like the style thing here it's
only one line here we can't have
multiple lines of codes this would throw
an error now in contrast to that when
you see if we certainly need certain
well or multiple numbers because we
would have something like if condition
and then we want to have something here
if this condition is met then we might
have else and then we will probably have
something like and if so this would be
kind of the syntax we would expect right
let's see how this actually looks in
handlebars and why this is the case as I
said we no longer have this single line
expression but it's kind of a block
because we're wrapping some content with
this overall template expression here
which is not independent or these
individual lines are not independent of
each other but they kind of work
together sit roulette handlebars know
that I have to specify that we're now
writing some code over multiple lines or
that we have this
yeah block here I do this by adding a
hash sign right after these double curly
braces and that is just half my my if
condition here but now I get my ID or it
tells you if block not closed
well because it's not and if but instead
we use a slash like a close and normal
HTML tag and my ID automatically
autocomplete at that it now recognizes
this is a valid block in handlebars we
close it with double curly braces slash
again like an HTML tag just with double
curly braces and we open it with this
hash signs and now handlebars knows this
here is one block working together now
the outside one in the middle is fine
this is actually written like this
because again it's now in the middle of
this block and therefore this works so
now I can say if condition is met I can
write like condition is matte or
condition not matte something like this
let me reload and you can see condition
not met because yeah we were passing
false here if I change this to true this
condition we should see that the
condition is matte
oops I need to of course restart my
server now conditioners Matt so now
let's output this area with a each loop
again in my index file ie Shoop is a
block - right because again we would
have like opening of the each loop that
some code or some HTML well content
between the opening and ending statement
and then well the ending statement so to
do this I will again open up my block
statement with double curly braces and
hash and then I will have my each
keyword here and like F and s and so on
this is of course a reserved keyword
here see how each and I want to well
loop through any array and then I will
just oops
I will just close this here close the
each block so now this is working again
but it's one have one curly brace too
much so now this should work and now how
do I put the value and currently looping
over I can use or I should use this
which again as a reserved word here by
handlebars - in this block statement
output in this H statement output
current value of well of the current
iteration so let me save it and reload
and I can see one two three here if I
want to rename this or maybe I'll also
want to output the current key I can you
as and then I'm from a pipe sign two
pipe signs and between these pipe signs
I would have value and the key so now I
can say value and if we load this you
see nothing changes this still works and
I could also say well key and unlike
let's say coolant and the value and now
you will see okay the first element
index zero is one second element is two
and third element is free so this is how
you can use the each expression here ah
well these are the very basics about
handlebars as I said you can write your
own helpers we can include partials and
so on and these are all things you can
very easily look up if you want to know
them right now otherwise we'll use
handlebars in the future widgets and you
will never see how to do things like
this very looking forward to seeing in
the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
