now if you watched my last video and you
may be sure to fully understand this one
year you saw that I set up a local
project we're using view Chasse
with the view CLI to have a workflow
using webpack - well be able to build
bigger projects to have a fully
functional workflow which also allows me
to split up my view code over multiple
files you also saw that in his source
folder we get this strange dot view file
here and you learned that this is
basically a file handled by the view
loader by webpack here in the end and
everything is then bundled together in
one file at the end it's a nice tool to
be able to split up our code though in
this dot view file we get three
different sections the template the
script section and styles off generally
apply to the whole app but can also be
scoped to this file here also of this
template and that is a convenient way to
be able to split up our code over
multiple files now in this video I'm
going to have a closer look at how we
can use these files we can split up our
application over multiple files using
components now let's take a closer look
we already have the app dot view file
and I'm first going to get rid of all
the content in there there's standard
content ahead there I'm also getting rid
of the content in my data field here I
don't need the name of this component
kind of I don't need to name it and I
can also strip out all the styling and
yes it's folder where we have this logo
I can also delete that now if we have a
looked as as much leaner and next I want
to create a new component I will do this
by creating a new file and I will give
this file the name of well off the
component in a my component shall have
that's just a naming convention which is
kind of used in the view chess world so
let's say here we wanted to create a
symbol a simple message component so a
message to view file and in this fall
well we need a template template or
something you will always need
in a template we must only have one root
element so let's name it orb let's make
it of type div and then there I want to
simply say this is a great message
whatever you like
so in h1 tag here you could of course
until now also use this h1 tag as the
main element here we don't need two div
as of now since we only have one nested
element now this is this component and I
already had a vision components there we
created it with this view dot component
command and we can still do this however
not in this file instead here in the
main dot JS file I first need to import
my message to view file let me add semi
semicolons because that's the style I'm
using here so I'm using or am importing
message from message dot view now
interesting enough
I'm not exporting anything any message
to view file I don't have a script tag
where I export anything it will work
nonetheless because web page where this
view loaded will do this behind the
scenes for us it as I explained
transforms this template here to
JavaScript code anyways and it will
export it so it can import from this
math should view file now if the message
imported I can simply use the view
component method here again to set up a
new component on my view instance and
give it any selector of my choice like
message or maybe also with a unique
prefix app message for example to make
sure I'm not interfering with any
third-party components I might have or
native HTML elements these second
element then simply is message because
this is my component remember before we
had an object here we will where we
would configure it
well this object is now given to us by
the view loader you could say by
compiling this message dot view file
here now with that I get my component
registered and in the apt of you fall I
can therefore now use app message here
like this like the selector because it
is richest globally now if I go to the
term
No and run npm run def to bring up my
development server again let's take a
closer look as you can see in the
running browser window at localhost 8080
I got this is a great message using my
own component which I outsource any
message dot view file now let's create
an our component let's create the input
dot view file for the input component
there I'll create a number template and
in this template I'll again add a div
and then I want to have an input field
type text here and let's also output
whatever we input here below this input
well we can use two-way binding for this
with we model we model will simply bind
the content we enter here to a data
property and therefore I need to add
such data property there for me to add a
script and here we need to export this
object and this object here is now setup
like a view instance kind of I will show
one important difference which I already
talked about though in the components
video here we set up data as a method
and I can use es6 syntax for that so the
alternative would be data colon function
or just again the shortcut es6 gives me
which I can use here because anavrin
eyes feature off this web pack template
I'm using it will compile es6 code to
es5 so you can use es6 here now with
this setup with this data here i need to
return an object in here which i'll name
message and should be empty at the
beginning now i want to bind my input
here to this message property with the
mall again for two-way binding and
thereafter i can output it in the
paragraph below now i also have to
register this and cue register this I
could of course again added here with
view component in the main dot J's fault
to create a global component or if I
don't know I only am going to use it
here in my message well then I can just
add a script tag here to export an
object here too and add the components
property to adjust or some local
components here
the keys are these electors for example
app input and then the avert the value
would be component itself which of
course have to import so import input
from and then it's from the input dot
view file and I will then assign this as
a value here which enables me of course
to now use app input as an element here
and if I save this and go back using the
input field and if I enter something
there you see hello awesome so with that
we're using this web peg setup these dot
view files to split up our code to
contain each component in its own file
which we then can import instead of
globally and locally next in the next
video I wanna have a look at how we can
use this setup to not only output the
message here in the input component but
also to transfer it to our message
component well let's have a look at this
in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
