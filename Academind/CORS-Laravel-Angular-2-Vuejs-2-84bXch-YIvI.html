connecting lateral to angular 2 or view
J s we already achieved a lot we set up
the back end and we generally also
started setting up the angular 2 front
end but now we're stuck we're getting an
error when trying to get all quotes that
we some are not allowed to access this
because no access control allow
originator is present now this is called
course or this is an issue connected to
chorus and course stands for
cross-origin resource sharing I already
explained this in the last video of this
series you are generally not allowed to
have a different front end and back end
server different domains talking to each
other and here we're serving angle two
from localhost 4200 and we try to reach
out to this domain so we do have two
different domains oftentimes it's kind
of fishy if some average service tries
to access your service therefore it's
denied by default but for api's which
are kind of common today we build a lot
of backends which can connect to all
kinds of front-end mobile apps web apps
and so on in nowadays this is something
we want to enable on our back ends or at
least at the API backends we're building
expressed specifically for that purpose
and we can enable this axis we can kind
of turn off that protection because we
want to turn it off and we have to turn
it off on our back-end so we're leaving
angular 2 now and we'll go back to our
lateral application the application we
built a few videos ago here we got our
routes and now we want to make sure that
we're able to target these routes from a
different domain to do so I will create
a new middle where you can create a new
middleware for level with the artisan
command-line tool so in the level folder
here I'll run PHP artisan make
middleware and I'll name it course
because it's connected to
cross-origin resource sharing problem
we're having in the application we now
got this course PHP file in the middle
aware folder in the app HTTP folder this
is almost empty it only has this handle
method now middleware is basically some
or are some functions which are run on
all requests and responses reaching
level and we can decide if we want to
work with the requests or the response I
will show you how both works so this SD
middleware created and now this will not
be used we have to tell they're able to
use this middleware we do so in the
kernel PHP file and here we can hook up
our own middleware and now you could
think that we add our own middleware to
the API middleware group here because it
makes sense we're having a couple of API
routes in the API PHP file here in the
routes folder and as I explained in
earlier video in this series the
middlewares setup here in the API group
are applied to all routes in the API
folder this would be the right way of
thinking about it but when sending
requests from our client from inner tube
to the server and when those requests
are not get requests but post put and so
on there actually will be an extra
options request sent before that that's
just some feature of your browser you
could say that's the default behavior if
you send a post request your browser
will automatically send an options
request first options kind of tries to
find out which options do I have are am
I allowed to send a post request here
and of course you are allowed but your
browser does know that and to tackle
this extra extra options request which
we can't stop from being created I
actually will add my milla we're not
here in the route group but actually
here in the middle of where array which
basically just means the middleware is
set up in this
ray are applied to all requests not just
the requests reaching out to my API
middleware group and actually it doesn't
even matter because this level
application will only serve as a
back-end anyways and there's nothing
wrong with applying our course
middleware to all requests now as a side
note you can also download some
third-party packages which make it very
easy for you to really fine-tune which
routes should add those course headers
and which route should not here I will
show you the general easy approach so
enough of the talking let's add our
course middleware here in the middle of
where array in the kernel PHP file and
the middleware lives in the app HTTP
middleware namespace and here in the
course file and we need to access the
class so pass this course class as an
element in this array with that now this
handle method will be executed on each
request entering our application and we
get two arguments here the request and a
closure called next next is executed
here and it gets the request as an
argument and this simply means let you
request continue its journey if we don't
call next we will actually stop the
request in our application will
therefore break because the request
doesn't reach the route it should reach
now if we want to change that request we
can do that before returning next
request here so we could set any header
here but I don't want to set a header on
my request I want to add some headers on
the response and we do this by adding
them on the result of this next call
which will actually be our response here
I can access the header method which is
a method level nose which allows me to
add some headers and here we need to add
free headers one header is actually
listed here in the browser access
control
origin this header is missing as the
arrow message so let's simply copy it
add it here as the first argument to the
header method as a string and the second
argument is the value and with star I'm
simply telling the application any
client any other domain may access
well my routes and you could of course
also instead be very specific about
which domain or domain should be able to
access your routes but here every domain
is allowed
I need another header though so header
and our header method chained and this
is called access control allow so with
this start of your header you pretty
much recognize that it is connected to
the course problem X control allow
methods so with methods which methods
are allowed to be sender which HTTP
methods way may we use well I want to
allow get post purge patch delete and
they're important options because this
is this extra request I was talking
about this extra request which is
generated and sent and of course you can
also limit that to D methods you need
and then I'll add a third header here
access control allow headers which
headers may be requests which the client
sends hold and I want to allow the
content type and you could also allow an
authorization header and much more now
with this setup here if I save this the
middleware is set up it is added in the
kernel file let's try getting the quotes
in our front and application again here
you see some quote now it's fetched
successfully because now we're allowing
the access and we're allowing our angle
to application to access our back-end
even though we're having different
domains here now in the next video I
will finish this angle to application
and enable it to also add an
added and delete quotes before we then
continue to view KS see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
