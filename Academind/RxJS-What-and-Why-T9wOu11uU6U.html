with angular chances are high you heard
about rxjs and observables chances are
even higher if you haven't worked with
angular because it's a pretty hot topic
in front-end development right now but
what does it actually mean what is rx
chairs and what are observables how does
it really work in this in the next
videos I'll try to help you on that now
I'm on the official web page our active
X dot io / rxjs and here we have this
very nice explanation rxjs is a library
for reactive programming using
observables to make it easier to compose
a synchronous or callback based code now
do you fully understand what this means
the first time I read this that wasn't
super clear to me so let's just use it
let's understand how it really works for
that we need to install it so let's
click on that and I won't use NPM
because for now I'll stick to a
web-based editor jsbin dot-com to be
precise but later in later videos I will
also show you how to add it to a local
setup for now I'll scroll to the very
bottom to pick a CDN and I'll pick the
bottommost to get the latest version and
here all I have to do is remove a
diversion to get it automatically
replaced with the latest 15.3 in this
case and then I'll go ahead over to
chase be calm you may use chance fertile
if you prefer that for example and here
I will add script in the HTML portion
hits tab to autocomplete this and then
add source and paste in the link I just
copied next I want to add a button here
to the body again by typing button and
hitting tab where let's just say click
me now I want to handle this all go to
the JavaScript portion here and also
edit or open the console so that we can
see whatever I log to it shrink this a
little bit here and I want to get access
to the button so here I'll use document
query selector vanilla JavaScript here
choose selected button and as a side
note I'll be quite honest a comparable
example can be found on the official
page if you click on learn it here I'm
basically just rebuilding these first
examples because they really are
it for understanding it so we got access
to the button and what we can do with
vanilla JavaScript us we can add an
event listener to react to any click so
react on clicks and execute some code
nnj is when i can use es6 code so i'll
use an arrow function here and here i
will actually get an event object and i
could simply lock this so console.log
event like that if i now it control
enter and click click me well we see we
definitely got some object being locked
here quite a lot of code but that is
just the event object in the end so in
the end this is working as I would
expect it to work you see
it's of type Mouse event so that is
working now daddy vanilla JavaScript way
of handling it and there's nothing wrong
with it now let me rebuild this using
our X chairs since I added this import
from the CDN I can basically comment out
this code here and write a new code and
here what I will do is I'll use the rx
package available due to this import
there the observable object and now I
help a method from event which will
create a new observable based on an
event so here the way this works is I
specify the event source so the button
here so where I want to listen to that
event and then the type of the event
here click as a string now with that I
already got one observable but nothing
would happen right now cue react to an
event I need to subscribe to an
observable so we'll execute subscribe
and subscribe actually takes free
functions we can pass here I'm only
interested in the first one year and
that first function gets the event data
again and I can then log it to the
console as before if I hit ctrl enter
and click this button you again see the
event object we saw before so the same
code as before or the same result but
with different code and on the first
look this looks more complicated doesn't
it using the SUBSCRIBE thing and then
this function we pass as an argument to
subscribe
I would we might want to use that
because with observables what you can
already kind of see here we have a
funnel-like set up our event data
travels from top to bottom so from the
data source which is our click event on
the button cue the code we execute in
the SUBSCRIBE function here now here
obviously that funnel is very short
small we only have to subscribe function
but the powerful thing about observables
and why they are so useful and used that
much in angular are the operators which
allow you to transform the way this data
is handled used or looks like immensely
let's say we want to make sure that we
only react to click events once a second
so if I spam this click button we omit
or we drop all event pieces all events
which have more than once a second now
with vanilla JavaScript if we go to the
original documentation scroll down to
flow we can see this would be the code
achieving this we would get the current
date we would then store the last date
and this last click variable we have a
rate which is the milliseconds
difference so this a window of time one
1/2 where any one should only occur once
every would have to check this manually
now with observables we can use a
built-in operator
it's called throttle time you can also
find it here in the official
documentation it takes a number as an
argument and that actually are the
milliseconds we want to have as a time
window you could say so here there could
be 1,000 and if I now it control enter
and I replace the event here maybe with
clicked so that we can actually see this
so I don't use the event data now and I
now hit control enter and then spam
click me you see clicked doesn't get
printed as often as I click the button
it gets printed exactly once a second
and all the other events get emitted
that's your awesome thing about
observables it's so easy to add this
functionality with one of the many many
many useful operators observables offer
and that really is the biggest advantage
of observables this funnel-like approach
which makes it very easy to write
structured statements handling
asynchronous code and the operators we
can use in that funnel to transform the
data for example if I wanted to print
the x-coordinate of the click event I
could output event client X for example
that's just how we can access it this
default property provided to us on that
default event object click event emits
so now it clicked me we see 32 53 and so
on now that's of course nice but let's
say we have more complex code here and
suddenly we decide that we want to use
this client Y variable instead of X now
if we only have one statement it hears
here changing it isn't difficult but
let's say we were using that coordinate
all over the place and many lines of
code then we would have to change it
everywhere well we can simply add
another operator to the party map since
I added after throttle time and since
the order here is important this will
also only receive a new event once a
second and here map now works in a way
that it takes a function as an input
this function y n returns a new
observable it gets the event data or the
observable data I should say as an input
so we could just say data and here what
it does is it has to return something
which will then automatically be wrapped
in a new observable since we can only
subscribe on and observable so map has
to return one so the SUBSCRIBE works
which is called on the result of map in
the end here since we chained it so here
I can return data and then client Y for
example and here and subscribe I know I
get a coordinate which one isn't
important to me here the previous
operators will sort it out and I can
just output coordinate now if I control
enter and clear this this is actually
the y coordinate which you can see since
it gets smaller if I click more on the
well top side of the button and we still
have the throttling in place and we get
the math data that's the power of
operators that's the power of writing
this in a structured way and looking at
it like a funnel and that is how you can
think about rxjs and observables we have
two funnel-like approach for handling
asynchronous code which is really
powerful and which might give you more
features and more power than the normal
vanilla JavaScript or promise using ways
of handling that asynchronous thing
gives you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
