about our ex chairs and observables and
maybe you already created your own
observables and worked with them a bit
you might have noticed that observables
are kind of passive you wrap then you
wrap an HTTP request
you can't trigger the emission of a new
value manually now having that passive
approach might not be what you need in
some cases maybe you want to be able to
emit a new value manually so you want to
use that observable like an event
emitter where you in your code control
then a new value is emitted we can do
this with something which is called a
subject it inherits from the observable
but there we can also call the next
method manually to force it to emit a
new value and therefore we can have a
more active approach of using
observables with subjects now that
doesn't mean that you should always use
subjects just use them if you need to
use something like an event emitter
let's see this in action in jsfiddle I'm
in J's fellow here and all I did is add
an import to the CDN link of rx chairs
which you can find on the official page
at the very bottom make sure to pick the
right version there and here I now want
to create a subject so I can create a
new subject stored in a variable named
subject the name is up to you though and
I use rx
subject however unlike the observable I
now don't call a helper method like
create instead I simply instantiate this
object with the new keyword it basically
is just a constructor now that's my
subject which I can use like an event
emitter now I can set up my observers
but I can save some time by using the
subject like this calling the SUBSCRIBE
method and cue this method I can now
either simply pass an object which has
the next error and complete method and
observer may have or just a list of
these methods so here I will pass a
JavaScript object will call the next
method like this and I know here we'll
get a value and this value well for now
I just want to log it to
console and I will also call or add
arrow function or function excuse me
where I will log any error to the
console like this console log error and
finally what about complete let's add
this to complete this function console
log oops completed now to demonstrate
how this works I'll add more than one
subscription because the great thing
about event emitters is that we could
trigger it from one place in code and
then react to that event in multiple
places so we typically have more than
one subscriber so here I will also
subscribe I don't use complete and error
here to keep it a bit shorter though I
just have next in this subscription now
with that I can add some code below that
where I call subject next keep in mind
subject is the subject I created and now
I can actively call next and emit a new
data piece something like that if I hit
control enter you see a new data piece
twice which makes sense because I have
two subscriptions which both incorporate
the next function if I also call subject
air or air or here you see or maybe
let's clear this you see a new data bees
twice and then error and then the
uncalled error because the second
subscription here doesn't handle the
error case so that is how I can call
error and of course I could also call
complete and don't pass any data here so
let's clear this head control hit
control enter and we see complete and
there we only handle this in the first
observable so it only gets printed once
now that is how we can use a subject and
of course we could call this code in any
other place we could call it once you
click the button we could call it after
timeout finished whatever fits your
needs you decide when you emit a new
value or error or completion with a
subject as a side note if you did
complete it emitting a new value
thereafter new value
that won't work if I now hit
control-enter you don't see new value
because it was completed so it works
like it observable but you can decide
when something happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
