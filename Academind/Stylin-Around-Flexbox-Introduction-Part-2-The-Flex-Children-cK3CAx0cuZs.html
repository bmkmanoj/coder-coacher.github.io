series
where as nother series we focused on the
flexbox container itself in this video
we'll have a look at the children which
live inside such a flax container and
the properties we can provide to them
let's get started one thing I already
showed you in the last video but I'm
going to repeat it nonetheless is the
flag shrink property now if we give her
boxes please note that the Box class is
the class album or children inside the
container app now if we give our boxes
the property of slacks shrink and
provide value other than 0 for example 1
then every box will be allowed to shrink
to fit inside this container so at the
moment as you can see this is no issue
as they're not taking enough space at
the moment anyway but what if we
decrease the size of our container to
let's say 400 pixels 400 pixels now
everything will still be fitted inside
this container even though as you can
see here above in this example the the
normal wave of all boxes would be
broader than the container dimensions so
if we set flex ring to 0 watch what
happens now our boxes will have the same
width as they do in the above example
and therefore they will overlap the
container right so there are no longer
fitted inside and this is what flex
ranked us now I just reset everything
and we're looking at the next example
flex grow so again our box class let's
provide a flex grow of 1 and as you can
see what now happens is that even though
we have specific width provided for each
box these classes here defy the width of
our bar
they will still stretch out and expand
over the full width of our container and
this is because we gave every box a
property of flex crow now as with Flex
rink we don't have to do this for every
box we could also pick some specific box
so let's say I only want box 1 2 flex
crow back box 1 has a class of box 1 in
this example and if I do this now you
will see every color every box keeps its
width I provided what this class is here
except for box 1 which would have as you
could see a class of W small which is
100 pixels but it stretches out to the
size of W big which is three times the
size now we can get us even further if
we go to box 2 which is the broadest box
and give it a flex grow of 2 now you can
see flex 1 has double the size roughly
of its it's normal size we can have a
look at it
it's one point six six times the normal
size and flex 2 has also been increased
now what happened here is that box 1 and
box you got bigger but box 2 takes more
space of the to be filled with space and
this is because we gave it a flexed row
of 2 whereas this only has a flex grow
of 1 and what this means it means us
divided up basically what what flex crew
does is divided up all to be filled with
space the white space here between all
boxes which have to flex grow property
with a positive integer and then it
looks at the relation of these values
you provide here and we pay and what
this numbers say is that box 2
should take twice as much of this
remaining space as box one does and
every word is said word receptors to
eight then you can see box one is bigger
than in the above example but only by a
tiny bit because we talk box two to take
up if you put it this way eight times as
much space of this space here then box
oneness
so that's flex group the next property
is the order property now if I take my
second box here and give it a order of
two it has pushed all the way to the end
of our four boxes now you might think
why is this the case I gave it an order
of two or not four well flexbox doesn't
know how many boxes live in silence flex
containers so order works a little bit
different the number we specify here is
not the position of your occurrence in
inside this box but it is a relative
measure compared to the upper boxes and
by default this number is zero so you
could say all boxes have zero but the
boys too has a value of two that means
zero means leave them the way they
appear in the HTML document in the DOM
and only the the one with the higher
number will be pushed to the end so if
we had box one with a value of order
free you can see that now one us in D
and because of the still highest value
two is the second last element because
it has a second highest value and these
two stay the way they are in this
example here because they don't have any
order provided they have an order of
zero now we can also provide a negative
value here of minus 1 for example now 2
is the first element because minus 1 is
smaller than 0 which these elements you
have and this is why
pushed to the beginning now if we give
this a buddy of mine is free we have the
same order as here even though we don't
use the standard values of zero so you
basically have to think of the order
function as how with numbers you provide
here be ordered and dari would see okay
- freeze the smallest that's the first
one
then comes minus one the second one and
these two have zero and if elements have
the same intention value here they will
just be ordered by the appearance in the
HTML structure so next we're going to
look at the Flex basis property and this
one is a little bit difficult because
not all of it supported values are
actually supported by browsers at the
moment but nonetheless we're gonna have
a look at it
so what flex basis does is it sets the
dimensions of an element now you would
say well I'm doing this with width and
heigh height right and yeah you
basically do and this is why the default
value of Flex basis is auto which says
look at my width and height now we can
also provide a different value here we
could provide measurement value like 100
pixels and now look what happens now all
elements are 100 pixels wide well I just
said you can set width and height here
right not exactly you're setting only
the dimension which is which corresponds
to the direction of your container so as
we got a container of Flex direction of
Rho which means from left to right we're
setting the width here if you were to
change this to column we're setting the
height getters so
you can say flex-space is 100 pixel we
could also say 10% we can basically use
all units we can use in our width and
height properties so we theoretically
also cup the content value which would
mean take as much space as the content
needs and as you can see I can't really
use it at the moment
and this is what I meant it's not fully
supported as of yet but what does work
is setting value add width in pixels or
dimension in pixels and our units like
MS REMS percentages as well as Auto
which is the default now we learn about
flex grow shrink and flex basis and we
can sum them up with two flags property
which first looks at grow property which
means you can set it to one to allow it
to grow as you can see it's already grew
then we can set it to zero to allow it
to shrink and we can set it to a lab to
slogan zone provided dimensions or for
example 100 pixels but there's always a
that worked because we allow it to grow
this would only work if we set this to
zero right okay that's the flex property
now the last property we have is the
align self property and for this to work
I'm just going to remove this and add a
line items property to our a container
you already know this one from the last
video and I'm going to sell it to flex
start now all items are aligned to top
and no longer stretch out now I can set
box free for example to align self flex
and
and now only box free will be aligned to
the end where the other ones are still
aligned to the top of the box of the
container so basically an alliance elf
allows you to overwrite the setting of a
line items for individual children and
that's basically all about children
properties in on flexbox environment
you learn about Flex grow shrink bases
the combined flex property and now align
itself and with these properties as well
as the other stuff we learn about the
Flex container itself you should really
be able to make cool-looking flexible
layouts and we're actually gonna do this
and one of my upcoming syriza's and I'm
really looking forward to that so I hope
you enjoyed it please leave some
feedback and I will see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
