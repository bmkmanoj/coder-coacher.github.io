video I just want to say honestly thank
you thank you thank you and thank you
this has been an amazing month and I
don't even know what to say I i started
this channel or I start filling it with
first videos where I tried out different
things like two months ago and now I
have 1000 subscribers and that's that so
awesome I I don't know what to say I'm
really thankful and I am just happy that
I seem to do things that other people
like you like and that's the coolest
thing you can do in your life i guess so
i really enjoyed this and obviously i'm
also pretty happy how well my udemy
courses started off and this all allows
me to focus more on producing these
videos on delivering this content and i
got so many ideas my head's gonna
explode but i'll try to to sort that and
i'm so excited on what I will bring out
in this channel in the next weeks and
months because I get a lot of plans and
i finally got more time to do that so i
hope you were excited like i am stick
with me check out all the videos that
will come and i will upload or at the
moment your watch it is there should be
an extra video where i go into a little
bit more detail on what's coming up
additionally i don't want to be the only
one celebrating this so i thought the
least I could do right now is prolong
the udemy coupon promotion so you're
still getting my courses for twelve
dollars because I want to make it
possible for everyone to join those
courses if he likes it and as I said I
got many plans for this channel I'm
looking forward to that and I'll see you
new videos heaven I say bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
