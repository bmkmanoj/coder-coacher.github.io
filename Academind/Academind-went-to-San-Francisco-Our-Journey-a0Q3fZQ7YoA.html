no like just a San Francisco right there
is some mist and stuff but I mean come
on yeah just go okay okay welcome to San
Francisco
so you got some impressions about San
Francisco but we're not just here for
some siding or also attending during me
life so let's head to the
around iMac and many of my humanity so
I'm actually not a what you would be
learned in college without Todd what
people
stomachs and where are we now
well dig we got an appointment at
you
and Max regrets out here in San
Francisco at the Google office to talk
about Barbies I'm super excited that you
could come out here to chat yes thanks
so much for having us here this is an
awesome opportunity and
so where are we driving yeah I have no
idea which rope is this by the way but
we are heading towards the Golden Gate
Bridge which you can see over there by
the way and thankfully can see right
here thankfully we get the car we wanted
right because we will it like whatever
you want yeah we wanted exactly that car
going to have a Mustang yep
that's amore see this master yeah it is
this is the first time we are now
together driving over the Golden Gate
Bridge here is our Mustang by the way
that's interesting okay
I won't walk through there
will you don't want it do okay honestly
let me try somewhere else I don't like
that again
so M this is Facebook
a doctor does that look like Facebook
please did you expect it to look like
that
it looks really unimpressed if I guess
but you can told us that it wouldn't
look like super impressive but let's
let's go a little bit closer and see how
it actually looks like I expected more
and more fancy and more blue I don't
know yeah that's true Oh max what is
that now refuge over campus that's the
Android version statue garden let's take
a closer look
the
tonight we now we're at Facebook and not
Google so what's your impression Google
cooler no you Google campus looks way
more friendly in my opinion Facebook
campus was really not that beautiful and
here at least something to recall to
report so I prefer Google just like in
real life
yeah I can confirm that except for maybe
what's happening to Greenwich of
Reginald for Facebook class so next up
would be then well you will see yeah
that's good
obviously you can't with it because
Willy without going to Facebook Google
and Apple so here we are at the Apple
headquarters Cupertino honestly not
super impressive like the other
buildings just Norfolk after all they do
have an apple store and it's quite nice
looking gets nice to work here too
so that's Apple
and Stanford like the escutcheon gun I
know you but you're everything I wanted
to my god
so other thing about the size of the
campus in this place out here it's a bit
bigger than University I studied at
if you ever need a helper hey you should
know better be there nobody help love
you
I'm here just to elevate
and I just wanna
connectives our last evening now in San
Francisco you look kind of rare Oh some
happens it's funny because we took the
ferry today right right we didn't
consider it the Sun was kind of shining
didn't do that but it was a great cruise
across the bay so that has a problem a
thing but there is somebody talking
about here different thing
oh you look beautiful so I have to ask
them to focus on total yeah what's a
great dress but I did a lot there's been
great time a duty me had a great time at
Google had a great time as if it's
obscured to the office city looking back
to getting back to work but it was
really nice how did you like it so he
knows about the first time in San
Francisco and although my head is kind
of red because it's the funk today I
alternated it was really amazing it
looks great to be here and it was great
to be a duty me it was great to drive
around and yes somehow it was also great
