new topic on this channel
ionic q a framework which allows you to
use your angular 2 knowledge which you
probably use to create web apps to build
native mobile apps with it these are
apps running natively on iOS or Android
devices sounds awesome it is this is
what we're going to build in this first
basic video we're going to enhance this
app in the next video of this mini
series here this app allows us to add a
new place and for example this could be
to spread river and Berlin and then you
can see it here on the front page add it
to this list and with this we could add
another place like let's say the
englischer garten a nice park in munich
now these are places added and watch
this might look like a very simple app
it covers a lot of the key concepts
ionic to offers like how navigation
works how you add components how you
store your data and how you can use
angler asyou to create such a mobile app
now if you want to learn much more about
ionic you right now have a look at my
full over 14 hours 5 star rated course
on udemy which you can get with a huge
discount by following the link in the
video description if you're not
interested in this well just stick
around and we will build this simple app
and enhance it in the next video with
some native device features adding
Google Maps to it and more so let's dive
into this
to get started with our ionic 2
application we're going to build we need
to install the ionic CLI this is a tool
which makes it easy to create new ionic
projects and manage them first now for
this you will need node jf installed on
your machine simply because this seal I
use this notes package manager to manage
the dependencies and all the node.js
itself to spin up a nice little
development server which hosts your app
might sound strange since it's a mobile
app yet but you will see what I mean in
a second so make sure that you have
noches installed and then you should
install globally on your machine with
NPM install - gee you should install
ionic and Cordova now Cordova is the
framework which will handle the web app
to native app compilation step and ionic
as the framework which creates the web
app which gives you a lot of nice
components and features to use which
makes creating a nice looking mobile app
very simple and it will also give you an
easy tool to have all in one workflow
which will compile your app your angular
app to a mobile app first and then to a
native app through Cordova so you don't
have to use Cordova directly now on a
Mac and Linux you probably need to put
sudo in front of this for this to work
on Windows you probably don't and I just
enter my password and now just we'll run
it through and we'll install both
packages globally on my machine now I'll
be back once this finishes and then
we're ready to create our first
application our ionic project the
installation of those textures finishes
for me and as a next step you should
navigate into the folder where you want
to locate your ionic project now I
already am in such a folder make sure
you go there to in the terminal and then
you can simply run ionic start to create
a new ionic project then you specify
your project name and I will name it my
places since this will be the name of
the app we create here then you can also
choose which template to use
I
we'll start with a blank template other
options would be tabs to start with some
tabs at the bottom or side menu to start
with a side menu and then they're
important at - there should be two -
make sure it's anionic - project and not
ionic one now with this you just hit
enter and this will now pull down the
blank template and set up the project
for you well as it says here this may
take a couple of minutes so I'll be back
once this is finished - okay so do the
app setup finish for me here so next I
can navigate in today's newly created
folder and there we can simply run ionic
serve and this will now do something
very interesting it will spin up a
development server or first of all it
will compile our angular q code to a web
app and there is some basic in order to
code with which this blank project ships
with but then it will spin up this
development server and it should
automatically open up a tab in your
browser this su tab it should open if it
doesn't make sure you navigate to local
host a 2100 or whichever hosted mentions
down here manually now here you see your
app and this now certainly sounds
strange because you probably imagine
that you create a native mobile app with
ionic and you kind of do you can now
easily compile this to a mobile app but
right now it only is a web app looking
like a mobile app and behaving like a
mobile app they'll of course some
features like the device camera will not
be available here it is a great mode for
testing your app and actually it is the
only mode I will use here because
compiling it to a native app thereafter
is really simple for development most of
the time this is all you need of course
you will need a real device if you want
to test some built-in features like the
camera now it still looks strange though
having it I could put on the full width
of a screen like this now that's not
really how a mobile app looks like
therefore in Chrome and I recommend
chrome for this you can open up the
developer tools and there if you click
on this button which which looks like a
mobile phone
tablet toggle device toolbar it says if
you click on this you now view this app
like running in a mobile device and this
works with any webpage not just with
ionic you project you cannot shoot your
device here like the iPhone 6
make sure to reload the page if you do
change it though and you will now view
it how it would look like on such a
device and it will also switch to the
right beam so material design for
Android devices and the iOS design for
iPhones and this is pretty awesome and
as I mentioned this is how I will
develop this app testing it in this view
now with this you see we got some
boilerplate code or some text here
basically that's just the starting text
II blank project ships with we will of
course change this to adjust to our
needs and to not work with that anymore
now as I mentioned I want to create an
app of simple app which allows the user
to add some places basically the place
where he currently is at and well store
it in this app does all I want you to do
very simple now for that let's open this
app in an editor and start working on it
I open the app and webstorm the editor
of my choice I still have this process
this ionic search process running here
and you should keep it running because
it will automatically recompile your
code and reload your webpage whenever
you change something so very useful
without this running you won't see your
changes reflected in your app and
actually you won't see that app running
the browser here either
now with that I opened it here and you
see we get a couple of different folders
and files now I won't walk through them
in high detail basically the most
important folder for apps of the source
folder which is where we store our
source code and where we basically write
our app now the other folders node
modules manages our dependencies
platforms management key platforms you
can build the app for and you can add
platforms through the ionic CLI you can
find more information on this in the
official documentation to which you will
find a link in the video description if
you want to do want to dive deeper into
this plugins that is
important if you want to use some
built-in device features resources here
you can store some icons and splash
screens you want to use for your app
when you create it and the www folder
hold your web app so that's in between
step between the source folder which
stores the angular app and the native
mobile app created through Cordova in
the end so again we'll focus on the
source folder here and then there it's
the app folder which contains our main
component the app component which gets
started and then we have this pages
folder here too now the pages folder is
the key folder for an ionic app because
my ionic app basically consists of
multiple pages now what you see here is
a page it's the only page we have thus
far but it is a page and therefore it
makes sense that we find this home
component as you can see if you click
into the typescript file and it has this
decorator so this is what we can see
this home component here in the pages
folder
each ionic page is just the angular
component it's just called page because
logically ionic to this framework
manages a stack of such pages for you I
will come back to this so this is key
component the only component we actually
see right now besides the root component
which is only responsible for starting
up our application and initializing the
ionic to navigation the ionic to
navigation that's something else which
is very important if you have a look at
your app component template you see that
it only has this iron nav element
whether you somehow seem to define some
root page root page refers to the root
page property in our app component here
and in the end it stores a reference to
this home page so this sample seems to
be responsible for loading this home
page at the start and it does it's
important to understand how ionic to
navigation works the ionic tube rain
Burak manages all the navigation for you
and it does so by managing a stack of
pages this means that you have a couple
of different pages in this case only one
but you could have more and you always
view the topmost page
on this stack of pages ioniq you manages
for you and if you change your page you
simply push it on top of this stack so
then this will be the page you view and
of course you can go back by popping off
a page removing it from the top of the
stack and again since you always view
the topmost page this means you will see
the page below it and this management of
the stack of pages is done for you by
ionic you now that is all which happens
here in the app component this stack of
pages gets initialized by implementing
this built in this component here iron
app with which ionic you ships which
initializes the stack of pages therefore
we basically say hey the bottom most
page should be the root page or the page
stored in this root page property which
again is this home page so we pop off
all other pages we have non right now
but if we were to have multiple pages we
could only go fds to the home page which
is our base page or well home page off
yet now enough up there about those
pages let's add some new pages to see
how we can play around with that feature
now I will add new pages through the
ionic CLI and for this I will open up my
terminal in my IDE this is a normal
terminal window and there I can use the
ionic CLI again to create a new page by
using the generate command and want to
generate a page and this page should be
called new place because I want to have
a page where the user is able to add a
new place to his collection of places I
will simply hit enter and this will
store or will create a new folder in the
pages folder
didn't you place folder which in the end
simply will again hold my typescript
file the template and if you wondered
this s CSS files course holds to styling
for this page ionic just happens to use
s CSS but you can write normal CSS code
in there what important note you don't
have to add adhere to your style URL
property in your component decorator yet
like you would have to
normal angular app here it uses a
different system it uses the SPSS
feature of nesting styles or selectors
and it always ships with this base
selector which is the selector of the
page you created like your page new
place it's just a selector of this page
as you can see here and therefore any
Styles you write inside of this outer
selector and this is important a styles
which go in there will automatically be
only applied to this pages template so
it's using a CSS instead of the angular
model of attaching Styles you could use
the angular way of doing it I will stick
to D both in SPSS way now with this new
page added in the template of this page
I will remove this comment at the top
and I will change title to add place
maybe and then there in the content I
will for now simply add a new paragraph
where it say add a place however we will
change this later on now we get a new
page it would be nice to view it now so
let's go back to our home page our home
template and there in the template I
will remove all the content and I will
add a button now this button should say
add a place and I will change this later
too
and when we click this button I want to
load this new page and I actually will
add a click listener for this and say on
load new place or whatever you want to
say and this method now of course needs
to be implemented in the typescript file
of the home page so there I will add
this method and I want to go to this new
place page we just added important make
sure to also add it to your app module
the CLI does not do this automatically
so here we should add the new place page
and also add the import at the top and
add a to entry components now entry
components this might be something you
don't know from your normal angular app
there you really need an tree
because this is an array where you
inform angular about the components
you're about to load normally you don't
need to inform angular because you
either load components by adding them in
another template through their selector
or by loading them through the angular
router now both is not the case here
we're not using the angular router we
don't use it by default in an ionic app
and we're not using this page by
selector instead as you will see in a
second we load it differently through a
concept introduced by the ionic tube
framework therefore angular is not able
to detect that we're about to load it
and obviously single reason why we have
to add it here in the entry components
we inform angular
hey this page is about to be loaded you
won't see it coming but it will happen
back to the it will happen thing how
does it happen back to the home type
script file where we added this method I
just mentioned that we will use a
concept introduced by ionic 2 to load a
new page and this concept uses this
stack of pages now this stack of pages
if managed through a navigation
controller and conveniently it's already
injected here by default by the copy use
this boilerplate this blank template
into our home types books file if it
were not make sure that you add this
injection give it any name you like but
make sure it's of type nav controller
which needs to be imported from ionic
angular now with this injected here what
you can do is you can now access the
snap controller and there you have a
push method remember that I told you
that we have the stack of pages where
you push new pages or pop them off the
stack well here we're on the Porsche new
pages part I push a new page and the
page I wanna push is my new place page
and you simply push a reference to this
page which gets imported here at the top
make sure to add this import with this
and place
we should now see something if we click
this button so save this project keep in
mind we still have this ionic serve
project process running automatically
recompiling our app and therefore we now
see this button if you click the button
we indeed go to the new page to our add
a place page and we also automatically
get this back button which you can press
to go back this is all managed by ionic
you this is this stack of pages concept
of navigation concept ionic 2 introduces
now this button clearly doesn't look
very pretty we can change this by going
back to the home template and in there I
will add the iron button directive which
basically tells ionic you hey treat this
as a button and give it a nice look too
and by simply adding this directive a
just looks now much better now we still
get the same behavior but a nice-looking
button so we get this possibility of
going to the place however having this
button right here it's not super pretty
it would be nice to have a plus I can
here in the menu bar at the top which we
could click and then go to the new place
page and what we are done adding a place
we're taken back to this main page here
and there we see what a list of all our
places for example so well let's work on
this and you add such a plus I will
first of all remove this this but here
in my template like this and go to the
menu bar give it another title like
awesome places maybe and then in the
iron mask for element and I met for is
as all elements starting with I and -
element a component ionic you ships with
now this is responsible for rendering
the navbar which is also the place where
ionic 2 will automatically add the back
button and here we get the iron buttons
element we can add another built-in
component in is buttons we simply add a
button with the iron button direct
and we give this any text you want or in
this case not a text but instead I can
now let's visit the ionic to dogs which
are some great dogs and you should
definitely have a look at them if you're
looking for a specific component because
as you can see if you click on
components there are a lot of components
there also are some built-in icons which
you can find down here under ion icons
and here you can see a list of icons you
can use in any ionic you app like the
add icon which is the I can we need so I
will simply open this and you can also
see how to use it and let me just copy
this code here so we basically use this
built in ion icon component and back in
my button I will add this inside of the
button element so this button will now
hold on icon therefore I will add the
icon only directive to the button which
males will make sure that the styling is
alright now we should have a plus button
and if we have a look at our running app
we need see it here however I want to
have it on the right the nice thing is
with the IL buttons wrapper we can add a
end directive we could also add start
and started and just define where it
should be positioned now end is not
necessarily on the right it depends on
the platform this app is running on for
iOS it will be on the right if you want
to force this to be on the right you
would have to add the right directive
but again
I will stick to the interactive to use
the platform specific definition of
where the end of this menu bar is well
animal days you see it's on the right of
course nothing happens if I click it
because I haven't added the click
listener so let me quickly add this
again by adding well click and then
target the on how did I call it unload
new place method we implemented a while
ago although not here but to the button
this is important add to the bottom of
the icon so a
if this reloads now and we click on this
you see it's working again but now
through the plus icon in our menu bar
this is an important first step and you
already learned a lot about how
navigation works and how you can switch
between pages now let's add a basic a
very simple form which allows the user
to define a new place then store it in a
service for now and display it on the
front page we will improve this later on
now for this I will go to my new place
HTML file and in there I want you render
a form now this means I will add the
form element built in HTML element
remove the action though because I don't
want to send an HTTP request inside of
this form I now want to have my form
fields and I will enhance this but for
now I only want to have a title now
since this is all I want I will add iron
item this is a wrapper which will make
sure that my title looks all right
and I will add iron label where I will
say title and then I will add iron input
again if you want to learn more about
all the available components I want to
choose ships with make sure you have a
look at this components documentation
and they're under inputs for example you
find how to style the inputs differently
which options you have how to implement
different types of inputs and so on now
I will go with a very simple one where I
will simply make this of type text so
like a normal HTML input just well using
this building I and input which acts as
a wrapper you could say and if I now
save this let's have a look at our page
this looks alright I can enter some
information here of course also want to
add a button in this form so below my
iron item here I will quickly add a
normal button with the iron button
directives though and there I will also
add another directive the block
directive which will basically make sure
that the
spans the full width of my view here I
will simply say create or no let's say
add place this button your should also
have a type of submit because it should
in the end submit this form whoops here
so this is now the button allowing me to
submit the form and on this I and input
I will now add a name title because it
holds the title of this place and
ngmodel because I want to use the
template driven approach this is vanilla
angular two you could say has nothing to
do with ionic two I'm using the template
driven approach angular 2 offers me when
it comes to while you're doing my forms
and reading the values in my force so
this now retrieves or allows me to
retrieve the title property the form
object in JavaScript is created
automatically by angular all I have to
do is I have to add the ng submit
listener on my form object also provided
by angular cube and or angular in
general and on this listener I want to
execute the on add place method so since
this is using the data security template
driven approach I also want to pass the
form and I can get access by placing a
local reference on this form element and
then setting this equal to ng form this
will give me access to the form object
created by angular in the background and
I can simply pass form value cutest on
add place method and well as a little
enhancement I'll add the disabled
property binding to my button and
disable the button as long as the form
is not valid so by checking if not full
valid so this will disable the button
and I will add a new required arm
directive here or attribute to design
input queue add this required validator
to my angular form
so with that I'll implement the on add
place method in my component
and there you see our already got a
couple of boiler blades so I will remove
the comment here at the top this was all
added because we use the ionic CLI to
generate this page I will remove this
does hook here this lifecycle hook and
it will also remove the two injected arm
things here features of anionic because
I want you add them manually if I need
them so in on that place I know that I
will get my form value and this value
will be a JavaScript object which will
only hold at idle which is of type
string I know it is because my form has
this title field and no other input so
with this I will get this value object
now I want you add this place I want to
store this place and for this I will
create a service I will create a new
folder in my ionic you project I will
name it services and then there I will
treat a new file which I will simply
name places and now you could name it
place about service of he has to follow
this angular naming convention or you
could argue since a displaced in the
services folder anyway anyways you could
omit the service part here I will leave
it in there so I will simply hit OK and
now in this service I will or in this
file or export a class named not under
recipes places service and there I want
to manage my places now I will add a
places property maybe make this private
private places and now this should hold
an array of places and for now a place
should be a JavaScript object which has
a title of type string and again it's an
array of such places at the beginning
it's an empty array though so this part
here is only the type definition if
you're confused what this means again
I'm just defining the displaces property
should store an array of JavaScript
objects which only have a title which
will be of type string now then I want
you add a method which says add place
where I know it will receive a new place
which again
the title of type string which will
access my places array and push this new
place on it and I will have a get places
method here I simply want to return this
places or maybe return this places slice
like this which will create a copy of
this array make sure that I don't return
a reference to the same place in memory
but a brand new array object so that
this is really a private property
because otherwise you would be able to
well change this places array will
return here and change this places array
in there too we prevent this from
happening by slicing it entirely and
therefore creating a copy so we get this
place of service and app module I should
provide it so that we can access it
application wide so any providers array
I will add my places service reference
and import place of service at the top
here and now with this in place a lot of
places right with this in place I will
go back to my new place type script file
and then check this place of service so
here my places service of type place of
service make sure to add the import
allows me to well be accessed here place
of service and call add place and I will
simply pass value because again a place
right now is only an object of a title
of type string well this is just what
value is so this should allow me to
store it in the places service of course
you also want to view it and let's view
it on our home page now to view it there
too to start simple I'll go to my type
script file inject my places service
there cue place a service make sure to
add the import and what this injected I
now want to get all those places
now retrieving them is not super simple
actually because if I were to retrieve
them in a constructor this would not be
stated whenever we rerender the view now
a better place to fetch our places is
might be ng Odin you could say but
they're still NGO dinh it is only
executed when this component is
initialized however when we go to add a
new place this new place page is pushed
on top of the stack but the old place so
- - the old page D home page it's not
destroyed so it will not be recreated
whenever we return to this page that of
course means that if our place has
changed whilst we have been away on the
add a new place page for example and
then we go back we won't see our new
place being added be reflected in this
home page so this won't work either now
a nice solution would be to use one of
Jana Q's built-in hooks I on view will
enter there are a couple of these hooks
and you can learn more about them in the
official documentation under API and
there if you scroll down to nap
controller you can if you scroll down
there Q learn more about how to use the
controller how to work with the
navigation in general and then how you
can hook into specific events for
example will enter is executed whenever
this page is about to enter no matter if
it was still cached still on the stack
of pages or if it was destroyed and
recreated so I am you will enter sounds
like the perfect place to load our
places that means I will add my own
property here places in the home page
which again is an object which looks
like this and yes you could create an
interface and outsourced there I will
come back to this later now for now this
is my places array and this means that
here in I'm you will enter which is
executed whatever just page enters I can
WIPs set my places here equal to the
places I get from the place of service
with the get places method
this should now ensure that whenever we
view this page we update it now with
that in the home dot HTML file for now I
will create a simple unordered list we
will improve this and I will loop
through all my places with ng4 so let's
place all places and remember this is
just an object with a title property so
I can say price play a place title here
to output the title of each place again
we will improve this visually later now
with this in place of place again let's
save this let's go back to the app and
add a new place test ok nothing happens
because we don't do anything else than
adding it when we click this button but
if we go back we did see it here and if
I add another place the same is the case
so this works now remaining steps for
this videos for this video are I want
you have this list look nicer and I want
you to navigate back automatically when
I click add place well let's start with
navigate back part a new place in this
component here when we add a new place I
want to go back to the home page well I
already told you that you manage your
stack of pages by pushing and popping
now pushing is not what we need here I
don't want to push the home page instead
the home page is below our current page
so to get there we need to pop the
topmost page so for this I will simply
inject my nav controller again give it
any name you like but make sure it's of
type nav controller
and make sure to import nav controller
from ionic angular up there now with
this I can simply use nav controller and
call the pop method to do just that to
pop the current page of the stack and we
should be able to see this every let our
app reload of course all our places will
be lost because you own only store them
in a service for now if I add a new
place we're taken back instantly awesome
now let's improve how this looks how
does list looks and if we have a look at
our document
in the components you see that lists are
such a common thing they have their own
components we can use and I will only
create a basic list but again you can
dive deeper into this documentation here
and learn more about lists so here we
can see how to create such a list item
though this one would hold a clickable
one I don't need that but the theory is
the same in my home template I will
remove the unordered list here this HTML
element instead I will add the iron list
wrapper component shipping with ionic
Cube and I will add I an item in there
now this iron item is what I want to
replicate with the for loop so that
place of places should replicate it and
then in there well I will simply output
place title and again consult the
official documentation to learn how you
can enhance that you can create complex
items with multiple lines and headings
and much more again I will keep keep it
simple have such a list and if we now
return to the app and add like a
favorite place like for example in
Berlin the spray that's a river in
Berlin you see this looks alright now
let's add a favorite place from Munich
which would be the English a garden
English garden a big park there looks
alright we have our places here we have
a nice-looking list we got a basic
application now there are things we can
improve though we're storing the places
in a service which means whenever we
reload the page we restart the app they
will be lost we should use some
persistent storage instead additionally
since we're talking about places
wouldn't it be nice if we had Google
Maps integrated on our app and could
well let's say could get get the place
we're currently at using a native device
feature locating ourselves and then
displaying this place on the app that
would be cool so in order to implement
this feature I will
- - adding third-party packages using
native device features and using native
device storage in the next video on
ionic you hopefully see you there if you
want to learn much more about ionic 2
also consider the course I was
mentioning at the beginning of this
video so see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
