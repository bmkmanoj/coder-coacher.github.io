closer look at a specific rx shares
operator for this video I picked the
filter operator which is really
interesting and which as the name
implies allows us to filter out some of
the values which are emitted by an
observable so here we get a stream of
data emitted by that observable and we
get the observer with the next functions
on and right now all values meet the
next function in our subscription year
of course time to stop that and to add
our filter operator now the filter
operator takes a function as an argument
and this function defines whether a data
piece one of these values is allowed to
continue its journey or not so all
values reach the operator of course but
thereafter only some may get to the next
function let's say these two the other
don't make it through the filter because
they don't satisfy the condition we set
up there so these two then continue to
the next function the rest the other
events are just dropped now let's take a
closer look at this in a real example in
jsfiddle so here in jsfiddle i only have
a script import which imports RX chairs
from the installation page at the very
bottom using the CDN make sure to use
the right version there and then I want
to use the filter function so for that
we obviously need an observable so I
will create a new observable and I will
use the our X J's package observable and
then the interval method because I want
to emit a new ascending number every
second let's say so I'll bring this to a
new line this will automatically give me
such number every second that's a very
convenient way of creating a simple
observable now in is observable I were
on is observable I obviously want to
subscribe so I can directly use it
observable call the SUBSCRIBE method and
pass my observer to it I could have
stored your server in a variable before
but I will just pass it as an object
with the next function which obviously
receives the value and as an hour video
issue I just want to lock the value now
I'll also add the error function
here where I get any error I might
receive and where I will then simply log
error and then also the error object or
whatever I get here I won't add complete
because interval here can't be completed
it will keep on omitting values until
our app is done so this is our
observable here this is our observer
being subscribed to it now let's use the
filter operator the filter operator
works like that I nest it where I move
it in between my observable and the
SUBSCRIBE function as we do for all
operators because they should run before
we subscribe to it so that we subscribe
to the changed value and now filter as
explained gets a function where we
receive the value and actually decides
this function where we will soon move
our code you want to execute you could
pass a second argument which defines
what this that this keyword will refer
to inside of this function so if I pass
this here I could ensure that if I call
this inside of the function body I'm
referring to this outside of it
confusing maybe check some video
tutorials on this and JavaScript it can
be tricky now I don't need the second
argument here since I won't use this
instead all I want to do here is I want
to return whether or not the value we
get in this iteration in this function
hole here should be allowed to continue
or not therefore what filter has
returned
it's just drew or false and our X chess
will do the rest if it is true our X
chairs will use the value we passed into
the function and allow its journey and
if we change the value inside of this
function that won't matter it will take
the original value if we return false
our x chess will drop the value so here
I want to return well as I said true or
false because hard-coded but that would
be a bit boring instead since I know
that value will be an incrementing
integer I want to return
in value modulus two equals zero which
basically is a check to determine
whether it's an even number because
modulus gives us the remainder of
division and if that is zero it was an
even number if that is anything else it
was an odd number
if I hit control enter now we indeed see
zero then we see two receive four we
don't see the odd numbers and that is
simply due to our filter also recognize
that error isn't called for the other
numbers otherwise you would see error or
something on the right because it's not
an error it's just a drop filter won't
flow an error for any elements it
filters out and that's the case for all
operators they don't give us an error
here they simply just drop the value
that is how we can use filter and of
course you can have way more complex
conditions in there you could check
anything you could do whatever you need
to do to determine whether this value
should be allowed to continue or not you
don't even have to use the value in your
condition but most of the time you will
probably do that because why would you
care about the value otherwise I hope
this was helpful see you in our videos
maybe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
