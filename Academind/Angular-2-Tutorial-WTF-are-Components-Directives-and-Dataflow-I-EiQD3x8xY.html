which get the most interest on this
channel are those about components and
data binding now that's no surprise
because components and the way we bind
to them and how data binding works
knowing that you is one vastly different
to angular one and secondly it's the
core of this language if you want to put
it that way we will create our whole
application by putting together
components in the end so I thought it
would be nice to have a special video
dedicated to just this topic and show
who you can nest components within each
other and then bind data and let the
data flow through those components to
also show that unidirectional data flow
we have an angular 2 so let's get
started ok here we are first of all I
increase the font size a little bit so
it hopefully it's a bit easier to read
now I'm sorry for any inconvenience and
if you weren't able to completely follow
along I recommend you try be watching it
on a desktop PC and from now on I'll
take care of that the font sizes
appropriately sized now as you can see
in my browser here I got a little demo
app running and this app basically is
there to demonstrate how we can combine
components and how we can nest them and
how we can let data flow through those
components now designing web setting
components isn't really a new abroach
right because well if at least your
writings on CSN is s and HTML you've
been dividing up your web page in
components and since years you have your
header you have your main section where
you might have a safe sidebar and then a
Content section where you will have
articles and then you have your footer
that are sections and if you come from
let's say server-side language like PHP
you probably used templating engine very
would also create your website from
different components so therefore I find
that that angular 2 follows are very
logical and in
if approached by using their components
now what is a component a component is
basically a directive which also has a
view or a template which will be
rendered to the screen so like let's say
the ng-if directive is a directive the
component we create is also a directive
the app component our route component
for example now the MGF directive
doesn't have a few attach to it yes it
might change the document due to the
condition it has attached to it but it
won't add something new or it won't
really render a complete view it will
just change something which we define in
another template depending on a
condition whereas a component has its
complete own template attached to it and
this will be rendered to the screen so
in this case I got my master component
here with this light lemon yellow
background color and this master
component if we have a look at it well
it has a selector of master component
and here's the template that's what will
be rendered to the view the template is
to having this input field and the
button here and that those two
components here now we can already see
an advantage of this component approach
I'm reusing components here I'm reusing
my level 1 component within my master
component so my master component
template here I got one level one
component two level 1 components and
those components that that's one of the
same component namely the level of one
component I defined here increase the
font size a little bit more so here I
have my level 1 component and this
component it has a level 2 component
nested inside it now that level 2
component in the end is let's say the
ending point of our journey and it only
has an input field and a button so
that's how we nest components and how we
reuse components and how we can put
together our website from the different
components we created so can really
create a toolbox so to say with all the
functionalities we need an our page and
then we just add them together
and through data-binding we have a
powerful means to connect those
components and yet to make sure that not
each component is a separate part
standing for its own and having nothing
to do with the other components but
instead else at connecting them with
them now when it comes to that
connection
it's very important to to plan your app
correctly because in general dataflow
flow in and angular 2 is unidirectional
and it always froze flows from parent to
child to child to child so we get it
from top to bottom and we can implement
something to have a flow from bottom to
top but that will only be possible
through events so the general data flow
is from top to bottom I can demonstrate
you this in this example here let me
enter some some text here in my master
component and then click the Change
button you now see every text field here
changed why is that the case in my
master component I have to change button
this button has a click event attached
to it which we call the unchanged method
I pass the value of the text input and
text input is just a local variable I
created here and attached to this input
if you're not sure about the data
binding syntax with the parentheses here
and what a local variable is I strongly
recommend you check out my channel on my
whole tutorial 0 series I have an
angular 2 which is still growing where I
will go much more into detail regarding
that concepts so back to this I call
this unchanged method here which gets
the value which is just the value of our
input field here from that local
variable where we access the value and
then I set my property text which I get
here equal to that value
now that property text is bound to my
input text here but I won't need it as
if now that would work even without that
binding here more it is bound to
that text directive I have on my level
one component so I have it on both level
1 components I'm using my text directive
to pass the text property so the text
and quotation marks refers to the text
property whereas the text in the square
brackets refers to the text directive
which I created in the level of one
component now might be bit confusing but
in the end it's always to read this way
this is let's say that the selector of
Ayad our directive and this is what we
what we pass or what what happens so to
say let's have a look at our level 1
component that is where we pass the data
through this text and square brackets
now in the level 1 component I have
defined that this component can receive
inputs through that square bracket
syntax off in this case only the text I
defined the text directive here this
line defines it this makes it available
in the master room component to use the
square bracket text I can't enter what I
want I can't enter test here and try to
pass something because test is defined
here on the on the level 1 component I
only define text so let me get rid of
that so that we don't get an error now
that means okay I can receive some data
bound to the text directive now what do
I do with this data I just use it it is
automatically bound to the text property
here so those names have to match if
they don't I have to provide an alias
that's possible but in this case I'll
leave it that way so property with the
name text matches always to an input
which has the name text which then again
has to be matched here so if I were to
change this to text too for example I
would have to change
here and then here our Vice the who
binding would break but I'll just reword
that so I bound to this text property
now through this inputs element which on
the same time allowed me to use the
square bracket syntax and sense data to
that component and that is why out of
the box without any of that code we'll
come to that soon it works that if I
entered a text here and change it it
will flow to all my components just
because of that and that and then the
fact that I bind my input element to
that text property here I said to value
to the value of the text property
otherwise I wouldn't display
automatically the data would still flow
into the template but we wouldn't see it
here because we wouldn't output it
anyplace now I got the same procedure
again I get this on change method here
and when I click on it it will change
the text value as the text property to
the value just like we did in a master
component it also does one other thing
it emits and it went here we'll have a
look at this in a second let me first
come back to how the data gets passed to
the level two component as I said when
we click on change we set this text and
it is also this text property and it has
also set due to the fact that we pass it
from the master component so those both
actions kind of set this text property
here now I'm also passing it to the
level two component exactly the same way
I passed from the master to the text one
or level one and now passing it to level
two and there for level two I have also
my inputs and my text property which
again has to match and then I out put it
in my element in my input element here
and that's why if I change it in the
master it automatically fuse flows
through all children because it gets set
here this automatically is where it is
to this level to text directive and
therefore it automatically flows through
to the text to so that is the parent to
try to child data flew I talked about as
you can see here we get a sibling and
therefore well it's a child of the
master component it flows through here
now I will change it here in my first
level one component to text five and I
will I will change it and then let's see
what happens it again changed in all the
places to the bottom is clear because
we're passing the text property so now
we're passing it on because we're
binding with that text directive here
I think that's easy but how we did we do
to let it flow back I just said that it
flows from top to bottom right well as I
said in the beginning we can trigger an
event which will propagate or which will
fire on our master component then and
which allows us to change the value in
our master component and that's one way
on how to work our way up that notarized
hierarchy so we do this by in our level
one component here by setting an output
which basically says this property is
it's an event so to say it outputs data
from our component where it's an input
basically it says our component can't
receive data the output output decorator
here says our component can emit data
and be aware I could also write it this
way outputs changed would
work exactly the same way as you see
I'll just revert it because I wanted to
show you both ways you can audit the
same with input here you could also
specify input so just wanted to tell you
that now our output change creates a new
event emitter now that has to be
imported from the angular 2 core package
and basically allows us to yeah emit
events so to create a custom event so to
say this is fired when I click this
Change button in our level 1 component
here as though fiery unchanged element
and I set my text property like I do my
master in my level 2 component but I
also fire the event by just calling the
emitted method on this changed property
and I omit the value so the new value I
got in my master component I have this
changed event set up on my level 1
component and changed is just the name I
got here and it has to be the same name
just with the inputs where text has to
be text here it has also to be changed
in the master component in square
brackets or in excuse me in in
parentheses because we have an event and
then I call the unchanged event method
or the unchanged method and passed the
event that's important dollar sign event
is always the parameter passed by
angular 2 so you have to use that the
unchanged method is the same I called up
here by my if I click that button
because it always receives the same just
two value a string of any of those input
fields therefore I just get this value
which I basically pass here in my level
one component and set it to the text
property which will therefore change my
text property and that's why if I type
something here it will also change in a
sibling component because it will flow
up to my master and then it will flow
back down data flow you that that's
basically how data flows in angler to
applications and if you know that you
can figure out ways to manipulate it in
a way you want to be now I defined the
same and available to component I also
got this changed event emitter and I'm
omit does this event when I changed
something here like t2 now you might
notice let me actually zoom in a little
bit so that this becomes clearer you
might notice that if I write something
here in a level one component it changes
everywhere if I write something in the
level two component tests changed by
level two it only changes in a level one
component it doesn't flow to my master
and the sibling isn't it's also not
touched in any way that is again because
of the way data flows in angular 2
applications we're triggering and it
went here now level two component
emitting it so to say which is then yet
triggered in a level one component or
which is then fetched in the level one
component due to that changed event I
define here this changes the text
property into level one component but it
can't go any higher than that because
we're not emitting it here it would flow
further if I were to call this changed
emit in my on level two changed method
which is fired when level two component
changes in value then it would propagate
up to the next layer which caused or
which fetches that he went handles that
event listens to it but I I don't have
this method and master one or the master
component isn't listening to any events
fireable level two it's listening to
events fired by level one components so
that is why the data flows down and to
all children but flow is up only one
layer or only to a layer which catch
that a wet or which listen to it okay so
that's the basics or that are angle
two components and data flow in a
nutshell obviously there is much more to
it if you're interested in more be sure
