updating the state that the UI isn't
updated that we're not seeing the H
change here
time to tackle this and time to learn
what reacts state actually is we had
props before and props is one of the
important data construct so to say you
garden react yes state as the other one
props is what you pass into a component
from outside of it state kind of is what
happens inside of the component if you
want to put it like that but basically
state is something which is not getting
getting changed from outside but instead
which is triggered from inside the
component yes you can create chains
where you personally went to a parent
component then change the state in the
parent component but in the end state
means the state of this component
changed do something stay to something
which can be changed by a component
itself the props can only change from
outside so what is this state thing well
let's change our code here a bit and not
create our own property in this class
here but instead let's use this dot
state this state is a property provided
by a react component like this dot props
by the way which sets our state and here
I'll assign a JavaScript object where I
then say H equals props dot H and now
years important thing you shouldn't
assign props to your state except for
the case where this is just the initial
value and that is the case here but to
make this clear you might call this
initial age so here change this to
initial h2 that's just a naming thing
and it's just a thing I do here to keep
the good practice of making sure that I
don't violate this rule of not
props to state so of course also changed
here in the prop types then so with that
I have my age field in this state
property object and when I increase my
age what I will actually do is I will
call a function react gives me or do you
react component from which I extend
gives me set state now that's an
extremely important method because this
method allows me to change my state and
whenever I call this method react.js
will trigger a rear-ending off the UI or
at least it will have a look if it needs
to re-render and i will come back to
this rewritten rendering process soon so
here this set state takes a javascript
object where i then said whatever i want
to change and that's important i only
specify the changes here so here in the
constructor i set up by state proto
object and i could also have let's say
status which is zero and then here in
set state i only change the age status
will not be deleted
it's just that only age gets updated so
then I set this state dot h plus free so
X is the old age this stage will still
refers to the unchanged state X sh and
increase it by free and this will be my
new age again status here will stay
untouched that will trigger a UI update
and now here in my code in my render
function I will output this dot state
dot H referring to the age stored in the
state and to prove that these status
doesn't changed i will output that too
so this that status dot the start state
dot status like that with dead if I save
this go back to the application we see
state as a zero ages twenty seven
if I click on make me older boom it
increases and now we see a change in our
application while it took us quite some
videos to make something change in our
components but I think it's key to
understand how react to the chance
components work by building it up like
that now we're able to change this
because now we're able to change the
state of our component we're not just
getting data from outside of it or by
setting it in a render function
initially but we're changing it at
runtime and that is what state does for
us state is to key trigger for us to
update our UI and of course with state
you can then also update all kinds of
things in your UI and I'll expand on
this idea or we'll get deeper into react
chasse in the next videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
