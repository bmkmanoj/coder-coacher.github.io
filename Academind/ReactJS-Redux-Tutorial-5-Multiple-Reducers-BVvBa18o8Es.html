how we use immutable objects and arrays
so far we also only used one reducer but
in bigger applications you'll typically
have more than one reducer you might
have reducers for different parts of
your application so in our application
our little Redux application here right
now we're doing math related stuff so we
might have a mauve reducer oops a muff
reducer here now let's say I'll remove
the user name here and I'll also take my
initial state and simply pass directly
here get rid of this constant so now I'm
just changing the initialization I'm
doing it here having my object here so
let's say we not only have this Moff
reducer but we also have another feature
in our application where we do use a
related stuff so we have the user
reducer and this initial state would
have let's say I have a name Max and an
age 27 so that would just be another
reducer with another initial state we of
course can have multiple states in this
application one per reducer to be
precise because the reducer is the one
responsible for handling the state and
we can handle multiple states with
multiple reducers so here we have two
features some na for like stuff and some
use related stuff and here we might have
let's say a set name action and let's
say a set H action and in the set name
action your I of course also want to use
the old state like it did before but
then here I want to override the name
and set it equal to action payload and
and you set H case here I would do the
same for the H set it equal to action
payload so now I get a brand new
user handling totally different actions
now the problem is create store here
oops
expect one reducer I can't pass multiple
reducers as arguments so I can't do math
reducer and then use a reducer that that
doesn't work that's not how it works
I can only pass one reducer but
thankfully Redux
has multiple reducers in mind therefore
I can import a new method here which is
called combine reducers and you might
already guess what it does it combines
reducers awesome right
so in the create store method I can now
call combined reducers and this expects
a JavaScript object which simply holds
my reducers so math reducer and then
muff reducer so we have to map them now
if I use the same name for the property
as the value es6 allows me to shorten
this and just pass my free user and user
reducer and es6 will automatically
expand this to key value pairs where the
key name matches the value name so the
name of this variable constant here so
with that I'm telling redux create a new
store and the store should be aware that
there are multiple reducers now that is
all that is all if I save this and
reload my application here you see now
my store has this overall state which
has then the Moff reducer and to use
reducer and the Moff reducer is this
sub-state if you want to call it like
this the same state as you saw in the
last video but now handle in a global
state because in the end our store here
holds one big application state it may
only hold one
not multiples but this big application
state this Chava script object we
created here may then have multiple kind
of sub states did Margie state handled
by the Moffatt user the state handled by
the usual user and so on and that's what
we're seeing here one big global state
which then has these two sub states
which have well their own state so with
that in place I can add new methods also
use the user reducer so we can call set
H here and set this to 30 and if I save
this and reload my application and go to
the last state here you see now the ages
30 if I have a look at the state
previous to this so to the action
dispatch before the last action you see
the age is 27 because indeed I do change
the age and very last action I dispatch
here important thing here as you might
already have recognized the names for
reactions here may only u be used once
because I'm dispatching them on my store
and not on the reducers so here if I
were to have a add action in my user
reducer tube then this would be kind of
bad because I have an ADD action here
too so we have to make sure that we use
unique actions here and this is how easy
you use multiple reducers that's all
that's to it important thing to keep in
mind one global state this chava script
object which may then have sub states</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
