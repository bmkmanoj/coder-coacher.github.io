finished without showing you how we can
actually display some data on the screen
but probably you were able to do this if
you watched my other angular 2 series
here or you bought my angle - udemy
course which of course is even better
but in case you did neither of the two
things which is okay I will show you how
we do it
we will use another form of data binding
remember until now we learned about
string interpolation which is using
these these double curly braces to
output well strings in our HTML document
well another form there are four in
total by the way and you can see them
all in my other language of course we
will probably see them all in this
course too so another form is property
binding property binding that's what the
name implies it binds data to some
properties now we can bind data to
properties of HTML elements like for
example the value property of an input
element we can bind data to that so that
we set the value of the input element we
can find properties to the reactive
properties so if we have some kind of
directive where we want to pass
something I and you will see this later
in this course and we can find
properties to that kind of our
directives by the way components to our
custom components we can bind properties
there too so we have a property here in
our Webber item does Webber item
property and it would be great if some
data was bound to this variety now in
order to be able to do this we have to
tell angular 2 that this very component
here property here excuse me is a
property which well where data can be
bound to which can be used in data
binding there are two ways to define
this the first is to add a number
metadata here another configuration to
our metadata which is called inputs
this takes an array with a lot of
strings in it and each string defines
which
properties of this component can be used
with property binding so for example I
could write whoever item here and this
would well enable us to use this am with
property binding now let me show you how
property binding then works in my weber
list component here i will pass data to
my weber item with this property binding
i just set up and i can do this by using
square brackets here and then i type
weber items the name of the property to
which i'm binding
whoever I tend therefore here whoever I
think this name is the one I'm binding
to because I had abled property binding
for this property and here in the
quotation marks
I didn't say what do I want to bind now
this is also weber item but yeah i know
it might look a little confusing now but
this weber item any quotation marks
refers to this local variable which
again is the weber item we're currently
at this current iteration in our loop
here whereas the weber item in the
square brackets refers to the property
to which were binding let me save this
and now you can see it reloaded and we
actually see our data so passing the
data into the child is working now as we
already saw the naming was kind of
confusing here and maybe we don't really
like weber item here but we like weber
item here it's a good property name here
so can we change it such that our
internal name and the component to which
we're sending the data uses weber item
but all other components which are
binding to this property use let's say
chest item yes we can do this
and we do this by adding a colon here
and then item this allows us to specify
an alias which means internal
we're using Weber item but externally
item will be the name now as you can see
our app is broken on this because we're
still using Weber item here this does
not work anymore because externally
outside our Weber ID and component we
now have to use item as you can see now
it's working again so this is how we
assign such an alias now if you remember
I was talking about two possibilities of
setting up data binding
now using the inputs metadata here is
one of them I'm going to comment this
out to show you the second one let me
save this now you'll see it's broken of
course and we need the input annotation
which we add by using at input and sign
a general type script allows us to add
decorators annotations to certain
elements this cases property now we're
missing an import here import here and I
already automatically added this but you
have to make sure to add this input
import from energy quarry you only need
this when using this add input
annotation you're not needing this when
you're setting up inputs in our
component metadata because the component
metadata is already imported here so now
this will do pretty much the same but in
order to also use an alias here we have
to define as Elias inside the
parentheses here so we just used item
and therefore I'm just adding item here
and now it's working again now whichever
way you prefer is really up to you this
way using it in a component metadata
groups all the definitions in one
central place at the top of our file and
what a component metadata however this
way annotating each property on its own
allows you to very quickly see which
properties are bound and which are not
and finally the decision is up to you so
this is how we pass data into our
components by using property binding and
now we're actually outputting the items
we have an hour
arrey by looping freedom and binding the
data to our Weber item component see you
