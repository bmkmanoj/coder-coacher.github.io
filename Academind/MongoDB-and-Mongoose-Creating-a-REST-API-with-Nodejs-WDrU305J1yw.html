videos of this series we already added
quite some functionality to our node
restful services we added our first
routes for products and orders but we
don't really work with the data we get
we don't really manage the data we have
no database we're going to change this
in this video we're going to add MongoDB
as a database and Mongoose as a package
to work with that database to store data
get data and so on so let's dive into
that
so as I said I'll be using MongoDB you
could also use a sequel based database
and you can always search for sequel vs
no sequel to find a lot of discussions
up about when to choose which I'll go
with MongoDB here I might add sequel as
a bonus later in a series but we'll see
and for that I simply google for MongoDB
to end up on MongoDB com now there we
could simply download MongoDB so if you
click on solutions here you can simply
click on try it now MongoDB 3.6 you can
download it and stall it on your
machines set it up connect to it on your
machine you can do all that I'll use
MongoDB Atlas though now what is a
MongoDB Atlas it's simply a MongoDB
database in the cloud managed by the
company behind MongoDB and we can't get
started with that for free why am i
using that because if we think to the
end we obviously want to deploy our API
at some point and building a really
scalable MongoDB on your own so a
cluster of databases replicating data
and all that stuff is something you
probably don't want to do on your own
now MongoDB Atlas does all of that for
you it's a database as a service and you
can work with it just as you work with
it or with you as you work with the
local long going to be you can install
and you can get started for free behind
the scenes is hosted on AWS and as I
said you don't have to pay to get
started so you can simply choose a
region here now I'll pick an American
one North Virginia and then if you
choose m0 as a size so regarding the
power you have available and so on you
see it doesn't cost anything now you can
of course pick a paid one for real
applications but for playing around I'll
use debt now you can see you don't need
a credit card to get started so let's
just get started I'm quickly going to
fill this out here once you did sign up
you can choose their name for your
cluster I'm going to name this node rest
shop because that's what we're building
here you can choose whatever you
you can choose someone going to be
version though here it basically I'll
stick to the default here the cloud
provider so there you could also switch
to a different one but I'll stick to AWS
the region you want to use on the
provider and then important make sure to
select the free tier so the hourly cost
should switch to zero dollars so make
sure that this is selected you don't
accidentally pick a paid one if you
don't want that these are all shared
clusters which might not be the best
choice for running it in production but
for development that's great and then
down there do you want a Charlotte
cluster we don't want to take all of
that you can enable backup but it'll
cost man money thereafter you'll need to
create an admin username and password so
it'll quickly do that obviously you want
to choose a more secure combination and
I did here and then you can click
confirm and deploy now let's quickly
confirm that we're not a robot and this
will set up this MongoDB cluster for us
though here we really will only have one
instance we'll take a little time and
once it's done we'll get the connection
details that allow us to use it in our
node application to connect to it so
even though we're developing the node
restful service on our local machine we
can of course connect to this MongoDB
running in the cloud and again if you
feel totally uncomfortable using that or
you don't want to use it for some reason
you can always install one way to be
locally and then use that local address
that's perfectly fine too now let's do
some useful stuff whilst is working and
let's click on secure it here there you
see the users you created you can all do
whitelist IP so I peace that may access
this instance here and I simply clicked
add Kurt IP address to add my well Kurt
at your IP address or allow access from
anywhere so that of course might not be
what you want you might not want
everyone to be able to access this so
choose whichever setup you want I'll use
that doubt you also be able to access
this again once my IP address changed
and with that setup let's go back to
overview and you
that's not finished yet it is here for
me though you can click on connect here
and connect your application and there
you will find the URL you'll basically
need to use to connect your application
to your instance here you can click copy
here to simply copy that and we'll need
this in our node.js app we'll also need
to replace the password and with that we
could see what they suggest us as
drivers here for a note for example they
suggest your official Mongo client but
I'm going to use Mongoose which is a
different package that makes working
with data with schemas fetching and
storing data super simple so I won't use
their official client I'll use Mongoose
which will build up on this client so
let's leave this page for now and let's
go back to our code there I'll quit the
server and install a new package with
NPM install - - save then Mongoose
that's the package name and - - save
also creates an entry in the package
JSON file now with that finished you can
now obviously start using it and I will
start using it in the app J's fall where
I want to set up a connection now I will
connect to my database here in the
app.js file where we start our
application for that all first of all
import Mongoose here by simply adding
require Mongoose like that and then here
I'll call Mongoose connect and now to
connect I first of all need to pass a
path and here I'll passed path I copied
from our MongoDB Atlas page I dare now
also need to replace the password which
in my case also is node shop and
typically you might want to put this
into some environment variable so that
here you actually access something like
process thought and thought Mongo atlas
password
whenever you chose as an environment
variable name and then you could set
this up on the server you're deploying
this to so that you don't have to
hard coded here into your code now it
used it with node one on the add a new
fall file node montage Jason which I can
use to configure it and there I will
simply add an end key for environment
variables which is an object and there
we can now define all the environment
variables we want to use like for
example here Mongo Atlas PW so I'll add
this here as a name and the value will
be the password we chose on Mongo Atlas
with that we should be able to get this
dynamically and we don't have to
hard-coded in our code now add a second
argument to disconnect function and
object where I will set use Mongo client
to true so that under the hood it will
use the MongoDB client for connecting
which is the recommended way for using
mongoose when using manga version 4.3 do
on our Mongo atlas which is the
recommended way of using this when using
mongoose version 4 or higher which we do
as you can see here now if that let's
try it out and for that let's go to the
routes file and then let's say for
products when we post a new product with
the name and a price let's say we want
to store that in the database now to do
that I will use Mongoose and for that
I'll first of all need a mongoose model
because mongoose and there's no in-depth
mongoose course or video but mongoose
works with models and schemas so you
define how objects you store in the
database should look like and then you
create a model based on that which is
just a javascript object to put it
simple and then this model will have a
couple of functions you can use to save
data update data fetch data by ID by our
criteria order it merge different data
sets and so on so that's what mongoose
offers do for you and it can always
recommend checking out the official
talks to which you'll find a link in the
video description so I'll add a models
folder in the API folder and there are
now add a product or JS file to define
how a product should look like in my
application for Dettol
first of all import Mongoose here to in
store in a constant named Mongoose so in
that and you file and then I'll create
such a schema I'll create a new constant
here and I'll name it product schema the
name is up to you and I will use
Mongoose an unknown goose the schema
method here essentially to which I pass
a JavaScript object which defines how my
product should look like now my product
should have an ID and I'll use
underscore idea which is kind of a
convention which will be of type that is
how you could figure it the value here
is the type of data this will be which
will be of type Mongoose types and then
object ID that's a special type which is
essentially a serial ID not a number but
simply a long string and that's a
specific format Mongoose uses internally
which we assigns the type here then
let's say a product should have a name
and that will just be a string so we can
use the string type like this with a
capital S then we also want to have a
price which should be a number and that
is actually all I want now we'll export
this schema wrapped into a model though
so a schema is like the layout that the
sign of the object you wanna use the
model then is the object itself or gives
you a constructor to build such objects
based on that schema you could say so
I'll set up module exports here and that
is equal to Mongoose model and now that
model function takes two arguments the
first is the name of the model is you
want to use it internally and name this
product the convention here is to use an
upper case starting character and then
the second argument is this schema you
want to use for that model with that we
get our product model setup we can now
use new products J's file in the routing
folder for that I'll import my product
here with capital key here to as a
constant name and I'll import it from my
model
file and they're from the product file
of course that is what we just defined
it now here in post I can use it to
store data for that I'll first of all
trade a new instance of that models a
new product lowercase P maybe where I
use new and then my model as a
constructor now to that constructor I
pass a JavaScript object where I passed
data for that model and there I'll need
to set an ID because we defined that we
want to have a D here and I will import
Mongoose for that with require Mongoose
to be able to create a new object ID
here new Mongoose types and now object
ID as a function constructor function
essentially will give me a new ID will
automatically create one for me and that
will be a unique ID which I can't get
twice then I'll add a name here of
course and that name will be a request
body name and I'll set a price my
request body price that of course means
we can remove the old product we created
here now we got a product object which
is actually created with the help of
Mongoose and that's a special object
where I then call it can call product
safe so save as a method provided by
Mongoose which I can use on Mongoose
models save will then store this in the
database now I can chain a method here
x'q which essentially will turn this
into a promise if I don't call that I
would have to pass a callback here an
arrow function where I either have an
error or the result of that operation
which I of course can do but I didn't
want to use a callback here I want to
use a promise
so I'll chain them here and in there I
will get back the result of that
operation which I'll lock to the console
so result and I also want
catch potential errors sort of all the
chain catch here where I get the error
which I did also want to log to the
console like that so this is how I try
to save that to the database now let's
save that and let's rerun NPM start to
run note 1 again and I get an error here
you see that I got undefined object ID
in my schema file so let's have a look
at what's going wrong there the problem
I have here is I use this a bit
incorrectly this Mongoose type object at
the ISTE constructor function which I
correctly use here in products J s here
to create the ID now to just tell
Mongoose that I want to use this type I
don't use that constructor function of
course instead I have to access Mongoose
schema.org IDs or density correct type
with that if I save this and then I quit
this server and restart it now I should
run without errors and does and now
let's try sending a post request to
slash products which should trigger this
route for that I'm back in postman all
target products here and I will attach a
body to my request
of course not product ID in quantity but
instead a name so here I will use Harry
Potter 5 and you can of course also use
other products and the price which all
set to $12.99 now let me click send here
and I get unexpected end of JSON year
because I mistakenly removed that
closing parenthesis here so let's send
us again and I indeed get back a
response here create a product and this
of course here is the data created by
Mongoose because we're returning the
product which is our Mongoose object so
we're getting back the data which was
safe to the database hopefully now if we
have a look at our log we also see this
log here which is looking good now on
longer DB Atlas it can take some time
until
see it if that really succeeded here in
your dashboard because right now it
hasn't it isn't showing data up to the
point of time when we really wrote this
eventually you should see that you
performed one right action here but we
can simply check by always returning
that data if we access a certain Product
ID so for the get route of products here
I can of course also get this product
with this ID for that I will remove my
dummy code here and instead I want to
use this product model and that's the
object I'm importing here at the top
because I don't need to create a new one
here instead I'll use a static method on
that object which is called find by ID
and it does what the name suggests now I
pass the ID to that and call X SEC and
then I can call them and catch
now let me restructure this over
multiple lines now and then I clearly
want to get my document and here I'll
simply log it to the console for now and
then catch I obviously want to get any
errors I might face so here I'll
console.log an error now right now I'm
not sending a response anymore though
and I want to send a response once we
got the data so I don't want to call res
status and so on after the catch block
because since promises run
asynchronously this would simply mean
that I run the code immediately before
that response is there because code
which I write into this line here will
not wait for all that code to finish so
instead I want to send a response from
inside the den block when I know that it
was successful or also from inside the
catch block but there I want to send an
error so here in the den block I'll use
rest status 200 and I will send back
JSON data of course and let's simply
sent back to talk as we get it so I'll
just set doc here as an argument now in
the catch block I as a just set wanna
actually do more than just logging this
to the console I also want to send a
response there the status code will be
500 though because something failed
whilst fetching the data and I'll set a
JSON response where I will add an error
property which is equal to the error I'm
catching here with that if we save that
file let's try it out let's copy that ID
we got when we created the object and
let's target product slash dead IT ID
with a get request now then let's click
send and I do get back this response
really quick and this does look very
promising because to me that really
looks like we successfully fetched the
data we changed it here and we can also
see that we really have this data from
the database by adding from database
here so we're not seeing some old
version of our code if I click send
again we still get the data and in the
log we see from database so this really
is our update code fetching the data
from the database and eventually you now
see one connection at least here on your
Atlas dashboard if you refresh and wait
a bit you will also eventually see the
reads and writes
you're having on that so we're storing
the data in the database we're getting
it from the database now one thing we
can improve is in the post request right
now I sent my response immediately I
don't wait for this operation to succeed
or fail so just like for getting the
data I want to put my success response
inside the success callback and I will
return the result we get here and for
the error case here I also still want to
lock the error here for us but I also
want to send a different response here
with a 500 error code where I said Jason
or where a sent data in JSON format
where I also have an error property
which holds the error we actually got so
that if something failed we really see
that here too now let's also try a
invalid ID so I'm
get requests for iid I removed the C
which doesn't exist by now Santa's you
see we get an error and there we see
that this couldn't be cast to you an
object ID because it's actually not just
an ID which doesn't exist it's an
invalid object ID and that's detected by
Mongoose if I add a D which now is a
valid object ID by the one which doesn't
exist I simply get back null because
that doesn't throw an error and it
shouldn't it's not an error it's just
that we don't have data for that ID so
we probably in our get function wanna
check for the duck if the doc is there
so if it's not null then I want to send
a response with the doc me document in
the our case I probably want to send a
response which is 404 where I have a
JSON object where maybe I have a message
no valid entry found for provided ID or
something like that
so that now if I save this we actually
have different kinds of answers we can
return we get a 404 answer you can see
the status code here with our error
message if I enter invalid ID if I enter
a valid one with a see at the end I do
get a 200 response and if I do enter an
invalid object ID then I get by 500
response my 500 error so this is how we
can work with MongoDB and Mongoose now
we're fetching an individual product and
we're fetching or we're storing a
product now of course we also have our
general get method where I want to
return all products we have so let's
also take care about this for this I'll
again use my product object up here and
now we can't just use find and if I
don't pass an argument it will find all
elements now you can also add more query
operators here like for example you can
add where to add more conditions to that
query or you add limit to only fetch
a smaller number and you could manually
implement some form of pagination then
here I'll fetch all for now though I'll
call access to get a true promise and
then chain catch and and then
restructure it over multiple lines and
in the den block I'll have all my
documents so all my products and I want
to return them and there I simply want
to console log all Doc's
and then for now return in a response
with status code 200 where I simply
return the docs as JSON data and I'll
also catch any errors we might get here
where I will console lock the error for
us here and we're out there after simply
return a status code of 500 with an
object where I have my error again
provided to our front end now if I save
this let's try a general get request
targeted at products if I sent this we
get back an array with this one object
in there so with this one product that's
great of course that's coming directly
from the database now before we continue
working on this get requests and before
we check which our response you might
return in the van block if we haven't
any data in the database let's make sure
that we can't encounter the case of not
having any data there by adding the
delete functionality now so there I will
now also use product so this model
object and there I can now access remove
and to remove I pass an object which
describes the object I want to remove
and I don't have to pass all properties
I don't have a have to pass an exact
copy of the object I want to remove but
the filter criteria and I'll use the ID
for that and the idea is something I can
get from my URL so I'll store the new
constant pain tidy and I get it from
request parents Product ID and that of
course is just Product ID because that's
the name I chose here so now I'll assign
value here and this essentially means
remove any objects in the database that
fulfill this criteria so that have an ID
property which has the value of this
idea and we should only have one object
dead works like this or that fulfills
this criteria then I'll execute exit to
get a real promise and I'll chain then
and catch now and that as always and
then I get some result which I can
console lock but I'll here immediately
return it set the status code to 200 and
simply return result maybe let's name it
result should not get into conflicts
with the response variable we're using
here and in the catch block I'll
possibly get an error which I'll log to
the console but where I then also want
to return a response with status code
500 where I pass an object which has an
error property that then in turn
contains that error object we got from
Mongoose now let's save this and now if
we grab that ID from the object we got
and we add a T at the end of our URL we
can get the data for that single object
but if we now switch this to a delete
request and click send I get this answer
which I guess means that it worked it's
some data about the process was executed
let's simply try by fetching all
products again with a get request and we
get an empty array so we successfully
deleted the data object that also means
something else we get an empty array and
not null here that's important for our
get method here for our get route here
when we fetch Doc's we return an empty
array maybe we want to do that but we
could also check if Doc's
length is greater or equal than 0 if it
is then I want to return my response
like this else I want to return 404
response and now this is really
something you can think about because
you could also argue that it's not
really a 404 error if we got no data
here
so we'll remove this in a second but I
want to show that you could use this
piece of information and there you could
set up an object you returned with a
message no entries found now again this
is something you can use
but I'll remove that entire check here
I'll comment it out because I think it's
not really an error if we got no entries
in there it's not really like we didn't
find a resource as it is if we try to
query an ID that doesn't exist here we
just want to fetch all products and it
turns out that we got none but that's
not an error at least in my opinion so
I'll leave the setup we had but you
could use that information that the docs
here will be an empty array and not null
for this check to return some other
response if you want it so with that
there is one method we have populated
and that is incoming patch requests
where we want to change our our object
where we want to change data in the
database now let's also work on that to
finish up that product setup here now
updating is simple with Mongoose we can
again use our product model and then
there is an update method now to that
method we first of all need to pass an
identifier for the object we want update
just as we had to for delete for move so
I'll extract the ID from product IDs
from my URL and I'll pass the same
argument as I passed to remove I want to
update an object that fulfills this
criteria that has an ID that matches
this ID then however I also want to
change something about that object now
the second argument describes how we
want to update this this is also a
JavaScript object and there we can use a
special property name dollar sign set
which is understood my Mongoose so this
is not an arbitrary name you have to use
dollar signs set here to then pass
another object as a value to that where
you then describe key value pairs on how
to update your object so for our product
which
has a name and a prize and an ID but we
don't want to change that that's the
idea behind patching we want to keep the
existing object and just change some
properties but if we change the ID we
essentially have the same as if we would
have created a new object so we want to
change name and/or price so here what
I'll do is I will set name to request
and now I expect to get this on the body
so request body new name maybe and the
price to request body new price this of
course assumes that we always pass both
to our endpoint and the idea behind
patches that we don't have to do that
maybe we want to just update the price
or just update the name so we should
check if we really do want to update
both so for that let's add some other
check first I'll create a new constant
which we'll name update ops for update
operations which is an empty JavaScript
object and then I'll trade a loop here
where I'll loop through all the
operations of my request body so I
expect my request body to essentially be
an array here now with that I can use
update ops and add a new property with
that syntax here where I can use Ops
prop name because I expect to pass this
and you will see the other side of how
we pass the data so that here will be
something like name or price and I'll
set it equal to ops value this will give
us an object that in the end will have
this form but only with the operations I
want to perform so here I can now set
update ops and this will be an object
which might have no key value pairs if
we somehow sent a patch request without
a payload then it shouldn't change
anything we might just change the name
or just change the price and with this
dynamic approach we're making sure that
we can really send different types of
patch requests
with that I can as always chain xx to
get a promise and hence chain catch and
then thereafter and and then I'll get
the result which I here wants to log
again and where I don't want to return
and let's again use result here and then
I'll again use response status with a
code of two hundred and Jason data which
is sent back where I will simply pass
the result back to the user and in catch
I'll get a console log where I lock the
error and then I return the status
killed five hundred with why Jason
payload where I have my error property
where I returned the error to the user
with that if we save that file let's try
it out and let's see what happens if we
try to patch an object for that I'll
first of all trade a new one
so I'll post two products and set my
object here quickly run a get request
fine so that's stored let's fetch the ID
and then I'll create a patch request
here now for patch I'll add the ID to
the URL but then I'll also provide a
body where I will set the name to Harry
Potter six now if I send sent is I get
request body is not iterable because my
request body here clearly is still an
object and remember I wanted to use a
different approach I wanted to get an
array where in the array we have objects
that have things like prop name and
value so let's do that I'll actually
pass an array here as a payload which I
can do that's all the valid JSON and
then I could have multiple objects here
and I'll have a prop name property in
here should be between quotation marks
though because we're writing jason here
and the value here will be name because
i want to adjust the name property in my
data and then i'll also have a value
property which holds the new value which
now is harry potter six so now if i send
this we get back status code okay
now let's see if that really works by
going back to a get request and getting
the data and indeed you see the name is
Harry Potter six the price wasn't
touched though and if I go back and
again patch a request and this time I
want to set the price and set it to
let's say 14.10 if I sent this also get
back this script egg response but if I
now get the data for this product we
indeed see the price was adjusted the
name is the same now if I go back one
more time and I patch a new party where
I want to set price new which is a
property we don't define our schema and
I said this back now I get back a
different response and if I get the data
for this object you see this wasn't
added so I can't add new properties like
this I can really just change existing
ones I can't add new ones and this is of
course on purpose I don't want to be
able to add new ones like this we
obviously could rewrite this to allow
the addition of new properties but I
really want you work with a set of
properties that's known in advance
where I can't add new ones and that was
quite some talking and work about
setting everything up setting up moong
or at last connecting Mongoose using
Mongoose creating a schema and model but
now we get a first draft of how the
products routes could work and and look
like if we really use a database
obviously this is not final we might
need more fields than just as a name in
a price but it's nice to get started and
we already achieved something very
important we got a first version of the
restful api where we actually persist
our data in a database and work with
that so let's continue on the road and
let's see which our cool things we can
add to this API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
