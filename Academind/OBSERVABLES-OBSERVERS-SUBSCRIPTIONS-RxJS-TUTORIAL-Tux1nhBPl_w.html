and specifically on observables
observers and subscriptions what are all
these things how do they work together
well like that we have our observable
which basically is a wrapper around some
data source and data source typically
means a stream of values because as you
might be aware observables are a concept
we typically use for asynchronous data
though it's not limited to this that's
important you can also wrap it about any
synchronous data source we will see this
in this video too so we have that stream
of data possibly asynchronous or
possible multiple values over time and
now we want to do something whenever a
new value occurs that is the job of the
observer the observer is there to
execute some code whenever we receive a
new value or also an error or if the
observable reports that it is done there
for the observer is the part doing that
and we need to connect it to the
observable we do that through a
subscription subscription basically
means with one method to subscribe
method we tell and observable our
wrapper around that stream of values
that someone is caring about these
values that someone is listening to them
the observer the observer on the other
hand implements up two free methods you
can implement none of these but then
it's not that useful of an observer or
just some of these whatever you need the
next method will be called by the
observable whenever a new value is
emitted so whenever we receive a new
value the error method it will be called
whenever the observable throws an error
and the complete method will be called
whenever the observable is done so
whenever we know that no more values
will be emitted in the future side note
some observables will of course never
finish if you wrap it around a click
listener on a button
you don't know when this will finish
right the user could always click the
button but how does the observer will
know that it should call next error and
complete well that is kind of the
contract the two observable and observer
sign through the subscription do
durable knows that it could fire a next
and bearer or a complete method on an
observer and you observer on the other
hand knows that the observable will only
fire one of these free methods so you
can easily implement them on the
observer and react whenever they are
fired so it is this invocation of these
methods which allows us to communicate
and to handle our data but depicting it
like this is not the best way instead
what you commonly see is a depiction as
a stream as I mentioned an observable in
the end just is a wrapper around a
stream of values and we can have one
value which instantly occurs to have a
synchronous data stream or then it's not
a stream I guess or we have multiple
values whatever the case may be we have
our observer with the three methods I
mentioned where we can handle any values
and can handle one or multiple values at
the end we might have an endpoint when
you observable it's done and as I
mentioned at before that might never
occur some observables are never done if
we do complete the observable though so
if we have some data source which
eventually finishes then we can call end
and we will execute complete if the
observer provides it on the observer
object we also might have a stream which
does not only emit values but which also
throws an error at some point of time
think about a stream or an observable I
should say wrapping an HTTP request we
know that we will eventually get back a
response but that response could be an
error either a timeout or maybe a
server-side error in this case the
observable would throw the error and we
could handle it in the error function of
the observer now seeing that on slides
is nice but how do we actually use these
concepts where can we see this concept
in code well let's take a look I'm on
jsfiddle here and I simply chose JSON
because I kind of liked the way it looks
and how we can work with it and what I'm
doing is I'm importing the rxjs package
from their CDN which you can find on the
official documentation on install it at
the very bottom and then I added a
button which I can click
I listen to any leg clicks on the button
with my observable here so I get an
access to the button here and then I
simply wrap the button click and I
create a new observable with the from
event helper method and as a side note
if you visit the official documentation
at reactive X dot IO and then you click
on observable here you see there are a
lot of methods you can use to create a
new observable and a lot of these
methods are actually nice methods to
conveniently create observables which do
something specific like here wrapping an
event average would emit a new value
every X seconds later in this video
we'll also see how we can create an
observable from scratch but back to this
one first
I'm wrapping or I can create an
observable wrapping this click event and
therefore let's open the console
whenever I click the button here we see
that the value the the x position of my
cursor is emitted because that's what
I'm getting here so that is how this
observable works and what happens here
behind the scenes is that this
observable has an infinite stream of
values and new value is emitted whenever
we click that is how that observable is
configured and then in the SUBSCRIBE
method we pass an observer now it may
not look like this because all I pass is
a method but the SUBSCRIBE method takes
two possible arguments either a list of
functions where the first function is
the next function the second argument
would be the arrow function and the
third argument would be the complete
function or a single object which
implements these methods so I could also
create my observer object here to take
the full route so to say create it like
that a normal JavaScript object and
there I may have my next method next
function we know that for that we will
get a value the value which was emitted
because next is only caused once a new
value is emitted and there we could then
log value client X and our case or just
the value to fully Bend then I can also
implement that error error function now
that will never be called on a
observable of wrapping a click because
it can't error
a sickly but we can still add the
function and we can also add a complete
function however that also will never be
cause for this example because when
we're wrapping this button and we're
listening to click events this
observable will never complete because
we can't tell if the user is going to
click this button one more time still I
can lock completed here however as I
said error and complete for this
specific observable will never be called
now that I created that observer I could
also simply pass that observer to my
SUBSCRIBE method and now if I up the
console and clear it here hit ctrl enter
to rebuild the code and I click this we
get the full mousie mint now since I
only lock the value and not clog well
you client X but you see it works as
before simply omitting the value that
again is an observable and infinite
observable and a synchronous one because
we can emit multiple values over time
and we use the from event helper method
now let's see how we can create an
observable from scratch
and how we can basically rebuild this
exact same behavior with an observable
being built from scratch now to build an
observable from scratch let's go to the
official documentation see which method
might be helpful and there are a lot of
methods of the create method here
actually see what I'm looking for with
create we can build our own observable
right from the start so if we have a
look at it you see that create actually
takes one argument The Observer kind of
and you will see how we build that in
the next second so we already got an
observer I will keep that I will comment
out this code here however or I can
leave to subscribe function even however
now I will use our X observable and now
create as I mentioned create takes the
observer to be precise it takes a
function which takes the observer as an
argument so we pass a function and
anonymous function to create and this
function takes an observer object now
important we're not passing our observer
variable here because keep in mind
that's an anonymous function it was like
if you were to declare a new one so we
simply name the argument this function
will eventually get and if we were to
name it observer we simply get naming
conflicts with our variable we don't
pass the data to that function here we
define a new one
which will eventually receive one
argument rxjs will pass that argument
for us and this argument will be an
observer we noted from the documentation
so I will name it ops here now inside of
the function we can call ops next to
emit a value so let's do that let's emit
a value here and if I now hit control
enter to build this coded up the console
log you see a value was already emitted
because of course we're not listening to
any click right now this code
immediately gets executed why do we see
a value because we subscribe to
observable which takes a function where
the function takes the observer which we
all the path to subscribe and our X
chest now passes our observer which we
passed to subscribe to that function and
execute that function that is how you
create an observable in that function we
can call the next method on the observer
because remember an observer knows or
the observer knows that an observer can
have next error or complete so these are
the three methods we can call and
therefore we see a value if I were to
call ops error error here like that
clear the console and hit control enter
again we see value a value and then
error and if I emit another data piece a
second value after the error and hit
control enter you will see we don't see
that because if an error occurs the
observable is finished it won't call
complete which is why we don't see
completed here it doesn't execute that
it just executes error but thereafter no
more values will be emitted because the
observable is done that's just how it
behaves after an error now if I call
complete instead of error
complete without any arguments because
we don't pass any to this method you now
see a value completed and you also don't
see a second value because just like
with error the observable is done it's
just the case that it didn't fail we
didn't get an error but it well
completed regularly again any our next
calls thereafter won't give us an error
but all they won't work we don't get
that value because the observable was
finished before now that's all nice
playing around with that but it doesn't
really feel like an observable right
it's not asynchronous and that from
event observable felt much more like it
because there we actually wrapped
something which was asynchronous and we
could see that this stream of data made
more sense here we immediately it print
some values in the end execute some
values so where is that and observable
remember that I told you that an
observable doesn't have to be
asynchronous and here it isn't we have a
function and this gets executed when we
subscribe to it and then that function
we just execute some synchronous code
therefore our whole observable is not
asynchronous we can easily turn it into
an asynchronous one though we could
simply add a timeout
so the normal set timeout method let's
set it to two seconds maybe and here we
of course have a function so that's the
default set timeout code and if I now
move ops complete into that you will see
that if I now add control enter we see a
different output than before now we get
a value and a second value before
completed as printed after two seconds
and it makes sense because ops complete
will not be called before two seconds
are over therefore this line is executed
first then set timeouts I execute it but
there nothing happens for the first two
seconds then it moves on because
JavaScript of course doesn't wait for a
set timeout to finish it never does
that's nothing observable specific that
is how JavaScript works and therefore it
executes this line now and then of two
seconds this line is executed now all of
a sudden we have an asynchronous
observable because now we have a
data stream where we have two
synchronous values being emitted
immediately but then one event happening
after two seconds and of course I could
also move that into this or in another
time out or something like that I could
also create an interval here and if I do
that clear this and control enter we see
a value and after two seconds we see a
second value and then it's completed and
now if I would move that after complete
of course a second value would again
never be printed because now after two
seconds it just is completed and it
doesn't wait for for anything else so a
second value is not printed I hope this
makes more sense
it might make even more sense if I now
recreate that from event behavior and
this is actually pretty easy to do I
will comment out all my code I have in
there in this observable create function
right now and instead I will add new
code we have a reference to our button
right we do get access to it here and
now if I use that button and set
on-click equal to a function which
should eventually get executed I can get
my event there and there I could call
opps next event remember I'm still in
this function we pass to the create
method so we have access to that
observer we eventually receive and I'm
in the function which I assigned to
unclick so that will be executed
whenever I do click so now if I had
control enter and open my developer
tools if I click the button now I'm
again logging that mouse event now I
basically recreated the same behavior I
had before with this from event
observable this one here now with my own
observable built from scratch but I hope
this makes clear how observables work
behind the scenes and how you can build
them from scratch with the create method
now there's one other very important
point if we subscribe to this observable
like this and keep in mind this specific
observable here it's an infinite one
because we never call complete here in
this function we don't call it because
of course we always want to listen to
more click events
if you have an observable which is never
completed that poses the danger of a
memory leak so you should definitely
unsubscribe to any subscriptions which
you don't need anymore imagine we have a
more complex JavaScript app here for
example a single page application can we
navigate to some other place in our app
all of a sudden we might not need this
anymore we might not need to
subscription anymore if we come back you
might even create a new one that the old
one still lives on in memory that's a
memory leak so clean up any
subscriptions you don't need anymore and
that's super easy to do all you have to
do is store that subscription in a
variable for example name and
subscription or in a property of an
object wherever you set it up so here I
stored the subscriptions and from
storing the result of the SUBSCRIBE
method which returns the subscription
and therefore I can unsubscribe so I
could add a set timeout method here that
after five seconds maybe I execute a
function now this is outside offer any
observable that's just the normal
JavaScript code and there I use my
subscription and I call the unsubscribe
method now watch what happens if I open
the console hit control enter you can
see I click here and it still prints the
values but after a little bit of a time
after five seconds to be precise I can
click this and no more values are
printed because the subscription ended
we unsubscribed and that is what you
should do if you don't need a
subscription anymore and with that I
hope I could clear up some of the
confusion I hope I could make this
concept of observables and subscriptions
a bit more clearer I hope you understand
how you may build your own observable
from scratch and what all these helper
methods like from event and so on do
behind the scenes see you in other
videos hopefully bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
