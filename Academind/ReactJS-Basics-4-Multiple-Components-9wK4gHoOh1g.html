create and load our react component and
that's fine and as I said many times
before you can't create individual
components and then just render them in
the Dom but you can also combine
components together I will do that and
for this I will create a new folder in
my app folder which I'll name components
and that's a good convention in your
react.js projects to store your
components in such a folder now I want
to create two new components in my
application I want to have a home
component basically like the main page
content you will see and a header
component at the top where is say let's
say a split in an application which
makes sense I believe so let's procreate
both a hetero chess file and it's also a
convention to have the uppercase name
you're starting with an uppercase
character like header here and then I'll
create a new file home dot not humor
nothing to do with the simpsons here
home is well let's start with the header
file
I'll pull and react again from react and
I don't need to import render from the
react Dom because I'm not going to
render this component directly into my
HTML file I'll not target an element
mark by me instead I will include it in
this app component later on and you will
see how to do that so I will only need
to create my component here and I will
export it to make it available outside
of this file because I want to use it in
my index dot J's file later on then I
will again create a class header which
should extend my react component that's
the general pattern you follow when
creating components and then I add the
render method to it and any year I
return of course my code again my HTML
code so to say and I'll treat an AF it's
not a navigator an app element for that
give it a class name of nav or
navbar default that's just some
bootstrap styling here to get a nice
looking navigation bar and in there I
want to create a container with Chas
enough navbar header class inside so
that's all bootstrap I definitely check
out bootstrap to learn more about it
that's no bootstrap course just want to
get a nice looking header and then you
could have multiple links here in an
unordered list where I know the class is
not class name the class and snap and
navbar nav so a lot of navbar stuff here
does just how bootstrap named their
classes and then I'll have a list item
with the actual link which won't work
for now by the way so I'll come to
routing in a later video for now I'll
just create this basic link so that's a
lot of code for it's just something
saying home but it should look nice in
the end of that let's go to the home
Chasse file in here I'll again pull in
react from react don't need render here
too because it will use this component
in my app component in the index touch
as file to export it of course home
extend react component so again that's
how you create your components then
define what should get rendered and I
will come to other methods you can use
in future videos too but render is the
most important one basically here and
then just make sure to return something
here to let's say a div and that I'll
say in a new component yay isn't that
great so with that I get my component
set up time to go back to the index.js
file and here I need to make some
adjustments well I will import my newly
created components so it will import
header from my components folder and
then from the header file and you don't
specify your file extension here so you
can leave out the dot j/s that will all
be hemmed by webpack and then i'm just
duplicating this import to also include
I hope component of course also adjusted
here to pull in home and then I can use
both components like HTML tags in my app
component here so I only got my
containers set up here and then I want
to add my header here at the top and I
can simply create an HTML tag named
header for that with that I'll just copy
the row here and create this again but
this time of course name it home to load
my home section and I could also still
include some text in here or something
like that right so I can still write
code in this component itself not only
include other components and actually
I'm doing that with all these divs here
so with that after I save it it already
got updated and you can see here's my
nav bar and my new component is home
component and that is how easily you
create new components the pattern is
always the same and then you include
them like HTML code in your existing
components you can't include these tags
here in the index.html file because well
the browser has no chance of identifying
what that is but react.js has a chance
of doing so because we tell it here at
the top we link everything together and
keep in mind any background this is no
HTML code it's JavaScript code it just
looks nicer but by writing this we're
not really creating an HTML tag which
looks like that instead we're telling
react.js hey please include the
component which you import from there in
this place and that is how you let
components well work together kind of or
combined together regarding you work
together part that's something I'll come
to in the next two videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
