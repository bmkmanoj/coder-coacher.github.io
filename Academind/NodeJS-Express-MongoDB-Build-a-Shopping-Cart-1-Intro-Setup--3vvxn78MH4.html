going to build a shopping cart or a
little shop like application with no
Cheers Express and hand Laban's
as the templating engine and of course
MongoDB to store all our data let's get
started as already said I have nothing
prepared for this course so we're going
to build it step by step from scratch so
let's start I will set up a new project
by using the Express generator and you
may just google for it Express generator
and find it on the expressjs page chorus
you may switch to English here and well
here is a basic explanation what it is
and how it works but I'll also give you
my explanation it's a little tool which
quickly scaffolds out a basic notes yes
Express app it has some sample routes in
it but besides that no boilerplate code
no annoying code in it just some things
like starting a server applying some
basic model where we would use any way
to quickly get started with Express and
to not write all the code lines you
would have to write anyway to have a
work express app so like for example
with level you got create project on
composer to quickly scaffold out a basic
level application Express generator is
the same for Noches and Express so make
sure to install it and you will find how
to do this in this guide on this page
here and once you have installed it you
may use like well describe here and it's
really simple to do so I will go to my
terminal window and navigate into the
folder where I want this project to be
in so where I want to set up this
project and you should do the same of
course in this folder I can use Express
which just executes this Express
generator which was installed globally
on the system and then the name of the
folder or of the project in the folder
name will be the same so I will call
this shopping cart and I'll add a flag
HBS to set the
useful templating engine to handlebars
because I really like handlebars but if
you prefer another templating engine
you're free to choose that of course
so this scaffolds out this project and
if I now see the into this newly created
project and first I have to install all
the dependencies required for this to
work correctly we're running npm install
so the installation finished here and
what did it install a couple of required
for party packages like express itself
for example which are of course needed
for this application to work correctly
so with this in place i may now run npm
start to start the server and as a
little script which is provided by
express generator but all this does is
it runs the server setup
programmatically with no GS now that is
the important side note of course you
need to have no chairs installed on your
machine if you haven't already and order
to do that you might head over to no
chests or org and download latest stable
version for your operating system but
you probably do already have it that's
to be honest why I forgot to explain it
I think you are aware you need note when
looking at a no chest video but
nonetheless now that you got it an are
ready to go you should have your server
running and if you now access localhost
3000 for 3000 here with a colon you
should see this Express welcome to
Express page and this means that
everything is working and that's just
one of this these very basic routes the
Express generator ships with the Express
generator generated for as q well have
something to work with and to see that
everything works now if you are totaling
you two node and have no idea what is
going on here
I strongly recommend checking out my
basic notes yes which is I have on his
channel where I will explain what note
is how it works how a servers grid with
node how a request flows through an
Express application and much more so
definitely check this out in case you
are having any questions there now with
this basic project beings
set up here it's time to open it in your
editor of choice or your editor of or
your IDE of choice and I will use
phpstorm for this so here's the project
opened in phpstorm and it's a default
express noches project Express generator
generates for us and has just said I do
have videos explaining this structure
and how it works on this channel so
check out these videos if you're having
any questions about that
I'll also post the links to them in the
description now using handlebars in the
views folder we get this error HPS fault
this index dot h PS file at the layout
dot h PS file while the error file is of
course called reused when an error has
to be read or to the screen and I
believe dislike this for now the layout
HBS file if we open it holds the default
HTML skeleton and this is the file which
will be extended but all the average
view files if we not specify otherwise
so by default our view files will use
this basic skeleton and then render
their specific content in this body part
here so where we have is free curly
braces and in the body this is the hook
where the other views will come in and
render their content so for example this
index dot H PS file here this is the
view if we have a look in the routes
folder in next chairs file here this is
the route for currently accessing here
by the way because we may think of
having a slash at the end of this URL
and therefore we're reaching this route
here which just handles the route route
and here the index dot HBS file is
rendered so this file here and now I can
see this file only has a heading and a
paragraph but still it has some styling
as it seems and this is because as I
just explained this content gets
rendered instead or in the place where
this body hook here is provided software
acts
seeing here this page here is this
complete HTML document here with the
stylesheet and then the content
specified in the view being embedded
into this skeleton or into this layout
and this whole layouts work in pretty
much all templating engines and we also
have access to this functionality in
handlebars and that's important to know
because wrote this application I will
use this basic layout to provide an
overarching styling and structure and
not to repeat the code many and many
times of course so with that I can for
example change this from outputting some
kind of title here I will come back to
that in a second - hello there
saved us and now if I reload the page
you can see this text here so you can
immediately see how you can change your
views and how the content gets rendered
to the page now back to the question
what this title thing here is of the
double curly braces remember in the
layout i had the free column braces to
provide a hook for our views to insert
their content however i also do have the
title with the double curly braces in
the overall layout - like indy in extra
h vs file this syntax here is used to
output a variable passed from note c as
express queued view to be rendered to
the screen because our views of course
don't stay static they don't have static
content they output content which is
retrieved from the server which is the
result of some calculation or something
like this therefore this title actually
refers if we go back to the index dot JS
file responsible for rendering this view
refers to this title variable passed to
this view or pass to this render
function here now this render function
basically tells note or house express
hey please send back a response to the
browser containing the HTML code of this
index file and dot h PS is automatically
added since handlebars is set up as two
default view engine of this project but
not only send the actus HTML code here
but before sending it back replace all
hooks between double curly braces with
the appropriate or corresponding data
passed as a second argument in this
javascript object here so by having a
title variable here we can replace the
title variable here with value this
title variable is set to express for
example and this is why we can here see
welcome to Express if we replace Express
with shopping cart and save this we
won't see any changes because we didn't
restart our server therefore the code on
the server is still the old one or the
code running at least as still the old
one so in order to see change as we make
anywhere besides the view files we have
to restart a server and I will do this
by going to the terminal where I entered
NPM start and then I had control C to
stop this server now I could restarted
by running NPM start here but I will do
this in my ID here just to have quicker
access this is just a normal terminal
window automatically navigated into the
shopping cart folder so here if I run
NPM start does also restart the server
and now very load you can see welcome to
shopping cart so this works too so
that's the view basics here next I want
to do some cleanup I don't need the
users J's file because these
pre-populated routes are not something
I'll use and the app touch as file which
is the first place each request will
come to I will get rid of this users
variable which was well referring to
this users chairs file I just deleted
and if I scroll down here you can see
that we kind of parse some paths and
then redirect the request over to this
routes variable which refers to this
index.js file in the routes file or to
this
users variable which related to the
deleted file if the path was something
like slash users instead of just / or /
anything else than users but I won't
need that now so I will get rid of this
here and now I can again close my server
by hitting ctrl C and restart it with
NPM start so every load it still works
because I didn't change anything we
could see here just some cleanup being
done as a next step I want to bring
bootstrap in to have some basic styling
this application because well I won't
create a complete shop or a complete
online shop I will provide a shopping
page with the products I will later
provide a user login view the shopping
card and for all that I will need
styling and to be able to quickly create
a prototype I will use bootstrap to have
some styling out-of-the-box so I will
head over to get bootstrap calm
click on download bootstrap and I won't
download it I will grab the link to the
CDN here and back in the application I
will go to the layout on H PS file and
enter this file right above the import
here which light relates to the
stylesheet we may edit throughout this
application living in this public folder
and then style sheets so right above
this link here I will add the link to
the bootstrap package and I will also
bring in the bootstrap JavaScript here
to be able to control modal's and
something like this because you never
know when we will need this or for
example for the responsive navigation on
mobile phones with collapsing menus and
so and so always handy to have this here
we could always tell Lee that in case we
don't need later on but as I said I want
to be able to quickly create some
prototypes here and I will also
implement jQuery now I will also fetch
that from a CDN and I can do this by
scrolling down and then here clicking on
this kill jQuery comlink and I will
choose version 1 point x 1 point 12 in
my case here and then
version just wrapped this link here and
also entered this right above the
bootstrap script here at the bottom so
with this that is prepared and if I now
reload my page we see if the style
changes I will also go to these style of
CSS file here the custom style sheet
expressed generator ships with and
delete all these styles for now I will
later on add styles but for now I don't
want any so if I again reload I can see
that well it changed it certainly looks
worse but we will fix this a few seconds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
