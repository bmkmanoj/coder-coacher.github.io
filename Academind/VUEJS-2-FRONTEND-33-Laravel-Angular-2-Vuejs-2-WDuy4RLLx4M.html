input is safe and to cancel button if we
click the edit button before well before
showing it I guess I will go to the
quote dot view file and there I'll add a
new property in the data method I will
return an object as we should do it and
then here I will simply say or it
provide a property named editing which
is false by default so we're not an
editing mode by default however once I
click on this edit button here I want to
change this and we do execute on added
here so I will simply add a new property
here the methods to store the on edit
method and in there I want to set this
editing equal to true because that is
what we're doing now we also have some
value we are we need to bind to in this
input field here so this is another new
property I'll add and I'll simply name
it added value which will initially hold
the quote contents OD content of this
prop this QT prop here well and if we go
in editing mode I definitely also want
to make sure that the added value here
is assigned to this QT content because
if we did edit it before but cancel this
editing then we might have an average
value so if we restart editing I want to
reset the value back to the content off
this quote now with this we can already
enhance this by adding V if on this
first if which holds the input to only
show this if editing is true remember we
do set this to true if we click on on
edit and I'll also add on cancel here
well in on cancel I simply want to set
editing to false this is all I will do
here so that I now out of a way of
getting rid of this and here I'll also
add V if on the avert if therefore here
a check if we're not in editing mode to
then show this div with this in place
just looks much better let's now click
Edit let's get rid of all those warnings
errors and we'll reload the page well
that is simply because I still have all
those links
in there let's get rid of those links
here this ref attributes so let's try
this again we still get some arrows
because there still are some unhandled
events we will work on them soon let's
now click Edit and I'll fix the styling
of the cursor here soon now this works
again an error because unsafe doesn't do
anything it's not balanced so this is
there's a warning we actually should get
we can cancel to switch we we don't see
the content here though so binding added
value doesn't seem to work desert and
that simply is because I haven't set it
up here so we should add the model to
the input of course and bind to added
value so if there's some place let's try
this again or we already see that it now
works here let's reload the application
get the quotes added cancel added cancel
that seems to work to me now the missing
piece of course is to hook up all the
other buttons and I also quickly want to
fix this styling of the cursor when I
hover over those links now there are a
couple of ways to fix this I'll take the
easy way of simply adding the style here
I set it to scoped to limit it to this
component and override the a linker the
a element here to set the cursor to a
pointer like this so now we should get
the average styling if we reload here
yeah this looks better so we get this
let's look up all the other methods
namely on update and on delete so I'll
start with on the lead here here I want
to reach out to my server and send a
delete request so again we need Axios
for this and we could centralize this in
a central file for example that would be
perfectly fine I'll do it here in the
individual files but again you can
centralize this and an on delete I want
to access Axios it's delete method and
then we need the path to the back and
route where we need that back and route
we should trigger or we should target
with the delete request and that would
simply be your back end server
slash API slash quote but then we also
need to pass the idea of the quote you
want to delete if this is not clear have
a look at the back end again there we
set it up in a way that they'll delete
route needs the idea of the well element
we want to delete which makes sense I
guess well the good thing is we have
this ID on the quote object we not only
have to quote content which where I was
putting out putting in a template we
also have the ID at the ID decode has
and the database on the back end so we
can simply access cutie ID and this is
again a property available on the quote
if you're not sure where this comes from
check the back and again we're returning
the quote object which has an ID so this
is the delete route and this is actually
everything we need we can now also
implement then of course to print any
response we will get and of course also
catch to handle error any error we might
get so let's quickly do this and now
let's save this and see if this will
work if we now reload the page get our
quotes and click delete here this looks
good
it doesn't update our view here because
we haven't implemented any logic to do
so but we do get theory D response which
looks like it was deleted and actually
if we reload here and click get quotes
again we see that it's gone so this
works of course it would be nice to
update the view too and we need to make
this safe method work so here let's work
on this first on update is the method we
execute there and here we need to send a
put request again you can check this on
your level back and a put request is
what level expects here the URL we
should use here also is our back-end
server / api / quote and then also the
ID of the quote 1q change but then as a
second argument we also of course need
to pass the data we want to overwrite
the quote with well and here the quote
who want to overwrite it is simply a
JavaScript object which has a content
property and the content property
of course Bede added-value whatever we
entered there so this is what we will
send as data to this request and then
again I'll implement then to log any
response we will get and catch too well
catch any error we might receive
console.log the error so with this in
place we should now be able to change
that so let's reload our application
click get quotes edit this quote change
it to a new quote too and hit save we
get a response which looks like it was
successful we don't get a visual
feedback here in the project because we
haven't added such a logic if I reload
the application and click get quotes
again it looks like it was successful so
this is already very good now it would
of course be good to also see that being
updated here and the view if it click
heads click the Save button or as see it
being deleted if we click the delete
button
so let's actually finish our tiny view
front and here by adding these two
features let's start with the editing in
on update
we of course sent us to the server we
should also set the editing mode to
false again to to close this input
element to remove it from the DOM and we
should also adjust the content here
we're outputting right the content of
our quote now what we can do is we can
take our QT the proper getting and
overwrite its content with the added
value now we will get a warning when
doing so because you choose will
correctly warn us that this is only a
temporary overwrite it will be
overwritten by view choice whenever the
property in the parent component which
we're getting passed here in QT right
when that changes but that's ok for me
here so this is actually approach I will
go with here and with that on update
should be fine now in on delete I need
to make sure to get rid of the quote I
actually deleted here so for this I will
actually call the Amit method to omit my
own event quote deleted and pass the
quote ID as an
argument here on the Amit method well
with this I can go to the quote stock
view file and listen to my own event
here quote deleted like this this is the
name I chose your quote deleted this is
my own event I'm omitting in the quote
component and we can listen to that like
to any other event with the add shortcut
here and then quote delete it and
execute any code we want so on quote
deleted maybe this method here whoops
like this that be structured is our
multiple lines so that it's easier to
read so encore deleted in the quotes
component should get executed now so
that simply add this here on quote
deleted and the methods property and I
know that this passes some data which I
can fetch with the dollar sign event
variable a reserved word view chess
gives me to retrieve any data at this
event may hold and it will hold some
data the ID of the quote that's the
second argument we're passing here so I
can now pass this on here with dollar
sign event and I know that I will get
the ID here and on quote deleted because
again this is the data I'm omitting so
therefore here I can simply go to my
quotes array and splice one element now
the element a1 a splice has to be
identified
I can need to get the position of that
element and I can store this in this
constant and get it by accessing my
array and then find index will give me
the index of a specific element and to
find index we need to pass a method I
will use a es6 arrow function this
method will be executed on each element
in the array this is why I named this
argument element it will be passed in
automatically this is a normal Java
Script function and we need to return
something in this method we do mean
literature and true or false so again
find the index we'll run this method we
pass as an argument on every element in
the array and then this method needs to
return true or false which indicates is
the element you were looking for or not
and it is the element we were looking
for if the element ID keep in mind
element is just a single quote
since we're executing this on the quotes
array so if the idea of this quote
equals di D were passing here this gives
us the position of the quote you want to
delete and then we can use splice to do
just that splice this single element
with this applies let's reload one more
time and click delete again now it's
gone here and it's gone to you if we
delete it here let's add an average code
like this go back and load it this looks
promising 22 save this this looks
promising too if we load this looks good
delete that this is our finished view
front and I hope that this now shows you
how you can connect view chairs to a
level back into a level API back and I
should say I will also show you how to
embed view chairs in your normal level
views the blade views were using the
plate templating engine later in this
series here or in this playlist so this
is something you will learn - before
diving into disk though let's see how we
can take this approach for both angler
to end your chest and implement
authentication on this approach this is
what I will have a look at next see you
in the other videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
