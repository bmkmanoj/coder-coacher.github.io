want to have them in your application
because they allow your user to know
what he just did and where he is in your
application so it's more than a little
bonus in this video and some other
videos in this series here I want to
show you how to add some animations some
basic animations to your react chase
application now before we dive deeper
into these specific tools react offers
you it's important to understand how CSS
animations work without react so without
using any react specific tools and this
video we're going to build this little
application using the material CSS
framework with this card which we can
slip or slide so here I'm not using the
transition element or attribute I used
in the last video but I'm using the
built-in CSS animate attribute and the
CSS animations let's have a look how
these work in this video I'm back in my
very basic react application it's pretty
much the same as before I still have my
card and on this card I have my two
buttons flip and slide now I don't have
any Styles applied to discard besides de
CSS framework style so the material
styles here I do have some event
listeners when I click on the button
where I simply change my state a bit but
all I do have in my state are the slide
and flip properties which are both set
to false initially and then can be
switched to true or false when I click
the button to do animation but no
animation is triggered right now this is
the part we have to do now since this is
all setup let's start by understanding
how CSS animations work the difference
to transitions which we saw in the last
video is that now we don't tell CSS
please do a style change over a specific
time period but instead we tell CSS hey
we get this specific animation please
execute this animation that's a clear
difference we're not changing a style
and
Halla to do that over time we're
explicitly telling it please do that
animation and the animation we are
setting up gives us more flexiblity than
the transition element or attribute
views before not only that it also gives
us some opportunities or possibilities
we didn't have before so let's see how
to set up such a animation such as CSS
animation I'll start with the slide
animation and I want to start or set
this up in the index.html file where I
set up some style tags here but no
Styles in between I'm just doing this
here do not pollute my main dot chairs
file with styles so as I want to start
with the slide animation the question is
how do we tell CSS that we want to
animate a specific element well we do
that by simply adding a class which has
the animation style attached to it so
here I'll click create a new class
called slide and all this class does is
it attaches the animation element or
attribute here now be aware you could
add any normal CSS style you want
this is a normal CSS class here so you
could set the font size whatever you
like you're not limited to attaching
animation here the animation I want you
do here is let's say slide and we will
have to create it on our own because
there is no built in slide animation
then you can also add some other
attributes here this could be for
example the length of this animation you
can dynamically change this so let's say
I want to slide over one second then the
easing function and here let's say we
want to ease in and then you can also
specify the position this element should
have when d'être animation finishes so
with a transition in the last video you
always had the well new value as a final
result so if we change the opacity and
simply set up a transition of one second
then it would slowly fade in or fade out
but then it would keep this status it
would stay faded in or faded
now with the animation the default is to
revert it so if we slide element then
after finishing the animation it will
jump back that could be desired behavior
but it could also not be so if you want
to keep the final state and say the
element should stay where I animated it
to then you have to add four words here
this simply tells CSS keep the final
animation state alternative values would
be revert or alternate which allows you
to replay the animation then you could
also specify how often you want to do
this like alternate two would tell CSS
do the animation twice and simply
alternate so slide to the right slide to
the left finished that would be another
choice
now here I'll choose four words to stick
to the final result if you want to learn
more about CSS animations I strongly
check out one of the many tutorials you
can find on the web which dives deeper
into this and the attributes you can set
up here I only want to give a basic
introduction here so that we're able to
use them with react.js later on now the
issue we have here is this slide
animation here doesn't exist yet so we
have to create it specifically we will
create a couple of key frames which are
individual points during the animation
where we can specifically tell CSS which
attribute should have which value at
which point of time so that is really
flexible and why the animation attribute
here gives us a broader flexibility than
the transition element we used in the
last video so here I will add new
keyframes and I do this with at
keyframes this is normal CSS code and
here I'll name it slides and system
image shows above here in my slide class
for the animation now to set up
keyframes we got a couple of options the
easiest way is to set up from and then
two like this and as you might imagine
you can set up these styles you want to
start
at any from part and then the stars you
want to have at the end at the to part
and you can animate multiple styles you
can even be more specific than that
you can work with percentages so you
could say zero percent which is the same
as from so at the start and then you
could add 50 percent which is in the
middle and then of course you could add
100 percent which is in at the end and
you can also add any other percentages
in between not just these free
so here I'll stick to 0 and 100 percent
even though that's the same as from and
to and then since you want to slide here
what I want to do is I want to transform
so does the default transform attribute
normal CSS attribute here and I want you
to translate X which means move it on
the x axis not y axis x axis and I want
to start at 0 percent which is the
position the element by default has so
it means start at the position the
element has anyways but then I want to
animate it to another position which is
why I add transform translate X and then
let's say 80 pixels which will move it
to the right 80 pixels you could of
course also use 100 percent here to move
it by the width of the element or 1000
pixels or even more whatever you like so
choose the width you want to choose here
this will be the distance it will slide
over with this we set up to slide
animation and any element which has the
slide class will now perform this
animation I can share this to you by
attaching the slide class to our card
here oops that's the card so let me add
slide here and if we now reload the page
you see it slide over that's nice but we
want you to trigger this when clicking
this button and not when loading the
page well maybe you want to do this when
loading the page but I don't want to do
it here so I want you to die Namek li
add this class here and not always so I
want to add this class when this slide
button ear was clicked which will then
set the
slide property in our state to true so I
can use the slide property in the state
to determine if we should slide or not
if you should add this class or not
therefore I will go to this class name
here and change it a bit I will wrap it
in curly braces to take control wire
react.js and then I want to add my
conditional classes to this string the
first thing I'll do is I'll add a white
space at the end otherwise I would
attach my class and I am right next to
this class name and build a new class
name which doesn't exist so make sure to
have a white space here then I'll add a
plus to concatenate something to that
string and the thing I want to
concatenate here is simply if this state
slide this is just check if that is true
then I want to attach the slide class
otherwise attach nothing so I'm using
this ternary expression here to check if
slider set to true if yes I will add
slide to that string if no I will add
nothing to that string so the slide
class will only be added if I click this
button if I save this and go back you
see up on reloading it's not sliding but
once I click this button it does slide
notice that it doesn't slide back if I
click here since I haven't implemented
this functionality but you see it slides
over when I click the button awesome now
I want to achieve the same for the flip
button here so in order to do this I
will go back to the index.html file and
I need to add a new animation here the
flip animation so here I'll first add a
new class and I'll name it flip of
course these names are totally up to you
I'll again add the animation attribute
and I will name this animation flip also
this name is up to you let's flip it
over two seconds here and ease it out
and now let's say ultra naté twice to
flip it over and flip it back notice the
difference to reword is that with reword
it would snap back whereas with
alternate - it will smoothly anim
so let's build D keyframes or set up the
keyframes for this flip animation here I
will all use 0% and 100% even though you
could use from 2 of course as before and
when flipping I also want to transform
the element but now I won't transform
the position I'm not moving it on the X
or Y axis instead I will rotate it and
here we can also rotate X which means
rotate over the x axis which means
towards you or away from you or rotate Y
which will rotate it like this so X Y
awesome they're really cool you can see
me here otherwise this would have been
impossible
so routed Y and then here you pass the
degrees by which you want to rotate well
I want to rotate by zero degrees
initially because I want to keep it in
the position has but once we reach 100%
so at the end of the animation I want to
rotate it to 180 degree so that we have
flipped it now with that we set up the
flip animation I can now do the same as
with the slide animation I want to
conditionally attach this class so I'm
copying this pasting it in here but now
instead of slide I'll use the flip
property and attach the flip class also
notice then with when clicking slide
I set flip to false and when clicking
flip I set slide to false so then we can
wreak lick the other animation if I save
this app should already have been loaded
I can click flip I can now wait it flips
back I can click this again but this
doesn't do anything because the flip
class already is applied I have to slide
first which will remove this of course
you can take this as a challenge and
change this so this is the animation I
get here and with that you got the
basics about how transitions and
animations work if you need even further
basics definitely check
some additional tutorials on that I'll
also include some links in the video
description which will help you with
that
with that let's move on and learn about
some reaction spesific tools which
support as when using animations in a
react.js application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
