video in this channel if you look around
this channel you'll see a lot of coding
videos and don't get me wrong I love
coding but mixing it up from time to
time is a very good idea
and if you ask me one thing I like most
about being a freelancer is that I can
pick my projects that I can decide how I
approach a project and that I can
generally control how I work that that
is something I really really enjoy and
if you sit in front of a desk coding in
the same language for 10 to 12 hours a
day that can get very annoying and of
course I do have those prints too but I
really love it if I also get to do some
designing work creating a web design for
a client creating some assets or doing
something completely different if you
look at my Vita you might recognize that
I've not always rich the developer I
started Business Administration I worked
in a bank and like consultancy and it's
that mix that I really love now back to
this video what will we do in this
series we will have a look at Photoshop
and illustrator where is it this way
I hope it's this way this way so
whatever Photoshop and illustrator are
two very important to it when doing web
design - and we will learn what the
differences are what we do in Photoshop
what we do in Illustrator and obviously
how to use those tools we will trade a
lot of examples this will be not really
a serious which is let's say 20 videos
long but it will be ongoing we will
create different assets different kind
of designs mix it up with some coding so
really really fun serious now let's have
a closer look at Photoshop and
illustrator in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
