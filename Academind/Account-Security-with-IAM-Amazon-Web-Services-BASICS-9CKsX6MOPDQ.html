from my AWS serious now after creating
an account and hosting our first web
application in this video I'll have a
look at how we can secure our account
because we want to make sure that no one
else is using our account with our
services therefore makes us pay let's
have a look at how this works and how
AWS handles account level security in
this video
I'm in my brand-new account and to
control the security of that account we
can visit I am that's a service which
you can enter into this service search
bar and it stands for Identity and
Access Management so we have a whole
service dedicated to keeping our account
secure now that is of course important
because your account is very valuable
you add your credit card and there are a
lot of services which can get expensive
if you use them wrong or even worse if
some wrong wrong uses them so how does
AWS handle a security and important with
that I'm not talking about application
security you as a system administrator
or developer are responsible for making
your apps and your systems secure AWS
helps you with that for example it
automatically protects you against basic
DDoS attacks but beyond that that's your
task here we're talking about giving the
right permissions to the right people or
services and these are two important
things one yes people more than one
person can use the account you are the
account holder but of course if you're
an organization you might have multiple
developers and other people who should
use this account since we have analytics
services services for spinning up
virtual machines services for file
storage there might be different teams
in your company which use these services
so you can get the access to different
users if you visit this page here on
Identity and Access Management it
probably looks like this if there's a
new account your security status doesn't
look that good because there are a
couple of things you can improve before
we turn towards that let's understand
how this access and permission thing
generally works we get groups we get
users roles and policies you can see
that on the left here now I said you can
add multiple users and you can put these
users into groups can for example create
an admin group with full admin rights
and then you could create one which is
only allowed to access as free and store
files there you can even be more
granular than that and only allow a
certain group
to access a certain bucket like a folder
you could say in as free to add and
change spots there or only give it
read-only access you can be very
granular let's create a new group here
so let's click on groups click create
new group and then let's give it a name
and all I'm going to create a admin
group so group with full admin rights
let's do that
and let's search for or actually it's
the first one
let's pick admin access here so with
that let's now click create group and we
have a new group now you might ask why
would I create a group with admin rights
if I am already the admin well for one
if you want to give more people admin
rights and secondly the people here
won't have exactly the same rights as
the root user there are some things for
example related to billing which you
still can't access with these admin
rights here now that's nice and a good
practice which we also are informed
about on the dashboard is that we create
users and don't and that's important
don't use our root account except for
maybe accessing our billing information
or stuff like that but we shouldn't
really use it for our day-to-day
business instead we should create a user
for ourselves and we can do this here
under users and then click add user
obviously now here give it a name and
this can be any name you like I'll
choose Maximilian dot Schwarz lor that's
just my name but you can use any
username you like you can also add more
users in one step
now here the access type is important we
can choose between programmatic access
and AWS management console access what's
the difference well we are in the
console and we really just want to
decide here if there's a user who is
mainly or only interacting with AWS
through that console then this checkbox
here is all we need but maybe you also
want to interact with the AWS services
from the command line interface for
example a tool you can download that's
especially important for developers you
can then write some commands to for
example push new code on to AWS or
anything like that then you want to
check this too and this will then give
you a key value pair you can
use for these operations that's advanced
I won't cover it in this video but with
these keys you'll be able to do or to
programmatically access your services
next you can choose a password or let
AWS generate one you can require a
password reset by that user and then
let's click Next
now here we have to define which
permissions we want to give to the user
the best practice is to simply add the
user to a group because we already
define permissions on group level but we
could also attach policies directly to
the user so we could make this user an
admin or whatever I'll just choose the
group here though and then simply click
Next so this is all looking good to me
and now I can click create user and now
with that this is the overview page and
here is you can view your password the
password which was generated for you and
you can even send an email to yourselves
with you login instructions that might
be interesting it's this language you
now have to use in the future queue
login into your account and then you
will need that username you just created
and that password so with that I will
close that and not login with the user
for now and let's go back to the
dashboard before we have a look at roles
and policies so we see our security
status improved now what we can do is we
can activate multi-factor authentication
and I strongly recommend doing that if
you plan on using that account nothing
is stronger than having a second step
here during authentication so that even
if your password gets owned you have
that fallback that the person who stole
the password still contacts the account
now this is something you can also
activate and you should activate for the
individual users so as soon as you do
login with the newly created user go to
the page and enable MFA for that user to
and you should apply an IM password
policy so that users who are now
resetting their password are required
for example if an applicant character
lowercase number
complex passwords potentionally let it
expire and so on with this set the only
thing missing is MFA's I'm going to do
this after recording and we made our
account much more secure especially once
we start using that user we just created
now what about roles and policies then
well we had a look at policies we
assigned a policy to the group there's
administrator access policy here we can
have a look at policies to see all the
already existing ones and we can also
create our own policy policies simply
define sets of rules and if we have a
look at a policy we can even load it
it's written here in JSON this is how
policy looks like you basically define
the version of the policy language here
and then you have statements in this
case only one where you have an effect
that you want to low something then what
here everything on what on everything a
more detailed or more specific policy
would for example be one where we search
for elastic Beanstalk here if you have a
look at the elastic Beanstalk fold
service policy we see now we have a
couple of actions which are allowed for
example here on ec2 to do anything on
ec2 and then on all resources so that we
can start all possible easy two
instances in this case for example so
this is how such policies look you can
create them on your own and use them to
manage access now what our role stand
because we have users and we have groups
and we have policies which you can
assign to groups or users or implicitly
to users through groups but what our
roles by default in your AWS account no
service has any permissions to access
other services you might wonder why
would a service access other services
what about Beanstalk we was being sought
but in the end Beanstalk is just a
simplification behind the scenes it
started an ec2 instance so a virtual
machine and it did so they
it has the permissions to do so we gave
it that permission implicitly when we
started using it through the console by
default though no service has any
permissions to access our services and
if you have for example code on your ec2
instance which wants to reach out to as
free to store files there you need to
give easy to the role to do so and that
is the last step roads can be attached
to services so that your services can
have certain roles which allow them to
interact with other services some of
them as with elastic Beanstalk are
assigned dynamically when you do use
them automatically but others have to be
assigned and especially they have to be
assigned if all of that happens
programmatically if you write code which
acts as an average service from within
the number one then roles come into play
and that is how I am works how a
security on account level works you give
permissions and you define who is able
to do what and the best practice is to
be as granular and strict as possible
don't give more permissions than a user
or a role needs that is a good practice
now some of the things like roles here
are a bit advanced you don't really need
them with your chest starting off but it
never hurts to you know right away how
that works and how you do use it if you
get more serious and if your application
grows now we probably will see one or
two opera throughout this series when we
start working with AWS but even if we
don't keep it as mind and one thing you
should definitely do is secure your
account make it secure add multi-factor
authentication use users don't risk
losing it or inviting other people to
access it that could be costly so see
you in the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
