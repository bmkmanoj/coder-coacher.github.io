we're going to dive into flex box which
is a CSS concept or a display type like
block or inline block which makes
designing websites really really easier
basically it's a concept where the
container itself which is defined as a
flex box will align its children so all
elements within this container in a way
we specify and which allows us to really
well flexible position all those items
and what we had to do in the past with
floats and clear fixes and all kind of
hacks and stuff is really really easier
reflects box and so let's just get into
it as you can see I got something
prepared here on plunker it's just a
basic HTML document and I get a
container here with four elements
operatives in this case inside it these
two boxes are identical and I will play
around with the bottom one and I we can
always see the comparison to the top one
now in our style that CSS oops both
containers are declared as flex elements
and that means they are flex boxes so to
say and we need to set display flags to
be able to use all the fun flex stuff on
any items within them as well as the
container itself otherwise this will not
work now the first thing I'll show you
is a property called flex direction and
was what this property does is set the
direction by which these elements will
be ordered so right out of the box the
Flex Direction is row and that means
that these elements appear in columns in
one row
so to say it's one row so if I set us to
row nothing will change now we also have
ro reverse which means that the ordering
is reversed and now we let all elements
start at the right of our row and flow
to the left so you can see the
comparison to their normal arrow at the
top as you might be able to think we not
only got row we also got column with one
L for better fitting and as you can see
column will change it in that way that
we only have one column and all elements
will be stacked in rows within that
column and as you might have already
guessed we also got wrote a column re
worse which is basically the same as
relievers just in the column so with
Flex direction we're really able to
control the flow of our elements within
a container and do easy reordering and
stuff like this i watch just set it back
to row for the moment and now I will
change something in our index dot HTML
and I will add some additional items
okay so I now added some items and as
you can see now the whole container is
full and then we still have one row
right now we can add flex rap rap to it
and this will make it so that no longer
will everything shrink like it is the
case here but each block will contain
through dimensions and instead the
elements will wrap so in the top we get
the case that flexbox will automatically
shrink down our elements so they fit
into your container well in the bottom
it does not shrink anymore because we
allow it to actually wrap now obviously
we can also set it to no rap and get the
behavior from before so the standard is
no rap we also got rap reverse and as
you can see this will reverse the
ordering so now number one is the bottom
left and then we go to the right until
there is no space for number five to the
right here and then it will be placed
above so I'm not sure how often you're
going to use rap reverse but you can't
it's there now these two properties can
also be written combined in just one
property flats flow which allows us to
specify first direction row and then if
it is allowed to rap or not so I would
just put it back to know rap for the
moment now i'm just going to edit it
back so that we have a little bit of
extra space available
just like that and now what if you want
the content not to be stacked to the
left but to stretch out over the whole
area that's no problem with flexbox we
can chest that just to find content to
it and then we got several options here
the default is flex start that's why
nothing changed we can change it to flex
and which will push it up to the right
to the end of the container but we also
get the possibility to set it to the
center now we got equal Martians to the
left and right we could also set it to
space between which will align it to the
very left and very right but leave equal
Martians between the elements and we
also enters the last possible well you
have space around now this makes it that
the first and last element aren't
exactly aligned to the left and right
but instead that everything is nicely
spaced out so this is a really cool
feature and I see that being used very
often in the future because with justify
content you're really able to create
cool layouts flexible layouts nice
navigation bars and don't have to use
all those floats and stuff which right
more than often mess up anything in your
layout so that is a really cool feature
I will just get rid of it so that we go
back to our default and um let me show
you another cool feature which is a line
items so we just got justify content
which aligns or which is spices the
elements out and the width of our
container so to say oh and that is very
important to you it's only the width
because we gotta flex flow flow of rows
if we were to have a column flow
then if you go back to justify content
and set it to flex and it's no longer to
the right but to the bottom so
everything that was right for the
horizontal dimension when we had row as
direction will now be transformed to the
vertical direction when we set the
direction to column now back to row and
align items now a line items allows us
to specify how these elements will use
the space they got in a vertical
dimension or put an arrow word where
it's how they will stretch out to the
top and bottom if we have a direction of
row or to the left and right if we have
a direction of color so by default we
have a value of stretch which means
stretch out fill all the space you got
but we can set it to flex start which
means no only take your height and if we
go back here and increase the height
like like that we can see okay this one
is higher than the other ones we all
have flex end which pushes it to the
bottom we get center
and we got baseline baseline means it's
aligned at the baseline of the text
inside the content so as you can see the
difference to flex start is that we got
this little margin at the top here for
the smaller containers because we're
aligning here on the numbers and not on
the top of our boxes now with justified
content and the line items as well as to
flex directions row and column we get a
lot of possibilities to align and
justify items and to really play around
that is what makes flexbox really cool
and yeah when it name say is flexible
now I just added two new boxes five and
six set the wrapping back to allow
wrapping and also will set a line items
to stretch so that in this case the
height of all items takes all the
available space now I did this to show
you another property named align content
align content works the following way we
can also set flex start here and that
means all items should be pushed up to
the top and as you can see stretch does
not work anymore because this kind of
overrides that entails the item items
how they shoot a line in this case
vertically because always remember we
got a direction of row if we change it
to column get the same project picture
horizontally
we can also set it flex and which will
align to the bottom of our container and
we got also center stretch space around
space between so this is equivalent of
justify content just for the other axis
where justified content would make sure
that everything is well justified and
spaced out in the direction we specified
here so in one row for example a line
content will do the same for the other
axis so we got a direction of Rho online
content will take care of the spacing in
the column and wise words are if we had
column here then align content with you
to spacing in the row whereas justify
content would take care of the column so
you got line and justify content space
between so this one is Rho access
because of row direction and this one is
the column access and also only because
of row direction so this is really
important that you don't get these mixed
up but together you can make really cool
things so that's it for the container
flex classes and in the next video we're
going to have a look at the children
flex properties because remember that
everything we did in this video was just
inside the container class so all the
flex properties we added and and and
changed were part of the container and
we didn't touch the children yet
but there are some flex properties which
have to be specified on the children on
the individual boxes with in a flex
container to work and we will look at
this in the next video see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
