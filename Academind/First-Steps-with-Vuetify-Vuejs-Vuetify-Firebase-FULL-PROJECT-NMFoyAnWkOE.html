and in the last video of this series we
actually got started with our beautiful
project we installed it and now we have
it here I open that in webstorm and if
we have a look at the running project
this is how it looks like now that's
default setup and as you can see it
already ships with a lot of components
and I don't want to use these instead
I'll go to my app but view file and here
I will simply start by deleting
everything which is in there now I will
re add some of these things
I'll also delete everything in my data
here but I want to start with a clean
project and then I add the things step
by step so that you really well see what
we use and why we use it so doesn't the
cleanup project if we now save this this
certainly is a little bit leaner now
let's start adding elements and you see
a left EVF element here now generally
all these beautiful components I'm going
to use start with we - and a good place
to learn more about beautify obviously
is their official page beautify
chase.com there if you click on get
started you can get detailed
explanations on all kinds of components
you might use how would you use them you
get examples you can have a look at and
at the bottom of each page you see the
different props you can set up and so on
so really an important page when working
with beautify is also another important
note over the course of the series or by
the point of time you're watching this
video the version of Butte approaches
might have changed and some things might
not work the same definitely always have
a look at the latest release notes of
beautified shares if something is broken
I'll also try to add annotations in the
video description if possible to point
you towards potential issues and with
that you should get a working project
again right now everything should work
though so this is give you deployed
chest page and I want to start by
populating the main page with some life
again I also want to change the default
colors though because if you have a look
at it
well now it's white but if you remember
the old state it was really great and
thankfully we can set our own theme in a
beauteous project for that theme we can
choose from many colors which you can
find on the official page under style
colors these are all the material colors
and these are basically the CSS classes
you can add to any element to add this
as a color for the element however you
can also set up a main theme for your
application to give your overall
application a certain style without you
having to add these individual classes
to all elements you're going to use more
information can of course be found under
the theme section here and there you see
you can choose between a light and a
dark theme now in order to be able to
see that we need some components though
so before diving into theming why don't
we add some components again in our
applet view file again we have to be app
component and that basically wraps your
entire app it's that simple
this really is all now in sight that we
have you can add different things for
example a main element this is not a
beautified shared component this is a
normal HTML element in this main element
we'll place our main content so the D
content we're going to display in our
application so you might wonder well
what's outside of the main element then
well all the content of our application
but basically our navigation so the
static content which is the same for
every page which isn't dynamic the
dynamic content goes into main and we'll
add a navigation above main now I want
to have a responsive navigation with a
hamburger menu for smaller devices in
the toolbar with icons and buttons for
bigger devices so why don't we start
adding that and we actually got a B -
toolbar component and beautify cheese
which you can use so let's add that
toolbar and let's see if we already can
see something after adding this well we
can't see it right here right it's great
so you might have over seen it but this
was actually added this bar here at the
top now you can already see that we can
switch
theme on the app element by default it's
the light theme can switch to the dark
theme which will change the overall look
of your page might not be the look you
want to use but you can do that changes
the background color and the color of
your toolbar now we're going to change
this color anyways later so I'll revert
to the light theme for now that's the v2
are now in the toolbar I want to have
certain elements to display and these
elements actually are the icons or DVD
navigation elements we'll have but it's
also the brand for example now in a V
toolbar component we can add a V toolbar
title component now you might be
wondering how do I know all these
components and how do I know how to use
them in which way well if you go back to
the beautify chest page there under
components to scroll down to the tool
bar here you'll find some examples which
you can simply check out and there you
will already see the structure I'm using
here like using a be toolbar title
inside of the toolbar this part here at
the bottom of this page as I mentioned
earlier you'll also see a full
explanation of all the properties you
can set but here you'll also see the
different elements under functional here
v toolbar title and so on so this is
where I got this from but the best way
to learn it really are the various
examples you can have a look at to see
the code of well what you're seeing on
screen here back to our element we add
up the V toolbar title component and
with that we can of course set our title
and I'll name our app death meetup now
if I save this and we go back to the
application now we see a nicely aligned
and styled title on that toolbar which
already is pretty great now remember
that I also wanted to add some links
later or for now simply some dummy
buttons which won't do anything but
which will represent our navigation
later on that's very easy to do too
can simply add the buttons and again
that is as for all components something
you can find out on the official
documentation we want to add buttons to
the navigation to the toolbar and
actually you don't even have to go to
the buttons component to know that you
can simply have a look at this example
again and here you see the V buttons you
also see the V toolbar items component
here which we use to wrap these buttons
and of course we can add this too so
here in the toolbar I'll actually remove
the button for now and add B toolbar
items to wrap all the items which
basically are not the title or some
other element which I'll come back so
here I'll now add my button and again we
can take the structure from here the
button and basically then add a text
like for example view meetups and here
we save this we don't have to add the
flat attribute as a side note that just
changes how the button is displayed come
back to this tube we save this we see
the button here sitting right next to
that title and also this button style
might not be the one we want that takes
us back to the different button styles
which we can now learn on the detailed
documentation page of how to pattern
there you click on it you see the
different kinds of buttons like flat
buttons which don't have a border
basically raised buttons which have a
border and a tiny shadow and then some
other buttons you may use now the flat
button actually makes sense on the
navigation so why don't we add flat here
and to get some space in between our
title and the toolbar items there
actually is a V space or a helper
component which allows us to distribute
this because behind the scenes B
toolbars uses flexbox VCS as concept
flex box and in Flex box by default here
all the items are aligned to the start
however if you add a spacer in between
it will add some well space between the
title and the our elements so if we save
it with this setup here
you will see that in our application now
it's pushed all the way to the right and
that it now has this flat look which
looks better in my opinion we can even
enhance this a bit more though we could
go to that button here and it could add
an icon to it to do this I simply add
inside of this button up besides the
text I add the V icon component now
again that is provided by beautified as
all the elements starting with V dash we
have a look at the beautified
documentation we actually see I can bust
nose here to here for example but we
also have a dedicated article about
icons to click on that we find a link to
the material icons page which allows us
to find all the icons supported by the
materials style guide or by the material
style and here you can choose any I can
you find appropriate for the element you
are about you create so for our example
here of the view meetups we can find a
fitting icon for dad what would make
sense for viewing meetups obviously
there are a lot of icons which might
make sense but I think the supervisor
account here would also make sense so we
can take this or remember this name
actually also click on it and copy it
and go back to our application at this
in between the icon without that extra
information here though and important to
remove the white space turn it into an
underscore with that if you now reload
the application you have two icon here
however it's it's really close to the
text and that might also not be the
behavior you're looking for that is an
issue though we simply have to add a
directive QD icon which is called left
in this case and should be setting left
of the text by adding this it beautifies
made aware that it probably is next to a
text and that we wanted some spacing in
between so now you see this looks much
better and that's how you could build
your menu I will come back to building
the menu a later
so right now I want to jump to another
menu we have to build the responsive one
the hamburger menu we need for mobile
devices because right now we only have a
toolbar and it won't auto collapse if I
open my developer tools and shrink the
page you see it's not collapsing so this
alone doesn't give us a responsive
design in order to add a responsive
design we need to add a different
component to beautify actually we can
look for one in the beautify
documentation there you can go to
layouts and predefined to learn about
some common layouts you use and actually
we're also using one this year's default
application market but now we can have a
look at which layout would fit our needs
this one has some drawer but I actually
know that there is one which I like more
I like the temporary floating one here
which floats the navigation drawer over
our main content I really like that a
lot of course you can choose any other
setup here so let's expect the source
code for this setup and here we see
quite a lot of elements we see our tool
bar here which we already added as one
extra element though we still have to
add but then we see that all this part
here at the top is responsible for
rendering this navigation drawer as it
is called this side menu which slides in
death decibel user is all component DB
navigation drawer component again under
components you would find a dedicated
article and inside this drawer
we're nesting another component made
available by beautifying the b-list
component also to be found in that
components documentation now here you
see how such a list could be structured
and how it could look like I'll simply
create a almost comparable list a bit
easier though to find the style I'm
looking for I'll go to components and
their twist and now here I don't want to
have an avatar or something like that
what you have all I can in my list
though so I basically want you will
build this style here where I have a
list with an action which holds an icon
and then the content which is a text and
I don't need the avatar
so what did we gathered all the
information we need now let's build this
step by step for that I'll go back to my
application and now outside of the
toolbar that's important
add your navigation drawer which was the
navigation drawer just like that now the
navigation drawer alone doesn't do much
it also meets you be connected to
something which opens it basically we
can use v-model for this we can use this
because beautifly set this component up
to be bindable via v-model
and here we have to connect it to a
property which holds a boolean if that
boolean is true the menu will be opened
if it's false it will be not shown it's
closed here I'll name this side nav and
of course I have to add this
so here I'll add it in my data object
and I'll set it to false initially so
that it's closed now of course we need a
way to open this now and four days I now
will add another element to my toolbar
here next to the title I'll add a V
toolbar side icon and that's element you
could also find on this predefined
layouts page I showed you a second ago
this adds a hamburger icon that is what
it does and this is dedicated for
opening the drawer basically we still
have to connect it though so what we do
here on that side icon is we add a click
listener we add a click listener where
we want to set side nav to what is
currently not so if sign app is true we
will set it to false and the other way
around to close or open the drawer if we
do that and we save this let's have a
look at our application we see the
hamburger menu there and actually of
course we should add it in front of the
title here to have it on the left
like this if they click this you see
nothing happens though we also don't get
an error so what's going wrong here
actually this is related to a change you
chase introduced in view 2.1 I guess
that clicks on components by default
don't propagate up they don't give you
this native click event you can still
easily get it though by adding a
modifier which is dot native with dad
you're telling view if I'm clicking on
the component give me the native Dom
click event now with that we should be
able to listen to that so let's click
this and something changed we get the
backdrop at least so somehow half of the
drawer is loaded but the drawer itself
is missing dad is related to another
thing we did with this click there click
on the backdrop actually also dismisses
the drawer and it turns out that if we
open the drawer with a click listener we
automatically dismiss it because our
click now propagates up and it's also
consumed by the drawer component which
then again dismisses the drawer so we
have to add another modifier to stop
modifier to stop the propagation now
with that we should make sure that we
only handle a click on the level of this
button and we get the drawer of course
it's empty though because we haven't
added anything in there you
theoretically can now add what you want
but a typical thing is a list which
displays really nicely inside the drawer
so in that navigation drawer we can
create a list with we - list now with
that we basically add or set up a list
now we can start adding items we do that
by adding V list tiles each tile is
basically a row in the list you could
say and this tile now can hold a V list
tile action action is like the icon in
our case so here I'll add a V icon and
now again I will pick this supervisor
account I can here because it worked out
really well and of course
to replicate my toolbar menu in the list
now because I need to have the same menu
invoked responsive and the unresponsive
approach at least in this application so
we have the supervisor account and next
to the realize a list tile action all
now at the b-list tile content and if
that is super confusing with all these
components you'll get into that really
quickly it's just a matter of practicing
and using do defy a bit and you always
have the official documentation to have
a look at if your stack or if you're not
sure which elements you should use so we
list tile context now will hold the
actual text like view meet us and now if
I save this and we go back to the
application
you already see it here due to hot
reloading can also reload now we see our
list item here so now we have a
responsive menu and we have the normal
toolbar we can now also add CSS classes
to make sure that we only display what
we want to display so only display the
toolbar menu if we are on a big screen
and display the drawer and the hamburger
icon on smaller screens that is super
simple to do we can simply go to that
hamburger menu here and add a CSS class
to it and I'll let those over multiply
to make it easier to read this class
needs to control whether this icon is
shown or not and if we have a look at
the official beautify documentation you
can find it under layout you actually
have this display part here you find
classes which allow you to control
whether something is displayed on a
certain screen resolution or not which
of course is key to creating responsive
designs for example we want to hide that
hamburger menu let's say on everything
which is a small device you can see the
definitions for device sizes on the grid
page here as a side note here small is
greater than 600 pixels so we can
basically hide it on small devices or
bigger with the hidden SM and up class
here and if you only want to hide it on
medium sizes and up well then you would
choose
this one so I'll go with hidden SM and
up go back to the application and add
this as a CSS class to my hamburger menu
of course the toolbar items on the other
hand should be hidden on small devices
so here we can add a class which is
hidden XS only to only hide it on very
small devices here with that if we now
save this you see we have no hamburger
icon on this screen size but if I
decrease the size now we get the
hamburger and we get no more item here
in our toolbar so now I can choose from
the hamburger icon from the navigation
drawer this is the basic set above one I
use now I also want to change the
styling the theme and I did mention that
we could do this with beautified it's
actually simple to do for one we can add
CSS classes to change colors and we can
pick colors from the style colors page
if we wanted to turn our toolbar into a
purple toolbar we could pick up fitting
purple maybe purple darken one can just
copy that here go to our code and on the
toolbar we can add a normal CSS class
where we apply the two classes we just
copied with dead if we go back now it
turns purple you will also see of course
that now all the text cells black so
that might not be the contrast you're
looking for we can simply fix this by
assigning dark directive to the toolbar
this will mark this as using a dark
theme and by doing that it automatically
turns the text into white text as you
can see now to also convert the icon
color here we have to go to that I can
here is our button and there we can now
also add the dark theme to inform it
that it's sitting on a dark background
and you see this turns it into white
cube so this is how you work with that
you give beautify the information is the
dark or a light color the one you're
assigning here
and with that information beautiful I
will adjust the text and the displaying
of icons and zone automatically as we
did here so this is one step now as I
said it would also be nice if you could
adjust the overall theme of our
application and not just work with CSS
classes we apply like this for that we
can visit that stylus folder and there
we get the main dot style file now
stylus is a CSS preprocessor just like
sass would be and you don't have to use
it you can though since it by default is
set up to be usable in this beautiful
project you will have to use it if you
want to override the theme though and a
detailed guide on overwriting the theme
can also be find a found on the beautify
page under oops it was under style theme
here if you scroll down you actually see
the setup you'll need to have in the end
this one here now what's happening here
let's copy this import because we
already have two second one in our main
style file and then I'll explain what
these two imports do this one the bottom
one basically imports the beautified
styles and your file happily uses
variables so our goal is to override
some variables before this gets imported
because since all of this gets built
dynamically here in our build workflow
with that we can change the styling of
the build CSS file now we can overwrite
variables here if you want to use the
material colors though we need to import
that colors file from the beautify
package which simply also stores various
colors we saw on the colors page in
their own variables and what we can now
overwrite the theme variable which is
one which will get used in that main
file and assign our own colors let's
choose the one I just copied if we save
this and we actually remove the purple
class on our toolbar and we go back to
our application you now see it's black
but that is not due to our theme but
because we added the dark theme to the
toolbar here how can we make our
teamwork then
well by default you chase or beautify it
we'll choose the black or the light gray
look however since we set up our own
theme with our own primary colors and so
on we can go to the after view file and
still apply a CSS class here however we
can just use primary now could have you
set the four but with the tree which has
used defaults now we're using our own
primary class or our own primary style
as we set it up in our theme file and we
can use it anywhere in our application
now you see we have this red colored
toolbar due to our own theme being
applied this is where I want to stop in
this video in the next video we're going
to finish this menu both menus this one
and the responsive one we'll learn how
we can dynamically populate these menus
and thereafter we'll start diving into
the core functionalities of this
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
