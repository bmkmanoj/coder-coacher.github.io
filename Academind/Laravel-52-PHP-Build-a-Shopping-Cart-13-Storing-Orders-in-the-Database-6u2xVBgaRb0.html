end of this serious so to say and our
shopping cart application here looks
really good already we will get our
products here and can add multiple
products to the cart then we can go to
our shopping cart you can check out we
can enter some testator here then like
this enter any credit card number here
and then a valid expiry date and you see
we see anything about by now now well
then we're buying this and of course
technically all are doing here is making
a charge with stripe and then we're
clearing the shopping cart so one big
thing that a certainly missing is kind
of well storing the order right now
while if the customer purchases
something we're not informed we can't
see the order it's not stored in our
database therefore yes we get the money
but the customer isn't getting that much
and we have no way of knowing what the
customer actually bought therefore I
want to conclude this series by making
sure that we're actually storing the
purchase in the database that we're
restoring an order and yes I know you
could add thousands of our things you
could add a whole admin dashboard which
allows us to create products and so on
but keep in mind this is a series about
creating a shopping cart and for me a
shopping cart means adding items to the
cart buying something and I'm storing
the order so that's what I'm focusing on
next so that we're actually able to see
what the customer purchased now since I
was talking about orders all the time
that's what I'll start with I'll create
a new order for that I'll head over in
my project and here I'll open up my
terminal which again is just a normal
terminal just included here in my IDE
and navigated into my project folder
I'll use the artisan command line tool
to make a new model at the model I wanna
create is the order model which yeah
allows me well to store orders i will
also store a migration fall with the
minus m tag here to make sure that I
couldn't configure the database in a way
I need it to be configured so I'll hit
enter and that will create this
migration form
I'll just bring down this when they were
here and then we can have a look at our
newly created file we got this order
file here and in the database folder
under migrations we got our migrations
file here which allows us to configure
the database I'll start in this order
migration file here and let's think
about what order should actually contain
or how we want to store an order I think
it should certainly contain a reference
to the customer who made this order so I
will store an integer pointing to a user
ID and for that of course we will need
to force the user to log in before
buying something currently remember it's
anonymous so everyone is able to hit
checkout but we don't need the chair to
change this the next step is I also want
to store the card and you could create a
whole lot of the frame table storing the
individual items off the card and so on
but here I'll make it easy I'm going to
serialize this card which basically
means I'll use a PHP function which
takes my model my object my PHP object
and converts it into a string and then I
also get a function to deserialize it
later on when Anita again that way I'm
able to actually store this card in the
same well table as my order are in and I
don't need to create thousands of
different tables so that will be a text
field because will contain a string or a
long string in the end and I'll name it
cart again this will hold my serialized
object and you will see what I mean with
that later on the next field I wanna
have is the user address now here of
course you could have multiple fields -
one for the city one for the street but
to keep it simple here I'll have one
single field address where I assume that
everything is entered and that matches
my checkout form where I also have
one address line the next field I wanna
store is the name of the customer
because the customer or the user to
which I'm linking with this user ID only
has an email and a password remember
that's how we set up the user here in
the user migration file so in order to
get the name of the customer which I
would need to put it on the well
shipping batch and put onto on the
package I ship for example in order to
get that name I do have this extra form
filled in a checkout form and I want to
store the name here so this will be a
string name now finally there's an extra
field which will hold my payment ID and
what does payment ID mean well whenever
I make a purchase on stripe this payment
has an ID and I'm going to show you that
in my stripe account so if I had I were
to stripe here and I should already be
logged in yes I can open my dashboard
and in this dashboard you see him at a
bunch of testing purchases here
yesterday basically I can hit where I
can have a look at my payments here at
the transaction payments and then you
see all the test charges I made and if I
click on one of the charges you
basically see this ID here now that idea
is important because this ID will also
be sent with the reply to my SDK to my
PHP function which makes the charge as a
response so I can store this ID on my
server order in the database and I want
to store it here so that I'm able to
match payments with orders so that I see
in my stripe account I got this payment
and I can see it that's this ID have a
look at my own orders table here and see
the same ID to match the order at the
payment so that's just something which
allows me to do that matching with that
my orders table is set up at the next
step is of course to work on the
order model here in the order model I
want to set up a relation to the user
because I know that each order will be
related to one user so I can basically
set up this relation here I have my user
and I know that
well again each order has one user so
this will be a one-to-many relationship
because each user may have many orders
so I set up belongs to here Kochi
because again each order belongs to one
user so this belongs to app user and of
course in the other hand in the user
model here I'll also create a new
function a new relation where I have
many orders which is why this is plural
and here I will return this has many and
then here I want to have app order so
refer to my order object with that I got
this relation set up in the way I needed
to have set up so with that the order
model is set up the order table is set
up that's a huge important first step
the next step of course is to then go to
the product controller and use this
orders object or this order model to
actually save the order wants to use or
makes the purchase that will be the next
step so in order to save this order
whenever you make a purchase I'm going
to go to my product controller here and
here you can see my well API key and so
on and I'm going to change this after
recording this video of course and here
currently what we're doing is we're just
cleaning or clearing the cart the
session is to lead a session forgets the
cart so that's all we're doing we're not
saving the order so before clearing the
cart or clearing the session card here I
should save this order of course the
right place to save to order though is
not here but instead it's here in this
try block because I only want to save an
order if we are successful with the cart
and with the charge excuse me so I
certainly don't want to do it here
because
we're reaching this point here no matter
if we're successfully charging or not I
also said that this charge create method
here will give us a response which for
example contains the payment ID so in
order to use this I'm going to assign
this to a variable charge this will
contain the response stripe sends me
back with that I can now create a new
order here for that of course I'll first
need to import it so I'm going to add an
import to app or appear to be able to
use the order object and stand down here
and opposed checkout function again and
try block after while making the charge
here I'm going to create a new order
like that now I could also mass assign
my values here if I configured key model
appropriately but here I'll do it one by
one to make this as explicit as possible
so my order will store the cart remember
that's how I set up this migration file
I want to store the whole cart for that
I will basically simply serialize my
cart
I'm already extracting it up here so all
I have to do here is I'll call the PHP
function serialized that's a bolt and
PHP function has nothing to do with
Larabee and all well serialize my card
here that will take my PHP object
convert it into a string and then
basically stored as string in the
database and later on I'll have the
uncie realized method here which
basically knows how to take that string
and create the old object again that's a
convenient way of well storing an object
in a database the next step is I also
want to set the address
like this and for that I need to get the
address in the first place well if we
have a look at our view at the checkout
view here in the shop you see we have
this address input though currently the
input has no name so we can't really use
it on the server so I'm going to assign
this name attribute here and that is
equal to address and watch some on it I
also want to assign the name attribute
to this well name input field here where
I fetched name of the customer because
all you store that - I'll just name this
input name so with these two name
attributes assigned to the inputs I can
go back to my product controller and
starting with the address I can take my
request which I inject into this
controller action here and simply
retrieve an input and the first input I
want to retrieve here is of course the
address and then I'm going to duplicate
this and I also want to fetch the name
here and store the username like this
the name of the customer so the next
figure when a store here is the payment
ID so payment ID like that and as I said
I can get this from this response I'm
getting on making the charge and here
I'll simply have an ID field where I can
retrieve this payment at you from and
how do I know that I can retrieve from
the ID field here well from the stripe
documentation you can find a detailed
documentation of how this response looks
like there and then you will see that
actually the ID field will hold the
payment ID so with the order object
configure here I then of course need to
create a relation or make the mapping
between this order and the appropriate
user I know that the appropriate user
will be D locked in user remember
currently I'm not forcing the user to
log in so that will definitely be the
next step but here I'll already assume
that the user is logged in I'll retrieve
the logged in user on the office aid
like this in order to be able to use
this I'll need to go I need to go to the
top of my file and I'll add
the import to disperse aid just by
adding use of here without that we could
we would get an error with that in place
I can retrieve D locked and user like
that and then on that user I want to
access the orders and here I need
parentheses after orders because I want
to build a query because I want to well
make query to the database I want to
save something to the database and to
something I wanna save is the world that
is how you save related objects to the
database first access D well the user in
this case access the orders of the user
and let's say when you order on this
well orders connection with that I'm
actually saving the order though
currently we would get an error if we
try to check out what's not being locked
in because off user would then be null
and therefore we couldn't successfully
saved us therefore we would get an error
but since well I can log in and see if
that works
theoretically I want to see if it well
works theoretically so let's have a look
as a first step only to migrate my
orders table here or my yeah order
migration fault of database so since I'm
using whom stat here I have a terminal
navigated into home state and a
homestead and in 2d project folder and
there I'm running PHP artisan migrate
like that so that created my orders
table and I also brought up sequel Pro
here which allows me to have a look at
this database as you can see here's the
orders table empty right now
here we got the products the users I
created and so on so with that I can go
back to my shopping cart application add
an item to the cart and I remember I
need to sign in otherwise it would get
an error so I will quickly do that and
later on of course we will add
functionality to force the user to sign
in so I'll sign in go to shopping cart
here click on checkout now enter some
dummy data whatever you like also we
need a credit card number a convenient
way to get one is to head over to stripe
calm and then go to their documentation
and here in the very first example we
gather dummy credit card number we can
use then enter any expiration date as
long as it is in the future any CVC code
click buy now and looks good let's have
a look at the database if I update this
table you see we got a new order here
and I'll increase the window size here a
bit as you can see we got while the date
the user ID one which is the right user
the address name the payment ID year
which is this idea mentioned earlier
stored in the strife account and we also
got this card field if we have a log
here that's exactly what I meant we have
this strange-looking string which
basically just is our card object from
before convert to a string and PHP will
be able to well recon word that to a
card object if we tell it to do so which
we'll do later on with that I well have
the possibility to make words than to
store them in the database which is a
great improvement of course still we
have this bug that only a logged in
users can make a purchase or well can
make it without getting errors but
technically everyone can still go to the
checkout page right now and also well
we're not really showing the user to
purchase anywhere it would be nice if we
go to let's say the user profile to see
all our purchases here so that will be
the two things I'll work on next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
