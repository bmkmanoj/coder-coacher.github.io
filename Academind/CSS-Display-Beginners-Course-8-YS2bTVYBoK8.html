beginners guide in the last video we had
a look at the position property which
basically allowed us to specify where
our elements should be positioned and in
this video we will have a look at
another really important property that
you should understand when you want to
work on the style of your website the
display property now
in contrast to the position property
which allowed us to position the
elements the display property allows us
to change the way our elements are
displayed on our website life that might
not sound totally here for you right now
no problem we'll have a look at that in
this video
so let's think about the following
example you have your website with an
HTML element and the body element inside
this body element you have a header
element and other elements this could be
a main element a footer anything like
that just think about these elements as
the general parts of your website's
which are positioned correctly as we
learn it in the last video so basically
you are happy with the core structure
the problem is that although these
elements are positioned correctly the
way the elements that are nested inside
these different elements might not be
according to your needs
let's think about two different here in
this element these two divs are by
default block level elements we also
talked about that in the HTML part of
the series and as block level elements
well they behave the way we see it right
here the problem might now be although
this HTML code is totally fine the
default display option we see right here
is not the one that you want to heaven
CSS therefore we need a way to change
the way our elements are displayed and
that's exactly what the display property
is doing because with the display
property we are able to apply different
values and bited different displaying
options to our elements now what does
this mean well basically we can apply a
block value well wouldn't change a lot
for the diff apparently we could apply
inline this is more interesting right we
could also apply inline block sounds
even more interesting and we could apply
none for example also something we'll
take a look at in this video now we also
have a lot more values available
actually it's not just these four and
this brings us to the question before we
dive deeper into the values where can I
find more information about these values
and again the answer is in the end the
end the Mozilla developer Network right
here because on this page a link can be
found in the video description of course
you can see that we have lots of
different values available for our
display property for example block and
inline right here now we will focus on
to block inline inline block
none in this video but there is one
additional value I would like to bring
your attention to and this value is this
one right here display flex this is a
really cool and a really helpful value
and therefore we'll have a look at that
in a separate video as I said in this
video we'll focus onto these four values
block inline inline block and none now
that was a lot of fury actually and
again I think the best way to see what
these values are doing is to have a look
at it at a practical example now let's
do this and for this example I use this
really basic code actually you can find
it in the video description also so we
have an HTML file with a header in F and
a main element and inside our main
element we have freed ifs we also have a
style file again with some basic styling
applied to make sure that well we can
see some important information on our
page talking about the page the page
looks like this with the open chrome
developer tools right here and as you
can see I kind of recreated the
situation we had on the slide with our
HTML element in the orange part then we
have the yellow part body and we have
the header ot nav empty main element
right here and inside the main element
we have to free divs now that's the
standard situation and everything is
displayed with the default display
property being applied for the divs and
actually for all these elements right
here this is block level now let's
change this in see what we can do with
the display property now let's go back
and for that we should go down right
here to our div and now I will simply
write display right here and start with
display block like that won't change a
thing just save that and let's go back
and reload the page and as you can see
nothing changed of course because as I
said before with this display property
we are able to change the way our
element is displayed and if you apply
the value of block to a block level
element well not a lot changes there is
one important thing though that I would
bring to your mind and this is that with
block level elements we can do the
following
we can write width like that and maybe
type 100 pixels by the way width and
height and pixels and percentages all
that topics will be covered in another
video of this series so we'll just stick
to width and height and pixels in this
videos if you're not sure about how this
works as I said no worries we'll talk
about that also throughout this series
but for now let's just apply with 100
pixels right here and save that if we
now go back and reload the page you can
see that the width of our element
changed and that's interesting to know
because for block level elements we can
change the width and the height for
example if we go back now and delete
display block or just comment it out
maybe this and that save that and go
back and reload the page you can see the
width is still applied so keep that in
mind with block level elements we can do
this going back to our code and now
commenting that in again we cannot
change the value to inline like that if
we save that go back and reload the page
well we can now see that our elements
are displayed as inline elements and
therefore we changed the default way
these block level elements are displayed
and that can be really helpful right
because you might want to have these
stiffs displayed like that but you don't
want to change the initial HTML file and
the way the elements are created right
there
and therefore display inline or also
vice versa so if you have inline
elements right here and you apply
display block to them this would also
work of course well this would allow you
to change the default displaying
behavior of that elements but the
interesting thing is that our width 1
over the pixels declaration apparently
wasn't applied right here if you go back
and maybe change it to 200 saved add go
back and reload the page you can see
nothing changes and that's also
important to understand because the
height and the width of such inline
elements cannot be changed
also an important difference to the
block level elements we saw before so if
you want to change the width of such
inland elements well you simply cannot
do that that's wrong of course we have a
way how to also change the width and the
height for example of such inland
elements how can we do that well if we
go back to our code and now change the
way it is displayed from inline to
inline lock right here
and save that then we can go back and
reload the page and we can see that we
now turned this initial block level
element this diff into an inline element
and with inline block we are then able
to change the width of that well now
inline element and that's really cool
because with that we have really
powerful tools in CSS which allow us to
style the elements just the way we want
them to be of course feel free to play
around with these values and see what
else you can do with them but that's
just the basic core concept that at
least that I think is important to
understand
now before we applied that display
property now to our website there is one
last value that I would like to show you
and this value is display:none
if we change it right here to non save
the page and go back then you can see
nothing because we've display:none we
can simply make sure that our elements
are not displayed anymore now this is
something we won't use right now in our
project but this can be really helpful
especially when you add JavaScript to
your website javascript will also be
covered later throughout this series
therefore for the moment we will not use
display none and simply stick to
display:inline-block maybe for our
example and as you can see not
everything looks the way it looked
before
so that was the theory that was the
basic thing you have to understand
regarding deed this property and I think
now it's the time to go back to our
website and see what you can change
right there so here we are back in our
code you can of course also find the
code
or the link to the code down there in
the video description the important
thing now is that if we look at our page
right here
well our page needs some more style and
we should use to display property to
apply that style and let's focus on to
this navbar because we talked about the
header in the last video so in this Neff
element right here we can see that the
way it is displayed right now it's not
the best one probably because I would
like to have home and context being
written next to each other and it should
also be centered so like Mike's world up
here now let's change that by going back
to our code and I'm back in the
index.html file and right here we could
add a class right here to this list and
this class could be navigation course
feel free to name it just as you prefer
let's save that and let's now go to our
style sheet and here we have the nav
element right there or in a section that
we created so let's not hype navigation
right here and that's the class that's
fine but specifically we don't want to
refer or select the class we want to
refer to the elements inside the class
and if we now at a space and type Li for
the list elements then we specifically
refer to the list elements we have
inside this navigation class that we
just created now let's add the curly
braces and let's now add this play and
let's start with inline like that now if
we save that and go back and reload the
page yes we can see that our elements
will look better but if we inspect that
now yeah we can see I think it's hard to
see but you can see it if you read the
pixels you can see that contact has a
width of about 50 pixels and home only
has a width of front about 39 pixels
that's of course due to the fact that
both are displayed as inline elements
now so we should change that and maybe
change in line
to inline-block like that and also apply
a width of maybe let's say 70 pixels
let's save that let's go back and if we
reload that yeah we can see that now the
list right here has a width of 70 pixels
and the second list element also has a
width of 70 pixels problem still is that
we don't only have the list elements
right there because if we go back to our
index.html file you can see that we have
the class navigation that we refer to
right here then we have the list item
totally fine for home but inside the
second list element we have this anchor
tag right there and this can cause
issues because if we now have a specific
definition for this anchor tag this
would overwrite the rule that we just
defined for the list items in the
navigation class let me show you what I
mean by that if I go back to style.css
and now go right here to the anchor tag
right here and now apply a background
color of red for example like that and
if I now go down to our navigation list
right here I will apply a background
color oops sorry
background color like that of yellow
like that and now let's see what happens
if we go back and reload the page we can
see that home is of course with that
yellow background color as we find it
for the list elements inside the
navigation class but contact well it's
not with that yellow background color
because it is applied for the list
element but as we have this anchor tag
inside the second list element we have
the problem that the anchor tag as it is
a more specific element is displayed
with that red background color that we
defined and this might cause issues on
your websites as we
not well specific enough or precise
enough now how can we change that well a
really easy way to change it is if we go
back and now don't only say navigation
list but also say that this style should
be true for navigation a like that
this means we now want to apply the
style to all list elements inside the
navigation class and also to all anchor
tags right here inside the navigation
class this is important if you would
write it like this then you would say
that you apply this style to the list
elements in the navigation class and to
all anchor tags that's not good because
you only want to apply that to a
specific anchor tag therefore make sure
to add the class in front of the element
now if we save this and go back and
reload the page then you can see it
didn't work because I forgot to add the
dot right here now we have the class and
if you now reload the page then you can
see that it works perfectly because with
that specific let's maybe unselect EE
expect - oh sorry because with that
specific definition l of the anchor tag
inside the navigation class we made sure
that our styling now is fine and with
that we can also see that the anchor tag
is styled like that and the list item is
all the style like that so basically we
have the list item right here the list
element right here and the anchor tag
right there so with that we have the
basic style of turning it into an inline
block element applied but I still would
like to Center these two elements now
just as Mike's word for that we should
go back and now we need to add a new
rule because the thing is that this
centering part should not refer to the
single elements right here but it should
refer to the entire navigation class
right there like this and now we write a
la text-align:center like that if we
save that we did that already in the
last video there from doing it a little
bit faster now so if you go back and we
bad and with that let's inspect that we
now centered the element with the class
navigation right here there is one issue
though you can see it right here we have
some padding applied so let's get rid of
that padding also writing padding:0
right there save that now reloaded now
it's centered but I think we also have
an issue right here in Mike's world
actually yeah it's the same issue we
have some padding here between the page
title class so let's also change this
quickly by adding a padding of zero
right there so this is depending to the
left and to the right and if you know
reload that yes now we can see if we
unselect inspect tool that we were able
to Center this list actually which is
pretty cool as I think let's maybe also
change the background color we have
right here from this yellow to I don't
know let's maybe use this darker gray
let's see what that it what this looks
like like this yeah
looks better we are still not done with
this style right here but regarding the
this property I think this is fine now
let's continue to the main element so
specifically right here
my SF city trip California landscape and
the images because that's also not
displayed the way I would like it to be
because actually it should be like my SF
City trip right here in this part then
there should be the image of these San
Francisco streets right there and then I
would like to have the California
landscape right here in this part of the
page and below that text I would like to
have the image of the California streets
so this image should be somewhere I
don't know right here maybe now let's
also change that so let's go back to the
code and what we have to do is we have
to work on these sort of trip text and
the trip text P mainly because if we go
to index.html we can see that our trip
text this class right here refers to
these two paragraphs and trip images
refers to the images so let's focus on
to the text first
by going back right here and now adding
display like that but we will
immediately add inline-block right here
because we want to specify a width for
these elements so let's let me specify a
width but this time not with pixels but
with a percentage so we will use 50% we
will talk about the details regarding
pixels and percent ensures height and
width later throughout the series for
the moment we will just apply it like
this and the only thing you have to know
right now is that with this width
50% we will simply say that our elements
so each element right here should have
50% of the width of this element right
here of our trip text class so again in
simple words the each paragraph inside
our trip text class so this end this
paragraph should occupy 50% of the space
or of the width of this trip text class
now what we can see already is that we
have some padding right here so we
should get rid of that also so let's say
that we don't want this padding anymore
of trip text right here and with that we
should actually be fine so let's save
that and go back right here and reload
the page yeah and we are unfortunately
not fine because what's the issue well
as I said I would like to have this
element well right here and not below
myself silly trip now the problem is
that if we look at the trip text class
again we can see that this has 740 1.14
so
742 pixels of width and each element has
exactly 50% of this total width so
actually this should work the problem is
that if you apply inline-block
as our value for the display property
then there is kind of an gap added
automatically between the different
elements so in our case between my SF
City trip and California landscape you
cannot see this gap but it's there and
because of that
we cannot display it next to each other
with inline-block
therefore we need another solution now
there is not just one alternative
actually one alternative would be to
turn the paragraphs right here into list
items then this would work but I don't
want you to do that right now because I
want to show you the Flex value in the
next video I talked about that in the
beginning but with using value flex
right here and by that using the
so-called flex box we can easily solve
this issue and additionally also easily
change the way our images are displayed
and because of that we will keep our
main element so this right here this
part the two images and also two people
like my page the way it is right now in
this video but as soon as we know how
flex box works we will quickly and
easily change the way these elements are
displayed now having said that let's
scroll down and maybe unselect the
inspect tool again and see what else we
can change and yes I think this is
something we should also work on now
because I would like to change the way
this image and this text is displayed
because the text should be next to the
image so this text here should be next
to next image this text here should be
next to my image now how can we do that
well we can go back to our code and now
go down to the footer by the way this is
wrong this is feedback so feedback is
actually this part right here which is
actually part of the main element as you
can see it so we should add that right
here doesn't have an issue or an impact
on through bite is displayed I just want
to keep that a little bit or as
structured as possible
but now coming back to our text that we
have because if we go to the HTML file
we can see that our text here right here
and our image is basically wrapped into
a div and the same thing is true for my
image and my text so let's first apply a
clasp right here and let's call it class
may
we review clients something like that
oops
like that and now simply use that class
and also add that class to that second
div like that because that's also
important to know equal classes can be
applied to different elements that's not
an issue that can be done easily in CSS
and it's also a big help when you work
on bigger websites the important thing
is that IDs which is also an attribute
you can add to an element can only be
applied once that's very important but
for classes working like this is
possible and easy to do now we have that
class review clients and now we have to
go to our CSS file of course and add
that class right here so let's call it
review clients but what now
because review clients or let's maybe
save that first and also save that in
this HTML file because review clients if
we reload that well here you can see the
class these classes are now again
basically only the evil containing
elements as we could call them but I
want to change the way these two
elements saw the image and the paragraph
behave now how can we do this what we
talked about that a few minutes ago in
the navigation part because we can again
simply go to our CSS file and now not
select the entire class but specifically
the paragraph and again by the way I
made a mistake right here this should be
review clients sorry for that and review
clients again now don't forget to add
the class name once again and now add
the second element which is an image
like that if we do this now and apply
display:inline because we don't need to
change the height or the width so we can
apply display:inline for the moment go
back right here and reload the page we
can see that it looks better still I
would like to have two text well being
more like there so we should go back and
now simply add vertical align
right here middle like that to our two
elements then this is also a new
property we didn't use so far we can see
that if we reload the page that both
elements now align in the middle or to
the middle of there containing element
basically well and with that if I
unselect the inspect tool again we can
see that our page again got a little bit
more beautiful still a lot of work
though but the important thing is that
you now have a better understanding or
hopefully have a better understanding of
the display property and how you can use
it on your website to make sure that
you're able to control the way your
elements are displayed on the website so
in the next video we will never look at
flexbox as I said before and work on the
main part especially right here and
right there with the images really cool
actually looking forward to that video
to be honest and I hope you do the same
and until then I can only say thanks a
lot for watching
hope to see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
