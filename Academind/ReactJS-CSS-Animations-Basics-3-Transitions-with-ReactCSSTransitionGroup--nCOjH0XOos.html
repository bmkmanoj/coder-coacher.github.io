they support your user using your
website he now knows what he just did
and where he is so there are more than
just a little extra now react chase
gives us a powerful tool to add
animations to your react.js application
we already did this in the last videos
with pure CSS animations and transitions
but now we're going to use this tool to
animate more complex things like this
one we're going to build here again
using the material CSS framework here I
get a Spacek list now watch what happens
if I add items they slowly fade in and
the same is true if I click such item so
here we're animating the list and that's
a bit more complicated than what we did
before but with this extra tool I'm
showing you it's super easy also notice
that if I load the page for the first
time you also see them fade and slowly
so we get this initial loading here so
here I'm in my react.js project pretty
similar to the one you saw before though
now I got this button here which allows
me to add new items and I got this
collection here this list which allows
me to output items using the map
function here to map my items and then
return a list item for each individual
item notice that I give each item a key
here which is very important when using
this tool I'll soon show you it allows
react.js to keep track of your
individual items the key I use here
simply is the item itself since my items
here are simply some strings which I can
use as keys and which are unique which
the key certainly should be so this is
the other part of the application I
initialize my state with an array of
items just free items by default and the
number of items on the stack right now
in the on add item method here I simply
replace my array with a new array which
are increased by one item with the
concat method concat here simply gives
me a new array so that I don't update
the old one but simply set it to a new
one so that this state gets updated
correctly so I'm adding this new item
and I'm increasing the item number by
one in D on the
item method here I simply take the old
items array with these slice methods you
get back a new array then on this new
array eye splice off the element I want
to remove since I get the ID passed to
this method and then I set my items
array to this new array which is the old
array minus one item and this items
array is then again rendered down here
in my render method notice that when I
click on such a item the on delete item
effort is fired and there I pass not
only this to bind this correctly but
also I which is simply the index of the
current item passed here in the map
callback so that's all normal JavaScript
es6 react code until now simply
rendering a list and if we have a look
at this
reloaded click add item you now see this
works but we got no animations which is
a bit boring so let's add some
transitions namely the opacity
transitions you saw before to do so
react chairs offers us a nice extra tool
or package we can use we have to install
that package with npm install - - saved
you also save it in the package.json
file and then it has two convenient a
very short name react add-ons CSS
transition group like this now if we
enter this will be pulled down and add
it to my project and thereafter of
course I can use it I do use it here in
my file by simply importing it and it
only has one default export so I can
choose any name I want here I'll name it
react CSS transition group which is all
the main name you'll find in a lot of
tutorials and this of course has to be
imported from the reactant add on CSS
transition group package now this thing
here actually can be used like an
element in our HTML code here and we
should wrap the items we want to animate
with it so this is a wrapper which
allows us to put any items we want to
animate between the opening and closing
tag and then we can con
figure this rapper his new tool your
this new object we just imported to
configure which animations should be
applied to the object between the
opening and closing tag so I will add it
here in my list and specifically here in
the unordered list before executing this
function here so here I will simply use
react CSS transition group and also
close it there after and now we need to
configure this react CSS transition
group otherwise it won't do anything
very importantly we need to give it a
transition name which is which animation
should you execute whenever something
happens to your objects nested inside of
you so to this list item object in this
case how it works behind the scenes is
something I will show you in a second
but you get the basic read now it will
attach some CSS classes to the elements
that's the between the opening and
closing tag and with these elements we
or with these classes we can then
control which animation should be shown
so here we choose a name and this name
later on has to be reflected in the
easiest as class as we set up but I'll
come back to this so now here let's give
it a give it a name of fade for example
since I want you fete them in or out
depending on whether I add a new item or
remove the item I also need to set the
time the animation takes when element
enters and thereafter when it leaves so
ultra as a lab transition enter and here
our satis - 300 milliseconds so this
value is in milliseconds here and the
leaves should also be 300 milliseconds
important to note here I said when an
element enters or leaves so this
animation or this object here the react
CSS transition group it's meant to be
used on transition status why it has
this name so when you have elements like
here in a list which can be added or
moved if you just want to do what we did
in the last videos simply flip back
heart or anything like that but the
content doesn't change so you're not
flipping the card to replace it with a
new one but simply to flip it well then
a normal CSS animation like you saw it
in the last videos is all you need the
react CSS transition group really shines
or is there to be used when you want to
animate the addition of an element or
the swap of element not just the flip of
element where the content doesn't change
I'm just highlighting this because it's
important to understand when to use this
and when to use normal CSS built-in
animations and don't use that at all
because you wouldn't need it in the
cases I showed you in the last videos
otherwise they wouldn't have worked like
this right so we set up this transition
group and gave it a name of fate now
what does this do what it actually does
is it now will attach a couple of CSS
classes cue each list item element here
when we add it or delete it only then it
will not do this when this list item
element is there only during the
addition and deletion process and this
is what we had to specify how long each
process will take enter and leave
otherwise react or this object here
won't know for how long it needs to
attach these classes so that is really
important under stead it only attaches
them for a short period of the time most
of the time no class will be attached by
this react CSS transition group this of
course leaves the question which classes
are attached I'll explain this while
setting them up so let's go to the
index.html to create some classes which
this react CSS transition group will use
remember we named it or we named our
transition fade so it will expect a
couple of classes which include fade in
their name but not just fade actually it
uses four classes fade enter fade enter
active fade leave and fade leave active
now what are the diff
well I'll explain this let's first
create him so we needed fate enter we
will also need fate enter active we will
also need faith leave and we will also
need faith leave active like this fate
enter here is only attached for a very
short fraction of the time when the
element is created so literally just a
millisecond or something like this we
use fate enter to set the initial state
from which we want to animate so if we
want to fade in element we would set the
opacity to zero in fade enter because we
want to start at zero and set it to 1
over time fade enter active will be the
style which is attached to this element
as long as the fade-in animation or any
animation whatever you choose runs so
these 300 milliseconds here you wanna
set the final state and also if we use
CSS transitions de transition attribute
to make sure it gets animated and not
pops to final state instantly and fade
leaf does the opposite way leaf is
attached at the beginning to give you
the starting state and fatal if active
is attached thereafter to set the end
state and the transition attribute to
make sure it not pops instantly but
instead smoothly transitions over so
fade enter should have since we want to
fade it ALP acity of 0 and fade entry
active should have opacity of 1 also
here I need to attach the transition
attribute transition everything or we
could also choose transition the opacity
since you do that then this time here
300 milliseconds of course should match
the time we set up here transition enter
so that we have the same time stay time
this react CSS transition group object
knows and the time we actually use here
then let's ease it out but of course
this is up to you now for faith leaf I
want to start a top acity of one because
it's already there we want now to fade
it out so the target opacity is zero and
the transition will be attached again
because I want to transition the opacity
over 300 milliseconds and Easter's out -
of course the 300 milliseconds here also
have to match to you 300 milliseconds
here another important side note why do
I need to add transition here again I
already did added here when we fade it
is element in well because these classes
won't stay there they will be removed
once the animation finished so then this
transition class or style year will no
longer be applied instead it will be
gone so we have to reapply it when
fading it out and there should be
transition and your time out and leave
time out as a side note sorry about that
so make sure this is time out otherwise
this will not work so if we now reload
the application and add item we see it
fade in and if we click on it it fades
out so now this is working but if we
have a look at it in the console more
specifically the elements tab let's
inspect such element and specifically
watch for new elements which get added
did you see that the classes kind of
jumped around so we had new classes and
then they were gone if you watch closely
and I will show you this by simply
increasing the time this takes so let's
make this three seconds and also make
the transition last three seconds here
of course if I do this reload here now
if I add a new item of course I should
inspect this first if I add a new item
here you see we have fade enter fade and
reactive attached and now it's gone and
again this is what I meant and behind
the scenes fade enter is attached a tiny
fraction of the time before fade enter
active is attached so that we have this
initial state before the final state but
we don't really see that
that's happening too fast and the sales
of course true when I delete the item
now you see we have failed leaf and fade
leave active and it's gone so this is
how this class works and how it animates
this over time and allows us to animate
the addition or deletion of items of
course you could always use this to swap
out a single item there are no borders
to your imagination here the important
thing is just use it when you do have an
actual transition so when you change the
content and not just if you want to
animate a single element which doesn't
change behind the scenes like
individuals before what if you also want
to animate this upon the initial load
well first I will reduce this to 300
milliseconds again here so that we have
more of a real animation and not this
very slow thing and then I want to add
two new configurations here to the react
CSS transition group
the first one is transition appeared
which allows me to specify true here
which means also animate the appearance
of this element and with appearance I
don't mean when a new element has been
added but when the page has been loaded
so when this whole page appears so we
also want to animate this and for this
we also want to set up a timeout let's
set us to 300 or let's set it to 500
milliseconds or even a second so that we
can see a difference now in the
index.html I need to add two new classes
because this takes their own classes
it doesn't use fade entry by default it
allows us to give it its own animation
it is named fade appeared so here the
theory is the same as above we set the
initial State and then we have fade
appear active here which will be
attached as long as the animation runs
and here I'll set the opacity to one and
a transition for the opacity to one
second since we set this ease out so
that's important to understand it has
its own classes
it doesn't use fate enter now if I save
this and go to this page and reload you
now see it slowly fades in when we load
this page instead of instantly being
there this is how we can use the react
CSS transition group to use CSS
transitions or animations in general to
animate the addition or deletion or
swapping off content in our react.js
render function here or our react.js
HTML code here again to highlight this
if your goal is simply to animate a
single element let's say like before
flipping a card then this is not for you
normal CSS transitions and animations do
that shop this is really only there for
you if you want to swap elements add new
ones
delete ones like we're doing it here
with that see you on all the other
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
