up our new contact route here to work
now let's say we want to add an option
when we select a contact here that we
are able to then have that we have a
button here which allows us to say like
something create contact from contact so
that we would have let's say the last
name already felt in here so we're going
to do this in this video to start off
this I will go to my contact component
here and below all these input fields
here I'll add a button which says create
new contact from this contact something
like this and when I click this button I
want yeah I basically want that did a
new contact already has let's say the
last name the same last name now this
partner shouldn't be displayed always
because when we load up our app and no
contact will select that I don't want
this to work
we're more specific this goes for a
whole block here right it there's no
need to display it if no contact to
select it so let me go to my contact
list component here and I will make a
change here I will set the selected
component to know so that we have no
component selected with no contact
selected by default now the app is
broken and I don't see the list anymore
this is because here I'm passing
selected contact to my contact component
but it is null and that froze the error
because in my contact component here I'm
trying to access fields of that contact
which is as a set now non-existent so to
fix this I'll add an ng-if directive
here to only show this contact
information or this contact component
here if selected contact is not now
now let me save this and now we got this
list only when I click an item here we
got this this is this info area or this
component pop-up here so now that we get
this I want as I said to be able to
create a new contact from this contact
now I'll show you two ways to set up
this road the first one is we copy this
route here and add new contact last name
this will pass a last name parameter to
this route and I will call it new
contact from contact but a long name but
is fine
now back to my contact component here
I'll have a click event which will fire
the method on create new so let me add
that method here on create new and I
don't need to pass anything here because
what I will do I will fire the route in
this component here and I will pass the
last name which is already stored in
this publicly available contact variable
so to actually be able to do this
routing again we'll add a constructor
here like in the last video I will need
to inject the router private router
router router as always make sure you
are importing it and for the same reason
as in the last video I don't need to add
the providers element or the providers
configuration here cause we're getting
this dependency injection from the root
component of the app component scene now
here in my create new function I can
then call the router navigate method
pass an array as an argument and I will
have the name of my route new contact
from contact very handy little name as
the name and then I will pass additional
information which is a JavaScript object
and here I'll pass the parameters this
route takes now in this case I'll pass
my let's have a look
last name parameter here so we will have
last name equals or gets the value of
our contact last name and obviously here
we have this contact and we should tell
wrap this this is of type contact let's
save this click this create new contact
so this does work we're not seeing the
last thing here this is a reason because
when we get here well okay yeah this
route is executed and as you can see in
the URL we're setting the last name as
an argument or as a parameter of passing
but we're not fetching this parameter
anywhere here in this component so let's
do this in order to fetch this router
parameter I do have to inject some
something here
I will inject another router of specific
object the route params so I will bind
it to my private property route parents
and it will be an object of type route
params
can again use this out of the box
without specifying anything else because
the router providers were injected in
our bootstrap method so I get my route
parents here and now to fetch them I
think a good place would again be the
one in it
lifecycle hood of our component so when
our component is initiated that's a good
place to fetch our route params
parameters so I'll implement the on init
protocol for interface as it was called
here implement methods the energy on
init method will be implemented and here
all I will do is bind this last name I
get as a parameter to my variable or my
property which I will have to create
here so we'll create my public property
last name by default
I'll give this an empty value empty
string so then I can say this last name
equals this route params and now here
I'll execute the get method and specify
the name of the parent which is also
last name but in quotation marks then
save this now let me click this contact
and click create new contact from this
contact and well it's still working but
we're still not seeing it here obviously
because we're not setting it here so
here I'll set the value to the last name
property and let's try it again
well now we see last name here that it's
not what we wanted West is not working
while this is not working because value
is a standard HTML attribute for the
input field and we're basically just
setting a string so in order for this to
work
I'll use my string interpolation syntax
I got here with Kohli braces and now I
save this and now we get back here click
this click this and I now see that I
seem to have an object here and not just
a string and the problem is that I'm
using last name and last name so I have
put this local variable last name and
now this is available here and so I'm
binding to this
instead of this so to change this I'll
just say past last name to make that
easy sure we have no naming duplication
going on here now let's get back again
click this new contact and now we get
the name here so that's the first method
and the second one is really not that
different I'll just use this route
instead of this route even though I
don't specify any parameters here by
basically just saying okay I still again
I got this last name param here and in
my contact component I'm just executing
the new contact route and the same was
the rest will stay the same and now
let's see what happens if I do this it
still works because angular will
automatically attach this additional
parameters here with the question mark
at the end of our out which allows us to
dynamically add optional parameters we
because we can access the route in this
way that's still possible or be passing
on parameter which is then just attached
at the end here so that enables us to
get rid of this extra route here with
this long name and just use the default
route with the option to pass in
parameter but we don't have to so that's
how we can pass parameters to routes and
how we can handle them in the component
which gets the parameters and whether
out leads to now what we have still open
is some form validation to do with our
create new contact field here or our in
the contact form here and well some
additional things about routing because
maybe we want to prevent the user from
being able to leave this page for the
back button if he has unsafe changes so
that are things amongst errors like
accessing a server using pipes what our
pipes
so on in future videos so I see you
there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
