on board observables are great and
operators are cubed but it can be hard
to find practical use case for operators
because you need some practice to be
aware of where you might use them so let
me show you a specific pattern which
uses Q operators are X J's operas which
is really an awesome pattern which you
might enhance your application so here
is the next sample we have an input
field trade with the input element and
unwrapping the input event with my
observable here where I use D from event
helper method Q will basically react to
every input event and that I subscribe
so now if I type here at max for example
you see that on every keystroke
the current total value of the input
field was printed out now that would be
useful if we have an application where
we want to validate the existence of
let's say username on every keystroke so
a user is signing up and we want to tell
him write whilst user is typing if the
currently chosen username is available
the issue might be that we of course
need to send an HTTP request to our
back-end to check the existence of
username in our database now if we do
that on every keystroke we're going to
send a lot of requests and for that very
reason we can use our X J's and
operators to control how we do something
the first very useful operator which
might help us with that is debounce time
let me add it here debounce time it's a
simple operator all we have to do here
is we have to pass an argument which
describes the time in milliseconds we
want to wait before we emit a new value
piece you could say it'll become more
clear once you see it in action
so here let's say it has 2,000 for two
seconds and now if you shouldn't get a
new value emitted if it's within this
time frame let me show you how it works
if I need control-enter
and I now start typing watch the console
log use these nap again but after two
seconds we get max and the average two
events we're at
em and then where we had em a were
simply dropped and that happens you to D
bound time now you might say well dad
looks a lot like throttle what we also
could pass for tire span and then it
would only emit a new value off this
time span has passed right it works a
bit differently though here a new value
will only be emitted if nothing happened
for two seconds so this is if Y if I
keep typing here and I type and I type
and I relate some characters which souls
are kind of typing all the fire in the
input element you see it never emits the
value we still have max from before now
only if I stop typing here down wait and
after two seconds of no value being
emitted so of me not typing since we
emit a new value on every keystroke we
get the current value and this is what P
pounds time does it simply check that
there has been a pause of value
emissions for the times when you specify
here and then it will simply give you
the latest value and all the hours will
be dropped and that can be very useful
because it means that every set is not
two seconds but maybe two 500
milliseconds that they can really let
the user type his name also incorrect
something but then after a brief pause
we actually get the value and of course
this was not that impressive because I
forget through it control-enter so now
again you see I can even believe
something but now if I stop for half a
second we get the value this is Yvonne's
time and this is already a great
enhancement because if you come back to
the example of sending HTTP requests
here we would send only one HTTP request
and even if the user stops for half a
second and then continues typing we
might have more but we don't have as
many as if we were to send them on every
keystroke however we do have one issue
here what if the user decides oh I miss
type and then oh I was correct now you
see indicated by this Q here that the
same value was in this again because the
user type something then you pause for
half
second and a debounce time does it gave
us the latest value here however the
latest value is equal to the value we
had before and that might be DDA
behavior you're looking for but it might
also not be the case
it would be nice if you could also
filter out values which are equal to the
last one and that is what the second
useful operator does this thing until
changed now this comes after debounce
time because if we were to place it in
front of the bounce time we would rarely
have a case where the last total value
of the input field is the same as now
after we press the key right because we
press a key we probably change something
so ostrich bones times though we can
rule out cases like this one so now if I
clear the console hit ctrl enter and now
I type Maximilian we get Maximilian and
now to do the same before to leave that
and retype it quickly you see I still
get it so shouldn't we not get this
anymore
well yes but keep in mind our value of
the omission here so what we omit it is
not the total value of the input field
we get it here with event.target the
value we do get at this point of time
it's just the event and he went now of
course this difference the last one even
if the total value is still the same so
what we can simply do is we can throw in
a map before all of that math allows us
to transform the value and here we know
we get event but maybe I just want to
return the event target value which also
means down here I get you finish the
value so I can Alfred that and if I now
it control enter and we do the same
again I type Maximilian we get
Maximilian in the finality of the Sega
or you see no new that new value was
omitted because we don't have to - next
to Maximilian if I change something else
though we do get it because now the
value of our admission of our observable
emission here is the total input and
that now doesn't change if I do this
here is the same so no new value
submitted so that is how you can
cleverly combine a couple of operators
namely be bound time and distance until
change with math to make sure we're
using the right value queue maybe
enhancer replication and in this case
send only one HTTP request instead of
thousands so I hope this was useful and
kind of get you thinking on how you may
use observables and I can only encourage
you to play around with these operators
to point out how to best use them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
