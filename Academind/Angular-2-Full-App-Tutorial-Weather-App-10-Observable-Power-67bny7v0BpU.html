now I want to change it in a way that it
automatically starts looking when we
type so how could we implement this
behavior with observables it's to be
honest not really that hard we would
start here in our Webber search
component and of course here I want cube
listen to all changes in on this input
element here so I will add such a such
an event listener and input is the
method or the event and looking for this
will fire whenever will I type something
into this field I then want to call a
method let's call it on search location
and I want to pass the current value of
this input field therefore I will gift
us a local variable called input and
then I can just pass input dot value and
with this on every keystroke I will
trigger this method here and I will pass
the current value of this input field
now I'll let me next so add this method
here this on search location which will
get the city name as an input because I
will get a string the input of there or
the value of this input field and I know
that this input field is there to search
for a city that's why I called the
variable here city name now I could add
this code here and let's see what then
happens here of course I would replace
this with just city names and were
directly getting this information and
now let's see what happens as I type it
added a couple of cities which I don't
know why this match Berlin at any point
Teegarden is in Berlin so this is okay
but yeah if it's just on every key type
it triggers this API and
for the city the problem with this is
not only that we spam our API and by the
way on a blogger map there is a limit on
requests per minute I think so we spam
this API this is bad and we get a couple
of well cities we don't really want here
we don't want to add them right away
and it would be better to yeah we would
just want to see some suggestions here
and then add the one we want
however these chester's should also not
update with every keystroke but only
let's say after every every keystroke
that actually changed the word and only
all let's say every 300 milliseconds so
that the user actually has to pause for
a short period before we send out a
request so that while worker typing
Berlin were waiting for the user to
finish typing before querying for B for
b efore BER and so on now this sounds
very complicated but the great thing is
with observable it's easy to implement
however we low need to change the way we
use this component or how we work here I
will get rid of this logic here because
this is not what we will be doing here
instead what I want is I want a separate
observable stream separate observable so
to say for which I personally can create
events and fire them and I define when
they are fired all 300 milliseconds for
example and then this stream will I will
also listen to it whenever I fulfill
these requirements reach out to the HTTP
service and fire this or send this
request and listen to this response in
order to do this I need some kind of
object which I can both listen to
because I want to listen for the user to
pause typing but I once also want to
fire you but I want to emit events
because I want to emit do you
are just typed and the observable
library rxjs
offers such and such an object a subject
this is an observer and an observable at
the same time so I will create such an
subject here and we'll call it search
stream and this will be a new subject
and subject has to be imported from rxjs
subject it will be off type string and
now what do I do with the subject on
each type here on each time I type into
this input field I will use the search
stream and I will call the next method
and omit the city name which was entered
and this basically means it will trigger
upon each keystroke it will emit this
value to the subject and now I have to
configure the subject in a way that it
will ignore a lot of these he wins until
a certain set of conditions is met for
example 300 Melissa consent since the
last hit or since the last he went I
will do this in yuan init method and
therefore I will implement on in it in
my class here and then here implement
you ng on init method and in this method
what I will do is I will use my search
stream and now I could subscribe to it
to listen to all these input changes and
I will do this first to show how this
works I will get back some data and what
what data would we get back well
probably the value T user entered so
let's Lock this data to confirm this now
if I type something here you can see in
the console I'm getting my interest here
and this is because while on each
keystroke I omit the current value and
here I set up well a listener now this
is almost what I want but not quite
I want to take this value and send it
out to the API and use it there I want
to call well whatever I'm currently
doing here in on submit I want to call
it here queue but with this value now a
good way to do this is I can use the
switch map operator on this observable
and watch what switch map does is it
allows me to map one stream one
observable into an average and I'll best
show this with an example here so what I
will do is I will have my like by a my
my input which is a string and I'm using
a fat arrow function here of course
again and then I will call the weather
service search Weber data method on this
term and this will indeed also or on
this input excuse me and this will
subscribe to it and down here data will
be something different let's see what is
data now if I type Berlin you can see
now we're getting back however data
object because we're transforming our
observable so to say we're saying use
the input we're emitting on each
keystroke but don't map this into the
data you use here instead map it into a
new observable where you pass this value
and then the new data the new response
of this overall observables Freeman
should be the response of this
observable this is the translation you
could give to you to this operator to
the switch map operator and with this
we're now on each keystroke searching
for this city now we're almost there
because well with this we could achieve
what we want and we could update but we
would do this on each keystroke but to
begin with
let's do this I therefore will add a new
field here called theta which will be of
type an E and an empty object at the
beginning I will then here set this data
field equal to the data we get back here
and then I can in my template output
city found and then here I will output
data name to output the city name so
let's try it again
Berlin as you can see it updated it
looks pretty good but still we're
spamming the API and well we will reach
our limit sometimes and then we'll have
to wait for a minute and generally this
is not the best style because these are
a lot of unnecessary HTTP requests how
to what can we do to reduce the number
of HTTP requests it is really simple we
add exactly two new operators to our
observable string here before we switch
our observable stream and before we call
this new observable and make this
request I want to for one gift us a
debounce time of 300 this is
milliseconds here as an argument and
debounce time operator means or this
debones time operated does that we will
only react to events which are at least
300 milliseconds after the last event
received
so here were emitting events on each
type but we will ignore all of them
until 300 milliseconds have passed and
then we will use the last event we got
so once we finish typing and 300
milliseconds have passed we will use the
very last and only this result that we
got now this would be great but we would
still send multiple requests in case
that let's say we type then
we accidentally press a wrong button or
wrong key and we Angeles but we leave
some time but windows and therefore in
fury we would have 300 milliseconds
between it but the actual value has not
changed in order to react to this case
I'll add another operator this tank
anthill changed and this takes no
argument here and this simply means only
use this event you received here an
event of course is this new value
entered into this input if it is
different to the last event and what
this were safe we're waiting for 300
milliseconds and were only reacting to
change the wins so with this if I save
this and now we have a look at our
application I'll ever watch this city
found and I'll use anniversary like
Chicago do you see how it waited until
it updated so I obviously this type so
that's trans again Chicago and only
updated offer was finished instead of
all the time but if I add always here
nothing changes but if I remove
characters you see it changes but if I
quickly change the back get it back
again we got this request and we're not
spamming the server with requests so
this has been an important step here of
course the next step is to add the city
to our list now this is very simple we
no longer need to pass the form here so
I can get rid of this don't need that
anymore I will also get rid of the
observer book or I will leave the part
in the middle because I still need to
construct when you've ever item however
what I do here is I can simply access
this data because here we're already
storing the found city in this data
field so I can just add this this
keyword keyword and with this we should
be good to go and now a last time I'll
have a look at this app load Berlin
click add city and here we get Berlin
and this is the state in which I wanted
now in the next when you will have a
look at how to set up profiles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
