back in this series you'll learn a lot
about bootstrap for in the other videos
in this video I will show you how you
can customize it to your needs
we'll use sass for this a superset to
CSS which allows us to change some
default settings for bootstrap like the
border-radius as you can see here or the
primary color all set conveniently with
sass variables and thereafter we import
and overwrite what we need from the
bootstrap package sounds complicated it
actually isn't so let's dive into that
and let's see how that works
so let's dive right into customizing
this and for DES we'll start on the
official bootstrap documentation page
get bootstrap comm there if you click on
documentation you can click on theming
here on the main page theming here you
find instructions on how you may adjust
the theme or the general look of
bootstrap so to say because bootstrap 4
uses sass behind the scenes now Assassin
case you don't know is basically like a
super set to CSS it's a language
building up on CSS which offers you some
extra features and I'll dive into sass
in just a second and bootstrap for the
team behind it used sass because it
basically makes writing styles easier
everything is compiled to normal CSS
code before it's getting shipped though
so normal CSS code is running in the
browser and normal CSS code is what
we're importing here
with that bootstrap link here however
behind the scenes that uses sass during
the build process and this is exactly
where we need to hook in if we want to
adjust the colors let's say or the
default sizes margins and so on assumed
by bootstrap then we have to override
some defaults which are set up in that
sass code and basically recompile the
bootstrap package to CSS again this is
what we'll do and this is what you find
instructions on on this page so here you
basically find an example structure how
this might look like in your project how
you can override the SAS code or using s
CSS which is a variant of sass so to say
and this is exactly what we will do now
one thing you can already see here is
that it kind of needs bootstrap locally
to do that we need to get the raw source
code behind bootstrap the SAS code and
we can easily get that by installing it
as a local dependency using NPM NPM is
notes package manager
and you get it automatically when
installing note J s we're not going to
write any node.js code but it ships with
that package manager which is the
de-facto standard tool for managing
development dependencies
now I already got that installed and
with that you can go back into your
project open your terminal or command
line either the normal one or like I did
here the one integrated into your IDE
and navigate into that project folder in
that terminal now you can run npm init
using that node package manager tool
which will basically put this project
under control of npm you're then asked a
couple of questions you have to assign a
project name and so on and you can
basically always accept the default of
course you can also find unit to your
needs and once you did all that and
confirmed you should see that there is a
package.json file in your project now
this basically is used by NPM to control
well your project in which dependencies
you have now with that edit you can now
run another command npm install to
install a new dependency and that
dependencies bootstrap so enter
bootstrap here and I'll add - - save -
also store an entry in the package -
JSON file this basically makes sharing
the project easier thereafter it will
now also give you that package locked or
JSON file which stores the exact version
which was installed and then packaged up
Jason you also see that bootstrap was
added as a dependency now with that we
got it locally and we also get this node
modules folder here now now in that
folder you should see that bootstrap
folder and in that bootstrap folder you
have the dist folder with the finished
and and readily compiled bootstrap code
but you also get the s CSS folder and
this holds all the raw code now you
could of course go into such a file here
and start editing stuff there don't do
that it wouldn't get compiled that's the
first problem you'll run into you just
because you edited here it won't affect
the compiled and finished CSS code and
additionally you shouldn't touch this
because if you ever need to reinstall
your project and reinstall that
dependency well you'll overwrite your
changes so we'll
follow a different approach we'll create
our own Maine dot s CSS file a file
where we will write our own CSS code and
also override the bootstrap defaults now
in order to be able to write SAS code or
s CSS code we need a SAS compiler and in
many projects you'll have web pack with
SAS loader in there we could do that
here too but we don't really need web
pack so what I'll do is I'll just go to
SAS - Lang comm and there if you click
on documentation you can learn more
about SAS and especially you can also
learn how to install it under using SAS
you find installation steps for Windows
you need to install Ruby first for Mac
and Linux you already got that we're not
going to write any Ruby code but it it
uses the Ruby package manager basically
to install SAS so you should just run
this gem installed SAS command with Ruby
installed to install SAS on your machine
and once you got that you can run it as
a tool from your command line to compile
SAS or SPSS files to normal CSS files
now this is not a SAS course or videos
if you want to learn more about that
definitely check out tutorials dedicated
to SAS what I want to do here is I just
want to use it to well overwrite my
bootstrap defaults and for that we can
go back to the bootstrap documentation
and there you see that one easy way of
overwriting bootstrap is by importing
everything from that bootstrap folder
the alternative is that we only import
what we need but for that you need to
make sure that you really import
everything you do use in your page
thereafter so I will go with the import
everything approach basically what we
already do and then you add this import
in your main door a CSS file with this
you can now from the terminal in your
project folder run SAS main dot s CSS
main dot CSS and this will overwrite the
main dot CSS file so let me quickly also
grab the styles we have set up there let
me add them after this import and now
hit enter and this now gives you your
main dot CSS file which
is way bigger now because now it
includes the entire bootstrap package
it's also not minified so that would be
something you have to do with some extra
build step we won't do it here I want to
focus on just the customization part the
key thing is that now we got all the
bootstrap styles and that may not see us
as file of course again we could edit
them there but we shouldn't do that
instead let's just import this main dot
CSS file so I will go to my index.html
file get rid of that bootstrap import
here
from the CDM we don't need that anymore
because we got everything and may not
CSS this also means that if we save all
the files and we go back to our project
and if I reload it should look exactly
as it did before because even though
we're not importing bootstrap from a CDN
anymore we still get the entire
bootstrap code imported because it's now
all in our main dot CSS file we can
check this in our browser developer
tools in the head section
we only got that import to main dot CSS
and if we click on sources there we can
see that may not CSS since the indeed
has all these bootstrap data fields now
for one we can also see that bootstrap
seems to use CSS variables here
however we will override the sass
variables and we do that in our main dot
s CSS file where we import bootstrap
there we now have to make sure that we
overwrite any colors or whatever we want
to change bootstrap uses so again back
in your official Docs we find more
information on that we find how we can
set some default colors we have to do
that before we import bootstrap because
we want to declare our own styles before
we import the bootstrap Styles
bootstraps variables in the SAS code are
actually configured in a way that they
won't overwrite our map values if we set
them but if we don't set them then the
bootstrap defaults will be used and this
is how we can set colors for theme
colors we also got that theme colors map
and why don't we just give it a try so
let's copy that theme colors map it's
basically a bit like a JavaScript object
you could say and let's import it or add
it in front of that bootstrap import
now there let's set primary maybe to you
a purple and danger to maybe a different
red simply like a dark red and now keep
in mind primary is a color we are using
in our project for dead submit button
here button primary right now if we have
a look at our project it looks like this
it's blue
now we overwrite this here with theme
colors primary so now what we can do is
we can re-execute that sass compilation
command and once this finishes we should
be able to reload our page and now you
see it's purple and the hover effect is
automatically adjusted to because
bootstrap behind the scenes uses this
variable in a couple of places to set up
a hover style and a default style for
the button and also for that button
outline for the alert which we could
have given a primary style to as you saw
in an earlier video in this series so
wherever we can use that primary color
it's now going to be purple and of
course you cannot just change the
primary color indeed you can find out
what you can change by going to the
bootstrap SCSS folder and in there you
have this variable stud a CSS file
underscore variables in there you
actually see all the variables which
tribe uses and they all have this
default flag so that your changes
actually aren't overwritten madam
they're only used if you don't set them
so if they should be used as a default
and there you see all the colors you can
override you can in general alright what
is blue in bootstrap world or as we did
it you can go to the colors map and in
there you can also override some colors
excuse me theme colors was it there you
can override primary and so on you
cannot just override colors you can also
override the DD dimensions or the sizes
bootstrap uses if you scroll through the
fall you'll see a lot of things used by
bootstrap like the breakpoints and so on
or what a default border radiuses and
you can change all of that
not in this file but in your file you
simply grab the
at border-radius here for example added
in front of the import that's always
important and then change it from the
default which is thought to five REM
change it to let's say ten REM if you
now save this and recompile your code
that's always important recompile the
CSS code if you now reload you see the
inputs are way more around it because we
overrode this default border-radius
and that is really something I encourage
you to play around with there's a lot
you can do with that now coming back to
something else we saw in the docs that
part that you only import what you need
this is actually good because it allows
you to shrink the size of CSS code your
users have to download right now we used
an approach where your users download
everything everything all the times now
if you know you only use the grid and
you only use form inputs and buttons
then you can actually just import these
parts of bootstrap because if you have a
look at the bootstrap scss folder you
see it's actually split up into buttons
into forums and then to grid for example
so let's do that let's import what we
need we got free required imports which
we always need you can see them here in
the docs so let's grab these and insert
them here these are the default
functions variables and mix-ins used by
bootstrap you can override that stuff
but you probably don't overwrite
everything so make sure that you have
the defaults for the parts you don't
overwrite and you do import these
defaults by adding these imports and now
let's import the other parts which we
need like for example the grid this is
how that import would look like but then
we in our case also need the buttons and
we need the forms and as a side note you
might notice that we omit that
underscore which is part of the file
name this is simply automatically added
by SAS so to say so you have to import
without the underscore now with that all
added we can recompile again now it's
also faster of you saw that and in our
main on CSS file it's leaner now it
still has a lot of code
there but actually it only has two grid
related code the forms at the button
related drug code if you for example
search for alert in there you won't find
any alert classes because we didn't
include alerts this also has one hour
implication if we now reload our page
there's one thing that should be broken
right now the navigation bar
so let's reload and indeed forum looks
good
button looks good but the default Styles
like the text that's broken anti
navigation bar as mentioned is broken
now the reason for this of course is
that we didn't include the navigation
bar here the nav bar we didn't include
that so let's go back that's always
include the nav bar and regarding the
default styles are that you've old
textile dad actually is the reboot
package which sets some default styles
for the browser with that we can
recompile everything reload and the text
is fixed the nav bar is kind of fixed
I'd say now the reason for the invisible
nav bar is that we also need to include
utilities here because we're using some
utility features in the nav bar dad if
we go back here it is again our response
if nature is only kind of working though
for example I'd right here you see this
is not really working as it should for
that we need to include the transitions
so that we can play this animation to
expand or well remove our mobile nav bar
with that if we get recompile and then
reload we can already see it now this is
working here and now we go back to the
state where we were before now as you
see it can be tricky to import
everything you need I also had to look
up for example the transition thing or
into utilities it's easy to overlook
this if you think just eat the navbar
and one other important thing you can
always look into these files of course
you can look in there for example the
type package we're not importing this
but here we also seem to set some
typography related things so we might
also want to import that after reboot
may be so reboot set some browser
defaults in general but the
type package here then set some general
typography related settings for
bootstrap so dad is also something we
might want to import even though I don't
see a directive friends here but you can
always look into these Falls you can
find out which variables two different
features their use and you can look into
the variables files in general as
explained and then you can always
override the things there after import
what you need on your project and they
have four improve your bundle your file
size and tweak it to your needs so this
is how you can customize bootstrap for
or projects using bootstrap for again
this could also be implemented into a
web pack workflow where you just compile
your sass file differently in the end I
hope this was helpful and then with all
these videos you now understand how you
can actually work with bootstrap and add
it to your next project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
