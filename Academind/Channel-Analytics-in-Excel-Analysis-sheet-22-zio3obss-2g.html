finish that and what is that well this
is our analysis sheet and this is the
last step before we can finally create
some charts the good thing about that
sheet is that we now organize the data
the way we want it to be so we have that
two tables but we have the statistics by
period and by region or by period and
country and we have that list right here
and this list allows us to select the
statistics that should be displayed
dynamically this is good the bad thing
is that at the moment our excel doesn't
look like this but look like that so
time to create that list and time to
learn some more formulas so the first
thing that we should change is that cell
d1 right here as we just saw this should
be a drop-down list that allows us to
select the different statistics now
let's create that drop-down list by
selecting cell d1 like a dude right here
now we go to the data ribbon to the data
tools area and here we can press that
data validation button like this now we
are in that settings menu and if we
change that validation criteria allow
section right there from any value to
list we almost created our drop-down
list the only thing that we have to
define is what should be displayed in
the drop-down list or what things can
you select in there for instance if we
go to that source area and type one two
and three like this press ok then we see
that our statistics cell changed we now
have that arrow next to the cell and if
we click that arrow we can now select
one two three so if I select two for
instance the cell value changes to that
selected value now that's almost what we
want we want a drop-down list like this
but the content or the selection options
are not the ones that we want we want to
have something else in here and what do
we want well if we go to the input
summary sheet
we see that we have these statistics in
column E or in cell e2 until j2 so watch
seven minutes until subscribers and we
could now select that criteria in our
drop-down list but I don't want to do it
like this I would like to have that
statistics that we want to select in a
separate sheet and not in one row but in
one column this is not necessary I just
want to show you how you can do
something like this that's why we do
that now so the first thing we need is
we need a new sheet which we can create
by pressing on the plus let's drag it to
the left and call it statistics list
because that's what it's going to be and
now if we go back to the input summary
sheet we see that we have a total number
of six statistics that's important to
know for the formula we will apply right
now because if we go back to the
statistics list sheet right now and
select 6 cells because that's the amount
of statistics we have and now write
equals transpose and press tab we will
be able to turn that statistics from a
row into a column now this is an area
formula in Excel I'm not going to talk
about array formulas in detail right now
but there is one specific thing you have
to know if you want to apply the
transpose area formula actually two
things the first thing is that you have
to select the amount of cells that you
want to transpose in your final output
sheet so in this sheet at the moment and
that's why I selected that six cells and
previously checked how many cells we
want to transpose now that we selected
that six cells and wrote that transpose
formula we can go to the input summary
and select those six cells that you want
to transpose so that we want to turn
from a row into a column and if I now
press ENTER we see a value error the
reason is that we applied an error
formula without typing the right command
the
I'd command for an error formula is not
enter after you wrote that formula it's
something different and the different
thing is that if we select that range
again so I'm going to sell a one where
we have the formula and now select the
six cells the results should be
displayed in press f2 and now I don't
press ENTER like you do it in a normal
formula but I press shift ctrl + Enter
then we see that it works like I said
I'm not going to talk about the details
and the background of such error
formulas in this video but you have to
know that you can use that transpose
formula to turn rows into columns or
vice versa of course but you have to be
careful that you select all the cells
that should contain results in the end
like we did right here so those six
cells and that you don't press Enter but
shift control enter after you typed that
formula now that we know that and now
that we have a list of the statistics
that we want to display we can go back
to our analysis sheet select cell d1 so
the cell with the data list go back to
the data ribbon where we still are go
again to data validation and now we see
that our source data is still here but
we want to change that so let's select
that and delete it and if we now press
on to that arrow right here let's do
that then you can select the inputs for
your data list so in our case this would
be the statistics list that we just
created and the six statistics like
sorry like that
now we selected all the values and if
you now press ENTER once and twice then
you see that nothing changed for a
moment but if you click onto that arrow
next to your drop-down list you can now
select the different statistics let's
select the watch time in minutes for
instance and double click right here to
increase the column width and now you
can choose the statistic that you want
to be displayed in the views for
instance right here the only problem is
that you can of course select all
statistics right here but it doesn't
have an impact at the moment
because nothing is displayed in that
column see so we need a formula that
allows us to retrieve the data based
under selected statistic and based on
something else well based on this
identifier because if you go back to our
input summary sheet we see that the
identifier allows us to identify each
row and by that each country and the
corresponding period and that our list
that we just created allows us to select
the column so the statistic that should
be retrieved so we need a formula which
allows us to combine those two things so
we want to find the identifier and the
statistic and then retrieve the
corresponding statistic of that country
in that period now let's have a look at
a formula that can do something like
this and this is the formula that I'm
going to use it's called index match
match now we talked about the index
match formula in the previous videos so
I'm not going to explain the details
about index match in this video however
as you can see right here index match
match simply allows us to add a second
criteria to our initial match so this
means with index match match we are able
to find our identifier so the one we
just saw in our input summary sheet and
the analysis sheet as the vertical match
so criteria one and we can also add
another match which would be the
statistics saw the statistics from the
drop-down list we just created as the
second match that horizontal match as I
call it right here and in between those
two matches we find the index this is
the result area and the important thing
that you have to remember when we will
now create that formula that d2 match
types have to build a frame around that
index so remember that structure because
we will recreate that now in Excel so
I'm now in the input summary sheet this
means we have to go back to the analysis
sheet and now we go to cell d2 and write
match we know that already so we can
simply write our
for the identifiers so we want to find
that identifier in our input summary
sheet in column B and this is wrong
because we did that with the normal
index match formula so selecting the
whole column but this is not going to
work with the index match match formula
you remember that frame I talked about
that has to be built by those two
matches around the index area so this is
the first frame the first column match
actually so we cannot select the entire
column but we have to start right here
because when we select that part we can
then create the second match and in
between those two matches we will build
the index area let's see how this works
so I'm selecting B free press shift ctrl
+ D down key to select all the values
that we have in the column now we write
a comma and make an exact match this is
fine and now comes the second match and
the second match can simply be added by
typing another comma and writing match
again like this so after pressing tab we
now have to go back to our analysis
sheet and select the second lookup value
and this is the drop down list because
if we refer that second lookup value to
that list then we can select the
statistics dynamically and that's what
we want so I selected that drop down
list or that cell d1 right here right a
comma go back to the input summary sheet
let's scroll up right here and now comes
an important thing I was already talking
about we cannot select only the
statistics because if we do that our
frame that we want to create doesn't
work because as I said we want to build
that frame around the index area and as
we started our column right here we also
have to start our second match right
there because then those two matches
build that frame and the index area is
in between as you can see right here so
this is why you have to create that
index match match that way to make sure
it retrieves the right value
or the right results actually now that
we selected that we can write a comment
and write a zero for an exact match
again and well now we do something we
already know as the formula is called
index match match we have to write the
index part in front of those two matches
right index press tab and now as I just
showed you we have to start with our
index right here so this is it now we
can press shift ctrl + u right arrow key
and shift ctrl + D down arrow key to
select the entire index area now we
write another comma press ENTER once and
twice and we receive 8 8 3 3 to 4 the
views in the United States in the first
period let's see if this is correct if
we scroll up and we can find the 8 8 3 3
2 views in that cell so we created the
formula correctly and now the great
thing is if we go back to analysis if
you change that right here from views to
likes this also changes so we have that
dynamic data retrieving option right now
let's also see if that's the right value
by the way to make sure that we didn't
make a mistake this seems to be correct
so this is fine now we have to do
something that you already know we have
to go into the formula and fix the cells
columns or rows to make sure that the
references are still correct if we copy
that formula down so the index area this
is something that has to be fixed
totally so rows and columns so I'm
simply pressing f4 right here and right
there
the match for the first criteria so the
identifier here we have to fix the
column to make sure that it remains in
column a for the match lookup area for
the first criteria so the identifier
well we should fix that completely and
then we can go to the second match here
we have to match also everything because
this shouldn't change and the same thing
is true for the lookup error for that
second match
like this now we can press ENTER and go
to cell c2 press ctrl + D down key go to
the right press shift ctrl + the up
arrow key and now press ctrl down now we
copied all of our statistics into that
column and we can still select whatever
statistics we want to have in that
column so those four columns now include
all of the information that we need to
create that two tables that we want so
the first table with the statistics by
period and by region and the second
table with the statistics by period and
country now let's see how we can get the
data out of that four columns into that
two tables so let's first create the
tables and call that region and now we
need to find the periods according to
the sheet names of course to make sure
that this will work correctly and this
is January to February oh sorry
February 17 let me just increase the
column width and copy that to write also
see like that the column width and call
that country like this let's also apply
some basic formatting now to make it
look a little bit more beautiful and to
change the formats of cells well you can
go to the home ribbon and in the font
area you find some formatting options
that you have so in this case I will
select the four columns right here
change the color of that cell or the
theme colors as you can see right here
to blue maybe and the font color to
white make it bold and maybe align that
to the right like this so this looks
better now I think and we can do
something like this so blue and white
and bold and simply copy that select
that press ctrl alt B and paste the
formats like this
now let's press escape to exit that
cells and now we only need to fill that
two tables with information the first
information we need is the region right
here and we have that information
already in that sheet so we can simply
select the region cell press shift ctrl
and the down key and copy that to right
here and we can simply press ctrl alt V
again and paste the values that's enough
and let's do the same thing for the
countries that's why we copied the
country names right here simply shift
ctrl and the down key ctrl Z let's go
back up here bright here select the cell
k2 right now press ctrl alt B and paste
the values so we got that no we have to
remove the tablet heads again of course
because we only want to have each region
and each country wants but we learned
that already so we can do that quickly
by selecting the entire sorry that by
selecting the entire column like this
going to the data ribbon to remove
duplicates we don't want to expand our
selection and press from of public heads
and ok and we see that we have seven
unique values which is fine and now
let's do the same thing for the country
column right here
go to data remove wks we don't want to
expand the selection also in this case
remove duplicates and press ok and again
ok now increase that column width and
now we see that we basically have almost
everything we need and the only thing
that's missing is the data of course but
before we do that let me decrease that
column width so that you can see
everything I'm writing right here so
it's same like this maybe so we don't
have any statistics in here at the
moment and to get that statistics into
that cells we have to make sure to meet
two conditions the first condition is
the region
so we only want to have a value right
here if we have the region and a in
column C the second condition is that we
only want to have the value also if not
only that na is true but also if we have
the data for the period from January to
June 2016 so only if the left and we
know that formula already ten characters
of that values in here are equal to cell
g1 now I'm going to show you a formula
which can do that and this formula is
called some product now as the name says
the sum product formula actually
retrieves the sum of products you define
in specific ranges however I'm not going
to use the sum product formula for that
purpose I'm using it for the purpose I
just explained so basically to calculate
a son based on two conditions in our
case and I'm not going to talk about the
formula right now I will just write the
formula and then go for the formula step
by step together with you because then
you will easily understand what this
formula is really great for the thing
that we want to do right here now let's
start writing the formula as I said it's
called some product like this and you
can see again the original meaning of
that formula so to return the sum of
products of corresponding ranges or
arrays but that's somehow what you're
going to do but let me just show you
what I mean so we press tab and now we
have to define the first array but I'm
not going to do this I'm going to write
those two dashes why am i doing this let
me show you that in a few seconds so we
wrote the first two dashes make the
first bracket and now we have to define
the first range where we can find the
first criteria so DNA and the range for
that is of course the whole column C
because in that column C we should look
for that criteria so if I say
now cell c2 press shift ctrl + V donkey
and now write equals and scrolling up
and now select that nae and cell f2 so
what we are basically writing right here
is that the formula now simply sees if a
row or a cell in that column is equal to
an A
that's the only thing you have to know
for the moment let's go on now we can
close that bracket write a comma and
again two dashes and open another
bracket and now we need a left formula
press tab because we only want to see if
cell g1 so the second criteria is equal
to the left first 10 characters of
column a or of each row in column a
actually and this is why I have to write
a left formula now select the entire
values in column a like this write a
comma define the 10 characters that we
want you check because that's the thing
that we have to look for if the first 10
characters are equal close the bracket
write another equal sorry no bracket at
the moment scroll the gap select cell G
1 close that bracket now write a comma
and now define the range the actual sum
should be calculated from and that's
column D by the way you cannot see that
right so let's drag that right here so
column D and again shift ctrl + the down
key and if we now press ENTER another
time enter we see that we have a sum and
how was this sum calculated well let's
take another look at that formula by
pressing f2 so the first part that - -
is that range and the criteria simply
does nothing more as I just said then
looking through column C and check if
each of
the rows or if actually goes for that a
row by row and sees if a row is equal to
f2 so to an a if this is true and this
is the important thing right now this is
set to one why is this term set to one
then no because of those two dashes
because those two dashes simply
transform fours are true to 0 or 1 so if
that first condition is true so if a
cell is equal to na then we have a 1 in
that part of the formula let's go to the
second condition here we have again
those two dashes that turn falls into a
0 and true into a 1 and we have that
left formula we talked about that
so you know why we are using this so
what happens right here is that we see
if the left 10 characters are equal to
g1 so - the period in that cell if that
is true so again this is displayed as 1
so we have 1 times 1 so this is 1
basically and if this is true then we
built a sum for all of the rows in our
case where this is true so for each row
where we have the match between the
column a and the column C suburb or for
true we simply create the sum of the
corresponding values in column D and
that's why this is basically a sum if
actually so if those two conditions are
true then we create the sum for that
statistics and that's it and this is why
this formula is great in that case and
why the only thing you have to do right
now is we have to fix the references
again of course so let's do this and we
don't want to change the column right
here so we have to fix both the region
well this should be able to move down
but not to the right so we have to fix
the column like that the range for left
should be the way it is g1 should only
change in terms of the column but not in
terms of the row and the views or the
result should remain in that column also
now let's press
now we can select that formula press
shift and right keys and shift and down
keys press f2 and control and enter and
now we see that we received or that we
retrieved our statistics for all of the
regions for all of the periods now one
thing we could maybe do as a quick check
we could check if the sum of the views
that we have read here is equal to the
sum that we have in column D so we see
that two five six seven one nine zero
let's now select all the values we have
right here
two five six seven one nine zero so this
seems to be correct let's now go back
right here select that cell g2 press
ctrl Z and also paste that to that
column or to that cell so l2 now this is
wrong but we can simply change that by
pressing f2 dragging that and a so that
a region match and turning it into a
country match and also dragging that
region to the country in the initial
table we want to look for the value not
if we have that let's press ENTER and we
see that this seems to work because we
have the eight eight three free two
which is the same that we have right
here now press shift and the right arrow
key keep shift hold and scroll down we
are almost there just a few loops here
we are now press f2 control enter again
and we have again the two five six seven
one nine zero that you already know and
by that we now created our analysis
sheet so this was great we use some
formulas we created a list and we can
now dynamically retrieve the results as
we prefer like this and you see that
everything updates let's maybe change
the color of that cell to make clear
that this is a cell but you can select
something by going back to home and
maybe turn that into a gray and create a
little border outside and turn that into
lack also now I think it's more clear
what you want to write here and again we
can select whatever we want and we see
that the statistics change now this was
great I think and now it's time to
finally create some charts to better
visualize what we actually can see right
here so let's create the charts in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
