angular 2 series in the last video we
left when we just had our component at
the point where we could click on a
heading where our name is displayed and
edited with two weight binding now for
this video I first promised you multiple
components and secondly I want to make
this contact a little more interesting
because in a real application you
wouldn't have just one contact right so
we will create an array of contacts and
then we will loop through a list where
we will be able to click on a single
contact and see his information so let's
get into this now I will start by just
changing this contact with a property
here to an array and then I will hmm
bracket then I will just restructure
this and we will need find a several
contacts which I will just insert really
quick
so I got my contacts over here and now
to be able to loop through it I will
first create an unordered list here at
the top with a list item
inside it and I will just restructure
this really quick okay fine
oops fine this is my list item here and
now I'm basically attaching everything I
had for this heading here to this list
item item so let's just indent this
maybe push this to a new line and I will
get rid of this heading here now
obviously this won't display anything as
of yet because we're not looping through
anything and we'll change this by adding
a new directive a new structural
directive like the ng F we also got the
ng 4 directive so we also have a star at
the beginning because it is a structural
directive and then we type ng 4 equals
and now we will loop through all our
contacts by using the following syntax
which says contact off contacts now this
hashtag contact here M creates a local
variable this is angular 2 syntax and
maps this variable to the current
contact we're looping through so now we
get this and if we save this we see that
it isn't displaying as of now and just
because this bottom part here is
creating errors as it's still referring
to a contact which is not available down
here because the contact variable is
this one and this is only a local
variable available within this loop and
therefore not at the bottom here so now
we got our list and to be able to see
the detail information again I will make
some changes here I will replace the
show detailed property with the selected
contact property I will also pass the
selected contact here in there on select
method I definitely have to add it here
as an argument and then I will map it to
this selected contact and the selected
contact property now is available or
outside of our loop because it's a
property of the component selected
contact let's see this should work now
yeah almost it doesn't display the phone
number an email and just because this
check here won't work anymore it will
always return false because show detail
doesn't exist anymore
so I'll just get rid of it and if we
save this now it works and as you can
see we can again edit stuff okay cool so
that is CNG for directive now the second
part of this video is that we will split
this master detail view up into two
separate components I therefore will
create a subfolder which I will call the
contacts because our contact related
stuff will go there and I will create a
new file which we call contact list dot
ta component TS and in here we first
have to import component from angular to
core we then get our component selector
like this and be sure to remember the
curly braces and below it we have our
class export contact list component
export class contactless component okay
now we get this and in this list here I
will copy the list easy to remember
remember I guess and we will copy it to
our template configuration here at the
backticks again and paste it inside here
just fix the indentation and now I got
my template here and I will also need a
selector here to be able to embed this
component in our components or in HTML
in general so that selector will be
contact list I can then use the selector
in the app component we're writing
contact list but this won't display it
as of yet because app component has no
chance of knowing of contact list it
just recognizes that this is an HTML tag
it doesn't know
so as we specified for our index.html in
the boot ts that we have our app
component we have to specify in our app
component that we have our contact list
component and we do this by adding the
directives configuration which basically
says hey here come some custom made
directives you have to know and remember
components are directives just with a
few component or a template attached to
it and I will add it by just adding the
contact list component here and
recognize that in in phpstorm the import
statement got automatically added so if
I save this now to be able to display it
I also have to copy all this stuff here
because it belongs to the contact list
copy it here save it and now let me just
comment out the stuff here again so we
don't get error
from it save it and now we got our list
here now let's create our detailed view
or a detailed component by adding a file
contact component yes and to make it
easier I just
oops I just copy everything from this
file get rid of the stuff I don't need
and the selector will adjust the contact
and we can already add it as a directive
to our contact list because this will be
the place where we will embed it
directives contact oh and I need to
rename it here then I will find it with
my autocomplete your contact component
again importing automatically done by
phpstorm for me and now I added this
component now I will fetch all of the
detail code here from our app component
so that all that is left there is just
our contact list tag and add it to the
template here re indent save and this
won't work because we haven't got the
selected contact property here and in
general the question is how do we send
the contact which we select in this
component to our contact component and
we do this by creating a custom
directive or custom data binding so to
say and we will be able to bind to a
custom property in a custom component so
a lot of lots of customization going on
here so we do this by going to our
contact component creating a public
property name naming it contact again
which just as an empty object and then
we have when this is very important we
have to add some configuration to our
selector here
our decorator here which is the inputs
configuration which takes an array and
the inputs configuration tells our
component or tails angular to that this
component will be able to receive data
which is bound to the properties we
define here in quotation marks and which
matches the name of our public property
down here so we can now add this below
our unordered list add a contact tag and
bind to it by using square brackets
because data is going to flow inside our
component find the selected contact here
so that we send our selected contact to
our contact component and here we will
have to replace selective contact by
just using contact save it and now if we
click on stuff here you will see it
works now one thing that doesn't work as
of now is the styling and this has two
reasons one is the check here doesn't
work because show detail does not exist
anymore as a property so I will just
replace it by checking if our selected
contact equals the contact of the
current iteration and additionally I
need to you copy this Styles
configuration to our contact list here
because this is what we need to styling
and now you will see it again works so
in this video we really covered a lot we
had our custom components where we had
our data binding so we could send data
from one component to the other and we
had the ng4 directive so as of now you
already know a lot of things which are
really the core of creating angular 2
applications and I hope you're really
enjoying it to say
way I do in the next video I will show
you how we use services to have a more
elegant way of fetching data instead of
just having a fixed property with our
array of contacts in our contact list
component and this will provide you with
the means of general using service to
provide data or to provide yet general
services to all possible places and
components inside your app so we'll see
you there
have a nice day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
