progressive web apps is a term
describing a set of technologies that
allow us to do one cool thing take your
desktop web application
the idea behind progressive web apps and
different features that comprises is
that we can progressively enhance our
web application to look and feel like a
native mobile app while still staying a
web app it's reliable because it loads
fast and it provides offline
functionality so with one of the
features that's part of progressive Web
Apps serviceworkers you can cache files
to serve them even if the user is
offline progressive web apps are fast
you respond quickly to use reactions and
it's engaging it feels like a native app
because you for example can access the
device camera all of a sudden yes this
is possible from within a web app so why
wouldn't you just build a mobile app if
you want all of that let's have a look
at some numbers here we see the usage of
apps or of things on a mobile device so
off they're available time users spend
87% in native mobile apps and 30% on the
mobile web so in the browser off their
mobile phone searching web pages well
that looks pretty bad for web apps
doesn't it well let's first of all have
a look at why it looks like this because
mobile apps have pushed notifications
that draw users in to them we have home
screen icons which make it easier to
interact with them with them with web
pages we can access native device
features like the camera and they
possibly work offline so if we offer all
of that in the web wouldn't that make it
more appealing it would and with
progressive web apps we can and there's
one strong argument why it's worth the
effort because if we have a look at what
it takes to build a native app if you
want to offer it on both platforms we
need to learn both languages for iOS and
Android and that this is important
80% of the time spent by users in mobile
apps goes towards their top free apps so
you never get anything off their time
they always spend it at Facebook Google
Maps and whatsapp or whatever your
favorite free apps are now that's the
reason why we want to build a
progressive web app we got the
advantages of the web like the broader
reach and we can still use native mobile
app like features in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
