create a react + Redux application and
how to structure your project or at
least this is my approach and a commonly
seen approach of structuring such a
project there is one important other
thing I want to touch on before
finishing this series before finishing
this basics series here it's about
asynchronous actions so far all our
actions here are asynchronous there is
no asynchronous actions action amongst
them they're all executed immediately
we're not fetching something from a
server or anything like that now in a
real application you oftentimes have the
use case that you want to reach out to a
server or have some other action which
may take a couple of seconds before it
finishes and with redux you can handle
such actions too or specifically with
third-party packages which can be either
added as malware let's consider the
following action here when I set a name
I don't want to set it immediately let's
say it takes a couple of seconds because
we have to write it to a database and
wait for the answer from the database or
something like that in this case I don't
return a JavaScript object here instead
I return a fat arrow function which has
one argument which is why I can leave
out the parentheses dispatch and this
function here then has let's say a timer
to simulate a server request which takes
a couple of seconds here instead of set
timeout you would reach out to the
server and wait for the answer so let's
say it takes two seconds again just to
simulate it after two seconds this
callback here gets executed that's the
default set timer function again if you
were reaching out to the server you
would probably also trigger some
callback once the data is there in this
callback you then call the dispatch
function
which I'm passing as argument which gets
passed by redux and this dispatch
function expects what a JavaScript
object with the type and then the
payload and the payload would be what
you probably got back from your server
here I'm just setting it equal to name
again so that's a a an asynchronous task
and if I reload my application here you
see I get an error actions must be
playing objects use custom middleware
for a sync actions well it sounds good
that's exactly what we want to do here
so in order to use a custom object I
have to install third-party middleware
or in order to use an asynchronous
action here this middleware is called
read acts funk and I'll also add the
save flag to save it at the package.json
file so read X dot a redux funk get gets
installed here and I want to use it in
my store here when I apply the mill
aware so URL add number import and I
import funk from redux funk and this
middleware is then applied here I have
my logger and then I apply funk without
parenthesis because funk happens to be
an export from this package here which
is not a function e to execute but
instead the middleware the right away
the middleware reread acts that wants to
execute so with that I'm applying this
middleware and if I save it now reload
my application here click on change
username you see after two seconds it
changed to an ax you also saw that this
action was dispatched right away before
then set name was handled here and
that's the asynchronous task which was
handled by func this first one is
undefined one let's see it again
for real OG application we have max here
if I click on this we see the first
action and then after two seconds when
you see the second action
setname and we see that now the name was
indeed changed and that's the funk
middleware at work as you see it's
really easy we only added one package
and then add the middleware and then we
were able to use an asynchronous task
here so redux funk makes using
asynchronous dispatching you're really
simple sometimes or probably often times
you will not use a timeout function here
I'm commenting all of this out here but
instead you will probably use a promise
so it would be convenient if you could
still return your JavaScript object
where you have type of let's say set
name and then you have a payload which
is a promise so let's say this is a new
promise since we're using es6 we can use
the promise here and let me quickly
reorganize this so we have the promise
your promise as you might be aware
otherwise definitely check out some es6
resources has a callback or has a
function as an argument this constructor
of the promise has an function as an
argument where the function has Q inputs
two arguments resolver rechecked which
again our functions we can call and then
here in this promise or in this function
we pass to the promised constructor I'll
again create a timeout function again if
promise is telling you to you definitely
have a look at some es6 resources and in
this timeout callback here inside of the
promise or this function passed to the
promise I'll then call resolve after
after two seconds here let's say and
I'll resolve the name so the promise is
resolved and this would be a typical
setup where you reach out to the server
through some kind of library which also
uses promises and which will also
resolve in the end and then it would be
nice if you could simply use your well
promise call here
your server call here which returns you
a promise so I'm simulating this here
now if I save this click on that now I
get and well an error again because
Redux funk is not able to handle this
and read acts also isn't by default for
this case we would use another
third-party package npm install
it's called Redux promise middleware and
the name is very clear about what it
does in my store the chase file I'll
import this middleware import promise
from redux promise
middleware oh I didn't add it to the
package stretch chase and did I let me
quickly add this a flag so that it is
there once I ship this to the repository
to the github repo so now I have my
promise middleware and I'll add it to my
apply middleware function your promise
and this again is a package where I need
to execute it and you can find out such
things of course in the official
documentation of the packages so
importing redux promise malware should
have it here - yes i do sell with that
safe this reload my application click on
this we don't get the error message but
we also don't see the name change here
though no error message happens we see
we see set name being called and then
set name fulfilled and what's this
fulfilled thing we haven't set this up
right well that's done by this third
party package by the Redux middleware
promise package it takes our action name
set name and adds pending fulfilled the
state it currently is in so in order to
actually do something I need to then
change this year in the reducer to set
name fulfilled I don't change my action
or this is still
setname but here in my reduce room
listening to sets name fulfilled
so again if a reload is click on this
now you saw it change to ana because now
set name fulfilled is handled by my
reducer so that's the alternative way if
you're using a promise and you may use
whichever way you prefer you can either
use the commented out one with the funk
middleware and of course you could also
use a promise in here that would also
work or if you know well it's going to
be a promise and i want you take the
easier way for that promise with this
promise middleware well then this
approach here is the right one just make
sure to listen to underscore fulfilled
here at the end and also make sure to
check out the official github
repositories with the documentation on
these packages on this middleware to
learn more about them and learn how to
use them how to configure them and so on
but that they are the basics about
handling asynchronous tasks in your
react.js redux application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
