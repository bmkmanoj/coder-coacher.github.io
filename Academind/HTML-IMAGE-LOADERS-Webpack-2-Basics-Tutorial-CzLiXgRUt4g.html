we're going to learn how we can use HTML
loader to dynamically copy an HTML file
and inject our bundles automatically
into it and how we may use a file loader
to do the same for images basically this
video builds up on this video where we
already set up a basic web back to
project allowing us to compile es6 code
to JavaScript code with babel and s CSS
code to CSS code you can find a link in
the video description where you can get
the starting code for this project I'm
using here so with that let's dive into
that project here and what you can see
is I opened it in the webstorm and
that's the basic project we're starting
with CSS and JavaScript code here our
webpage config file as mentioned before
making sure that we compile the es6 code
and s CSS code and that is everything
for now that's nice but as mentioned at
the beginning of the video I now want to
tweak this set up and improve it a
little bit more one thing I don't like
is we have the index.html file sitting
in the root directory here it kind of
would make more sense to put it into the
source directory to indicate that we of
course may change this file too
so that we are able to well change it
and then copy it to the dist folder so
that we do have it in our distribution
folder too so that in the end also our
dist folder contains everything we need
to deploy right now if we run npm run
build they'll project to be precise you
will notice that we get a dist folder
but in this this folder we actually only
have to bundle javascript file the main
CSS file and the index.html file is not
inside the folder sort of this kind of
counterintuitive
whenever the thing I setup right now is
I include the imports for script and CSS
manually in the index.html file it would
be nice to have one single workflow
where it is done automatically and
finally if we were to use images and we
stored these images in the source folder
that also would not work because we
don't copy the image file over to the
dist folder or something like that
a couple of things we can improve and I
will start improving that right now and
I want to start by fetching an image so
that we can see that this image copying
and implementation actually works so I
will simply search for webpack here
since that sounds like a good image for
this case and I will have a look at the
P and cheese here because I want to show
how to include such a PNG file and why
don't we simply take this one year so I
will simply save this image and of
course you are free to choose any other
image I will save it in the folder where
I have this project we're working on
right now and there in the source folder
I create a new image folder and here I
will insert the WebP egg logo dot PHP
file a PNG file so with that we add a
discharge X we can find it here in the
image folder now the next step is I will
move the index.html file entity source
folder because that's the other thing we
wanted to do to have that all in one
folder and in the end also have it all
in a dist folder and therefore in this
index.html file and I want to include
this image so I will add a div below my
head in here where I will add an image
tag and I simply want to point to the
image folder and then the web pack logo
PNG file and give it some alt text of
web heck maybe so that's my index.html
file set up well almost
I also want to remove the script and the
CSS imports because that's the outer
part I mentioned I want to include these
dynamically so that we don't have to
hard code it into your with that the
index.html file is prepared we get an
image but of course the word flow is not
at all in a state to handle this so
let's add some new loaders to enhance
our website configuration if we have a
look at our packaged our JSON file here
we see we already get a couple of
loaders but we'll need some new ones so
I will use NPM install - - save dev
again to save them as development
dependencies and store them as such new
package JSON file and the loaders or
packages of one install are the HTML
loader for the HTML file the HTML web
pack plug-in which will then create
to recreate that HTML file based on the
one we're using as a source so it will
basically not just copy it it will
create a new one but use the old one as
a template you could say then the file
loader to also copy some files like
images in our case here and for now
that's everything I will add something
else later in this video though so these
are the three new loaders or two loaders
one plug-in I want to add and what's
that I can go to my web config and
adjust that so in there I'll simply
start in the rules section and I'll add
a new rule what I want to test for it
being an HTML file so just as you
learned it I'll test for the extension
with this regular expression then I'm
going to use something and that
something is an array however I only
have one loader and that's just the HTML
loader so I can use that shortcut of
putting just a string into this array
like I do here so that already is the
HTML loader all we need for that let's
work on the loader for the images next
that's an average JavaScript object in
our rules array here I want to test for
it being an image and of course you can
have multiple formats I want to allow
two formats here and the regular
expression for that uses these
parentheses you have a or condition in
between so to say so here I will check
if it's a dot jpg or with a pipe symbol
a dot PNG file these file types can now
be handled by this rule and there I will
use my array of course I will add my
loader and here when I add some options
that's why I'm using the object notation
the loader is the file loader but I also
want to define something about where it
just gets stored and how it should be
named so add my options object cutis
loader and now the file loader takes a
couple of options and as always you can
learn more about these options on the
official page simply google for web hex
file loader and you will find you get a
page with the documentation so you're in
options I wanted to find the name by
default it would give it some hash so
the normal file name you use
or would be replaced by some random hash
not there's nothing wrong with that you
can do that but I want to keep the
original name so I will simply use in
square brackets name which is a variable
which is recognized by file loader and
means okay keep the old name then dot
and then in square brackets you xed and
you might be able to guess what it means
however it should be enclosed in single
quotation marks that whole expression
and that suddenly means keep your
original name and extension and why do
we need to specify this as mentioned
because by default file loader would use
this random hash and you can also
configure some other things about it and
therefore this is what I want to use as
a configuration here to simply copy the
file you could say so that's the name I
also want to tell it where to output it
to with the output pause which also
takes a string by default it would just
shove it into our output folder which is
our dist folder here now that is not
what I want here I want you have it in a
subfolder and that again it's just a
personal preference you can leave it in
the disk folder you can have all your
assets into this folder in the end all
your deployment artifacts here however
as mentioned I want to have it in the
image folder so I will put image slash
here as output puff and I'll do the same
for the public path the last option I
want to set that all there will be image
to inform it where it is now is so an
output path we tell it copy it into the
image folder but it will also
automatically update our HTML file with
the correct new place of this and we
need to set this to public path to still
well put image slash and then the name
of the image into the index.html file it
would not do that otherwise so out the
purpose for copying the other one is for
well keeping the correct reference in
the places where we use this image so
with that the image loader is prepared
the HTML loader is prepared but the HTML
loader
is only one part of well what we need to
set up with dead we basically extract
any HTML it finds so in the HTML
while in this case and we'll store it as
text and that isn't useful for us we
need to use another tool which we
already installed we need to use the
HTML web tag plugin this is a plug-in
which will actually create a brand new
HTML file but we can tell it that it
should do so based on some template and
what's a good template for an HTML file
well besides other supported options
like handlebars or ejs HTML of course
and that is just what we store with the
HTML loader so all we need to do now is
we need to import this plug-in so the
HTML web pack plug-in which we require
from the package we just added HTML web
pack plug-in and then in the plugins
array at the bottom of our config I
simply instantiate this plug-in with new
HTML web pack plug-in and here I need to
pass a JavaScript object where I
configure it you don't have to do so in
that case if you pass no configuration
it would create a new index.html file by
default
give it some dummy title and that's
important automatically and checked all
your bundles you create so you main dot
CSS file and the bundle torch as well so
it would do that it will still do that
if we add a tiny configuration the
template configuration which will still
create a index.html file so that is the
name it will use which will still inject
our bundles so scripts at the end of the
body section and CSS code in the head
section but which will in opposite to
the usage without a configuration not
prefilled this index.html file with some
dummy text but instead take our HTML
dummy so therefore here I can simply say
the template should be our source in the
XHTML file and this is then of course
parsed by the HTML loader which fetches
the HTML text which again is a valid
template for the HTML file we're
creating with this plug-in and with that
everything will work so we're pointing
to source index.html we make sure that
we use that for the index.html file
which gets created
the dist folder and that already is a
major step of what we need to set up now
we're almost done when we're going to
adjust though is the public path because
keep in mind right now not right now the
last time you configure this the
index.html file was in the root folder
so telling web pack that the path of our
assets is in the distal der was correct
that's not the case anymore
now the index.html file will sit in the
dist folder too so we can simply remove
this comment it out for example the
public path well in width is in place if
we now run npm run build to start the
web pack development server
let's see dad looks alright here I guess
no errors so if we now with it localhost
8080 dad looks good we see the image and
the rest is also still working here so
that's all looking great let's also try
our development build npm randall plots
you create the dist folder and there we
see we get an image folder with our epic
file and in the index.html file we can
see that it correctly points to that
folder here we also see that it injected
our bundle chairs script import and the
main dot CSS import so this would all
now all be prepared to be deployed and
keep in mind we didn't add this here in
the source folder this was in these
injected you can't find the script or
CSS import in here so that's working a
one thing which I don't like is that
this dist folder is always there and if
we were to change something rename the
created JavaScript bundle the old bundle
would not get removed because it would
constantly only add new files to the
space folder so it would be nice if we
could entirely remove the base folder
before we start each build process so to
say so that we build a completely new
dist folder whenever we run npm run
build prot turns out we can do that
rather easily all I need to do is
install one additional new plugin
so with npm install' - - saved FL also
stores new package.json file and it's
called clean web pack plugin and there
are other options of cleaning the dist
folder you could use operating system
commands in the package adjacent file in
the script you could use our packages
I'm going to go with that plug-in though
so with that installed I can go to my
website config file I'll need to import
it here so the clean web pack plug-in
which I also require from the package we
just installed clean web pack plug-in
well and then all I have to do is go to
the bottom added here is the plugins
array new clean web tech plug-in
position doesn't matter and there I need
to pass an array of all the folders I
want to clean and that takes some
strings I only want to remove one folder
and that's the dist folder and as always
Google this plugin to find more about
the available options and how you may
configure it so with that in place if I
now run npm run build again build
products use me you see the dist folder
is not there right now
but if I reload this directory structure
you see it was recreated so now it will
remove it remove the dist folder before
creating a new one and that already is
the finished workflow dead already
is everything I wanted to show you how
to copy images how to copy the HTML file
and how to dynamically and check the
import into da HTML file as well as
clean up the dist folder when building
the project I hope this was useful and
hopefully see you in our videos you have
a great time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
