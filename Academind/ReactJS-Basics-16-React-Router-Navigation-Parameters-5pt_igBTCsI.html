working after all the route setup has
been done so in order to add links I
will go to my header che s and then here
I will want to add my links in my header
I will import the link component if you
want to call it like that from the react
router and that allows me to create well
links and I'll replace the anchor tag
with link and this will get rendered to
an anchor tag in the background when
well loading it in the browser then but
for me here I will need to use link here
and not a not the anchor tag again later
on in the browser this will be an anchor
tag so here I then need to add the two
attribute to specify to which path to
route here and here I just want to go to
/home let's say and then I'm copying
that pasting it to my user and here I
want to go to slash user for now if I
save this and go back to my application
and click on user and then home you see
that this navigation works fine that's
all and if we inspect this you can see
it is an anchor tag indeed now
oftentimes you want to add conditional
styles or classes to the active link to
provided some CSS styling right well
that's actually pretty easy you can add
an outer attribute to your link here
active style and here you could then say
color or that we would need to pass a
JavaScript object to it and then say
color should equal red now if I save
this now you see it's red when it's
active sometimes you also want to pass a
class name so you could then add active
class name and then just specify let's
say you come to class and you want to
let's say active so in this case this
will get the active class whatever it is
active as you can see here if I navigate
away it doesn't have the active class
anymore but if I click on it again we
see the classes being added so that
allows you to apply conditional styling
to your links here depending on whether
they are active or not either through
directly specifying the style like so or
a class name which has then some
underlying styles in this case here
there it simply doesn't so we don't see
any change but it would be as you saw
when I inspected it the case that this
class gets attached to the link
sometimes you also want to navigate from
code and not through a link so let's say
in our user component here I'll add a
button where I say go home and on this
button I simply want to navigate home
now I could make this a link style as
about that's clear but I want to show
how to navigate from code so I'm just
applying some styling to the button and
then I'll add a listener or an abandoned
ler which I look hold on navigate home
and I want to call this function
whenever I click this button so I will
call this I'll navigate home then we add
parentheses here remember that we're
just providing a link to this method now
how do i navigate home here i need to
import something from the reactor outer
package and this something is the
browser history again so browser history
from react router
whoops and then I can go to my own
navigate home method here and simply
call browser history push and then the
path which I want to navigate so in this
case I want to navigate to slash home
right if I save this go back to the
application click on user and then I go
home
you see we're taking home that's all
that is how simple it is and if you look
at this command you'll learn why it's
called browser history we push and you
you are out on the browser history and
it gets pushed on the top which is why
we navigate there instantly so the
browser history now also includes the
slash home route which genis the active
route so we covered a lot
the missing thing for this basic router
overview is how to pass parameters let's
say here on the user page I want to
display the ID of the user right now in
order to display the ID I need to first
go to the index touch as file and change
my user path here because I'm expecting
to get an ID as I get parameter with
this URL so the URL should then be
localhost / user / the ID to tell the
react router that we are getting such an
ID so that we're getting a flexible a
variable element in our URL a parameter
I add the slash here and then colon and
then whenever I want to name this
parameter internally so that will be the
name by which I can extract that later
on I'll choose ID for now so this allows
me to access the slash well ID route now
of course if I save this does will lead
to an apple
which is broken because now this link
isn't passing an idea even though we're
expecting one so just slash user doesn't
exist anymore
you would need to enter something like
slash user five and then you see it's
working again so in order to make it
work again from our from within our
application I go to the header file and
here I need to pass something right I
need to pass more than chest slash user
I need to pass slash user and then
whatever I do you want to pass and of
course since we're in the template
syntax here you can also output some
content dynamically here right so you
could also add something like two plus
two here like so add if I save this and
go back well you see now it's navigating
to slash user slash four right because
that's just a result but I'll hard-coded
here for now I'll go to the ID ten and
with that well it's working again that's
certainly nice but we're not displaying
the ID here right
we are not extracting it how can we
extract our ID extracting parameters is
fortunately really simple too I'll go to
the user component which is where I want
to use the ID and then here I'll use my
single curly braces to output some
dynamic content in my template here and
then here I can simply get my routing
parameters by accessing this props and
then parents so the route params the get
parameters will be passed by react
router to my props variable here or to
my props property so I can't access any
available parameters again passed from
my react router automatically without me
doing anything on my props property and
then on the parents object and here I
know I will get parameter named ID
because that a year is the name
my index chair spot here that thing
after the : so this man here ID has to
match the name by which I extract it
here with that that's all if I save this
now you see user ID 10 and if I enter
something like 1 1 1
whoops that was wrong button something
like 1 1 1 well now you see user ID 1 1
1 that is how you can extract the
parameters so I think you are seeing
that passing parameters and extracting
them is made really simple with the
router XD whole we access router is
really simple to use
because I think it's very explicit about
how to use it
look at how you set up these routes it's
really simple it's how you would
mentally set them up because all the
nesting and all the dependencies are
clearly visible and that is why the
reactions router is really great and
powerful and I can only like you to play
around with it create more complex
routes and learn more about it if you
need some more help or want to dive into
more advanced content concepts then the
place to go is the react.js router
github page and there you will find some
documentation click on tutorial here and
that on lessons to see all kinds of
different lessons where you couldn't
dive into the router much deeper than I
did here but you should have all the
basics you need by now and with that I
think it's time to get started with the
redux serious next hopefully see you
there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
