website keeps growing and growing and
step-by-step we also improved the looks
of it now in this video we will add one
really important property to our website
the position property let's do that in
this video
so back on our website and one important
information before we start because if
you never heard of the position property
make sure to check out my video right
here there should be the link because in
this video we really have a look or take
a look at the basics of the position
property why we need it what the
different values we have are and how
these values interact with each other
with these basic set we can now continue
right here on our website in a
beginner's guide and have a look at how
we can apply this position property in a
practical manner now let's do this and
to start we should go back to our code
right here I'm in the style.css file as
you can see right there and the first
thing we will change is the page title
right there because remember the title
if we inspected right here is this part
up here and I would like to have a
specific behavior for the title I would
like the title to remain up there if I
scroll down and at the moment well this
is not happening so let's change that
and we can change this by adding a well
specific position to this title it's
maybe a deposition up here in this
position this position value is called
fixed like that and let's add the
semicolon and let's also add top zero
right there also important also
something we talked about in the other
video I just mentioned the important
thing now is that with position fixed
and top zero edit the following behavior
can be observed if you will of the page
well we can see that Mike's world is now
added to the top basically and it
remains there if we scroll down and
that's really cool because with that
position fixed declaration being applied
we can now position Mike's world related
to the viewport and that's the reason
why it sticks up there and why our page
well looks a bit better now now the
problem now is of course that well this
kind of should be on the entire your
page width and not just right there so
let's go back and
let's add something else and this is wit
and let's add 100 percent right there to
make sure it covers the entire page now
before we continue one important note we
will talk about the height and width and
what you can do with that the pixels and
the percentages in one of the next
videos of this series so in this video I
will just apply some of these things to
make sure that the position property
works correctly in case you're not sure
about how this works in detail don't
worry we will talk about that later in
this series as I just said so for the
moment let's just apply the basics that
we need to make our page work and this
basic is for example this with 100%
declaration right here so if we save
that and go back now and reload our page
you can see that now we have our
beautiful Mike's world kind of header
actually right there on top of our page
with the width of 100% that's really
nice but if you follow this serious and
if you know the structure of our page
you might see something now because
there is something hidden behind Mike's
role now do you know what I mean because
if we look at the nav part right here
can you see it the nav element is now
behind Mike's world now Mike's rod
should be on top that's not the issue
but nav should actually be positioned
well kind of blow it now how can we
change that well the answer is there are
multiple ways how to solve this issue I
will just show you one way now which in
my opinion is a really easy to implement
and easy to understand solution so let's
go back and before we do that we should
maybe quickly rearrange our code right
here because I would like to do it like
this so let's maybe delete it right here
and position the class right there so
you are free to organize that the way
you want it but I like to have it in a
way that I have the CSS code that refers
to elements appear and appear and then
we can follow the CSS code that refers
to classes right there
right there and right there as I said
you can do this as you prefer actually
but I think with that approach we can
make sure that this is kind of kept as
well simple as possible and makes it
easy for us to keep the overview what
you can also do of course is we could
for example add something like header
right here you can see this is how you
can comment out code in CSS so simply
add a slash and dastar symbol at the
beginning of the code that should be
commented out and then add this star and
the slash at the end of the code that
should be commented out so this could be
the header for example and the trip text
well I have to look that up to be honest
I think the trip text was in the main
part so we could also add that as said
you don't have to do that I just do it
for now in this video to make sure that
we keep the overview of the different
areas we have right here in our CSS code
so this is the header and now coming
back to what we wanted to add because we
wanted to work on the nav part actually
because the problem is as I said that
this element should now be below Mike's
world now how can we do that well the
answer is we don't have to add anything
right here we'll work on that in a few
seconds but we'll just go back to
index.html right there and now add a
class to our header and we don't have to
do that but in CSS it makes things a lot
easier if you work with classes so let's
add a class to header and maybe call it
fixed bar again the cap up case we
talked about that in another video and
let's save that and go back to our
stylesheet and now I will add this class
right here so it's called
fixed bar like that and now we will add
something and what will we add well we
will add height right here let's maybe
add 70 pixels for example now I might
ask yourself what are we doing here well
if I add the height now all the right
and maybe at a height of let's say 40
pixels because we have a padding of 10
so 40 plus 10 top plus 10 bottom is 16
and now we have the height of 70 can you
imagine where this is going to let's see
let's save it and let's go back and
let's now reload the page and see what
happens because if we do that well then
you can see that now our nav element is
visible again and what's the reason for
that
well let's inspect that to understand
what we just did here this is our page
title so the class that we have and
basically this part right here and
important right here we defined that
this part is fixed this means we
excluded this class basically from our
document flow this is the reason why
Neff was hidden behind Mike's world
because 14 F element Mike's rod wasn't
there anymore but now we added this
fixed bar class and this fixed bar class
if you look right here kind of wraps
this page title class so this part
basically right here is out of the
actual document workflow but the
wrapping class the center class well
it's not it's still part of the normal
document workflow now as we know that
and as we know that our class that is
not part of the document workflow has a
height of 40 plus 10 plus 10 so 60 well
adding 70 to this class that is part of
the workflow leads to exactly this
result because as you can see right here
the fixed bar right there now defines
that we are able to specify the distance
between this first element right there
because that's what we got so we have
this element in our workflow and the
following element the nav element you
can see it right here the distance or
actually you can't see it let's maybe do
it like this I think this makes it
easier so here we have the header class
right
and if I open this Neff element you can
see that the unordered list kind of
comes after that
so the Neff element is just the element
we have for our general website
structure therefore the UL the unordered
list is bigger than the Neff element not
a big issue right here the important
thing is that with this approach we one
are able to easily add this bar on top
right here and additionally made sure
that the following element so home and
contact is also displayed correctly now
there is one thing that I don't like
what he is still and this is this gap
right here to the left we can easily
solve that if we go back to our CSS code
and add body up here like that and
simply define that body should have a
margin of zero if we save that and if
you go back you can see that now our
header bar right here even looks better
and now our page occupies the entire
space some small cosmetical correction
but I think it's better the way it is
right now now with that we made sure
that our header here looks good actually
but there is still one thing that I
would like to add if we go back right
here then I would like to add another
thing to our page title right there and
this is called text - aligned and this
should be Center if I save that go back
go to page then you can see that the
text is now positioned well in the
center of our page again we will talk
about the details behind the text
formatting and detect styling later
throughout this series I just wanted to
take the chance to show you that you can
also easily fix that by just adding that
simple property so we now kind of finish
the positioning of Mike's world and to
be honest if I look right here the
general positioning is quite okay
actually now what I mean by general
positioning the general content parts
that we have so for example right here
our header element appear right this one
then we have our navigation then we have
the main part and
then we have the footer this is quite
okay actually at the moment there is
maybe one more thing that we can do and
this is maybe give this a little bit of
a different color because this is
actually not part of the footer it's
still part of our main element so let's
quickly change that maybe by simply
going well well maybe to the index.html
file and now right here we have this
paragraph and let's maybe also add a
class right here like that and let's
maybe call it feedback like that and if
we now go back to our style file and now
also add the footer you can see this is
also kind of a preparation for the next
video already we will just add footer
right here and now refer to our feedback
class we just created and now define a
background color color like that off
again
let's maybe use five to 175 one this
purple let's say that the color should
be white and text the line we learned
there in the header should be sender
like that and if we go back and save
that yeah then this looks better now for
the moment but coming back to what I was
talking about a few seconds ago is that
the general structure of the page is
okay the problem we now have is not our
general positioning it's the way our
elements are displayed inside this kind
of elements that give the page structure
so what do I mean well we have a problem
with the way this list is displayed
inside the nav element right here we
also have a problem with the way the
text right here and the images are
displayed in our main element and we
also have a problem if we scroll down
right here with the way our elements are
displayed in the footer because we would
like to have this text right here next
to Mac's picture for example but these
are not issues necessarily related to
the position
our team for this purpose we need
another property and this property is
called display so in the next video of
this series and this will be one video
again we will have a look at the theory
behind the display property and of
course also applied to our webpage and
with that we will do another step
regarding the styling of our page and
make it step by step a little bit more
beautiful now as always the only thing I
can say right now is thanks again for
watching this video I hope you liked it
and I hope to see you in the next video
of the series bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
