short video I'm just going to do some
cleanup in this video as you can already
see I updated the styling a little bit
to have it look a little bit nicer
because in the end it should be a nice
looking app were creating here and not
just some rough examples tied together
now what did I do when it comes to
styling I created a second CSS file or a
CSS file as it will get compiled by a
gal pyram in my setup and here I
basically put all these sides that are
relevant for this contact list and
therefore in my contact list component
here I'm importing these Styles here in
my style URLs array only the contact
list Styles before I made this change I
had app CSS here now the app file
contains styling that applies to the
whole website the whole application I
guess it makes sense when you consider
the name of this file and it is
therefore imported right here in the
index.html so what did I do well I just
added some margins centered my app and
when you hover over the names you know
we see that they are clickable because
you have the cursor here and with that
nice visual effect and well besides that
everything's the same now what I also
want to add here is we got our two-way
binding going on here but only with the
first name at the moment I want to
expand this form here so that we can
edit every attribute of our contacts
here so let's do this now I'll therefore
head over to my contact component here
and as of now I only got my ng model set
up for my first name so what I will do
here is I will actually create a nice
little uniform so to say by just adding
my first name here my last name and then
I'll basically just copy
this year let's see how this looks yeah
that that's what I want so gets rid
let's get rid of this and add it here
for the last name then here I wanted to
add it for my phone number and here for
the email address let's reload this yeah
now I don't want it line up this way
obviously so what I will do to to fix
this is I I will add some styling to
this form here too
so the bottom part here notice that at
the moment we're not importing any style
sheet and I won't import one I was just
add the Styles meta tag Co no style URLs
but just Styles and this also takes an
array with a string in it but this
string will just provide the Styles in
this document so to say and the styling
that I want to apply is that each label
here has its input box next to it and
then we have a line break now to create
this I would just create another div in
here and I will really just wrap my my
input fields here and my my label so to
say inside this div now I'm already
repeat this now it would obviously be
nice to have these boxes lined up here
so let me add this and to do this I will
use the label tag to wrap my Mia my
labels
now let's give these labels and styling
now let's give to use label some styling
by making them an inline block element
and giving them just a width of let's
say 100 pixels let's see how that looks
has to be a little bit more so that the
phone number doesn't break here see yeah
that's good now I will also increase the
width of my input elements here give
them a width or let's say 250 pixels
let's see how that looks
yeah so I'm good with that and as you
can see all our data now gets loaded in
this form and if we add a bit and let's
say we add this in a way that we can
remember it now we click on another name
and we go back and we still get a safe
here so now we got really our two-way
binding going on for all of our contact
fields we have your not only the first
names but all the names and I think that
was some necessary tidy up to get our
app in the right direction and in the
next videos we will then focus on more
new features see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
