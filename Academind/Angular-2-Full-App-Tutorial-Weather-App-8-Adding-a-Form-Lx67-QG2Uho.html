service now I want to take us a step
closer to actually searching for better
data on the internet for this I'll need
a new component I want to have a
separate component with this search bar
here at the top where we can enter city
names and so on that's created component
this video oh well obviously start by
treating and you'll find the weather
folder now what call it a weber surge
but component dot yes because the
component itself will be named and of
course be exported clock web component
excuse me weber surge component this
will be the name of our component and of
course we need to add our component
decorator tudas well component just
decorated would have a selector which
should be beverage search or my weber
search to make it definitely unique and
then we would have template this well
double back take some text of multiple
lines and then this template I'll have a
section which should have a class of
Weber's search and I already got a
styling for this setup this would just
make it look nice okay and in here I
will then have a form because I will
want to enter down some data really only
when I put fuel in this case but this
will be inside a form now for ins are a
topic for itself name let you and again
I do have videos on his channel
discussing forms and the two different
ways you've got of setting up and using
forms here is two quick wrap-up first I
don't deleted the action here and I
would leave it like this for a moment
so this
my form here and what I will do now is
I'll just a lady at a label year for the
city and input field which will also
have an idea of city and which the
required and I will have a button of
type submit' which was called add city
below that form I'll have a div and this
is really annoying here and here we have
just a span with a class of info which
say city found and then here will be the
city name now of course some hard text
for the moment post-production of
searching the day web database writer
database new online database were on the
website right now but we will add this
so this is the form or it is is how the
template should look like now forms and
like you can query can be handled by
Engla to this is a normal form tag here
but unless you will recognize it and
automatically kind of store it as a form
yet in the application surface area and
this will allow us to validate the form
and to check the values to receive
certain events like when you form is
submitted
and so on and I got you as a set test is
automatically by just recognizing this
foreign tag if you don't want any that
you to do this automatically because you
might want to configure validation more
detailed or whatever we want to have
more control we can also create this
form programmatically using form builder
notice that does do really quick
explanation this video if you want to
dive in deeper and you probably should
if you want to get while going with
Engla tubes you should check out the two
videos I have in forms and of course for
which you will find a link in the
description but short version here we're
using the way of in or two
all are detecting it as a form and
giving us all the well things you can do
with or without having to write much
code what I will do though is I will set
up a specific event your ng submitted
this is a book in English - event only
available for forums and here I just
specify which well method should be
called when the submit button here is
called
as you can see I don't have a click
event on this button instead I only have
this ng submitting better and as I just
said dis ships with angling tools built
in form mechanics or function laws as it
offers us so this allows us to submit a
form now here's a cool trick which might
look strange at the beginning I can
assign a local variable to this for the
already so local variable it's an
earlier video sim basically this just
means that now in this whole template
but only there I can access this F
variable and this will refer to this
forum element not only to ever value or
and a deeper to the whole element into
all the properties this element has now
I can also set this equal to ng for and
now this will not mean that F is a
variable which is a spring same energy
form but instead this says yep I want to
assign a value to this local variable F
but please assign the overall form as
its distort for LSU and this form
differs from this form tag because the
Engla to form has feels about the
validity of the form of the values if it
was touched by the user or not all this
is storing that U is for in which again
is auto-generated when it comes over a
foreign tag and by using this F or in
whatever name you want here equals
energy form
we're binding this local
not to disappoint add order to spawn
HTML element back to this Engler to form
and therefore we can then submit this
local variable because again you can use
it all over in the template and does of
course includes submitting it which then
will allow us to also use it in the body
here to extract some values from this
forum next thing I will do here is a
lone creator spawns have met method
antis receives our form which is of type
control group this is important English
who forms RF type control not formal
energy phone control because they are a
group controls and controls again are
the inputs of our for now how does
English we know that this should be a
control the answer is it really doesn't
we assign a directive to it the ng
control directive and we may also
specify a name here like let's say
location
this will set up this input here as a
control in this overall form and now
this former passage beyond submit method
here will hold this control and the
validity of this control the value and
so on for example as I said this input
here as required it will be invalid in
the background in our angular 2
application if it is empty for example
and it won't see business end so no this
is how we add a control to our form this
is our on submit
method here all I want to do here is I
want to log out our form let me save it
and now of course I also wanted to use
it in my app component right above my
weather list I will add my web search
and I see it was a bit in consequent
here this should maybe also called
called my mother list but as I already
said
does not really matter but just appear
to have a unique way here I will get rid
of the mine here as well so now in here
I also need to add this to my directives
error here so the weather search
component and now if you have a look at
our application we can see that we got a
search bar here now if I open up my dev
tools yeah
she received shadows to consult and if I
tip type Miami click add city you can
see that well we got an energy for mob
chick here and this is a control group
as I said and this well holds our for
all the information about our controls
we got here the status is valid the
value is location sticky cause its name
of the simple field and it's Miami and
so on we can well accidents axis is here
too and you may just play around and
dive into all the values you got here
and all their properties and English who
forms stories and as a set is it's not
the form HTML element this is to angular
2 form object so this is what we get
here and now let's reload this app so
that this is empty again and let's
inspect this control and as you can see
you got this class the CSS class
attached for these classes ng untouched
pristine and invalid now obviously we
did not add this here we don't have any
classes attached using fluid doesn't
automatically done by English you
because this input is registered as a
control in this form and we set it to be
well required that it may not be empty
and therefore it says
this is invalid if I remove require here
watch what happens
it is now valid now let me change this
again so acted here and invalid again
now if I start typing C is untouched
pristine and invalid at the moment now
if I take type a single M you saw it get
updated it is dirty because well I
changed something and it is valid
because it's not empty but it's still
untouched it gets touched as soon as I
click add city and well focus moves out
of this input now it's touched dirty
because it's no longer empty and it's
valid and this is how you can use these
classes of course to automatically apply
as I'm styling based on the validity of
this field this field now of course the
mela which is not only controlled
represented with the CSS classes you
also have access to the ability validity
in the control group in the actual
English you form object which is stored
in a background and that's a sad you can
dive in into this topic a lot deeper and
the two videos that got dedicated to
forms on this channel but with this we
got our earthworm our research monitor
setup and we're almost there to fetch
data from a server see the next videos
