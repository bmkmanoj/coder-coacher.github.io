actually get our hands dirty now in
previous videos I explained something
about the angular 2 architecture and how
to set up your development environment
especially the latter one is very
important for you to be able to follow
along so you should definitely check
that out
you will find a link in the description
and in this way you're right now where
you can click so I just want you guide
you through my folder structure I got
here which is the standard folder
structure this is all the standard from
the github repository we downloaded in
the previous video and I got four
important folders here I got my app
folder where the compiled JavaScript
will go you don't have to do anything
there or God will take care of all that
if you have it running by gulp command
and terminal I get my assets folder here
where my raw uncompelled
s CSS code lives I get my dev folder
here which holds my typescript files
where we will actually do our editing
and I got my source folder here where
the CSS will be compiled to so app and
source will be the compiled stuff and
assets and that will be our development
environment now I'm inside my app
component here and this is a standard
angular q component I got here they all
start by importing component from the
angular tool core package and this is
necessary to be able to use the
component functionality and to actually
have angular to be able to recognize it
as a component then I get my default
typescript class here which will be as I
said compile to standard JavaScript and
I'm exporting it to say hey this class
or this component will be available in
other files or modules as well now what
really makes this a component is this
decorator here I'm adding this component
decorator which is a default angular 2
decorator to attach some configuration
to this class an angular 2 desta's a lot
it uses these typescript decorators
which always start with an at and then
have to decorate a name off
- yeah really add configuration to your
class and make it something else in just
a plain JavaScript class so in this case
I'm adding a configuration of an
selector which basically will be in HTML
tag injecting or using this component
and the template which is what will be
displayed and the browser this is C
hello world text you are seeing over
here now that now to actually run this
component I have to load it in two
places one is the boot es file which
imports the very important bootstrap
method from there from the angular 2
package and all this method does is tell
angular 2 angular 2 whenever you start
this application so whenever this site
gets loaded you should create this app
component which will be the root
component only the root component has to
be created through this bootstrap class
here but this is very important to do
now the second place where you will have
to add something to actually be able to
see this component here is the index dot
HTML file where I got this these app
tags here now as you might be aware app
is not a default HTML tag it is indeed
the tag I I identified I in create
created by adding this app selector here
so obviously you should choose names
here which won't get into the way of
default HTML tags now between these text
we see this loading text here which
really will only be displayed if there a
is an error or B the app is actually
loading so if you reload this page will
see it blinking up for a second okay so
now let's get into this app component
here oh and by the way all this stuff
here is just angular to stuff necessary
to be able to run this application or
any application any angular 2
application so inside this app component
just displaying some text is pretty
boring
let's change something here now
router's course we'll be building our
quite complex contact app and we'll
start by just displaying one single
contact specifically I want to display
the name here and when we click on it we
will see some more information about
this contact and this will already use
quite some different functionalities or
functionalities of angular 2 and
especially we will see some data binding
in action here so let's start by
replacing this text here with two back
ticks and what those back takes us they
allow us to write anything which will be
interpreted as as a string on multiple
lines so we can structure it as we would
in a normal HTML document and be aware
we could also use an external HTML
document as a template and I will show
it to you in later videos as we will be
able with CSS files but for now I will
use these in file templates here so um
let's just add a heading here h3 maybe
and add a name but obviously just adding
some text here again won't do anything
we first need to store some contact
information a variable level trade here
in a property of this class so this will
be a public property I will just call it
contact and this property will be a Java
Script class and it will have a first
name of Max which is my name but you can
pick anything you want obviously last
name will be also my surname but if you
don't like the character you can also
pick any name you want we'll have a
phone number this won't be mine so don't
even try it and let's say an email
address you could try this one
okay so this is just this class or just
as object is contact object here now I
can display information from this
contact by chest out putting it in the
angular queue template here by using
angular 2 template syntax and as our
double curly braces here contact first
name now we save this we see that it
automatically reloads and I see my first
name here max and I can just add my
second name to my last name by doing it
the same way really and now I got my
name here now the angular 2 template
syntax offers more than just outputting
information in this way and we will see
all of these syntax elements throughout
the videos and we'll see quite a lot of
them in this with you already because as
I said I want to be able to click on it
and then display more information below
this heading here so let's just add a
div to to hold that and inside this div
I will have my let's say let's create a
phone number where my phone number will
go and then my email where this will go
okay so you save it but actually we're
not seeing anything as of now and I only
want to display this when we I only want
to display this information you when we
click on it so now we need to add some
way to add a click it went to this title
here and we do this by using a special
angular 2 syntax where we use
parentheses click closing parentheses
equals and now between the quotation
nice we will define the method which
should be it should be executed once we
click on this title so I will name this
unselect and pass no argument now this
click property here is a default event
already recognized by angular 2 so all
the default events toggle by user
interaction interaction are already
implemented in angular 2 obviously now
you might recognize these parentheses
here now angular 2 has a clear
differentiation what considers its flow
direction data flows so as I told you in
the architecture video we generally got
this unidirectional data flow and you
couldn't remember the direction by the
braces or the parentheses you're using
around your property here so if you use
normal parentheses we're talking about
and they went and the data will flow
from the few to the component now if
these were squared brackets here I can
type square brackets we would have
follow the opposite direction and I will
show that to you in just a second so we
get this unselect here and we have to
obviously specify this method in our
component here so on select with no
arguments and unselect and what should
happen when we click this on select I
then want to display this block here so
first of all let me add that information
here
so now you can see oops email that it is
visible and now I yeah I only want to
show this if some condition is true so
let me first create a boolean property
here which basically says show detail
equals false by default and when we
click here I want to set it
oops this show little I want to set it
to true now at the moment nothing
changes because I got no condition here
this will be the next angular 2 syntax
we're learning today will be star and G
if equals now if you see something
starting with a star it will be some
structural directive which means some
commands so to say which will alter the
structure of your document in this case
it is pretty easy to recognize because
what does this ng F do well will define
something which will then define or
determine if this plot will be shown or
not and this clearly changes the
structure of our element or of our
document so here in between the
quotation marks we will then enter the
condition which should be checked and we
want to check if show detailed equals
truth only then should this be shown so
now if we click on this we see the
detail here now I want to show you
another very important template syntax
we got here and let's say we want this
if we click on it um
then we want this to let's say get read
just to more highlight that we click on
it now therefore I will define just a
little class here which I call clicked
and which basically changes the color to
red and back in my app component here I
will then add square brackets equal
something and between the square
practice I will write class dot collect
now this class property here is also a
default property which comes with angle
2 which allows us to easily attach or
detach classes CSS classes to an HTML
element and we then specify dot clicked
to attach to collect class now what we
do is we also have to provide a
condition here when to attach this class
and we will use the same as below su
detail equals true now if we click on
this nothing happens because actually
we're not importing the style as of now
so therefore I will just tell this
component to load my app dot CSS file
here and I will do this by writing style
URLs which is just another configuration
here then square brackets because it
could be multiple files and then we have
a string which will point to our source
file here so our CSS file app dot CSS so
this should do the trick
and if we now click on it it gets read
cool huh angular 1 was really popular
due to its two-way data-binding
now while angry at you generally has
this unidirectional approach two-way
data-binding is still there and i will
show it to you so until now we saw only
one-way data-binding from the few 2d
component and
from the component to the few square
brackets is from the component to the
view and parenthesis is from the view to
the component this is a structural
directive and now we will implement
two-way data-binding we will do this by
adding an input field here type text
that's fine save it so we can see it
here the rest of the work as you can see
now this input type should be tied to
our contact here now to add two-way
data-binding here we will combine the
two templates and taxes we learned so
far for the each direction of the data
flow so first you will have the square
brackets and then our parenthesis inside
the square brackets equals something and
then here we have to write ng model now
mg model is just the both in angular 2
methods so to say to create two-way
data-binding
that is all we have to know about it
right now
so we then link it to the property which
should be bound to this text input here
and let's say we want to be able to edit
the first name of our contact here then
we will just write contact dot first
name here saved us and now we see we got
max here now if we added this to Chris
you see it live updates on each
character which chains change so I will
gifted my full name and now if I click
on this we still get the rest of this
working so now we got really some core
concepts of angular 2 we got different
template syntax elements we got the very
important two-way binding we saw how to
create a component and in the next video
we will actually create several
components or two components to start
with and have them work together and
have data flow from one component to
another component to display something
there so I
hope you stick with me please leave some
comments if you liked or disliked this
video and I will be happy to see you in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
