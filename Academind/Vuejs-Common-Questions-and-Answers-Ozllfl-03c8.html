have a look at some common beauteous
questions I see a lot this is by no
means complete just some questions that
came into my head please share any other
questions you have in the video comments
I probably won't answer them there but I
might create a second at firt and other
parts of this series in the future so
let's dive right into it
let's start with the first question I
see a lot do I need do you need a
complex build setup or workflow do you
need a setup with web pack and Babel and
all these things the answer is it
depends on what you're building
you can absolutely drop in or drop you
into you HTML pages where you want to
use it just import the UJS and you can
start using it you can use the view seal
I'd create a project with it this gives
you a feature which workflow with zero
setup that you can still customize 100%
since you get access to the underlying
web pack configuration so this is in my
opinion the best approach especially if
you're building single page applications
there you have one workflow that simply
works and that's continuously updated by
the people developing it you can also
build your own workflow with web peg and
Babel and so on this of course is a good
solution if you need a highly customized
setup right from the start but in most
cases to view seal is best one exception
our multi-page applications which you
also can build with UJS you're not
limited to single page applications
there you often work with the drop in
import because it's convenient you just
add it to the web pages where you want
to use some view feature and then you
just create some view instances and
start controlling parts of the screen so
that's the general theme drop-in it's
great for multi page applications on
smaller projects medium-sized and bigger
projects use the CLI if you got highly
specific requirements use the custom
setup from the start but again you can
customize a seal I project you so this
might always be the best approach when
our question see a lot is should I use
es6 or other next-gen features or es5
because you can write view apps with
both syntaxes you can use function or
arrow functions you can use whichever
features you want in a workflow that
supports it like for example workflows
created with the view CLI and there is
no right or wrong here really use the
syntax you
often next-generation JavaScript makes
many things easier makes it easier to
solve certain problems so that would be
my recommendation go with
next-generation so es6 Plus JavaScript
but in the end you are free to use
whichever you feel more comfortable with
important when using view chess as a
drop in import so outside of a bigger
build with flow you're limited by the
capabilities of the browsers you're
building for most browsers don't support
all next-gen features yet so your may be
forced to use es5 then here's another
interesting question view instances vs.
view components we have both in view
apps we get our instances and components
what's the difference now an instance
allows us to control some Dom in an HTML
file with that l property now
theoretically that's not the only thing
I instance can do you can use an
instance without connecting it to the
Dom but typically you will use that L
property to say hey in this Dom I want
to control this part with my instance
and now I can use features like that
templating syntax with the double curly
braces to output my text property which
are all to manage the instance and if
you're starting off with a view
you're always or off just working with
one instance where you have methods and
some data and computed properties maybe
and check out my view serious or course
if you want to learn more about this
where you have all these things where
you control parts of the Dom with that
instance this is especially useful for
multi-page applications where you maybe
want to control some parts off the Dom
which was rendered by the server with a
couple of different view instances now
components work well together with
instances we also have our DOM and HTML
file but now we maybe have a hook so
some Dom code some HTML code which
should act as a hook for a view instance
which then in turn uses a couple of
components
its own template so we could replace
that div with a template to find in the
instance and start using these
components in that template maybe it
becomes a bit clearer with this graphic
we got our Dom here on the right with a
couple of divs this is the HTML code we
wrote and we control parts of that Dom
but not everything with a couple of
different view instances and in the
template of each instance so for example
between the div tags where we have ID
products we could start using our
components these components are created
with the view component method and they
have a template and work a lot like
instances but are reusable instances are
not reusable instances are always
connected to just one place in the DOM
and if you have something like a card
you know these cards material design
cards you know from apps they look
beautiful if you have something like
that which you want to reuse probably
let's say in a V for loop that doesn't
work with instances it does work with
components though so components allow
you to create reusable building blocks
for your new apps what about our
third-party JavaScript libraries you
want to use in your view app you can do
that you have a couple of options you
can add script imports either to a CDN
or to a local file in the index.html
file and the Sol's refers to multi-page
applications where you add to that file
where you need to you well package or
you use a local import so you have
downloaded a file and now you import it
directly into your javascript file with
the import statement in that file if
you're building view apps you use import
statements in your JavaScript files all
the time and this now applies mostly to
single page apps because for drop in
imports and multi-page apps
import statements aren't understood by
most browsers but if you have a build
workflow that bundles everything
together in the end this will work and
this is how you then import our
JavaScript packages which will just be
included in that big bundle at the end
bye
adding such a import of course you can
also use NPM or yarn so dependency
managers to install and download these
packages and then still import them wire
import statement and for CSS it's pretty
similar there we can also use links in
index.html or in HTML files in general
pointing to you CSS libraries lying on
some CDN or locally on our web server or
we use a local file that we import with
the import statement into our JavaScript
file now that sounds strange importing
CSS into a JavaScript file well this has
one important prerequisite you need to
be using a workflow that supports it for
example one created with the view CLI
there if you use the web pack setup it
supports the import of CSS files
it doesn't actually import them and mix
them with JavaScript instead it makes
web pack aware of the existence of that
file and if your workflow then has the
appropriate modules to handle that file
type which the default CLI created web
pack setup has then this will also
include these CSS file in your final app
automatically make sure it's injected
into your index.html file and everything
off like that so this is all managed for
you by just adding a import qsr CSS file
into your javascript file and only in
one file is enough this will already
include it and of course here you can
also use package managers to download
that CSS library like bootstrap for
example and then add that import
everyone can see your code now this is
something I also hear a lot and it's
true if you open the browser developer
tools and you have a look at the source
tab there you can access the JavaScript
files that are powering the page you're
currently on and there's nothing you can
do JavaScript runs on the browser you
can't hide it it's not pre compiled so
it's not kind of unreadable everyone can
read it you can't avoid that
you have to ensure that you don't put
security relevant or sensible
information into that file and that's
about the only thing you can do
unfortunately you just have to be aware
of this there's no way to hide it it's
visible to everyone can I use Redux with
you chase a question I get a lot yes you
can read X is not a library which is
closely tied to react though it's often
used in conjunction with it and you can
implement redux into view though my
recommendation would be to use the view
specific implementation view X it's by
the same developers as view and
therefore nicely integrates into view
applications and works nicely together
with you so have a look at view X I also
got a serious on that and I do cover it
in my view course on udemy two links to
both can be found in the video
description of course and with that you
get a powerful tool for managing state
on a in a central place in your view
application can you use view with PHP or
laravel framework a PHP framework or
node or any other server-side language
or framework the answer is yes view runs
in the client in the browser it doesn't
care about your server-side framework or
language still we can differentiate
between single page applications and
multi page applications and let me
explain what the difference then is in
both cases you can use any server-side
back-end however so for single page
applications view controls the entire
front end and we only get one file the
index.html file from the server for
multi page applications we only control
parts of the views which are rendered by
the backend now for single page
applications our server sends that
single-a index.html file where the view
app then runs and controls the entire
front end and all further communication
where we might need to store data on the
server or fetch data from there happens
with a restful api which and that's
important could also run on a different
server view really doesn't care now for
a multi page application of pro
we also got a server and there we render
our views so we sent multiple pages for
different requests and if we click on a
link there for example we send a new
request to the server and get back a new
view and then they would the library the
framework runs in sum or in all of these
views that's totally up to you so you
then use view and there you don't have a
restful service because view is now
communicating with your view and if you
need to directly communicate to your
server you would do this with a HX
request providing one restful endpoint I
guess but in general the the approach is
a different one because the server plays
a more important role when it comes to
rendering the views the front-end it
doesn't do that at all in a single page
application approach my state is lost
after page reloads that's also something
I hear a lot and it's true if you're
coming from a traditional web
application web page environment you
used sessions to manage the user state
if the user is locked in or something
like that now for single page
applications and that's important it
only applies for that of course if your
server is closely connected to the front
because it's rendering to use so if you
have a multi page application then you
might still use sessions but for single
page applications the front-end the
single page is kind of detached from the
backend so we don't use sessions there
we can't really do that the backend is
stateless instead we get to our options
for storing data in state one is local
storage and one is of course a
server-side database
local storage is a client-side storage
mechanism like cookies a bit it runs on
the browser and it can be accessed
through JavaScript you can't directly
access it from the server or anything
like that it's a simple key value store
so complex data can't be stored there
but it's great for example for storing a
JSON web token which is often used for
authentication in single page
applications and when your view app
starts you can have a look at local
storage and see if
and which data already is in there and
possibly initialize your view app with
that data
hence keeping the old state now not all
the state should be stored here I said
that we don't use sessions but of course
on your restful api you probably have a
database this database is fully under
your control since it runs on the server
it's accessible only from the server
which can be a security advantage and
you can use any database you want you
can store any types of data you want
you're not limited to a key value store
here server-side database is the right
choice for any data that needs to be
long time persisting so let's say you
plan on storing the orders of a user you
could do that in local storage but
whenever the user uninstalls the browser
or cleans up their the cache and the
storage this will be lost for some state
this is OK for our state it is not and
that should then be stored in your
server-side database can you host your
app on hiroko etc so on hosts that run
server-side languages for example Doge
is and so on well let's have a look at
what we get when we build our view
application and with that I'm again
talking about a single page application
multi page applications you host these
on a server which supports the
server-side language you're using
because it's your server site that's
rendering the views single page
applications are detached from the
backend though so you can host them
separately if you build your view
application for production for example
in a view CLI project setup using
webpack then you get a couple of files
index.html filed a couple of JavaScript
files and maybe a couple of style files
all these files are static files
there's no server-side code in there the
JavaScript file doesn't use nodejs it
will run in the browser eventually so
therefore we don't need a host that is
capable of executing server-side code
static host like AWS as free or firebase
hosting deaths so search for static web
host when you're looking for a host for
your view single page application here's
another common problem I see a lot my
routes don't work after deployment so
here are you the user the user using the
web page and the server you enter a URL
and what you get back is a page where
your viewer application runs and I'm
talking about a single page application
again here for multi page applications
you're not going to run in this problem
because all the routing is done on the
server there for your single page
application however the routes are
stored on the front-end in your view app
so if you click somewhere in your view
app and you access let's say slash
products then this works because the
view app knows the routes because you
defined them there and by clicking on a
link where you always then add some
special routing directive or something
like that view captures that click and
doesn't really send a request to the
server but instead handles it internally
checks if it knows the route and
re-renders the page accordingly the
server doesn't store any routes doesn't
have any routes now if you click the
refresh button of your browser you'll
face an issue all of a sudden view has
no chance of handling that route because
if you refresh the page and you request
to send to the server and that request
targets slash products now here we then
get a 404 error because the server
doesn't know that route the problem is
we would know it in the view app and to
give you the chance of taking over and
looking for the route we need to set up
a rule a configuration on the server to
always return the index.html file which
hosts our view app even for 4 or 4 cases
this means that instead of a 404 error
we now again get the index.html file
with the view app where we can look for
that specific route and if it finds it
it can render the according page and if
you still want to provide a 404 page for
routes that aren't defined there either
you would need to add a catch-all route
in your view router setup so a route
that catches all unknown requests and
then renders some default page from
within your view application so that was
it I hope this was helpful if you watch
the other Q&amp;amp;A videos you might have seen
some well connections as I mentioned at
the beginning of the video share any
other questions you have in the video
comments
I won't reply there I can't offer any
help there but I will note them and I
will see if I can create some future
videos covering these questions I hope
you enjoyed the video and I hope to see
you back here on a Quetta mind in the
future bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
