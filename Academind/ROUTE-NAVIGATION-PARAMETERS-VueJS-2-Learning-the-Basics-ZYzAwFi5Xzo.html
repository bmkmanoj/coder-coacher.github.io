here
you probably watched my last video about
routing and I strongly recommend doing
so because this video builds up upon it
in this video we're going to have a look
at how we can use our router our routes
we already set up and navigate to them
using links and how we can also pass
data how we can pass parameters to our
routes so let's get started this is the
application as we have it right now we
get these slash users route and the well
main route just slash at the end where
we have the home component getting
loaded now it's nice that we can
navigate around by entering the right
path here in the URL but I think the
user experience would be a little bit
better if we would not only do it like
that but also have some links we can
click some some header you could say
well let's implement such a thing the
place to implement it is of course the
app view file which acts like a skeleton
which has our router do and which is
responsible for loading our routes or
rendering them here in this router view
place so here I want to add a navigation
and you could of course style this in a
much nicer way just clearly is pretty
ugly but it shows how it works and
that's the key thing here so I added a
horizontal line below the heading and
then let's say when I have a link and
this link shall lead to the home page
now clearly we could do it like that
just link to slash with text home and we
got a home link here if I click this it
reloads if I enter users click this we
go back to the home page but you
probably recognize that it always
reloads the page because we're always
sending a new request to the server and
the server gives us back the index.html
page that clearly is not what we want to
have because it destroys our whole
application state every time we navigate
around so that is not really a great
user experience instead it would be
great if we would never leave this
running application and just rerender
the part of the Dom which should be
rendered
that is what we're building a
single-page application for in the end
right well we can do this we get router
view to render or to mark the place
where the components shall get rendered
we got another important component we
can use router link now ultra link
allows us to create a link which will
basically be handled in the way where
there is no request sent to the server
instead the click is handled by the view
router anti component which shall be
loaded is loaded so here let's name at
home and in order to make this work we
need to set this to and an equal slash
for example side note you can also bind
to with we bind : or shortcut just :
and then also bind to some variable
holding the path here now since I do
enter the full path here anyways I don't
need that so I will just route you slash
but you can make this more dynamic by
binding to a property so that's the home
link let me also add a user's link where
I navigate to slash users and with that
if I save this now you can see it also
lets the appropriate component but you
can clearly see by watching this reload
I can hear it never reloads the page it
never sends a fresh request because it
shouldn't and it doesn't so this is a
much better way of navigating around
that is one important thing but now
let's also pass some data that would be
great wouldn't it and also how can we
navigate without using links because we
might have some places in code where we
want to trigger a navigation action when
some code is finished or when we
executed some code and not when you user
click somewhere well let's have a look
at both starting with D parameters we
can send parameters by simply adding
them to our URL so let's say here in
users we expect to get some parameter
some user ID even though it's called
users but still so here we expect some
ID or let's call it team ID so we want
to see all users of
one team and team ID like this of course
won't work let's give it a real ID like
let's say ten so we want to load the
team with the ID ten here just an
arbitrary example now in the users
template here we want to output this so
let's add a rapping div because we may
only have one root element here in the
template and there we shall have a
paragraph where we say team ID is and
then we want to output team ID something
like that
it won't work right now in the main dot
JS file we configure the routes we now
have to tell the viewer out rip that a
part of the URL of the path will be
dynamic will be a variable we do this by
adding slash : this colon is important
it indicates that the following word or
part is dynamic and then any name you
like for example team ID like this this
name years up to you you will be able to
extract the data by calling this
property later on so this tells DB
router that there is a dynamic path in
the app of you file we're passing 10 in
this position so we want to extract that
ten later on the missing piece is now in
the users hood view file here we want to
extract this now we can do this by
adding a script and your export our
default object this view J's object and
now how do we get that routing data here
well inside of our view instance we get
access to this route parents now the
clearly won't work here because well
that's it's just in the object right and
yet call this in some method but since
we have this dollar sign route property
here available and this is available
because we add a DBU router here as a
plugin this gives us access to dollar
sign route we can also access this in
our template so here I can just access
dollar sign route again dollar sign
route is made available by the view
router parents and on the parents we
know we call it team ID so
this team ID here of course has to match
the name gave it here now if I save this
and we go to our home page here and I
click on users again
it loads user slash Ken and you see team
ideas 10 here so this clearly works and
if I manually enter 12 here you see now
it outputs 12 but now I want to show you
a little gotcha you can run into you
let's add another link where we load the
team with tid 12 so users for team 12
and here we got users for team 10 should
be straightforward right if I click
users 12 or let's go to home first if I
click users at team 12 we see 12 if I
now click 10 we see 10 but now let's go
back to the application and enter a life
cycle hook here lifecycle hooks are
basically methods which are executed
automatically on a view instance when it
is created and so on you can learn more
about them in your official Docs you can
find a link to lifecycle hooks any video
description one hook is the created
method and this clearly shall not be
here excuse me we shall be in the users
of view file so created this method will
be executed by view chess whenever this
component here is created and here I
want to simply say alert and want to
output this route params params team ID
like this so let me save this and it
opened it on another window but it
opened it now if I click home and click
10 we see it again if I click 12 we
don't see it we see the URL change
we see it change in the template but we
don't get the alert I have to go to home
and back before we see that alert again
now why is that because view chess
manages the components very efficiently
when using routing it doesn't destroy
them just because we're switching
between 10 and 12 here it keeps the
component because it's the same
component why would it destroy and
recreate it that only cost performance
right so therefore it's a clever
behavior
that it doesn't destroy the component
instead it keeps it alive and only rear
Enders the parts of the dom which need
to rebury rendered that is generally a
good thing but it is bad if we have some
methods depending on that like here
where we execute some code in the
created method this is not executed
every time we switch the route now to
make this work we have to set up a
watcher so we add the watch property
here and in the object we set up that we
want to watch dollar-sign route we need
to enclose this in single quotation
marks because dollar sign is a special
character which is generally not allowed
in property names so now we can watch
this route property and here we write us
in es6 method style we get the
to-and-from parameter passed by UJ s
this basically just means to which route
are we navigating and from which route
are becoming well in here we can then
simply alert and say to params team ID
now if we do this and save this it'll
give me D Allah gave me the alert
off-screen but if I now click 10 we get
the alert if I click 12:00 I get the
alert because now we're watching this
route property which of course does
changed that was always the case but now
we're executing this code here whenever
it changes because we're watching it so
the component is not getting recreated
but we're still getting informed now I'm
going to comment it out for the last
piece of fingers or a code I want to
show you navigating from within your
code so any users dot view file let's
say we have a button and I want to go
home when clicking this button now
clearly we get this home link here right
but still let's say we want to do this
when we click this button so here I add
add click and then I execute the go home
method a method which I'll add down here
so in the methods object I have go home
like this and I could run X any code
there now here
basically just navigating so a link
would technically be the wiser decision
but let's imagine we would have some
other code here so how do we do this
here Lin well we can simply access the
router TV router and there we can push a
new route on that stack so to say
because can we can think of it as a
stack because we can use the back button
to remove the top-level element and go
back one page so we want to push a new
page on that stack and we decide which
page by entering a path here so let's
say just slash which you want to go to
just home
so we basically enter the same here as
an argument to push as we enter here as
an argument to our links here to the two
attribute now by doing this if I save
this and I click go home I'm back to the
home page but now I navigated from
inside my code
so with that you learned a lot about the
view router and if you want to learn
more you can find a link to the official
talks in the video description the view
router is very powerful but with this
video and the last video before that you
should have a solid understanding of how
routing works how you can set up routes
and how you can navigate around now
there is more to it and these talks
should get you started to really dive
deeper into that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
