to have you on board you're probably
watching this because you want to learn
and not you or at least learn what's new
web the viola version of English you and
this and the next videos in this series
we're going to build this application
here a really simple application which
yet uses a lot of features of English
you like components modules routing and
much more in this application we get a
collection and a market and on the
market well we can add certain things to
our collection like let's say a box with
also students awesome and then of course
we see them in a collection where we can
remove them so what this might look
simple we're covering a lot of key
concepts of English you in this
application and I'm happy to have you on
board throughout this series
let's directly jump in with setting up
our development environment now I'm
going to use the angular CLI the
command-line interface as it makes
setting up a go to project and managing
it really easy as you might be aware
setting up a go to project can be a bit
more complicated since we use typescript
and we need a compiler for that and if
all of that is brand new to you I
recommend checking out one of my basic
videos here on the channel where I
explain why we use typescript and so on
but basically we do use it so we're not
writing JavaScript code directly instead
we use typescript which is compiled to
JavaScript and therefore we need a more
complex project set up this Eli max
setting up such a project very easy but
to use this Eli we need note J s now
we're not going to write any node.js
code we're not writing server-side code
here we only need it for a a development
server which is automatically run by the
CLI just so that we can test and see our
code and be because of npm it's package
manager which allows us to install these
CLI as well as all our dependencies we
may need in our project so make sure to
download the latest version here on
node.js org 6.6 at the point of time
where I record this video and once you
download it and install it head over to
the command line on Windows or terminal
here on Mac and then install the angular
CLI
you do this by simply running sudo on
Windows you won't need sudo and then npm
install - g2 install it globally angular
CLI at latest which will pull down the
latest version now once you hit enter
this will download the CLI and install
it well at least offer you enter your
password and then you're ready to use it
now I'll skip the step since it takes a
couple of seconds and I'll be back once
it has finished if you encountered any
issues during you CLI installation as
done business might sound I strongly
recommend googling them to seal I still
in beta at the point of time where I
record this video and a lot of the error
messages you're getting are also there
for other people so googling them will
probably find your solution really quick
now if this finished all successfully
you should navigate to a path where you
want to create your new project and then
you can quickly create it by running ng
which uses the CLI we just installed new
and the name of your project now I'm
going to name my collection app but of
course choose whatever name you want and
what this will do is use the CLI to
scaffold out a finish pre-configure
project which we're going to use now if
you don't like the CLI of course you're
free to use any other seed project or
your custom workflow you want all the
rest of this course or of this video
series will barely use TC ly I really
only use it to set up this project and
have a development server as well as a
workflow to compile everything and
manage my files but if you prefer a
different approach do it like this all
the back once this is finished i hope
that this newly created project in
webstorm which is the editor or the ide
i use but of course you may use any
other Eddy IDE like Visual Studio code
or an editor like sublime or Adam now in
this editor on the left you see the
folder structure and the files to see
like created for us
well the été folder here is important
for running end-to-end tests something I
won't cover in this videos here so we
can ignore it the source for
here holds all our source code and now
this looks like a lot especially since
we haven't written a single line of code
yet but that's basically just default
setup which we will use and in most of
these files we won't work for example
here in the top level while these Styles
the CSS file would allow us to create
our own global Styles which should be
added application white so this will
just be added to our index.html and this
index.html actually is the first very
important file here let's have a look at
it it's a default html5 skeleton here
and let's ignore this a bruit thing for
now this will be the only page which our
server DC lie ships with will ever serve
and the same is true if you were to
deploy this application on a real server
you only deploy or you only ship or
serve one page this index.html now
what's the sense behind that the idea
behind this is that angular 2 allows you
to create single page application which
means you only have one page and
thereafter angular 2 will re render the
Dom add new HTML elements remove
existing ones change some text and so on
QED give the user the illusion of new
pages being loaded but actually it's one
of the same page which constantly gets
changed and this is not angler to
specific there are other frameworks for
creating single page applications as
well you could also create a single page
application with react.js for example so
does the single page we're loading and
you won't find any script imports in
here because web pack which is used by
the CLI in the background to manage our
project will inject these script tags
automatically so when we actually serve
this application we will see some well
something happened because actually
scripts will be added and we need these
scripts to run our english' code which
you write because in the end that's just
JavaScript code getting executed in the
browser
well let's simply have a look at this in
terminal
and it's just a normal terminal
integrated in my IDE you can run ng surf
inside of this project folder that's
important to serve this project with key
angular CLI as I mentioned before DC Lai
ships with its own server so let's wait
a couple of seconds until this is all
built and thereafter you may head over
to a browser and open localhost 4200
which should give you app works which
means everything is working behind the
scenes this index.html file was loaded
as I just said some scripts were
inserted automatically by web pack and
these scripts happen to hold our
application even though we haven't
written anything yet but as you can see
a default basic application was created
for us here now if you want to dive
really deep into the CLI project
structure here I recommend checking out
the official github page of the CLI to
which you'll find a link in the video
description I'm going to focus on our
app which we can find in the app folder
now here is where we will write our
angular 2 related typescript code and
GCL I happens to create as a very simple
app which holds a app component which is
kind of the root component of our
application I'll come back to the idea
behind components in the next video
which will show us this app works
content here we can see this if we open
it here we see that even if you don't
understand the rest but we have a class
which has this title property which says
app words and it seems like we somehow
reference a template here with template
URL and this template here points to the
app component HTML file which kind of
seems to output this title property
again I'll come back to this or what
happens in detail in the next video so
overall this is what we're seeing where
somehow rendering this app component
HTML file template we're displaying the
content of this title property and all
of that gets inserted in the index.html
file this is our first application and
how we set it up with the CLI in the
next video in a serious
I'm going to explain what actually
happens when we visit this index.html
how our Anglo 2 application gets started
and what makes up ananga 2 application
see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
