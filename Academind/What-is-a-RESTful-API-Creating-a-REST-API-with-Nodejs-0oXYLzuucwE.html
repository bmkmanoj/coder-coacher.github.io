channel in this series we'll have a look
at how we create a restful api with
nodejs
let's dive right into it
so let's start building a restful api
with nodejs and for that first of all
let's have a look at what exactly a
restful api is what it's made up off and
what we should keep in mind whilst we
build it so what is a restful api
actually well restful stands for
representational state transfer and the
whole idea behind a restful api or
behind that name really is that we can
use it to transfer data around now that
sounds bigger than it maybe is the
general purpose of why we want to use it
is that it's an alternative to a
traditional web page for cases where
that traditional web page just doesn't
fit our needs let's maybe have a closer
look at this so what is a restful api
imagine we have a client which is our
browser so we are the client and we have
some server obviously like a web page
there we send a request for example if
we enter something into the URL bar and
we get back a response and for a normal
web page as you know that's a couple of
HTML pages 40 different URLs we enter so
we have a starting page we have a
products page an order page something
like yet that is a traditional web page
now if you're building a single page
application it's going to be a bit
different there you also send a request
and you get back a response but you
really only have to step only once
because you get back one HTML page which
contains a bunch of JavaScript in the
end that will then dynamically re render
that page but this is how web pages work
now that's great for a traditional web
apps but what about other cases where we
also want to reach out to some server
but where we don't really need HTML
let's have a look at some of these cases
we still got a server and by the way a
server here also means that we probably
have some database running on the server
or running on another server but
connected to this server and now let's
have a look at different clients maybe a
mobile app running on our smart phone
and that mobile app obviously all needs
to store and fetch data the problem just
is it doesn't need HTML for that the
data is not transferred as a text file
or something like this or as HTML file I
should say instead we use some other
data format and we really are just
interested in that data a similar case
is if our client is some code some
application think of the Google geo
location API where we can send
coordinates and we get back a parsed
address for example that all there is a
restful api just to give a little
spoiler here and the idea here is that
once you of course need to send data and
get data we're not interested in an HTML
page we just want to exchange data so
that we can use it in our code and
finally I already mentioned it the
single page application case here we
actually have a web app but only for the
first request we need HTML for all
subsequent requests we only want to
exchange data send some data to the
server fetch some data from it and
therefore here we all just need one HTML
page and no more thereafter you can't
build all of that with a traditional
server-side setup because a restful api
in the end is also just a normal server
the big difference in the end is that we
don't care about this HTML stuff we just
want to send data back and forth and
that restful api is are stateless
backends they don't care about the
individual client which connected to it
so if we have our client here and we
have our restful server which is a
normal server having some urls it is
able to accept requests on and so on
then we might have these endpoints so
these are the urls supported by our
servers
these URLs then each might all support
different HTTP words so we have get and
post requests but we might also be able
to support a delete request for example
here to delete a user or the same for
posts maybe we have a patch request
that's all the HTTP verb which exists or
for products maybe just a get request so
this is how our restful api could look
like we have a couple of URLs and each
URL then possibly has a couple of
different HTTP words and therefore types
of requests it supports and then from
our client we can send a request if
we're having a web app we would call
this an ajax request a synchronous HTTP
request one where we don't send a
request that get back a new page but one
where we send a request our current page
keeps on running and eventually we get
back a response which we then if we're
talking about a web application
typically handle with JavaScript to
re-render the dom or do whatever we need
to do with that response and if we have
some other kind of application like a
mobile app then we still would have some
tools provided by Java or Swift whatever
it is whatever you use for writing that
app that would be able to send a request
and handle a response you get back this
is the idea behind the restful api we
have a server with urls supporting
different types of HTTP requests for the
given urls but all we do is we exchange
data now if we have a look at this setup
here this data is typically exchanged in
JSON format it's not a must though you
can send XML data URL encoded data like
where you have like query parameter
style foreign data you're not limited to
Jason I'd say the one thing you
typically always have is you're not
sending HTML around though theoretically
you could also do that and parse it but
not with the goal of rendering it
through the browser because these API
endpoints here
not going to get targeted directly by
the browser in a sense of the user
entering any of these URLs that's not
going to happen
all these URLs are going to be targeted
by background requests like XML HTTP
Ajax request sent from JavaScript or the
equivalent for a mobile app this is how
we use it and we use it to exchange data
because that is essentially the only way
we can connect a single page application
or a mobile app to some back-end they
don't want HTML they want the data they
want to send data to so this is the idea
behind a restful api now if we go into
theory land here then this is not
necessarily a restful api a restful api
is a clearly defined construct and just
having a couple of URLs with different
supported HTTP endpoints it's
theoretically just a back-end and an api
you create it we often call all these
API is restful though because it's the
word or the expression for a back-end
that is not a traditional server sending
back HTML but data but theoretically we
got a couple of constraints that really
turn an API into a restful api we have
six such constraints where one is
optional I know this is really
theoretical we're also going to build
one in this serious so that it's a bit
easier to grasp I guess so the first
constraint is a client-server
architecture if we're building a restful
api then we have a clear separation of
concerns between our back-end which is
there to manage data do calculations and
send us back data and our front-end
which could be a single page application
or a mobile app which is responsible for
the UI our restful api awls is stateless
so we don't store any client context
like a session on it that's super
important our restful api doesn't care
about the clients connecting to
it it doesn't care if it's reached by a
single-page application and the mobile
app and maybe some other application it
doesn't store anything which clearly
binds it to one of this applications
like a session it's not handling
sessions it's not it's not caring about
sessions and this is going to become
important when we add authentication we
have cache ability in a sense that a
restful api typically should also well
express itself or tell the client
whether responses can be cached or not
and this is all the kind of case if you
don't explicitly set up and there's just
some default going to get used but you
you can clearly define if for example
for a get request you want to cache the
response you want to allow the browser
to cache the response and for how long
that should be the case or if you would
absolutely want to for a bit any caching
because you know that your data changes
so frequently that caching doesn't make
sense
so you can set up caching responses here
too to really make sure that the client
is using the API in an efficient way and
this is just something you yeah you can
do in a sense of you can clearly tell
that caching should be enabled for
example we also can build our restful
api in some layered system which means
the client connects to some server but
that server doesn't necessarily have to
be our final API could be some
in-between server which forwards the
requests or which sends back a response
but behind the scenes also reaches out
to our API and as I said we're really in
theory land here but we just don't have
to guarantee that our restful api or we
don't give to guarantee I should say
that our restful api is the final point
in a traveler or in the journey of the
request coming from the client we also
have a uniform interface which means
that resources are identified in in
requests so we send a request to let's
say slash users and
and a get request that clearly
identifies one resource the users get
resource and that the data we transfer
can be decoupled from the database
schema so if we store a user in a
certain way in the server-side database
we don't necessarily have to transfer it
like this to the user we can deviate
from that schema although it's good if
we have self descriptive messages and
links to further resources for example
if we send a request to get users we
would probably get back a list of all
the users and then it would be really
good if for each user object we don't
just get let's say the ID but we also
get a link to which we would have to
send a subsequent request to get the
data for that user so that we don't have
to guess about the API endpoint we would
send a request to because there is
something crucial to keep in mind of
course when you're building an API you
only have these addresses you only have
these URLs and if you're not aware of
them if you have no documentation to
look it up and if the API doesn't send
information about other addresses back
in responses then you have no chance of
using that API because how would you
know to where you send a request if you
compare it to a web application a
traditional what I mean where you have
multiple HTML pages there the user would
navigate around with links so there we
also have that information about other
pages we can wizard and it's kind of the
same gear for the restful api it's good
if we provide this information back to
our clients and then optional request is
code on-demand that means that
theoretically it would be allowed and
still be a restful api if we implement
it such that it gives the client back
some executable code and that's not
something we're going to build here so
it really just means it doesn't have to
be just data it could also be some code
that the client can execute raw
than just data for that code and again D
is here these constraints are all just
theory constructs so these are really
just that's the theoretical definition
of a restful api we're going to build
one here and we're going to build one
that works and that makes sense so don't
don't learn that by by hearts that you
don't need you know all of that be aware
of that stateless thing is really
important the clear separation between
client and server dad seemed to be the
most important things to me because
that's something which often is hard to
grasp and you often get asked well how
can angle or your angular or a
single-page application how can I create
a session on the server and the answer
is you can't really do that because in a
single page application you use a
restful api because you only need the
data and a restful api shouldn't really
care about the client connected to it
shouldn't really manage sessions because
you never reload pages anyways so that's
important to know you're independent
from the client you're stateless now
enough of the theory let's build a
restful api in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
