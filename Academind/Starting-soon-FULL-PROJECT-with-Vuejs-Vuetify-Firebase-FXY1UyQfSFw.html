you on board my name is Max million and
a lot of you guys wanted a full project
and a lot of you also wanted view chess
you're getting it though we're going to
build a full project over the next weeks
and this is the project it's our meetup
organizing application it's built with
view chess with beautifly which is a
package for view chests which gives us
this nice material design and a lot of
finished components you can use and
we're using firebase behind the scenes
what can we do in is that what you see
we have this Caruso lair where we can
basically see some featured meet ups we
can also explore all meetups here click
on a meet-up and of course register for
it now this will go super fast because
firebase is fast but this actually sends
a request to the backend here we can
have a look at that back-end here is the
firebase console and this is the project
we create here you see the users like
creators in this project here you see
our real time database with the
different nodes for the different
meetups and in a storage you actually
can see that the images we see for these
Vedas are uploaded to storage so this is
more than just a nice-looking front that
we have to back-end in there too
now of course they're not limited to
viewing meetups we can also organize our
own meetups and an image of course get
an image preview even enter a nice
description and of course also pick a
time and a date so like July 31 and then
well let's maybe use 8:00 p.m. after we
hit create meetup we can view this
meetup here - here it is our awesome
meetup at time we told it to be and then
we can even edit it over here title
description or date and time if we
decide that it shouldn't be 8:00 but oh
I picked a.m. I see but it should be 5
o'clock in the evening that is our
project we're going to
and of course we don't just have the
project here we also of course have to
log in or create an account first we
have to pull authentication flow Q that
is what we're going to bill I'm super
excited to get started with you in the
next that you were actually going to get
started by planning this application
creating a concept and then we'll dive
into the setup at all the other steps
this won't be a short project but I
guess it's going to be an interesting
one and I'm really excited to dive into
it with you see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
