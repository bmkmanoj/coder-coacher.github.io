this view dual fired
firebase project where we were building
this def meetup application thus far
were in this state we have the project
in the state where we are able to
actually view meetups new car cell click
on one see the details and that's it
we're managing this stage through UX
already which is great but I think a
nice next step would be if we could
actually organize a new Meetup
even though it won't be stored on a
server just yet this will be a nice
enhancement to actually really create
our own meetup so let's implement this
now
I now want to make this organize meetup
page work and for that I need a forum so
let's start by having a look at the
beautified documentation and actually
see what they offer us when it comes to
input text fields and there are text
fields components which give us nice
inputs for single line and multi-line
inputs and the nice thing is this also
has validation built in so we also get
validation errors depending on which
rule to configure which is really
awesome and I will come back to that so
I'm going to use a bunch of these text
fields now to allow the user to create
at least a first version of a new meetup
we're going to enhancers later once we
add firebase to upload files and so on
but we can go pretty far without
firebase already so let's go back and
let's go to the create meetup dot u file
or page here which is actually the page
will load when we click on organize a
meet up there I'll again add a V
container to use the beautify grid and a
V layout row now here I'll add a v-flex
element XS twelve that's all stuff you
already know in there I'll now add a
heading whereas a create a new meet up
so that we simply have a title telling
us what we're doing maybe H four that's
really big so create a new Meetup and I
maybe give this a text color of primary
- - text like that so create a new
meetup now we load that I'll add a new
roles and UV layout with a row and in
there v-flex now however this reflects
we'll get X is 12 I'm in there I'll add
a form element I'll remove the action
because I don't want to send a request
to the server or anything like that
I'll handle a submission through uks now
in there I'll add now review layout the
row and now here at the Flex element
away from very small devices on bigger
devices only half the width may be and
therefore offsetting it - and now add a
B text field element here that is a
component provided by you to fire and
the V text field component takes a name
like normal HTML inputs you could be
title since I want to fetch time layer
it takes a label where we can define
some placeholder text we will actually
see your error sunlight liable attached
next to it then an ID may be of title
and I also want to add required and this
will use the built-in validation to show
us when this is wrong if we go back now
you will see the input field if I click
in that and I type there you see now
it's valid but if I remove that we get
an indication that this is invalid which
is really nice would also be nice if
that tight layer at the top would be
kind of well aligning to our input
fields we can achieve this by simply
adding sm6 and the same offset here at
the top to sort of we get the same
styling on different devices which looks
Li really nice in my opinion and maybe
we change this from the primary text to
the secondary text here or therefore
remove it altogether since that should
be the default anyways so now that is to
title add it we also need to date we
need the location we need a description
we need an image these are all things we
definitely need so what I'll do is I'll
go back to the application replicate
this add a number row now not with the
title but with the location want to
allow the users to simply enter that
here so that's all the required input
now we got two lines here really simple
and then I want you allow user to enter
the image now I'll see you an add an
upload button here because we will
actually upload an image to firebase but
we haven't added firebase yet so for now
people should simply enter a URL here so
name this image URL and here M
edge URL like that let's give this an
idea of image - URL maybe so now we got
this cue here we get a tiny bug that the
line is not displayed at all times
sometimes that happens and beautify
really strange
I'll next add another row where I want
to allow the user to enter a description
so your that will be the description add
this here queue here also a description
and the description should be a
multi-line text field and we can do this
or add this by adding multi-line here
this will now ensure that we actually
have multiple lines to write them we can
even increase this if we want now when
using multi-line if you have a look at
the technical documentation here just
scroll down multi line here you will see
that you can actually also restrict how
many lines you want to allow but all the
way at the bottom actually there's a lot
about validation here - so feel feel
feel free to dive much deeper into that
now here what you can do is if you use
multi-line you can also use rows to
define how many rows you want to display
I'll stick to the default of 5 but you
could override this that's just
something I want to bring to your
attention as you can see there are loads
of properties you can use to adjust
validation and how that all displaced
displays definitely feel free to play
around with that so that's the
multi-line validation back to the image
I believe it will all be nice if you
would see a preview of the image maybe
below it so here I'll not add a text
field but actually I simply want to add
an image property normal image element
actually where I want to output output
my image preview maybe or image URL this
is a property which doesn't exist yet
but I'll soon add properties to it will
bind all these inputs now I can bet back
to date and time later let's work with
the input to get thus far and let's add
a script section to this file now so
that we can actually bind all these
with two properties so export a default
object here and there
I now want to have my my data property
for now and then data I will return an
object and in that object I'll have my
title which is an empty string initially
I'll have my vocation which is an empty
string initially I'll have my image URL
which is an empty string and description
so all the things I configure that your
ass text fields now we can use the
v-model on the title to bind to title
and that's using normal view chair
syntax here again nothing you defy
specific except for the fact that DB
text field component allows us to use
the model on it but we model it than
just normal view chairs code and I'll do
the same here on the location and on the
image oops image URL here and also on
the description and this is the
important part which allows us to fetch
the values to user actually enters with
that fetched there's one other thing we
can of course do we can add another
wheel layout towards the end of the form
to be a row reflects XS 12 maybe and
there I now want to have to be button
where I actually say create meetup or
gift is button a class of primary now if
you have a look with the button at the
bottom make sure to also give it s m6
offset s and free to have it sits nicely
in the middle here now that button
should not be enabled at the form is
invalid and I'll come back to checking
this for now this is the form how it
looks like let's see how we can enhance
this with validation and actually using
the values you and your to create and
you meet up I want to start with
validation the button should only be
clickable of the whole form is valid
which is currently for example it's not
for that I'll go back to my JavaScript
off
here in anti computed property to this
component the instance and I'll add a
form is valid computed property here
that's a third playing space there
now here I want to return if this title
is not equal to an empty string and this
location is not equal to an empty string
so basically that all of them are valid
all these inputs and you can of course
to find your own validation logic here
or use another view validation package
like V validate to cut other ways or to
get out of ways of handling this so your
l then also check if the image URL is
not empty and finally of if the
description is not empty so I'm checking
of all these fields to have the values I
expect them to have not being empty and
so on we put this over multiple lines to
make it look a bit nicer so that's my
validation logic and now I can use
formulas valid here in or on my button
to bind to the disabled property and if
that is true the button is disabled so
if not form is valid so this computer
property where I return this boolean
check if that's not true then this will
be disabled and that will be not true if
the form is not valid which is what I
want so now what you see is it isn't
these disabled here as soon as I do
enter something into all of these fields
though it gets enabled as you can see
image preview of course not working here
if I were to use my own image
like for example from Munich which is to
say diem living in if I now choose an
image here like this one for example get
Dada URL then this one now if I enter
this here you should see that we indeed
get a nice preview well that is rather
large here so maybe we should do
something about the styling validation
however it's working let's fix the image
styling then now that we already see
that it's an issue
can fix that relatively easy on the
preview image I'm using here I'll simply
set the height to 300 we do that now you
see it ensures that this doesn't go
super big on small devices it's still an
issue though so maybe we go even smaller
than that 200 now it should also be fine
now entirely fine on small devices I
guess better though you can of course
also use responsive CSS to control the
size here I'll just try to get a fix a
quick fix for that now that looks better
so this would now be to set up all of
use here now I want you make the create
meet up button work and want to make
sure that whatever I enter here once it
is valid I can submit it and I do add it
to my Buick store now for that I'll go
back to the view X stored and add a
mutation here create meetup seems to be
a fitting name there I'll actually get
the state and payload as arguments and
in the mutation I expect to get a
payload which already is an object
formatted in the way I want to have it
formatted now that's not a strict
requirement you could also reformat the
content you get and make sure that you
create the object you want to save in a
mutation so both is valid here I'll
actually just set state and reach out to
my loaded meters here and actually you
simply push my new meter which again
will be in the payload already formats
in the way I need it
so push it on human loaded meetups so in
actions here of all the add a create me
that method there I can get this object
where I use destructuring to extract the
commit method I'll also get my payload
here as a second argument that will be
the middle I actually want to create
here I'll now create my meet up my
meetup object and I'll set the title I
expect to get a title property any
payload
I'll have to make sure that my
application works like this but since
you're the one configuring the store
that something is you can control so
you're Tyler Shelby payloads title
location shall be payload location the
image URL Chevy payload
image URL and the arm description shelby
payload description and correctly you
would say well if I'm extracting all
these properties which have the exact
same names as in the object I create why
don't I just take payload as the actual
object and you would be right if that is
how your application works and it
certainly is the case for our
application there's nothing wrong with
doing that I'm just showing you more
we're both way of actually mapping this
to a new object to make sure that you
understand that you could transform it
here you could also build it up in
mutations as I just said in this method
here I chose this method I'll create
meet up here because palos might also
have other properties which I don't need
or maybe other property names which I
don't want to use here so that's why I
choose the more verbose way it's not
about getting done as fast as possible
here but also just teaching you a little
bit about UX I guess so that's the
meetup I was using it yet though now
here we would actually reach out to
firebase and store it that would be the
idea at this point here and once we did
stories we would get back an ID firebase
created and we will add this ID to the
meetup and that's all stuff we will do
once we added firebase we get a lot of
work to do then we'll also upload the
image here and get the storage path and
firebase and store that all that stuff
we have to worry about right now so I
will simply commit here I will commit an
X you could create meetup passed as a
string and as a payload I will pass my
meetup so that I can simply push that
onto my loaded meetups array and all our
gathers will then automatically fetch
the updated version of that array so
as the create meetup action I created
now back in the create media component I
want to fire that action whenever I
click my button here
however this button should actually
submit the form remember we're still in
a foreign object so the better way of
handling this is to give this V button a
type of submit and then go to the form
and there I'll add a at submit listener
submit this a native Dom event and we
can listen to it it will occur once you
click a button which is of type submit
here I then want to prevent the default
which would be to send an HTTP request I
don't want to do that I don't want to
leave my single page application here
and then I'll call on create meetup or
any method method name you want to use
so with that let's go down to our object
let's add methods here and let's add on
create meetup as a method here now I
don't need to get any arguments here
because I got all the values here and an
on create meter by now we'll simply
dispatch my actions of this store
dispatch and now I'll actually create my
meetup data object choose any name you
like where I will simply bind this title
to this title then location to this
location so basically create a
JavaScript object where I store all the
data I stored in my data property here
so image URL this image URL and that
will be what I pass to my store them so
description to this description like
that and you're ultimately dispatch my
create meet of action and pass the
meetup data to that action that is what
I'll do here now again once we add a
date and time which we haven't added yet
this will become more complex for now
what I want to do is I want that add a
date here and somebody said new dates to
get the current date so right now you
back to the store to also handle that so
here we'll actually then also store date
and payload date and with that we get a
very easy way without date and time
Pickers without fire base without image
upload but a very easy way of adding new
meetups for now we will enhance this no
worries so with that let's see if it
works let's go back to your application
here let me fetch this link again let's
say Munich JavaScript meetup location
will be at the marienplatz in Munich
always say a great place to beat if you
don't want to find someone because it's
crowded with people then I'll add my
image URL here to get the preview and
it'll certainly be an awesome meda let
me get to create Meetup did it work we
don't know let's view the meetups looks
good to me you get the Munich chalice
copied up the date is displayed a bit
strange here because it's in simply use
new date and we have no way of properly
outputting dates can now view the meetup
here there we get an error because
cannot read a property title of
undefined because because we have no ID
we try to fetch a meter by ID when we
load the individual media but when we
create one we don't have one now I told
you that we will get one from firebase
once we send our data there but that
doesn't happen yet so for now and again
it's only a temporary solution when we
create a meter here I'll store an ID
which is hard-coded into the store where
it's not a production ready solution but
that will do for now
so with that let's go back to organizing
a meet up here let's reload the page
Munich
Java scream was at the marine flats in
Munich let's enter our image here and
it'll be an awesome meetup like that
let's create it again let's go back to
view meetups click on it now we see it
here now there is stuff to improve for
example that we actually maybe navigate
a way we clicked three
meter button that we have date and dime
time pickers that we use firebase the
last thing I'll do in this video is I'll
make sure that we navigate to the list
of meetups once you click create but
we'll take care about the pickers and so
on in future videos too of course let's
make this create media button work
correctly or to be precise once you
submit to me that here I want to do the
right thing
first of all I'll add also check if this
form is valid if that is not true by
adding an exclamation mark I want to
return because I would don't want to
submit the format the form is invalid we
shouldn't be able to reach this code
anyways since we disables the button but
on the other hand the user could just go
into the Dom and remove the disabled
flag and then we would be able to reach
that part so it's a nice extra check but
more importantly once you did this patch
I want to use the router this dollar
sign router to used injected router
instance to push a new route and go to
slash meet-ups
you could also of course navigate to the
newly created meetup that let's go back
to the application when final time and
let's ask that Munich JavaScript meetup
one more time still awesome the click
create meetup now I'm taking there we
see it here so the old one due to hot
reloading in our setup here so the page
wasn't actually reloaded and now this
all works of course we now have the
issue if we have two new meetups they
share the same ID because we hard-coded
that into our UX store will fix this but
in the next video I want to dive into
using date and time time pickers to make
sure we don't use the current date and
then I'll also take care about
outputting the data a nicer way and
outputting the actual place and
description we also don't do that so
there is still a lot of work let's move
on and start working on these issues in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
