on board on this channel I already have
a couple of pages where I show you how
to use rx chess and the operators Q and
Hans your applications in this video I
want to have a look at reviews and scan
QR brazzers which can be mistaken for
each other because they do kind of the
same thing but they have one distinct
difference and we'll have a look at this
besides that they are really useful
operators if you have an ongoing
operation a couple values being emitted
which you often have when using
observables any 1q kind of reduce these
values to a final result let's have a
look at how about works and let's start
with reduce now you might know the array
reduce method which allows you to reduce
an array by applying a function which
takes the tow value of your arrays of
what you will have in the end also and
then the current value it occurred
element of the array for example and
then it does something with it you
define what it is it could add up all
the items and then it goes to the next
element takes the new total so for the
first element now take the next element
and ask this maybe go to the third one
hits you total at the third and so on
and in the end you have just a total for
the whole array now our ex chess has a
salade function here I have an
observable which I created with the alt
helper method where I simply pass a list
of elements you can pass an infinite
list here how many items you want and
they will simply omit all these items
synchronously immediately so there is
just words that sort but hit ctrl enter
now we just if you want two three four
five now I want to reduce them to get
the total sum and for that I can
actually reduce method where I have to
pass a method and this method is
described will get few arguments that
the total and then if the current value
it will do this for each omission so for
each value so to say and then it has to
return something here it has to return
us a new value a new total which will be
used for the next element as a input
total so that is kind of a loop at that
here inside
here you can also pass a second argument
which is our starting total because for
the first element we of course have no
total so you're going to start with zero
and now in my function here what I want
to do is I want to return my old total
initially zero plus my current value so
for the first element we will have zero
plus one then for the next value we will
have one the total of the first
iteration plus two for the third one
three plus three and so on
for now clear the console in control
enter you see we just get 15 which
indeed is the sum of all these items and
that is what reduced us and it can be
very useful if you have an observable
where you know it will eventually
complete it and you want to reduce all
these individual values to one single
value in which you really are interested
in the end so what is scan then scan
works pretty much the same
almost I can even replace reduce here
with scan and if I now clear the columns
on this control enter we see the
difference in all the get subscription
in the end but it prints on each step
but on each step it Princeton you total
so for the first element difference one
because we have zero plus one for the
second element is prints brief because
we have one the total from the first
iteration plus two and so on
it is the difference scan is useful if
you want to reduce your elements but you
are interested in the in-between totals
and reduce is useful if you're only
interested in the final table it's a
most important to recognize that reduce
of course only makes sense if your
observable eventually completes whereas
scan doesn't need to complete it brings
out a new total and eternally it keeps
track of the latest total and therefore
even if it's an infinite observable you
will still be able to you scan on that
and simply add it up or whatever you
wanted to of course you don't have to do
additions here it could multiply it you
could do anything with it so these are
scan introduced hopefully this video was
a bit helpful in showing how they work
and how they differ</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
