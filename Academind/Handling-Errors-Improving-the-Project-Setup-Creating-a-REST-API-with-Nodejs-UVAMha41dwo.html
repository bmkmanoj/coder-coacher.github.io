last videos we already worked quite a
bit on our restful api and I liked how
it looked said works really great now we
added some routes and zhan it's now time
to improve our development set up a
little bit at least and I always want to
make sure that we improve error handling
because we're not really handling errors
in our API as of now
so first of all what I want to improve
regarding the setup is I don't
constantly want to restart the server
whenever we make a change to anything
for this we can use a package called
node Mon we install it with the NPM
install and then - - save def because 3
is only a development dependency we need
and then the name is just node Mon just
download it like this this is a package
which will basically monitor your files
and automatically restart the server
whenever you change something a link to
the package can be found in the video
description and there you can learn more
about it so now with that note one was
added I now also want you no longer
manually type note server but instead
with node Mon we would have to type node
Mon server je s that however will fail
because it's not a global package
installed on our machine now we can
easily work around this by going to the
package.json file and adding a script
let's add the start script that's a
special script we can easily execute by
running NPM start inside our project
folder and when we type this I want to
run node 1 here I can use that because
this will now not search for it on our
cert system but in our project and there
we just installed it so then I want to
execute node 1 server je s now if I run
NPM start here you see we got this
output here looks a little bit different
than before and it essentially started
our server so if I go back to postman
and I try my requests again this still
works because we got a no js' server but
watch the console if I added something
so here I'll simply add a comment routes
which should handle requests and now if
I save this file
you see it's restarting the server even
though here I didn't add any logic that
would have required that but it watched
the file and saw that I changed it and
this all the works for files and
subdirectories here if I say handle
incoming get requests to slash orders
and I save this
it also restarted so this is really
convenient now we don't have to manually
cancel the server and restart whatever
make a change
additionally I want to add a logging
package to my set up to log incoming
requests so that we can also see some
information here in the terminal so for
that I'll temporarily quit node Mon and
install another package with NPM install
- - save and it's called Morgan
it's a logging package for node J s we
can use it really easy just go to app J
s and there let's create a new constant
its name at Morgan and require the name
is by the way totally up to you
require Morgan this name is not up to
you that has to be the package you
installed and now we have to basically
tell Express to funnel all requests
through this middleware that it is in
the end and Morgan will then just log
something and let the request continue
so Morgan behind the scenes will call
this next function saying I don't return
a response I just did something in this
case I locked something you continue
doing your work so let's use Morgan and
let's use it before we handle our
requests with our routes by simply
saying app use and then use some more
again as a function and pass death here
that's the format we want to use for the
output now with that let's rerun NPM
start to restart node Mon and if I now
again send a request here it looked as
before but you see now in a terminal we
get this extra log seeing that we got a
get request and how long it took and so
on so that's really nice additionally I
now want to handle errors keep in mind
if we send a request to some invalid ID
or with some invalid HTTP word we get
back this default error HTML page and I
want to send back JSON instead now error
handling is really nice in
set up here keep in mind that we have
here our middleware which forwards
requests to products and orders files
where we then have to router on the
apprehend that means if we make it past
these two middlewares
none of the routes set up an IVA of the
two files were suited to handle the
incoming requests hence we can handle
errors by simply catching all requests
that make it past these two requests
here these two middlewares I should say
so we can something use the app object
and now use and no longer add a filter
like slash something but simply say I
want to handle every request that
reaches this line because if you reach
that line it means no route in one of
these two files was able to handle the
request so here in this middle of where
I again have my request response and the
next function and now I simply want to
return an error here so I will create a
new constant error and create a new
error here the error object is available
by default you don't need to import it
or anything like that and here I want to
output not found as a error text I will
also set a error status code excuse me
that should be error so that error
object is provided by no chase and I can
set a status code of 404 because here we
get here if we have an error because we
didn't find a fitting route which is the
definition of a 404 error then I will
actually execute this next method and
pass my error along with it this will
now forward the request but forward this
error request here instead of the
original one essentially now add another
middleware here where I also get my
request response and next but I get a
separate first argument which actually
is my error and this here will handle
all kinds of errors like the error we
create here and we for
word or and that is why I chose this
setup errors thrown from anywhere else
in this application this shouldn't
really be able to happen yet but later
when we add a database for example and
when we have operations doing work on
the database these operations could fail
and we then want to return a 500 error
now if these operations fail they will
directly throw an error so we don't make
it into this first middleware but since
they throw an error this middleware here
would be triggered and it would handle
this error or get this error so here we
can set a status code on the response we
eventually want to send back which is
either the status code the error has
like it has if we created our 400 error
404 error or we assign a 500 error code
for all other kinds of errors and then
we can simply return some JSON data here
and we could have changed that as I did
in the router setup so that would have
worked too and there I want to send an
error object which maybe should have a
message property and this setup is
totally up to you set it up as you want
and there I will pass on my error
message like the message this should
also be error by the way the a message
of the error we get as a first argument
here the message will automatically be
not found and for other errors
whoops fix the typo for our errors these
typically also have a message property
it's kind of what most errors have you
can pretty much rely on them having a
message object a message property and
now we will return this so let's try
this out let's save this and no daman
will restart and now let's again send an
invalid request now you see we get back
a method and our answer here error
status is not a function it nicely
proves that the automatically thrown
error has a message property because
that's not our own error and I did
indeed
is up here we should assign an error
status property of 404 not a method so
now let's try this again and now we get
not found which again is our custom
message this one and so I accidentally
but it's also kind of good I guess
proved that though our custom 404 and
ler SD I handle all other kinds of
errors like my error with the unknown
function here both work and with that we
got automatic reloading
we got default logging and we got error
handling which is a great improvement to
our project with that let's leave it as
this and let's go back into our project
and make sure that we add more useful
functionalities to it in the next videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
