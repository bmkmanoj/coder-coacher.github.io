this is the last video of this series I
hope you already learned a lot in this
video I just want to show you two
additional tiny tweaks or things to know
to keep in mind or free actually the
first one if you haven't found it
already it always lost in the video
description though is the official
documentation well it's not that hard to
find if you google for view X that's the
second result here it's view X dot view
chest org here you can dive even deeper
and learn some additional things about
view X but the main concept of course is
the one I showed you in the last videos
now another very useful thing when we're
in the browser right now is our the view
developer tools if you google for them
you should you should find a Chrome page
and I'm talking about the Chrome browser
there I don't even know if it also
exists for other browsers and there you
can add the view dev tools as a
extension to the Chrome browser now I
already got them added and what they
allow you to do is if you open them in
your developer tool and then view you
for one get your normal tools showing
you the components on your page app
registration and registrations where if
the values use there so that's nice but
you also get that UX tab and the cool
thing is watch what happens if I click
on register you see you see the commit
here if I click on register again you
see another commit and now if you click
on an older one it jumps back to that
state so you can time travel through
your list of states to debug your
application and quickly see how the
application looked like at another point
of time you also see the payload of each
commit and so on see the state of the
commit and a great tool to dive deeper
you can also if you don't want to jump
back temporarily but reset your app
simply click revert
and you're back to that state or you
revert at that state I should say so if
I revert that state and back to the
state before if I unregister and every
word that I'm back to that state so this
is another great tool for debugging your
application the last thing I wanted to
show you is if you have a look at the
app at the store the chase file this is
not a complex app but the store the
chase file is already not very big but
it has a lot of code in it well you can
split it up and you will see this in
bigger projects there you typically
create a new folder which you may name
store for example could also name it
view X and I will move my store dot J's
file in there that did not really
shorten the file though but I will also
create some other files here one for the
Gators one for D mutations and one for
you guessed it the actions now with
these extra files what I do is in the
actions file for example here first of
all I exported efj old object and then I
will go to my store the chess file to my
actions and simply copy that method or
all the methods I have there and put
them as methods into this object them
exporting in this file and then I can
simply go into the store dot J's file
and import actions from my actions file
this actions object and I simply assign
it as a value to my actions property
down there or use es6 to automatically
assign it since it has the same name now
I will do the same for the mutations so
I will grab the whole mutations object
here actually go to the mutations J's
file export the default object here to
the object I just wrapped and go to the
store J's file to now import the
mutations there and I will assign them
to the mutations property or again use
es6 since the name is the same and I'll
do this say
for the gathers export default object
that one year import the gathers in the
store dot JS file and assign them here
again using es6 as a shortcut and with
that distorted chase files much leaner
now the app would be broken though
because all the moved distorted shares
file so make sure to adjust the import
in the main dot JS file to and with that
if I save this and go to the application
reload it looks like it's working again
but now the store the chair's file is
leaner and i outsource this in two
different files mutation scatters and so
on and with that you should be set to
use view x and really improve your
applications with that i hope to see you
in other videos have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
