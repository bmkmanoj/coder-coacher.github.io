a lot of material on angular 2 which I
by the way we'll also update in the
future one singlet you is stable and out
and so on and on no chairs now you might
know that angular 1 and no Chi as was a
quite popular combination and the same
is true for English you are no chairs it
works together very well and I thought
why not make a video where I show the
basics of how to connect angular 2 with
no chairs and give you the tools to
create applications based on that now
little South advertisement right at the
beginning but also might be very helpful
to you if you want to dive really deep
into that you might want to check out my
angle or to an air chess course over on
udemy and you'll find a link in the
description and also if available Sam
discounts to get it cheaper than the
default price as you can see it's pretty
well right and in this course you will
learn how to bolt angular 2 plus no
chess application how to implement
authentication how to create data on the
servers store it fetch had manipulated
deleted how to manage the state in your
angular 2 application also how to handle
errors in the end you'll even learn how
to deploy to Heroku or AWS so really a
big package and obviously I can't really
do that here in one single video or in
this serious since this requires a lot
of work and is really really in-depth
but what I can do and what I want to do
is well show you the basics how do you
connect both ends and how do you get
them to interact so therefore I am in a
brand new workspace and now that's not
helpful to you because you don't have
this project right do you well you can
get it on my github account and you'll
find a link to this in the description
too there I have a repository angle to
know chess where you can switch to the
branch seed project and then just clone
it or download it as a zip file and
extract it and this
exactly the project I have currently
opened
you
now what is this project well I'm not
going to go super deep through all the
files and folders but to give you an
overview the assets folder here will
basically hold my angular 2 application
in its typescript form so I'm compiled
so here in the app folder this is where
I will write my code then indepent
falter that's on the back end that will
be my note chess server running and I
created all the notes yes Express I'm
using Express back-end using Express
generator so if you watched my notes yes
basic serious
you saw how this works and there's a
world structure might not be too
unfamiliar to you so this was basically
created with Express generator this is
the server generated by it then I have
my routes folder with the app chess fall
holding my wealth routes currently only
one rendering my index view and then
this is the view in the index in the
views folder and then I have my app
chess file which is basically my well
application the application running or
the main file on my back and handling
all the requests so my server in the www
file basically loads this app file sends
all requests into this app file in this
application and here note and Express
handles it applies a couple of middle of
wares and so on one important beware is
this one here which is required if your
unlike in this project hosting your
back-end on a different server than your
front-end now here in this project both
will be sent from the same server so
this middleware mirror so the smilla
where here would not be necessary but
this basically allows you to do this if
you were having two different servers
what do I mean with both coming from the
same server angular2 runs in a browser
right yes it runs in a browser but it
has to be served from some server in the
beginning right it's a single page
application but this single page is
needed to and this single page you get
is this next on HP s file this is just
normal quite HTML code and here my app
gets loaded and you saw a man or two
videos how that works
and I'm using system chess - I'll start
my Apple load all the dependencies in my
public folder in the JavaScript folder
here the compiled angular 2 files live
so the typescript code in the assets
folder in the app folder here will get
compiled into the JavaScript app folder
which is then loaded once my application
runs and the vendor folder here
that's a folder automatically generated
by gulp which is configured in the gulp
file which basically copies all the
angular 2 specific dependencies from my
node modules folder into this vendor
folder so that I have access to that on
my front end as well because of course I
need them on my front end in my client
and not on the server where this node
modules folder would lie so let's take
quick overview over this folder
structure and lift that I'd say why
don't we get started right away let's
see what we're currently got so I will
start my app and PM start will run my
server and I also need to compile my
application for this I run npm run gulp
these are all scripts set up in the
package that json file which you might
check out here so with that I got gulp
running which will keep running and
watch my files and recompile them
whenever needed and I got my server
running so with that if Y well let's
reload here we see hello world test
that's the basic application with which
we start here based in the C project I
let the closed two steps and I'll both
on that and what I wanna bolt is a tiny
little application where you're able to
create random messages and basically see
them in a list here doesn't sound too
amazing but actually does a lot shows
you how to connect back-end and
front-end and enough to talking let's
start so back in my workspace in
webstorm here which is the ID I'm using
I'll start working on my front end first
so that we have something to to see
right so in this app template file I of
course don't want to display hello world
instead notice I'm also importing
bootstrap so some styling in the index
file instead I want to create the well
the classes or the HTML code for the
list of messages I want to display so
for this I'll use a container element it
is just a bootstrap class of course with
a row inside of it and then just a
column to give this some nice basic
styling here so that's all bootstrap
classes here and then what I want to
have here is I want to have a button
which allows me to create and you ran
the message like this new random message
and of course this partner should
receive some bootstrap classes as well
so I'll give this to the classes button
and button primary next I'm going to
copy all of that code and your
duplicated because in here I will use
the general skeleton with the bootstrap
classes but then I want to create an
article element which all give the
bootstrap classes panel and panel
default just to give to some nice look
to and you'll later on see how this
looks of course and then here I will
create a div where the panel body 0 this
will just be my messages and here I want
to output my message content of course
here I'm referring to a variable I have
created yet or a property in my
component but I'll come back to that
soon also of course in my article I want
to have multiple articles multiple
messages so for this I'll create the
energy for loop here and I'll loop
through all my messages so with that
message of Massachusetts again messages
doesn't exist yet now message in here at
least does existed this message and
create in here with the ng for loop but
messages would refer to a property in my
component class body and that doesn't
exist yet so there's something I need to
do there also on my button up here I
want to add a click event and I want to
Gyan ad message method whenever someone
clicks this button so that's my HTML
code and actually you can have a look at
this if I reload my page you see okay
this is my button right now nothing will
happen I would indeed get an error if
you open up the console if I click this
but yeah that's my application right now
not too amazing but we'll get there
I should probably start by adding this
messages property so I'll do this in my
app component I want to create a
messages property but which type should
that have well probably my own type I
think it makes sense to create my own
message class which I can use so I'll do
that then I'll create a new file in my
app folder which I will name message dot
model dot TS and that's just naming
conventions that I describe what will
live inside this file here I'm just
setting up a basic model for the data
I'll be using throughout my app and here
all I want to do is I want to export a
class which I will name message and this
class will have a constructor and here
I'm using a shortcut in typescript I'm
both setting up my constructor with the
arguments it needs as well as the
properties of this class here in one
step by adding the public keyword in
front of the name of this argument here
I'm automatically also creating a class
property named content in this case so I
will have access to this property later
on and this should be of type string and
that's really also not really
complicated model by any means but it
will be the model I'll use froths
video and with that I can make my
messages here an array of messages like
so and I want to make it an empty array
at the beginning now of course I need to
import my message and I'm doing this
here at the top by importing message
from dot slash message dot model without
the file extension that's important when
using imports and typescript here we
don't specify the file extension now if
that we're almost able to see some
in our HTML page or on our real
application running here so let's work
on that for now I'll simply create a
dummy message here where I'll just write
hello as the content and with that if I
reload my page you see this message now
that doesn't look too nice maybe it
doesn't hurt to enter a horizontal line
here between the button and the messages
yeah looks much better and later on
we'll be able to add random messages by
clicking this button and it should
appear here and of course they should
not only appear here they should also be
stored on the server and fetched from
the server that's a part we haven't
touched on yet but I'll come to that
no worries before I actually start
adding my server-side code I'll first
implement just add semi-colons should be
there I'll first implement my on add
messages on add message method that's
the method I'm calling with this click
handler here on add message so here in
this on add message method I want to
generate a random number between 0 1 and
100 and I can do this by using the
math.random method but this gives me a
number between 0 &amp;amp; 1
and a floating point number 2 &amp;amp; 1 would
be excluded so a lot of things I don't
want so the first step is to multiplied
with 100 so now at least I'm getting
numbers between 1 and 99.99999 almost
there
but I still only want non floating point
numbers so integers for that I'll use
the math.floor function which will
basically always round down the number
so it would give me 0 to 99 and then I
just add +1 to get numbers from 1 to 100
and of course an even quicker way to
write us would be to use my seal here
which will just round it up so then I
get 1 to 100 as
number so that's a random number but not
a random message yet so next I will
create a message and that said a message
should be message a new message of
course and then my random number of plus
and then some string let's say is an
awesome number so the randomness message
will really be more like a random number
and then appending this string to it but
I think you get my point of course you
can generate whatever you want to
generate here or even create an array
with predefined random messages and then
pick one from that array whatever you
like so this is my message and next I
want to push my message on to my message
array here so if I now save this and
then I reload my page and now I click
ran a message well you see I'm adding my
random messages here that looks pretty
good to me so the front-end part is
working and we're almost done if we went
missed a complete back-end part now if
you look at the top
this video has named something like
alert you and noches the note J as part
is really not included unless well the
loading of the page here so time to
actually work on that and store our
messages on the server and get it from
there I'll start by getting rid of the
dummy message here first before I get
that but then it's time to continue and
I'll first implement the well method to
actually add messages because that of
course allows us to see them in a second
step then now for interaction with the
server I'll first create I'm a service
here on the front end in angler 2 and
I'll name it message dot service 30s so
that's the filename and the service
itself should be named message service
of course exported and we need the
injectable decorator here we need that
because I will later on in check angular
choose HTTP service and you can only
inject services into services if the
services into which you want to inject
does have this injectable annotation
otherwise this will not work if you try
to inject a service into a service which
doesn't have the injectable metadata it
won't work so therefore I'm importing
injectable here wonderful so now that's
working I will start by adding a new
method which I call save message and I
expect to get a message of type message
so my own custom message which also
needs to be imported from the message
dot model file therefore and I expect
you well get this in the safe message
method and there I want to reach out to
my server and give this message to the
server so that on the server I can
actually store it in my Mongo database
so with that
timed you go back and work on the server
now as just mentioned I'll use MongoDB
as a database and therefore I expect you
to have it installed and running on your
machine if you don't and you don't know
how to get there in the description of
the video you'll find a link to a video
where I show how to setup MongoDB so
that you're up and running and able to
follow along with that the first step is
to install Mongoose so I'll open up a
new terminal window and that's just a
normal terminal navigated into my
project here by the way
and I will install Mongoose which is
just a third party package making data
interaction between Express and MongoDB
really easy and allow us to work with
data in a very intuitive way and you'll
also find a link to its documentation
and a video on Mongoose in my channel in
the description too so with that I got
Mongoose installed
the first step is in my app touches file
so in the fall which will first get my
request on the server we're on the
server now angler to stand for now I
will import mom us by creating a new
variable and requiring Mongoose here and
as a side note the color for God that
you might want to install it with the
save flag to also add an entry in the
packaged adjacent file which is
important for actually deploying the app
for example so if that Mongoose is
installed it was before and now we're
importing it here in the app touch s
file and next I want to connect to my
database so I can use the Mongoose
connect method for that in here I have
to specify the path to my database now
since I'm running this on my local
server its localhost and then the
question is which port does it run on
well let's have a look this is the
terminal window where my MongoDB service
running and after starting it up you
will see something like this here this
port specification which tells you which
port is occupied by your MongoDB server
in my case and this is the default is
27,000 Oh 17 so I'll enter this here -
seven Oh 17 and then you add a slash and
the name of the database you want to use
now you don't have to create this
database before using it it will be
traded for you so pick whatever name
seems appropriate to you I'll use new
note
angular 2 here so that will be the
database I use draw a project here but
you again choose whatever you want to
choose now we'll connect to Mongoose
we're ready to use it and Mongoose and
I'm not going to go deep into mom who is
here because I really got a video on
that but Mongoose uses models so to work
with data your so you set up a model on
your back-end and you work with the
model to create data to store it to
interact with it and be
seen smoke Mongoose will map this model
to your database will create a
collection based on that model and
whenever you store a variable based on
it model it will actually store an entry
in the database and you can fetch data
from the database through that model too
so this model is really important and
therefore I will create one I'll create
a new folder first on the root level of
my project and I'll name it models now
it's named models but here it will only
hold one
I'll give this file a name of message
shares because it will hold my message
model now in here I'll first import
Mongoose again so require Mongoose and
then I'll need the schema that's a
property Mongoose offers me oops I want
to add a e at the end though and here I
just access the schema property that's
me that you create a schema which again
is something among who is you need in
order to create a model so our model and
Mongoose is based on a schema which is
like a blueprint for the model so that
Mongoose knows how its model should look
like next I will create this blueprint
this schema with the new operator and I
pass a JavaScript object to the
constructor here where I define how this
schema should look like for this message
model I'm setting up here now I want my
message is only to have a content so
I'll give this a key name of content
it's freely totally up to you choose
whatever you want to choose and then I
configure it by passing a chava script
object as a value and here I'll set the
type which should be string uppercase
string that's introduced by Mongoose
here and I also want to make it required
which means you have to set this so
that's the schema not the model however
we do work with the model therefore I'll
do that next I'll set up my model I want
to export that model therefore I'll do
with module exports and that is equal to
Ma newest model and now to dysfunction
here I passed the name of the model and
this is important the convention is to
use uppercase leading character and then
well whatever name you like message in
my case and Mongoose will automatically
create a collection in the Mongo
database based on that model name and it
will always take the lowercase version
of that and PluralEyes it so message
would become messages it will
automatically create a collection
messages for you and then as a second
parameter I passed the scheme on which I
want to base this model so now I got
this message model available to work
with throughout my application which is
of course great because that is what I
need with that time to switch to my
routes file and in here I currently only
got the route to serve my index file my
index page but since we're working on
creating messages I'll also add a post
route slash message for example and here
I'll take my default express middle
aware function to handle this request
and here I then want to create this
message and store it in the database so
for this I'll just create a new variable
which should be new message now here I
want to use the message model I just
created so therefore I have to import
this message from my models folder which
is on a higher level therefore I go up
one folder then the models folder and
then a message fall without file
extension on the back end here - you
don't specify the file extension so now
I'm able to create this new message and
this constructor also takes a JavaScript
object and here of course I'm not
defining how it should look like I did
this in a schema but here I passed the
actual data so I know that my model
expects to have a content so therefore I
provide a content here and once you put
the value of the content well I expect
to get this value with the request so
here I will
is my body since it is a post request
and fetched a content from it and I
expect to have this field available
since we're the ones sending the request
I can make sure that the content field
will be available next I will save my
message by calling the save function and
I could leave like that but I want to
provide a callback to handle any
possible errors this callback takes two
arguments error and result and name them
whatever you want and important thing is
you have two arguments you get back and
then you either get an error or if this
is now you'll probably have a result of
this operation now here I want to handle
the case that we do get an error and in
this case I want to return a response
where the status code is 500 or for 404
or whatever you want to set and then
I'll add a JSON object
where I basically want to say message
error while saving data and of course
you may pass the error object here or
whatever you like so that's really up to
you get some generic error handling here
and again if you want to see a more
elaborate error handling in udemy course
I showed earlier I actually do this and
I will display a modal to the user to
show any possible errors that happened
so that's the error case and in case we
were successful I just want to send to a
one status code for everything okay a
resource was created and then I'll also
append a JSON object where I send let's
say a message with the text saved data
successfully something like that so
that's my post route you create a
message now of course we have to wire
that up to our front end so that's the
next step so back to the message service
here we're currently not doing anything
so time to change this I will need to
reach out to the web so I'll definitely
need a constructor where I want to
inject the angular to HTTP service and
dependency injection of course works
like that now I need to inject us from
the HTTP
module which can be found in the HTTP
package at angular slash HTTP now in
order to be able to use it though I also
need to make a change in my boot dot ts
file here I need to setup the HTTP
providers in my bootstrap methods so I'm
doing this by adding HTTP providers and
also I need to import those from the
angular 2 or at angular HTTP package
here so HTTP providers so if that I can
use HTTP but still I'm not doing that
mat match in my message service here
right so in order to change this I need
to first set up the data I want to pass
with the request because remember on the
back end and my routes file here I try
to extract this content field from the
body sent with the request so I kind of
somehow need to send the content now on
the front end though if I create a new
message like I do here in the app
component remember each new message
based on my model here does have a
content field so somehow I just need to
turn my message object into a string I
can send to my server in able to parse
the data there
well nothing easier than that in my
message service I can create a new body
constant here I'll use the built-in json
stringify method 210 stringify the
message I pass to this save message
method here with that I'm doing what I
just described I take my message object
and I turned it into a JSON string which
has this content field my server will
look for so we're almost there
but I also need to set up some headers
here so new headers that's another
built-in object in angular 2 so I'll
import that too from at angular HTTP and
it expects a JavaScript object in this
constructor or nothing at all if you
don't want to
any headers but here I want you to set
up the content type to tell my server
which content it will receive
application Jason with that I set up the
body and the headers so I'd say I'm
finished or I'm prepared to send a
request now as a matter angler to videos
related to HTTP I will use observables
here therefore and check out those
videos if you if you want to learn more
about that therefore I will here return
this HTTP and then a post method so on
the HTTP service offered Bangalore -
there is this post method and I'm
executing that and this of course as you
probably are aware will give me an
observable to which I can subscribe and
unless I subscribe no request will be
sent so here I'm just configuring the
request therefore and this post method
expects at least two arguments the first
one is to URL and this will be HTTP
localhost since I'm running this node
server on my local host 3000's the
default port setup in the bin www file
and then the slash message route that's
throughout you just created this one
here now with this you are all being set
up I next need to pass data I want to
send and that's of course body so I want
to send my body here I also want to send
some headers so I'll pass a JavaScript
object as deferred argument and here I
specify the headers key but just of
course a kind of built-in key angler to
will look for it and then I pass the
headers while constant I created up here
to set the right headers for this
request with that I'm actually posting
the data and we can try this out if I
restart my server like quitting and
running NPM start again and I reload my
page
well I can't click here and we see them
here but of course we don't see if they
are actually added on the server and
they wouldn't be because we're not
subscribing to this room
we're only setting this up but this
isn't observable we have to subscribe to
actually send the request it's in order
to do this I will go to my app component
and then here in the on add message
method after pushing it on my local
messages array I will reach out to my
message service but I haven't I can't
access it here right now well I need to
inject it of course so I'll add a
constructor and set up my private
message services property or message
service property and then message
service the service I just created also
add the import to slash message dot
service without the file extension now
in order to make it work and consult my
videos or other tutorials on dependency
injection in angler to I also need to
add the providers metadata here I'm
telling angler to hey this component
will need this message service can you
take care about finding out how to
create it and then hang on to knows okay
I need to be able to create the service
and once it encounters this line here it
is able to create it and give it to me
and therefore I got this message service
available here and I can now call the
save message method and pass this
message I create right here now still
nothing would happen because I haven't
subscribed to it yet so let's do this
next I'll call subscribe on it and just
to make it clear we can't also specify
that we will return and observable here
just to make this 100 persecuted you
don't have to do this it's just a good
practice to well be explicit with the
types you're returning of course in this
case I also need to import observables
from in this case rxjs observable and
then yeah I need the observable here so
as a chest said this is an optional step
I'm just being explicit here so back in
the app component I'm subscribing to it
and now in the success case so in the
case first
sass fall well here all I want to do is
I simply want to log out success to see
that it seemed to work on the server in
the error case I will instead
well lock this error to the console and
with that if I now reload this page
again and I open by developer tools to
see my console let's see what happens if
I click new ran the message I see
success so it looks like it works and we
can even verify this if you go back to
the terminal and you open up a new one
keep the server running navigate into
your MongoDB folder and in there go into
your bin folder where you started your
server and run your Mongo database now
use your database you setup in your app
chess fowl node angular 2 in my case
that's the database that was created for
you so no danglers you in my case here
and then you may access the messages
collection remember I said mom whose
would create this collection
automatically based on your model name
and execute the find method and indeed
you see that we have three messages in
there with 92 131 which are exactly the
numbers you see here so that's great
storing the data on the server actually
works now of course the problem is if we
reload the page here everything is gone
so even though it's stored on a server
we're currently not fetching it so let's
finish this app by actually adding this
functionality as well a good point to
start implementing this of course is on
the backend so I'll go to my app chess
file and above the post route where I
actually create a new message I'll add a
navigate route to slash messages plural
because I'm fetching multiple messages
here at least potentially and of course
here I'll have my default express mail
aware function and then here you will
see through note excuse me from Mongoose
it's really easy to fetch data
I can use my model like a class of
static methods here so the small I'm
importing here at the top and then I can
use the find method and find allows me
to specify some conditions or criteria
by which I want to find it now here I
want to find all messages so I don't
need to specify anything I can directly
pass the callback function I want to
execute once I got data this callback
function also takes two arguments the
first one is in potential error at the
second one you can name it whatever you
like that goes for both arguments of
course is or will be the messages I
retrieved so here I will first check if
we got an error and in case we did I
will actually just copy this error
handling from the post route so your I
will just say error while fetching data
some generic error handling or very
simple error handling here but if we're
successful I want to set my status to
200 and I want to send back a JSON
object and now this is of course
important here I want to set a data
field which actually holds the messages
I got from my database and you can name
this field whatever you like you can
name it massachusett Evac lear
distinction to messages here and message
here and so on so now I'm returning the
messages that I've fetched in the
database if I haven't got an error in
which case I would return this response
and the return keyword here is important
by the way if I would not have it
I would generate my response but then
continue execution and generate another
response which is not what I want
so therefore have returned here but you
don't need it here since no code is
executed after this line so of this I'm
actually sending back T objects I got
from the server
or from the database and now I need to
handle them
front end so I go to my message service
again and here I'll create a new method
which I'll call get messages and this
will also give me an observable wrapping
any object the same is true down here
and that's all as I said optional so
what I want to return here is using the
angler to HTTP service executing the get
method and observable configured frutos
now that method to get method only
expects one argument it's of course the
URL to the resource I want to get so
here localhost 3000 and then slash
messages is the route we set up here in
the app touch as file this one now
that's fine and what would this give me
well actually it would give me some JSON
the one I'm returning here but messages
here will not be an array and the form I
want to use it in my front end it will
be the data I get back from the database
and it will of course also include the
content of the messages but also the IDS
of the database entry and so on so a lot
of stuff I don't need and therefore I
need to transform the data I get back
the cool thing about observables is they
have a lot of operators we can use and
one cool operator is the map operator
which allows me to transform values in
order to be able to use this I need to
add an import here which is just rxjs
/rx
and that simply unlocks all those
observable operators to be used now it's
red because my ID has some problems
finding that but it is available and
with the map operator I can they it
basically take the data I get back from
this observable do something with it and
return a new observable with that
transformed data so put in easier words
it allows me to transforms the data I
get back from this request so therefore
I'll use a fat arrow function here to
work with that and to
work with the data I get and to specify
the logic by which I want to transfer it
so or transform not transfer so I want
to create a constant here and I'll just
name this extracted name it whatever you
like and here I will use the data and
run the JS method on it I can do this
because this data here behind the scenes
is of type response which is a
JavaScript interface basically I can
import from the HTTP package which has a
Jason method available which just means
this response of course also has to stay
this code and so on I don't need that
just give me the body of the response
the data of the response and that not
only give me that data also immediately
transformed it into a JavaScript object
so that's a huge important first step
only with that single line we're leaving
out all the stuff we don't need status
code and so on we're just getting the
data as a JavaScript object but still
this data also has some stuff we don't
need like database IDs and so on so in
order to fix this I'll next create a
helper array on a mat message array and
this should just be an empty array at
the beginning an empty array of messages
of course and then I'll create a message
here this variable and next I want to
loop through all my elements in my
extract data but here in the data field
now what is this data field well if you
remember our routes here data is the
name I specified here data and if you
redemptor stew messages or if you net
renamed this to anything else then you
also have to rename it here but in my
case it's called data and now I'm
looping through all the entries in this
data so through all the messages with
all the stuff they got attached I don't
need and all I do here is then I will
take my message variable I created up
here and assign it to a new message
in each iteration where I only extract
the content so each element here in this
data field also has an ID and so on and
I only extract the content now it's read
here because it doesn't know that
content will be available but I know and
then I want to push it on to my message
array and in the end I will of course
return this message array because
remember map simply transforms to data
here I'm setting up the logic by which I
want to transform it and in the end of
course I have to return the transformed
data
I've arise otherwise nothing is
available so that's to get messages
function time to use it in our app
component of course I want to fetch
messages right when the uploads and I
could do this in a constructor but it is
a good practice to not do any heavy
lifting or HTTP calls in a constructor
for example for testing reasons where
it's better to control through angular 2
if you do it in another place now what
is this other place
it's the on init lifecycle hook
implements on in it is to code I need to
add to my class here and this basically
tells angular 2 and typescript that I
want to use an interface the on init
interface which I do need to import from
at angular core and this interface
requires me to implement a certain
method the ng on init method to be
precise now this ng on init method will
get executed automatically as long as I
implement this interface here by angular
2 whenever it creates this component so
when I load the app it creates a
component it will execute this method
automatically and so since I want to
load everything up one startup this is
the perfect place to whoops to actually
fetch the data so I will do this by
using my message service again
and then here I call the get messages
method and remember dis returns me an
observable so I have to subscribe to it
to actually get something and to
actually send the request in the first
place and here in the success case I get
back some messages and I will use those
messages to assign them to my local
messages property here so to dis
messages array this will then be set
equal to the messages I got back from
the server and I will also handle a
potential error case by simply logging
it to the console for now okay so let's
see if this works I'll first restart my
server since I did some or made some
changes there too and then I'll restart
my app here while you reloading it well
we almost got it we see three entries so
we got three objects that is good to
service I kill it seems to work but
somehow we fail to extract the content
let's see what went wrong it's a tiny
thing this shouldn't be a lat
a4 in a loop it should be a for off loop
so I should loop through all the
elements in this array and not try to
loop through any keys and some kind of
object so now if I save this I don't
need to restart my server if I reload
this page now this looks much better and
if I add new random numbers and reload
again they're still there because
they're still stored on the server so I
think even though we only have a very
basic app here you're still able to see
how easy and fun it is to connect no
chairs with angular 2 now of course
there are different ways to connect it
you could also run angular 2 or serve
angular 2 from a different server that's
just a setup here with which I went and
of course there are a lot of things how
you could extend this app you could make
messages edible editable or deletable or
anything else you can sort them on the
server they're really quite a lot of
abilities and again just a quick note if
you want to dive into this deeper check
