homestead set up it's time to learn how
to work with it I'll start with the
configuration file again so in this
hidden homestead folder here I'll open
up this Yama file and here what we
already had a look at it in the last
video most of this configuration is
pretty straightforward we got our IP
address at the top we can configure the
resources this virtual machine should
have the provider if you're using
VirtualBox or VMware then all these keys
in this authorization stuff should work
this basically points towards your SSH
keys folder this hidden folder and we'll
make sure that can easily connect to
your virtual machine for SSH and if you
should have problems there this might
stem from multiple sources to be honest
and bestest to Google for larval
homestead with your operating system and
then as such a key problem or something
like this and you will probably find a
lot of solutions to possible problems
here however this should not need any
changes by default now the folders and
sites keys I talked about them in the
last video and this allows you to well
map certain folders to be shared on your
waivered machine and here I follow the
approach where I have my root folder
mapped to a root folder on my machine
now of course I could map multiple
folders here and have each of my
projects being mapped to a different
let's say project folder on my way grant
machine or on my worship box but I don't
like this I will like this root project
setup but you may choose whichever Pro
approach works for you
now on sites we then make sure that we
can access our projects from our local
browser and we do this by mapping
basically the URL here to
to our
paft or public folder of the specific
project we want to access through this
URL so important this path here is to be
seen on our virtual machine so not our
path on our local machine but the path
on the virtual machine and therefore
this target here this - path always has
to be included here of course since this
is what we start on the virtual machine
and then this path is derived from your
local machine since they're local and
virtual machine are equal since this is
exactly what we shown here the last
configuration here allows us to define
which databases we want vagrant to set
up when starting this new box and by
default the only have one homestead now
we may add additional ones here but keep
in mind those databases will be empty at
the beginning but with full arable
migrations you can of course quickly get
them into the state where you want them
to have and as I said this configuration
here easily allows you to add either an
our database if I could type like this
now they commented out stuff your
doesn't need changes most of the time so
I well we'll leave this out for now
these are more advanced settings and I
have never changed them before to be
honest so save this closest file the ste
configuration we have here I explained
before that we have a possibility of
shutting down our virtual machine and
we'll have a grant we can do this with
two ways with vagrant destroy we will
actually do what the name implies
destroy the machine which means we can
easily start up a new one but all the
data on a machine for example in the
database will be lost the new one though
will ask this is the main idea of
vagrant have the exact same
configuration as the old one the
configuration of this homestead box and
our config file if we want to keep the
data around but still want to free up
some resources for example
we may use vagrant halt to hold our
regime this will not destroy it today
they will persist but it is well shut
down or paused we can in both cases
bring up the well paused or a new
machine with vagrant up and it will
automatically decide what to do as it
knows if machine was halted or destroyed
just that you know how to manage your
machines in my homestead folder where I
ran wakened up I can SSH into the
virtual machine by running vagrant SSH
and with assets a SS aging into it I
mean that I'm now in my command line
inside this virtual machine so all the
commands I run here are not run on my
local computer but inside the virtual
machine why is this important because
for example it's very important when
running our PHP artisan commands
especially the database related ones
since those commands need access to the
database we have to run them on the
virtual machine since there is the place
where our database links it's not our
local machine therefore for example PHP
artisan migrate won't work on our local
machine since it will try to migrate
this file into our local my sequel
database which we probably don't have or
have not set up the way we need it
therefore for this to work correctly we
have to run such commands on the virtual
machine now once I assets SS aged into
this let's see where we are we're right
at the root level where we have this
code folder remember that's the folder
where we mapped our local files to so
let's have a look into this folder there
you see exactly the same folder
structure as I have here in this PHP
folder
I got projects tutorials homestead and
these are the free forces and fullness I
have here if I go into tutorials and on
YouTube you can see I have my neural
basics folder here and inside as level
basics folder
I could now run my PHP artisan commands
like I would on my local machine if I
were developing there of course you have
to be in the project folder in the
specific project but of course you also
have to be on your local machine for
this to work this is really important to
keep in mind as you will get quite
strange errors mostly saying that they
can't connect database if you try to run
database related commands on your local
machine just stressing this because
these are errors everyone will have
experienced because you both did not
think about it did not realize he's not
in the local or an individual machine
but only local machine and therefore
this is a key error source and I want to
point this out now with this clear I
will exit just but having exits I'm back
on my local machine Oh in the terminal
and now I can run vagrant destroy but
before I do this I want to show you how
you can access your virtual machine
database from your local machine now I
find use sequel Pro for this but you may
use whichever tool you want and well I
already got it set up here but basically
how you connect us you choose standard
here not SSH standard because Lerman
hopes that well automatically forward
supports so that you can access them
from your local machine easily one of
these ports is this port 30 30 3060 this
is the database port and therefore on
our local machine we may just access our
well localhost the homestead is host as
a default user of database arm on your
homestead machine your virtual machine
and the password will be secret all
lowercase now if we click connect you
see we're right inside and here is the
home state database that is
automatically generated because it is
set up this way
the homestead llamó file so this is how
you can quickly connect to your database
from your localhost
just because level homes that
automatically forward some ports and
this is really the key configuration or
usage part I want to talk about I
strongly recommend the official
documentation here for more information
about how to configure certain things
and what the different configuration
keys in the home study mo file mean but
I think what this you should be good to
go and you should be able to set this up
and use it as your day-to-day
development environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
