we protect our outs and now we did all
the things we have to do to be able to
log in and to access this restricted
area so to say now what we will do in
this video will be pure HTML and styling
because we will create our dashboard
view so to say if you where we can
create a post and see all posts now if
you're not interested in that well feel
free to skip this video in the next that
you will continue with hooking up some
logic to actually be able to create
posts let's dive into this so currently
our dashboard looks like this not too
exciting I have to say let's change this
I'll start with the HTML part and I'll
start with extending from our layouts
master file so that the dashboard like
to welcome to desk uses our master file
and this kind of we have the header at
the top and so on style so to do this I
first extend then I create my content
section here remember this will be
whatever I write between those two
section expressions here will be what
will get injected here
so oops one file so now what I'm going
to do here is I'll create two sections
on HTML tag section which will give
class row for our bootstrap framework
and our class of new post which I will
manually style now in the section I will
have a bootstrap column and I will add
some offset so that it is centered now
this will be the new post section ste
CSS class implies and what I'm doing
here is
I'll add a header address so not only
for navigation and in this header I'll
have an h3 tag where I say what do you
have to say and then I want to add a
four
I'll leave the action empty as of now
and here I'll add a form group again
this is a bootstrap class which will
just format my four nicely and I will
add a text area which it will give a
name of new post idea of new post we
need two columns but I will set it to
five rows and I'll add a placeholder
where I say your post so that's my text
area and I also will give this text area
class of form control so that bootstrap
formats it's not formatted nicely now
below my form group div I'll add a
button of type submit' which I will give
a class button mount and by primary so
that it is nice blue button and I will
just give it a label of create post so
that will be my new post arm section and
if I load this it's gonna look okay
because we're mostly using bootstrap
classes so this will be how we create
new posts now below my new post section
I'll add an hour sexual firstly all to
be around
bootstrap row exactly which will get the
posts class which I will also manually
style or use in my own CSS file now in
here I want to loop through all the
posts and output them now obviously we
don't have any posts as of now we don't
even have database so I'm just going to
create some dummy HTML code here which
will be first again my bootstrap columns
so just to have the nice styling here
out of the box then again a header where
I say whatever P people say and then
here I want to have an article for each
post which I will give a class of post
so when we loop through all our posts
what we will do is we will create this
block for each
host we find so this will be our dummy's
skeleton for each post what we're
creating here and there should be a
paragraph with some dummy text for now
this will be the actual blog post text
or post text in the full application
obviously and below this text I'll have
a div with a class of info where I will
say post by then this will be the offer
which we would also retrieve from the
database for now just using my name here
on and then they do it would also be
retrieved from the database then I'll
add another div which of a call or which
will give a CSS class of interaction and
here I will have various interaction
methods or possibilities now I'm first
going to list them all divided by this
pipe symbol here so we will have a like
and a dislike and we'll have the
possibility to added our post oops and
the possibility to delete it now
obviously when we're looping through
this we'll have to check if this is our
post or not because if it's our post
then we should not be able to like or
dislike it but to be able to edit and
delete it but if it's supposed if
another person we want to make sure that
we can only like it dislike it and not
mess around with it right so that's
that's that and now let me just copy
this article here and paste it one more
times good we have to dummy posts here
and now if I reload this page you see
yeah that doesn't look too nice in
Wiseman's in dirt
oh I misspelled to this class here off
set free so so that term that could use
some additional styling I guess but you
see the Kitchener ol idea how our post
should look like now let me add some
styling I will
for this go into my public folder here
and I'll create a new subdirectory which
we'll call source and in this
subdirectory
I'll trade an additional user directory
called CSS this is where where I will
store my CSS files now here I will
create a new CSS file which we'll call
main dot CSS in this file I only want
you to some additional styling too much
first I'll start my new post section of
it that will give it some additional
padding from top and bottom and I will
give it a little border at the bottom so
that we have a clearer separation to
your posts area then the header in our
new post section as well as the header
in our post section should have a margin
bottom of 20 pixels just to set it a
little bit more apart from the content
below it then I will in my post section
format my post article such that I give
it a little bit of padding to the left
to kind of if we look here to indent it
a bit into the right and I will give it
a nice little visual sugar here by
adding a border where I picked a nice
red dark red and which will appear on
the left of the post and just add some
margin to the bottom sit to the next
post three pixels and last thing is that
info bar here I want to forward that too
so I'll select it by yet just going into
the info deaf in my post article in my
posts section and here I want to first
give it some dark grey color and I will
make it italic okay so now to be able to
actually see these changes I have to
import the style sheet and now this is a
bit
you're not very tricky but you have to
know how to do it right I could use like
the direct path year so I could use
source CSS main CSS but this would be or
would lead to possible problems because
well in wearable application when we use
our router
we can have URLs which not actually
reflect the real directory structure
light right like here for example where
we have slash dashboard now if you were
to look for source yes as main CSS in
this folder it would not work because
that is not a folder that is chest out
of the URL and how we styled so to get
an absolute reference URL file i will
use allowable helper here so I'll enter
my plate expression here with the double
curly braces and then I'll use the URL
fade and here the two method and now I
can specify the path as if I always were
in the public folder here so I'm routing
out to source yes as the main dot CSS
now if you do have problems with it to
here in which sometimes can cure
depending on your development
environment well you could also use the
URL secure method which which just
enforce HTTP or you could use the assets
howcome method and then specify the path
here now in this case I'm using this and
this should work in most of the cases so
let me reload reload this page now as
you can see it's much nicer looking now
we get this border here beautiful and
our posts are much more nice to look at
right now so that is just the styling
the visual part in the next with you
will take care about actually being able
to create posts see you there fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
