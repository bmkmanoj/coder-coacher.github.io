data and learned what props are both
very important concepts of course now
with that we're ready to take the next
step and learn what events are or you
probably know what events are but how to
use events in our react.js application
so I'll go back to this home component
and in here I'm actually going to clean
this up a little bit so I'm going to get
rid of children and user going to get
rid of all of that stuff you just leave
the other props name in each year and
I'm also going to getting rid of the
text here therefore of course in the
next chance file I'm getting rid of my
off the well content between the opening
closing tag as well as the opening
closing tag as well getting rid of the
user object and deleting user object
here too just to clean this up a little
bit so that should still work it looks a
bit leaner now next in my home component
I want to create a button so I will
trade a horizontal line below that I'll
add a button on which I want to say make
me older now I already do have my age
here and I want to be able to increase
that age right so here I want to do
something whenever I click this button
but first I'll add some butch foot
classes here with class name button
primary and then well it would be nice
if we had some method we could execute
whenever this button gets clicked so I
will create such a method and I will
call it on make older so on make older
should get executed whenever this button
gets cold and then I want to increase my
age but how could I access to my age in
the first place it's new properties here
right well it would be a nice idea to
save the age in a property of this class
so not in this props property we're
getting past from outside but remember
we're using classes here we can create
properties therefore so I'll create a
constructor function again that's all es
six staff if that is all new to you
definitely check out some es6 tutorials
and here first thing of course I have to
do is call super to execute the parent
constructors since I'm inheriting from
reactive component and thereafter I'm
creating a new property named age with
this dot H and as set is equal to well
in the constructor we actually get the
props passed into it so here I can then
access props H so this is the age I get
passed into this component from outside
and this is my property I create inside
of the home component now I have access
to this age and that I can make myself
older let's say we add three years to
the age when I click this button with
that ike of course can also change my
output here here i can that output this
dot age right like so your age is this
dot h now if we're safe this we see
twenty seven stole the button won't work
because we haven't hooked it up yet but
we see that the extraction of the
properties and he's saving in our own
property works fine so I'm saving it in
this age and I'm outputting this age in
my well HTML code here in my template so
Tuesday the last step is to hook at this
button and I can add a click listener by
adding on click now that just is how you
add events in react is you have the
event name and then just the on at the
beginning so it's like the well default
HTML or excuse me default JavaScript
event handlers on click and then here
you specify what you want to do upon a
click of course I want to execute on
make older but if we were to write it
like this that would be wrong I need to
delete the parentheses otherwise I will
cuted immediately because again keep in
mind this is javascript code here if I
do this I execute it but I just want to
place a reference to the functions
function which should get executed
whenever I click on it therefore I
remove the parentheses now it's not
getting executed instantly instead the
button now knows so to say what to do if
we click on it then it will execute it
however that won't work as you will see
if I save this and click on make me
older nothing happens and in the console
we see cannot read property age of null
whenever I click this well why do we get
this error what's going wrong here do
you know what's happening here well good
job if you figured out the issue is that
we're binding it here or resetting the
onclicklistener here this on make older
will get executed now have a look at on
make older there we're accessing disk
and what's the issue with this keyword
in JavaScript it's always referring to
whatever executes a function it's not
referring to my home class not to the
object here it's referring to what is
executing this method and here the
button is executing this method
therefore in order to make sure that
this refers to the home object to the
home class I have to bind this so I add
bind and then this this makes sure that
we're actually using this in the class
context here by the way and never
possible syntax remember this one here
would have been to use a es6 arrow
function so to do this say execute this
function here and then here we will just
return this start on make older without
parenthesis
with parentheses here so we would
execute that's a funkier keep in mind
that that is just how I es6 arrow
function looks so this function would
get executed immediately and it would
return this on make older this function
call which would then also use this age
so if I save this and now click on it we
still see nothing happening but if we
reload we see we don't get an error so
maybe we see something if I log the Kurd
age to the console to trace down what's
going wrong so let's save this and click
on it well as you can see on the right
the H is getting incremented correctly
it's increasing but it's not updated
here and that is because the state of
the application hasn't changed and
react.js will only rerender if the state
has changed now what is this state and
how do we tell we actually asked that
the state changed that something we're
going to have a look at in the next
