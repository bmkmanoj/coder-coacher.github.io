finished our input summary sheet which
includes all the data we have now it's
time to create the analysis part to
retrieve all the data we actually need
now before we start let's take a look at
these formulas and functions we will use
to create that analysis sheet now we
will use t if formula the index match
and index match match formulas we will
also use these some product formulas
with multiple conditions and I will
explain to you what the dashes regime in
this formulas will also be combined with
a left or right formula in addition to
that we will talk about basic eric
formulas d transpose formula further we
will talk about how to combine cells and
how to create some nice data lists now
this is a lot of information right so I
decided to split that analysis sheet
serious into two parts in the first part
this video we will only talk about the
if formula about the index match formula
and how to combine that with left or
right and about how to combine cells in
the second video we will talk about the
other formulas and by that finish the
analysis sheet now that we know what
formulas and functions we are going to
use let's take a look at what we
actually want to do so we want to create
analysis tables this means that we want
to retrieve the information that we
actually need in the format that we want
so this means we want the first table in
this way this means you want a list of
the countries and the statistics by the
different periods and we want a
comparable table for the regions so all
the regions of America Asia and so on
and the periods and the statistics
should be retrieved as follows we want
to be able to select the statistic that
we want to be displayed right here like
this and this should be something like a
list where we can select the statistic
that we want so this is the final goal
of those videos so those two parts let's
start and see what we have to do to
achieve our goals right here
so I'm back in the input summary sheet
we created in the last video just to
remind you we have statistics for
different periods right here and we have
a unique list of all the countries we
have statistics for we have that list of
countries three times so for the first
period for the second period and for the
third period but the list of countries
is always equal that's important to know
now let's go back to the beginning and
think about what else you might have to
add to be able to create that analysis
tables the way we want them to be the
problem at the moment is the
identification of the country if you
would look for a country in Colombia
this would not be unique because we have
all the countries three times now if you
want to identify each country you need
to create something like an identifier
and as we have each country for each
period only once a good identifier would
be a combination of the period end of
the country name or the country at E as
you prefer let's create something like
that so the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to add a column so I select
column B and press ctrl-v like this
let's increase the column with a little
bit and right i dint identifier because
that's what it's going to be so as we
said we want to create that identifier
based on the period and the country ID
now we talked about that a little bit in
the last video and that we can combine
cells with an N symbol this is what we
need right here let's see how this works
so I'm writing equals select the period
right end now we need to define how
these two cells are separated so we need
a quotation mark and space maybe second
quotation mark and now we have to write
the second end and select the country ID
like this if we now press Enter you see
that we basically have what we want so
the period and the contrary but if we
copy that formula down now then this
doesn't work because the cell that
identifies the period is empty now of
course we could
copy down that period but I don't want
to change column a to be honest so the
only thing I want to work on now is
colombi so we need another solution
let's see how we can find that solution
by working on the result in column
before so the one which are selected so
we need to build a condition this means
if that cell would be empty then it
should retrieve the period from the
previous row right here this is not
totally correct and we have to adjust
this further problem but it would be a
first step let's see how we could do
this so I'll select the formula and
right if and now if a 4 is empty right
if there is nothing in it the way we
have is right here then the value of the
previous row like this should be
retrieved if this is false so if this
cell here is not empty well then simply
retrieve that value from that cell let's
now close the it formula and you see
what happens yeah we are getting closer
but we have one problem at the moment we
retrieve the entire value of the
previous row so we have the period and
the country ID so we should get rid of
that country ID in that formula and we
could do that by adding a left formula
to that existing formula because the
left formula allows us to retrieve a
defined number of characters of that
previous value in cell that we can see
right here so let's add that left
formula so we are fine with that but the
only problem is that if that cell is
empty it should not retrieve be free but
left be free yes but only the first what
is it generated to 16 10 characters like
this let's close the left formula and if
that is not true to say for I think this
should work now let's try that
now this result is exactly what we want
to have if a 4 is empty then give us
back the first 10 characters of the
previous row so actually only the period
and if a 4 is not empty well then give
me a four and combined that result with
the country ID this is great so we can
now press Enter go to the last cell
right here press left press shift ctrl
and the up arrow key and press ctrl down
and now we see that we created our
unique identifier which is defined as
the period and the country ID now it's
time to create the analyzer sheet right
so let's do that by pressing + right
here dragging that sheet to the left
double-clicking it to rename it to
analysis maybe and we actually have
already the first two columns because we
need the identifier to identify the
statistic or the country the period and
the corresponding statistic and we have
that country name and you remember we
want to build a table that includes the
country name so let's copy that first
two columns into that analysis sheet so
i select this and that press ctrl shift
ended on arrow key press ctrl v go back
to analysis sheet and now press ctrl alt
we we learn the shortcut in the last
videos and press paste link now let's
select both columns double-click that
line to increase the column width this
looks good for the moment but the next
thing we need is the region because we
want to have one table with the
countries and one table with the
region's let's write region's first like
this and we have that regions already
right because you remember in the first
video we imported the input data and a
country sheet with some country codes
let's take a look at that this is that
sheet that we imported and in the first
column we have those region or continent
codes you can call that as you prefer
for Asia Europe
one in the second column we have that
country codes so that codes we just
imported from the input summary sheet so
we now need to match and that's we're
going to do the country codes we have in
the analysis sheet with the country
codes right here and retrieve the result
from column a and we also did that in
one of the previous videos we simply
need to create an index match formula
now I explained to you why it's called
index match and why I start writing
match first because the match part is
the one that identifies the country ID
in that case and the index part is the
one that retrieves the result so the
regional code so that's why we start
writing match so I'm writing match like
this and we want to match that no we
don't want to match that right we only
want to match the right two characters
so this is kind of the same logic we
just had in the input sheet but for the
right side now well then let's do that
let's write right formula like this so
we want to have the right two characters
so the country ID can close that and we
want to match that country ID with the
country ID in column B of the country
sheet like this so we can now write
comma and we want to add an exact match
actually I'm just confuse because we
forgot one bracket right here let's do
it like this now the formulas fine
that's important you have to be careful
about where to put the brackets of
course but now it's working so we get
the match part and now we know that the
index so the actual part that retrieves
the results has to be placed before that
match part like this so I'm writing
index pressing tab and selecting the
first column like this so in all right a
comma press ENTER once and twice and we
see that we retrieved the corresponding
region to the country so us that's North
American
let's now press f2 and see what
references we have to fix so where we
have to make sure that the reference
doesn't change if we copy the formula
down or to the right now the index well
we can fix that we will not copy that
formula probably but just to make sure
let's success because that should always
be the first column of the country she'd
with the original codes the match part
so do you write section right here here
we should fix the column because if we
copy the formula down it is allowed to
change if we copy the formula to the
right it should not change so let's
press f4 three times like this and let's
press f4 once right here to also fix
column B in the country sheet if in our
press Enter select the last cell that
contains the value right here with
simply control and the down arrow key go
to the right press shift ctrl and the up
arrow key and press ctrl down then we
have our overview bioregions this is
great now we need one more thing
actually to then be able to create the
tables as the next step we have the
country names we have the region's we
have two periods in the identifier and
we need the statistics so the statistics
should be displayed right here and we
should be able to now create a list
where we can select the statistic that
we want and that should be displayed
then right here for the corresponding
period of the corresponding country now
we will learn how we can do this and
what functions and formulas we need for
the purpose in the next part of that
analysis sheet video series thanks for
watching hope to see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
