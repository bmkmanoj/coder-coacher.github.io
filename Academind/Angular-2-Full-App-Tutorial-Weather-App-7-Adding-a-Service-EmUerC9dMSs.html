our app until now we're well having our
list here and we're getting this data
from our Weber data file here it's time
to add a little bit more dynamic to the
school application and I will start by
introducing a service which will do our
data handling and which will be later
extend to reach out to an actual restful
application to fetch the validator so
first let me create the service and this
web will pull the reader and I will just
call it Weber done service stop TS and
again this is naming convention where
you want to describe what's inside this
file next and I don't want to compile
thank you
next I will then export this class here
exported class weather service and I
will make it injectable because later on
we will need access to http inside here
now if you're not familiar with angular
2 services here's a quick wrap-up but I
wouldn't recommend you have a look at my
other videos on this channel
angular 2 services allow us to have
centralized places in our application
which you may access from all our
components or directives or basically
all our classes and which handles
certain things which will need to be
accessible from several places so for
example this service will later on go
out to the internet and fetch the data
we don't want to do this in a component
because this is not really great
practice we want to outsource this no
service because you might have several
places in our app where we needed
functionality there for services are a
great place to centralize such things
now regarding the annotations in Chaplin
injectable annotation here a module has
a great dependency injection framework
built in this means that and you will
see this in this video we can define in
classes in a constructor which objects
we need for this class work correctly
and ever two will automatically yet find
out how to create this class and create
an instance of this class and pass this
to some constructor it is called
dependency injection by providing the
dependencies where we need them and such
a service is something you want to
inject now to be honest that is not why
we need this injectable annotation here
even though it might look like this will
allow us to in check the service but
actually you would be able to inject it
even without sanitation
we need this them to be able to inject
something into this service because
injecting service into services is
possible but only if we act this
annotation or any metadata that is how
English works when we check something
like a component we don't need added two
injectable because we already have at
component so that's the theory in a real
quickly sent up wait if you feel like
well I haven't understand a bit that's
okay I have specific videos in my on
this channel in my new playlist where a
develop deeper into this and explain how
this in dependency injection works and
also how you can control how many
instances of an object you have so that
let me check this out you will find
links in the description of course so
this is my weather service and at the
moment I won't implement the HTTP punch
out yet but I will treat a new method
here get weather items and this method
should be responsible for well doing
this fetching our
items so all this will do here is it
will return our Weber items we have set
up an hour whether the data pod so this
is basically exactly the same as we're
doing here now you might ask where do we
create a separate service words again as
I said to centralize functionalities
do not repeat yourself and also you
might change the way you get Weber items
imagine you're using this in three
different components and you want to
replace the code in each of them
therefore it is a good practice to store
this in one central place this classroom
in this way at this example
so back in my world were less component
where I am actually doing this manually
at the moment what I will do here is I
will add a constructor and it is
constructor I will say that I want to
create a new private property which will
be accessible in this complete class
here this is just a shortcut to create a
field for a class in typescript and I
forgive to us feel the name of let's say
whether is serviced is totally up to you
and then I will specify the disability
service now that is not optional this is
important this starting with you that we
need an object of type Weber service for
this class to work correctly now the
constructor is of course co-op angle to
be causing that you creates our
components and as that dependency
injection will make sure that we receive
such an object you then what I can do
here is we can access this private
property we created and here to get
Weber items method and this will get us
more liberal writers if we have a look
at our application you will see that it
is broken why is that well because we
tell about you we want an object of type
weather service but at the moment unless
who does not know how to create such an
option
in order to tell English you what I need
to do is I need to add a new metadata to
this component here the providers
configuration here and thus will be
married just as to the directors where I
you find all the providers this
component or this collapse needs and
providers are simply chest while the
types of the objects I want to inject so
in this case Webber service and make
sure to have this capital case at the
beginning also make sure because it's
done automatically for me here to add
the import to discover service to your
Webber delivers better service fun in
created here this will now and we can
already see the solute load allowed us
app to work correctly this is how we use
services name let you in a very quick
way here of course and does two basic
service we will use for artists add
later on of course to also reach out to
the internet and fetch real butter data
see you in the next videos why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
