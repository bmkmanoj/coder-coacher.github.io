on board you're already seeing this
stream diagram where we can depict how
an observable emits values and how we
use these values in an observer
something I had a closer look at in this
video here now that's great but the even
better thing about observables
besides the nice structure is that they
have this funnel-like approach where we
can pass the values which are emitted
through as many operators as we want
before they finally reach the observer
so you might have our first operator
maybe the map operator which will simply
turn our values and you transform values
the logic for the transformation lives
in the map function then so maybe we
transform a number to a string object
into a simpler object or whatever we
need
now these transform values could again
reach the next function now but maybe we
want to chain another operator really
using that funnel-like approach what we
can do that maybe we have to throttle
time operator which make sure that no
more then one value can reach the next
function per well window-frame here so
for two thousands in this case so the
first value here would reach next but
the second one what maybe because not
enough time passed between the two
values maybe here two seconds were
passed to dip path since the last value
so this value will make it the next
value won't but maybe now we again have
more than two seconds in between so that
value might also make it this is my
operators are great in the end in the
next function we know exactly what we'll
get because we did change these
operators but we can ensure that we only
get what we want to get by transforming
and controlling the values just as we
need it let's see this in an example now
I'm on jsfiddle here I added a script
import using the rxjs CDN link which you
can get on the install it page on
reactive X of I o /r X chairs at the
very bottom this link remove
at version and hit enter to get the
latest version and then just bad link
now that's all what I'm starting with
and now I want to create a simple
observable because in this with you I
don't want to focus on the observable I
want to focus on the operators so the
observable I will use here is or the way
of creating observable it's chosen from
the list of methods we have for creating
new observables quite a lot I use create
in another video now I want to use
interval this one here now interval will
simply emit a new value every X
milliseconds with X being passed as an
argument so I can simply say wire
observable of course you could choose a
different name is rx observable and then
interval and I will pass one year or
1000 to be precise so one second that we
get a new value every second now what
value do we get simply an ascending
number of integers so 1 2 3 and so on
some of the incrementing numbers that's
the observable now I want to subscribe
to that and I'll create an observer for
this and that observer here is simply as
we learned in an average it you just a
JavaScript object and we can implement
next error or complete this specific
observable here we'll never complete it
will run infinitely and it will never
throw an error so I can just implement
it next method here I know that in the
next method I do get the value and I
simply want to lock the value so what I
can do with these two pieces defined is
I can now use the observable called
SUBSCRIBE method which is provided by
the rxjs package and pass my observer
and with the console being open if I now
hit control enter we see 0 1 2 and this
keeps on increasing every second and it
won't stop now that is my observable
setup here now let's use operators we
change these operators before calling
subscribe so I will move subscribe to a
new line but still call it on well
whatever else a chain here and the first
thing I want to change actually is
map we saw that on the slide before and
map transforms the value the observable
emits actually map will give us back a
new observable but this observable will
holds the transformed L data why does it
give us back a new observable it has to
because subscribe in the end and we can
only call subscribe on observables so
map takes a function as an argument this
function will hold the logic we use for
transforming the value so here we know
we get the value because that is what we
plan on changing that was what our x
chairs will give us here and in the body
we may do whatever we wanted you with
that value and then call subscribe on
what we return in the end so here I
could simply return value times 2 and I
simply return the number here so that
will be an integer but again rxjs will
automatically create a new observable
which emits this transformed number as a
value so that subscribe will work with
that if I clear the console and hit
control enter to start a new iteration
we start at 0 but then we get q4 and so
on so we get our doubled value that's
the map operator working and we could do
whatever we want we could hard code
something totally different here like
hello if I now clear doesn't hit ctrl
enter well we get hello all the time
because we don't care about the original
value which would have been a number we
always return hello that's the power of
the operator now just returning hello is
boring I will return this is number or
just number and then the value to have a
little prefix in front of my numbers so
now if I clear this and hit control
enter again we see number 0 1 and so on
now let's change another operator again
before subscribe to have an effect and
then this could be the well let's stick
to the one we saw on the slide throttle
time here I
have to pass a number as an argument
this number defines for how long I want
to wait so here I could say aatul two
seconds now since we do emit a new value
every second and we wait for full two
seconds to pass before we accept a new
value we should actually skip two values
at a time so let's see that we start at
zero which makes sense but then the next
value is free which makes sense because
one and two were skipped because when we
omit the second value two seconds are
not quite finished but right thereafter
they are so we see every third value we
could say because we wait two seconds if
it would decrease justice to 1900 you
will see that we see every second value
so now if I hit control enter here we
see zero then we see two and we four and
so on
so datas throttle time and math now
combined and that is how we can use that
funnel-like structure to apply any of
the operators we want and have a look at
the official documentation at the
observable docs here to get a full list
of all operators there are quite a lot
to really control to get what we want
and I will create more videos on more of
these operators more interesting ones
and interesting combinations of these
operators no worries but I hope that
this already clears up some of the
confusion and shows how powerful
operators and this funnel-like approach
are see you in our videos hopefully bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
