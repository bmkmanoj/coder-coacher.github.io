we already had a look at HTTP now in
this video I want to show you how we can
connect to another restful service like
in this case firebase 2 to post data and
get data and store it in their database
so if you're not familiar with firebase
you can think of it as like let's say a
cloud database it's it's more than that
but that's it's not for this video and
what we will do is we will use their
REST API to yeah basically put data
there of whose data there and get it
back I'll put this simple up here as for
this video my two future videos where we
dive deeper into the old firebase API
and do more stuff with that but for this
video what I'll be able to do here is I
can insert a first and last name here
set the user and submit it and as we can
see this response you get back from the
server and it's just confirms that this
data was set now if we have a look at
the firebase database of say or the data
that is there itself I do this by
accessing my firebase account here we
see that this data was indeed
successfully set now what we also do is
what we can get the user and now
obviously nothing changes here but if I
reload the page and now click get user
we can see we get back that user in JSON
format now first step for you if you
don't have an account with with Google
or with firebase is for you to sign in
or sign up before with Google or create
a new account with them and once you
have done that
you should be taken to a dashboard which
looks like that now I just hit my my
details here because I don't want anyone
to access this account but you should
see your URL we'll going to use
throughout this video right here where
it's blurry in the video now but you
should see your you are out there
now just copied that URL when we needed
later in this video so I'm not starting
off with basically a clean installation
all I did here was I
well I created the HTML code we're going
to use for this video so the foreign set
the user and the button to get a bag and
some styling but you will find a link to
the code in the description so first
thing I'm going to do is I'll treat a
service which will handle this
firebase access to do that I'll create a
new file here and I will call it fire
fire based dove service ta tour TS and
inside this file let me see when our
first export my class here my firebase
service class and remember the naming
convention where we include the type of
this class or the type to which we're
going to transform this or as which
we're going to use this in the name so
in this case we're including service in
the name of our class here then I want
to make sure that I import injectable
from angler to core and then I attach
the injectable metadata or decorator
here to to attach the metadata to
disclose now inside this class and for
the moment not going to write like a
firebase framework where we then have a
universal or standardized way of sending
data and setting it and putting it to
our firebase database in this case I'm
just creating the methods we're going to
need for this video so what I'm doing
here is I will create a set user method
which allows us to set I use for
basically and this method should take
two arguments the first name which will
be peer string and a last name which
will be a string and additionally we'll
have a get user method then true chest
head again you obviously could write a
more generic class here which would
offer you a simple way of putting and
getting all kinds of data but in this
case this will do now in my set
user function here I want you access the
well the restful api ofer base and
therefore i need to be able to use the
angular 2 HTTP service so to do that
I'll add my constructor to inject it
here I will automatically bind it to a
private property called HTTP and what
will unchecked well the HTTP object or
an instance of this object now to be
able to do that make sure that in your
boot is where you bootstrap your app you
got your router providers well set as
providers so that angular 2 is able to
do this injection then on my back in our
firebase service here what I'll do is
our first created body of this request
because this will be a put request not a
post request but a put request this is
because in firebase or with firebase we
can use both requests a put request will
always overwrite the old data or the the
old data we were setting here not all
the data in the database just the one
we're targeting here and a post request
will kind of append to it so like a push
function an array and it will give each
data entry we we sent there and
automatically generated ID now but both
can be useful it depends on what you're
building here in this case I'm going to
go with to put function or with the put
request because well that's something we
hadn't had a look at until now so first
I'll create a body of this file of this
request and I'll just create a string of
a JSON object and this JSON object was
well basically when I will create from
the parameters were passing here with a
first name of first name and a last name
of last name so very simple javascript
object and creating here and then I'm
turning it into a string thereafter I
will return this HTTP put so this is
where
I create my put request here
I now need to target a specific URL now
this URL is that one you're seeing here
now this just looks a bit different
because it it's too small to have the
normal layout but this is your dashboard
and here it's blurry right now but here
you will find the link to your database
so I'm just copying that and then I have
to enter HTTP colon double slash and
then enter the link now it could learn
here again but here is really just HTTP
and then your link yeah your the URL to
your database now we have to append
something to this URL because we're not
targeting the root directory in our
database let's say we want to create a
user kind of directory or a user element
there so therefore I will target you
slash user dot Chasen by appending dot
Chasen at the end of the URL we're able
to access the restful api of firebase
and then I'll also pass my body to this
function now we're not done yet what I
need to do is I need to map the response
to turn bytes we're getting back to
adjacent element so to do this I will
first an able the map operator of rxjs
by importing rxjs /rx this will give us
access to all the operators and then
I'll just enter a new line here
I will map the response I get here to
response to chase into basic basically
just transform it into a JavaScript
checked ok so now we're having a Jason
element here and we're returning this
now let's also write our get user
function this one is a bit simply a
simpler I'm just returning this HTTP GET
now again I'll take this string
here string from above put it into
quotation marks from above and then I
will know it will not eat death I will
again map the response to transform it
to Jason so this should do it now back
in a rap component I need to create the
response property which is output here I
love assume a more and then I will
inject this firebase service we just
created
I will bind it to the private property
firebase service and this automatically
added to import for me make sure to
import your firebase servers correctly
at the top of this file and I also need
to adhere to my providers area to tell
angular who did well basically how to
create as firebase service now I have
two methods I'm targeting in my HTML
code here that is the onsubmit method
and the on get user method so on submit
will receive my form which is a control
group so make sure to import control
Krupa to talk to you and here what I
will do is I will access my firebase
service will set my user because that's
what I do when they're on submit when I
submit this form and what I want to do
here is I want to pass my first Emma
last name so therefore I access my form
which I pastors on submit method here
and there I have access to value
property and here I can just access
first name because I bound this first
name input field here with ng control to
well the name first name and
respectively the last name input field
is bound to last name through
control here so therefore we can access
it like a property or a property of a
JavaScript object here so form W last
name down here now this alone won't
enable us to output it this just returns
that will chase an object basically but
it doesn't even fire the request to be
honest what we have to do is we have to
subscribe to this observable because
again HTTP in and let you by default
uses observables and we have to
subscribe those observables to basically
fire them or to start whatever they
should do in this case send a request
and also to be able to listen to
anything that which comes back from this
request so in this case in the SUBSCRIBE
function I get two cases first one is I
get back a user so your user is what I
don't want to get back and this case I
want to set this response equal to you
to this user but first I will stringify
the chase because remember we're
transforming our response to jason and
we have to stringify it to actually be
able to output it in our well HTML code
well the other cases we get an error in
this case I just want you lock this to
the console okay so this should work
just before my code about a little bit
here and then I got my on GAD user
method now here also X is my firebase
service and I will call my get user
method there and then again I will
subscribe to this observable and I got
two cases here to I get back a user in
this case well again I will set my
response to the stringify version of
that or I get an error in this case I
want to log it to the console oops okay
so this should work
let's go give it a try and I got an
error here in my firebase service last
you know this
the last names I think my auto-complete
nuts me there so let's try it again
yeah this worked and if we have a look
at our dashboard or in our application
or database here we can see this was
successfully inserted let me reload here
and get the user and we're getting it
back awesome
so this works and this is basically how
we can use the firebase restful api to
set data and get data and obviously we
can do a lot more with it
so either you dive into the firebase
restful api documentation or well i
guess i'll probably do some more videos
and maybe we will refine our firebase
service to be more generic see you in
the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
