one important problem we got if we build
a website all these different fonts we
get a lot of JavaScript files over which
we distribute our code we get multiple
CSS files probably multiple images and
we can copy them manually to the server
we're running the app one though for
example for JavaScript we probably need
to bundle them all into one file for
shipping them because most browsers
don't support multi fall JavaScript apps
where we try to import from our files
and that is where web pack comes into
play
it helps us bundle and optimize all
these things so it helps us set up a
development workflow but we have some
input files which attend bundles
together or transforms or does whatever
we plug into our setup which is a core
part of web pack so that we get some
optimized and bundled files which we
then deploy so that we got the best of
both worlds a development setup where we
can write we're both and understandable
code and code that we ship that is as
small as possible to make that work web
pack follows the structure you see here
we have certain entry points like the
app dot J's file where it starts
analyzing our project and if we then for
example import another JavaScript file
into that file it will automatically
pick that up and add it to the bundle
and thereafter we bundle everything
optimize everything and get some output
now in between these two steps we can
plug in some loaders which do something
to the files like for example transpile
next-gen javascript to current gen
javascript which runs in more browsers
these are so-called module loaders they
are applied on a per file level and
additionally we get so-called flag ins
which then take the entire bundle and do
something with it
like for example ugly fired so mini
fired that is what web pages are helpful
tool we use during the development to
write code that's readable to us but
usable by brow
