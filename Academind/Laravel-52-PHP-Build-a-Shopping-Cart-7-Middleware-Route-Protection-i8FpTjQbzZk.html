working but there are some pieces
missing for example the user is not able
to log out and the user is able to well
with this URL here at any point of time
because we're not protecting it we're
not requiring the user to be locked in
to get here also we're not automatically
logging the user in upon signup so all
these are things I want to fix here so
I'll go back to the code and I want to
start with providing a log out
functionality this will be done in the
user controller I'll add a new method
here public function get log out and
logging out is really simple using the
office age level provides I just run off
log out and with that log out method on
this off helper letter will
automatically take care that everything
is the leader that has saved about this
user or about this users state so that G
is no longer locked in of course the
database entries will be kept so not
everything will be deleted basically the
session and so on so if that user is
able to log out and I will set up a
route for this little get route here
user log out and I'll of course use my
newly created action in the user
controller and get log out name this
user dot log out and now that I think of
it it would make more sense to also give
all these routes the user prefix here
however that is a lot of unnecessary
typing I'm doing here because I would
add slash user in front of all of these
routes now since all these routes share
the same prefix I may as well add a
route group here with a prefix as to
grouping logic the prefix should be
user and then in closure in the
anonymous function of this route group
method here level provides I'll add all
these routes which should get this
prefix and then I can get rid of the
user here in the profile and you log out
route and with that all these routes
will be accessed with slash user slash
signup slash sign-in and so on but I
don't have to explicitly type it here
all the time
simply by grouping them together by this
criteria here this prefix anyways back
to the logout functionality but that was
important to hear of course I want to
add the link to the logout and he had or
file here so I'll do this here route
user dot logout will give me this link
and with that well we should at least be
able to see if all of the works and
logging out should work too so I'll go
back to my page let me first check if
this route still works yes so the route
grouping works and if I click on well
sign in I'm still taken to the sign-in
page which of course doesn't make sense
since I'm still silent but I'll take
care of this soon so if I click log out
yes just seems to work but it would of
course be nice if I also am redirected
so I'm currently not doing anything here
that certainly is wrong so I'll provide
a redirect here and let's say I want to
basically navigate back to where the
user came from so let's try this again
I'll go back to the index page and yes
I'm not locked and currently but it will
work anyways yeah I'm taken back so this
works but you still see there are some
missing things however for one it would
be creative this header here or this
user management pop-up or drop-down
would be updated accordingly so that I
don't see the log out possible here when
I'm not logged in and the route
protection I was already
looking off so I'll take care of the
route protection next I'll do this any
routes PHP file and lateral has this
concept called middleware which allows
me to basically funnel all requests for
which I specify a middleware through
that middleware which is basically a
checked check run on the requests to see
if they fulfill a certain criteria
letter would ships with some built-in
middleware and there are two middlewares
I'm thinking of right now which are very
handy for us the off malware will make
sure that only authenticated users may
access a certain resource whereas the
guest villa where does the opposite and
we can of course use both malware's to
make sure that only authenticated users
may access the profile per page whereas
only an authenticated users may access
the sign up or sign in pages for example
in your kernel PHP file you can see
those middlewares here this is the basic
middleware layer all ships with this is
the of middleware I'm talking off and
basically with this off string here we
get a shortcut to easily access and
apply this middleware and guess the
other one I'm talking about in the
middleware folder you see the files this
these links here are referring to so off
is referring to app HTTP middleware
authenticate which is this file here so
here you can see the logic level runs
and the gas middleware is referring to
the redirect it redirect if
authenticated malware this file here so
we can adjust these files to our needs
and I will do this but for now what I
will first do is I will add the
middleware and the routes file so I will
tell level which routes of my routes you
see here should get a certain middleware
now how can will aware be applied and I
just saw that this signup page should
also be pass into the route grouping by
the way but how can I apply middleware I
can do it by simply adding and
new parameter here middle aware and new
element in this array and then I could
pass an array of Milla wares so off and
any other middleware
or if I only have one I may simply
specify it as a single element or azzam
as a string here off now I certainly
don't want to protect these sign up
route with the off middleware because
then you would never be able to sign up
since well he certainly isn't
authenticated before trying to sign up
so instead here I want to have the guest
middleware so middleware guest to make
sure that only unauthenticated users are
able to sign up I'll copy that to my
post route to my sign-in routes and here
for the profile I'll also copy it but
I'll replace GAF guest with off because
only authenticated users should be able
to get to the profile and the same is
true for logging out another kated users
can't log out so they shouldn't be able
to now you already see a similar thing
as with the user prefix here I'm using
this guest middleware on four routes and
off onto now this is perfectly fine but
I could also use grouping here again so
let's do that
I'll group all these routes this time
not by prefix but by middleware and
apply the off middleware for or key
guest middleware here for the first set
of routes so provide a closure which
holds all these routes and I will paste
in all the routes which currently have
the guest middleware like this and then
of course I can get rid of this
middleware element here and the route
setup and I can also create another
group here route group
middleware and then of 42 other routes
down here which you also share the same
malware so I'll take these routes and
insert them here and all the get rid of
the middleware here so with that I'm
still applying the middle where the gas
middleware to these routes ante off
malware to these routes now if we have a
look in the middle where files level
ships with the authenticate malware is
of course the one which checks if the
user is logged in and we see that level
tries to redirect us to basically this
is a route here like the route command
to the log in page well this route
doesn't exist here so I want to redirect
to the user to user dot sign-in does an
important adjustment here for having
this to work correctly and in the
redirect if authenticated case this is
fine since we're redirected to an
absolute URL or path here which is our
route page which is OK for me you could
of course replace this with redirect and
then route and then product index I
think was the name of the very top route
yes and this would basically do the same
so whatever you like more so I'll go
with that and with this if I had over
and reload my application here and I go
to sign up this works so if I go to sign
in does all the works if I do sign-in
I'm redirected to the profile and if I
try to access sign in again you see I'm
redirected back to the starting page
because this is now protected that is so
that only an offended case and
authenticated users may access it
logging out of course works and what
happens if I'm a now logged out try to
access my user profile page I'm okay
I made a mistake here let's replace this
with Route guest takes an absolute
pathway which of course doesn't work so
let's use route instead so I'll try this
again
you see I'm taken into the sign-in page
so all that works what do I want to do
last I want to login the user right
after he sign up and I went to fix this
drop down so I'll start with logging the
user in after sign up by simply adding
off sign up off login and then pass the
user which I want to login so with this
helper method I can instantly log in a
user and of course I know that this is
possible here because the user has been
created so that is one thing let's try
this so I go to sign up and I'll create
a new user here with a novel email
address and we can't test if I'm signed
up by going to user profile this works
of course we could also redirect not to
product index but to user profile so
let's do this and now to the header
currently I'm always showing the signup
and sign in and logout links now that
certainly isn't the right thing to do
because well I only want to show sign up
and sign in if the user is not locked in
and if the user is logged in then I want
to show logout and I want to replace
signup and sign in with a link to the
user account to the user profile let's
say so how can we do that very easily
level offers us the possibility to use
the office 8 in the blade templates as
well so I can check with off check which
is a helper method basically telling
level Hey please have a look if the user
currently on this page is logged in
which of course level can validate
because it stores it in a session and if
this is successful well then I will
display the content between e if we're
ending inside of this F block
I'll also add an else statement here and
then and if so now what do I want to
display in the case that the user is
authenticated well then I want to create
a new list entry saying user profile
linking to that page here if the user is
not authenticated if he is not logged in
then I want to show this block here and
this log out link will also only be
shown if the user is authenticated so
also in the well if case and the in the
true case here so with that in place if
I reload the page here and have a look
at the drop-down you now see I only see
signup and sign in because I'm not
signed in if I do is sign in though you
see now I got access to user profile and
log out so that's working great and with
that we've got a working user interface
or user sign up inside and process in
place and yeah I'm happy to see you next
