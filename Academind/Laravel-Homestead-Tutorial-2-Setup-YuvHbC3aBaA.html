knew well which software homestead
includes what it is what way current is
and so on but not only is it important
to know how to install it because we
want to use it
it also helps understanding of all these
pieces work together once you've set it
up so let's do this what we will need is
vagrant some may just follow this link
here and we'll also need either
VirtualBox or VMware and these are the
programs the tools which actually create
and run the virtual machines I will
choose VirtualBox here now on the
respective websites you just download
the software like VirtualBox for your
operating system
OS X in my case and I'll do the same for
Waveland where I choose this subtle
download button here to get to the
download section and also download it
for your operating system now this might
take a couple of seconds and I will see
you once this is finished so my
downloads just finished and now I'm able
to well first run VirtualBox and it over
here just run this package here and next
I'll just follow through the
installation here that really isn't too
difficult so let's finish this now once
this is done close this and I will run
the way grant installation it and it
works the same way as the VirtualBox
installation chests did let me get this
over here to run extracts package here
and then just run while the Installer
here again I have to enter my password
here so I do this and with that good to
go so now we got VirtualBox in Waker and
install the next step is to install
homestead or to bring in homestead which
really just as I said
before it is this pre-configured box
though also we later will have to
install another part of Homestead which
allows us to easily configure parts off
the pre-configured box because the box
itself yes it is pre-configured it is it
contains the software you operating
system of the software which you're
under but we are able to change certain
parts of the default configuration in a
separate config file but you will see
this so next the lower first next step
is queue add this lateral homestead box
to vagrant which is the provisioning
system in the end and I do this in the
command line by running way grant box ad
and then level homestead
and you're this one now just installed
arable homestead and I have to choose
which well virtual provider I use so I
use VirtualBox here of course with just
enter one and now just will download
this box and well this has quite some
size because remember it has complete
operating system included and much more
and therefore this will take a couple of
minutes and I will see you once this is
finished
so my setup just finished here and the
next step is to actually download the
homestead initializer so to say which
will set up the basic configuration
homestead needs to actually start this
box this homestead box and with
configuration I mean not software on
this box but how basically wavelet the
virtual machine and our local machine
works together which databases we have
in our virtual machine and so on but I
will go into more detail about the
configuration of our vagrant box in a
future video so how do we then install
this configuration basically we get to
come on here so we clone the github repo
here with which includes this homestead
configuration and I do this in the
folder where I want to have my well my
homestead config this is not necessarily
the folder where your projects will live
in but what I do is I will have my
homestead folder on the same level where
I will then have my different project
folders or other sub folders but this is
my personal preference you may install
it where you want however it is
important that you will start your
virtual machine with the command vagrant
up from within this folder so place it
somewhere where you remember where it is
so I'm now navigated into this folder
this PHP folder my case and here I will
run git clone then the link I just
copied and then I will name my homestead
folder well homestead address clones it
into this folder now here's an important
note for Windows users to follow along
with
these commands I execute a terminal here
I recommend that you download git bash
which is basically a tool which allows
you to do just that run the same
commands i'll run here on my Mac OS or
on a Linux machine on Windows and this
will make it far easier for you to
follow along and I will base this video
on the assumption that you are able to
follow along with these commands so I
cloned this into this folder and next I
will well move into this home step
folder and in there what I will do is I
will then run with the bash tool this
init shell script which copies some
basic initialization files and yeah sets
up homestead configuration the way we
need it with this we're almost ready to
run everything but I want to first
navigate to the folder where the actual
config file will be stored this is the
root user folder and in here I got my
home state yamo file and it's just a
text file in the end where well the
configuration takes place now I will go
over this file in the next video however
what is important
vagrant or the virtual machine maps a
certain folder to a folder on your local
machine to keep the files synchronized
because otherwise you would have a
problem because of course you want to
develop on our local machine with our
local IDE s for example but we want to
exit to execute to access these files
through a browser for example if you're
creating a website but these files then
have to be on a virtual machine because
this machine has the server right so how
do we get our locally develop files on
that machine the great thing is vagrant
has this synchronized folder concept
where files in this folder will be
automatically copied so to say into the
virtual machine so that all the changes
we do in our
local machine will be reflected in the
virtual machine and therefore we can
develop locally but test on the virtual
machine and this is what we do here with
the folders key here we define which
local folder the map key we want to map
to which virtual folder to now add a
virtual folder for me as fine home right
way current code is okay but I don't
code in the code folder I code to show
this in a Finder I'm here in my root
user folder under development than PHP
for PHP projects and then your tutorials
or projects so I want to have this PHP
file as my root folder to be
synchronized in order to do this I will
map this here from well development PHP
and you replaced as pop which with
whichever path you need from your root
file on down to the filer your actual
projects will well sit in and you may
map this to one single project or like I
do here to a folder which contains
several projects so this Maps this
folder however this alone won't allow me
to run applications in the browser I
will have to map my sites here too this
will make sure that my files are
synchronized with the machine but in
order to access my my websites there I
have to tell why vagrant or homestead to
which projects certain URL should relate
and I can do this here by let's say I
want to have my level basics tutorial I
will use dot dev as extension but you
may choose whatever you want here and
now this home way grant code file is
okay because this is the virtual machine
path where my projects sit in now here
again we're on a virtual machine like we
were here but this part here is wrong
because if we have a look at my
structure here
is home wagon code file relates to this
PHP folder here now in there I have my
tutorials I have YouTube and then for
example here level basics so if I want
to map this project what I will do is I
will replace level here because the
public folder should say the same
because our index.php will always be the
public folder and little project
so whatever the here is I will replace
level with tutorials and then YouTube
and then wearable basics so tutorials
YouTube level basics and this will make
sure that I'm mapping my actual project
to this URL on the virtual machine now I
will close this and now I have an
additional step to do in order for just
to work in my browser I also have to
create a mapping on my local machine
from well the URL I want to use to the
IP of the virtual machine and this IP
while you could see it in this homestead
Yammer file here at the very top this is
the IP we will need so I will do this
next I do this by running sudo nano
pseudo is required on Mac to get well
access to this nano is a little text
editor command line text editor and then
I want to add edit my e.t.c hosts file
now on windows letter will schedule
covered if you scroll down and down and
down here the hosts file you'll find a
description where to find the hosts file
on a Windows machine what we basically
do in this file is we can map IPS to
certain domain names which we then can
enter in the browser we don't have to do
this
this is GIP from the ammo file but of
course it's easier to type a domain name
into the browser than this IP just make
sure to not bind a domain
your which might serve an actual website
like google.com for example because then
you would not be able to access this
page anymore so here I will then map
this IP to level basics death and then I
access exit with control X press Y to
save it and enter again now with this
still in my homestead folder where I
cloned the git repository into I can now
run vagrant up to start my virtual
machine based on the configuration I set
up here and this will take a couple of
seconds and we'll be back once it is
finished
so there's finished for me you may
ignore this red warning here or error
that is nothing too bad and now I can
access this page under level basics duck
death and as you can see here is my page
so it doesn't spin the installation how
to set it up and next we will have a
look at how to configure it and how to
for example access to database from our
local machine and how to run our tests
and commands for example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
