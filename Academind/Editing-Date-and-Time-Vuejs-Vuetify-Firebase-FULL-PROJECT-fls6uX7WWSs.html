beautify and firebase serious in the
last video of this series we added the
functionality to edit an existing meetup
at least the title and the description
now I want to be able to add the time
and the date so let's implement this
functionality in this video
let's dive right into it and the
approach generally is pretty much the
same I used before in the last video in
the series we created this edit meetups
meetup details dialog which we simply
open whenever we click that button next
to a give meetup so if I quickly sign in
with my account with which I created
that meetup on a give meetup for example
this one we have this added button we
can click now I want to have a similar
edit button down there next to the title
at the time so that I can edit that and
for that I will create a new component
in the Edit folder view I'll name it
edit meetup date dialog to start with
the date now that is of course a dot
view file and in that dot view file here
I now will follow a comparable approach
as before in that other dialog file here
so obviously we have our template here
and in that template I'll add a video
log wrapper and again that's just what
we did here to then we'll have an
activator and then a card with a
container actually I'm copying the
template of the our meetup dialog and
I'll enter it here now of course I won't
reuse the entire dialogue I could just
use the component but if I plan to do
that
instead what I want to do is here for
example on the button I won't use fab
batma here I'll use a normal button and
I don't want user icon in there instead
I'll just want to say add a date here so
this should really be a normal button
now I saw where you will use the v-model
we've added dialogue I'll add this to my
data properties soon I'll leave the
width as it is now in the container I
want to use a layout I will say edit
edit meetup is OK or edit meet date
maybe as a cards title now inside the
card though I now of course want to have
my date picker so here we got the
divider with Navarro and now it's inside
here that I want to change something so
rid of the weak our text here and I'll
get rid of the divider and the bottom
row here so that I only have one layout
one row in my grid and in here I now
want to add my on my date picker so add
we date picker here and this V date
picker here needs to be bound to a date
property so I bind with remodel to
editable date now this property doesn't
exist yet I'll add it soon though I also
want to set a style where I set the
width to 100% so that it fills the
complete dialog that the state picker
fills out the completes dialog so with
that we got the date picker set up now
when other thing I'll add is the actions
property to indicate that I want to be
able to cancel this because obviously I
maybe just want to say to stick to the
old date and don't want to have to pick
a new date
now inside we date picker I now add a
template where I set the scope and we've
used this feature before in this video
series this simply allows me to set the
save and cancel buttons on it both are
displayed on the date picker again so
that I can quit this process and opt in
to not pick a date so here inside my
template I now want to add two buttons
with we button the first one will get a
class where I'll set the text to blue
with blue text darken one and I'll say
close here now on that button I want to
give it a flat style and on a click on
it I want to set edit dialog which is
this property we haven't added yet but
which will determine whoever we see the
dialog or not so we'll set this to false
here and I'll split it over multiple
lines to make it a bit easier to read so
here when we click the button I
basically close dialogue now I'll
duplicate this button on the second
button though I want a safety date we
now picked so here I will call a
different method I will call on save
Changez this is my template setup for
now we'll see if it needs more
fine-tuning but let's go with that for
now
now I will add my script here below the
template now in a script I will of
course export my default view instance
for an of component and I expect to get
the meetup as a prop so that I get to
meet up data there I also it will set up
data and return an object here as we
always do and in that object I now want
to have both added dialogue which will
determine whether we see the dialogue or
not and I want to have the editable date
which is to take the user picks and we
have to differentiate between the date
we already have on the meetup which I
don't want to override automatically and
the one who user picked because if I
click into the date picker pick a
different one and click cancel if I were
to set the pick date immediately once I
click on a date equal to the meetup date
I would overwrite it even if I cancel
now I don't want to do that therefore I
will have two different data objects
here so that they don't interfere
so with that I'll add two properties
here in your object added dialogue which
is false initially so the dialogue is
not showing up initially and then
editable date which is null initially
because the user hasn't picked one
that's not like this we have to enter a
white space to fit the linting rules the
next thing i want to add is a method so
I'll add the methods property here and I
want to add the on Save Changes method
which of course is executed when we
click the Save button here now an
unsaved changes the idea is to save the
date now for that we need to initialize
the editable date first though because
if I open the date picker here I want to
ensure that the first ID which is
selected is the actual meet update now
we get the meetup as a prop
so what I'll do before I add my method
is already created hook here and there I
will set this editable date which I'll
set equal to a new date where I
as this meetup date into the constructor
so that I construct a new date based on
the old date of the meter and this
editable date is bound to the date
picker so it should be selected
automatically at startup now in unsaved
changes I now want to take the updated
editable date so the data user may have
picked and store that in my store and on
the server again so for that I'll first
of all create a constant new date
so that's the new date to the user
picked and here I will initialize a new
date object I will pass this meetup date
to it though and that's not equal to
editable date because that may have
changed in the meantime keep in mind
it's bound by a two-way binding here so
with that new date here I now want to
get the new data user picked so for that
I can create a new date where I pick
this editable oops
added double date into it now why am I
taking this approach why don't I use
just this editable date because of the
way beautify it returns me this state it
happens to be that it's much easier to
work with it if I take the return value
by the date picker UJS
beautify excuse me you will beautify
gives me and put it into new date to
standardize it basically so now I'm just
creating a new date based on the date
the beautify date picker gave me back
and that is a really nice way of having
definitely correct date to work with now
on this new date I can call get UTC date
and this will give me the day of this
date now I will repeat this for month
and year so here I'll get UTC month and
then here new year is not first January
but instead is the full year get UTC
full year so with that I'm simply just
making sure that I take the editable
date turn it into a format I can
definitely work with and can retrieve
that data with these helper methods now
I can take the new date I already have
which is based on my rate
shanell meet update and simply update
all these things by using new date and
then setting the UTC date to new day
oops new day here and so on
and I also Dida do this for the month
which I'll of course set equal to new
month and then I'll use new year here to
set the UTC full year so I'm first
retrieving it from the updated date and
then I'm setting it on the old one and
with this and with the old one just a
side note I of course mean a new date
based on the old one not directly on the
old date stored in the Meetup so with
that I got my new date and now I need to
dispatch it to the update meetup data
action which we already created in the
last video so use this store dispatch
and I want to dispatch to update meetup
data here and the payload I want to pass
is the ID this is this meter of ID and
the date which is new date now if that I
am dispatching this to that action and
if we have a look at the store we
created if we have a look at the update
meetup data method I'm already checking
whether payload includes the date in
which case I update to date with the
payload date and that's just the date a
lot of dates I'm passing here so this
update meetup data should be fully
reusable so let's try it out let's save
everything to make sure we have an
updated project and let's use this
button here to use it I'll take my edit
meat update dialog and I need to
register it globally so I go to the main
dot J's file where I also registered my
edit meetup details dialog component and
first of all I'll import my own new one
so added meetup date dialog could be a
name it's in the Edit folder but it's
named date dialogue and
want to register it so here that's the
dialogue that's the component I want to
register I will adjust the selector of
course that shall now be that date
dialog here at the end so that's my
super short tag name of my own component
now in the meetup dot view file I want
to add it as a just set next to the date
so we have the title and here we have
the date and the location and here I
simply want to add a new death below and
add my own new component which of course
needs to meet up as an input so colon
meetup refers to meet up so that is how
I ensure that I pass this meetup in to
this component by wire property binding
I also want to make sure that I only see
this as the creator so I'll add VF user
is creator that's a computed property we
already use up there on the other dialog
so now if I save this here we see a tap
date now let me reload this quickly
unlocked in I see edit date here if I
click it we see the date picker here
it's the 18th August which I guess was
the default date before
let me quickly reload this again you
really be sure that this is the case yet
it's the 18th August so that's selected
if I pick the 24th August now and I hit
save now we see it's August 24th so this
worked and it's selected now if I save
this again it updates immediately and as
adopted in the database - let's check
August 25th so this is working really
great now let's do the same for the time
and we'll do it in the same video so I
will copy the date dialog for that so
the state dialogue file and name it time
dialog now on this time dialog file of
course change some things but the
general structure is the same now for
one I'll change the title it's added
time on the button added meetup time
the rest can stay as it is here at the
top at least of course we use a V time
picker not a V date picker we use
editable time here as a property name
seems more appropriate for working with
times I'll leave the style I'll set the
format to 24 hours for this time picker
here and I'll also leave the actions
here now with that I'll also add
template to add my two action buttons
I'll leave the button regarding the
closing of the dialog and saving all the
sounds good on save changes still a
fitting name now if I scroll down here a
lot also still works except for it's the
editable time of course but here in on
save changes we need to change a lot
before we do that let's initialize
editable time down there still with the
initial date however there I want to use
two time string to use that as the
editable time which will then be passed
to the date picker the date picker
should be able to handle this correctly
well this is the editable time now in
unsafe changes the approach will still
be the same I use new date based on the
meetup date and now I want to retrieve
the hours and the minutes I'll use the
approach from create meet up here where
I fetch hours and minutes here with
regular expressions so I'll add it here
to this times of course incorrect it's
this editable time and now I'm
retrieving that so here I have hours and
minutes and then I can set a new date
set hours equal to hours and 4 minutes
set minutes webb's minutes here equal to
minutes of course without semicolons so
this is now the code to set the time the
updated time and then I still dispatch
updated with data with the new date and
keep in mind the date of course is day
in a month in a year with time since I
initialize new date based on the meetup
date the time month and year hasn't
changed at all
I only change hours and minutes they're
on the original date which is why I
chose this approach it's really flexible
it allows you to reuse update meet up
data
I do pass a new date to it though only
minutes and hours have changed but who
cares and that really gets me the
flexibility I want here now with that
that's almost all I'll now go back to my
main dot J's fault
duplicate this import now I'm importing
edit meet up time dialog
I'll also duplicate this setup off to
come up our component and do it for edit
meet up time and here it's also edit
meet up time dialog now with that we got
this component to you now let's grab
this very short name go back to the
meetup and there in that div where I
already set up my edit date dialog I'll
also set up the added time dialog now
and I'll do so by also passing the
meetup to that and by using we f2 check
if the user is the creator now let's
save this and let's try this out to the
app updates here so this looks good now
let's pick at a time that's 4 p.m. and 3
minutes which looks good that's exactly
what we see here now let's switch this
to maybe 6 p.m. and it's safe and it
updates it now let's switch the data
again maybe to something in October 26th
October let's save that it updates and
works too so this is now working now we
have a way of changing the date and time
through dialogues we hope we have these
buttons here which is really convenient
way of interacting with that now of
course feel free to find hyuna's to your
needs for me does this how would I have
it the next thing and one of the last
things I want to do is I want to make
this register button work so that we can
actually register or if we are
registered and register for a meet-up
let's do this next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
