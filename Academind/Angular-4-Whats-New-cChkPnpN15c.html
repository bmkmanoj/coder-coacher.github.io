released what changed
what is new attached to this video you
will find a couple of links leading to
the official release notes and so on if
you want to dive deeper but now let me
guide you through it basically and
that's the most important thing angle of
Ford doesn't change that much some under
the hood changes some improvements
performance improvements but regarding
the code you write regarding your code
that should still all work there
shouldn't be any braking changes and
that is great news because that means
that your old code should continue to
work with angular for now why angular 4
to begin with the name simply has
something to do with the way we should
look at angular the framework as a whole
angular 2 was a complete rewrite of
angular 1 and therefore we really talked
about two different frameworks there now
the angular keep decided that the future
should just be angular and angular 1 is
referred to as angularjs so that's a
different framework and angular is these
now to be used framework angular 2 is
the first part of that angular force
simply it's the next version and why not
angular free well that simply happened
because of some internal aversion and
conflicts so they skip the version 3 and
move to write to version 4 it also means
that we will see angular 5 probably
around fall this year we don't know what
will be changed there but for now
angular for is the latest version again
mostly with some under the hood changes
so since we mostly have under the hood
changes which new features do we have
are there any their answer is yes we do
have some new features for example
regarding ng F in the past with angular
2 if you wanted to use ng if with
multiple conditions or specifically with
the else clause you would probably write
it like this q ng if statements where in
the second statement you simply check
the opposite well with angular for you
officially now have an else statement or
else clause you can put into your
engineer statement it then looks like
this might look more complex but it is
really simple you wrap your alternative
content in an ng template a new
component introduced with angular 4 and
this should replace any template the H
EML 5-element you used in your angular
template so in ng template you rap
whatever you want to display optionally
alternatively and you put a local
reference on the ng template and then
you use that reference name in the else
clause of ng F and that is a more
convenient or I guess a more logical way
of creating a if/else block of course
the old way will still work and there is
nothing wrong about using that so there
is one new feature we have another new
feature or some kind of a deprecated old
feature I should say it's a new renderer
we already have to render eyes angular
cube it looks like this and we could for
example use it to change the style here
the background color of element that's
nice and this feature generally still is
available but the old renderer as you
saw it here was deprecated now we have
renderer to it mostly offers the same
methods some change their name though
but generally it's the same it was
renamed because under the hood a lots
changed so we do at that new renderer
now important the old one will still
work I mentioned that there won't be any
breaking changes it simply is deprecated
so it will be removed sometime in the
future you may still continue using it
it won't be removed before angular 5
probably but if possible switch to
render at you make sure to adjust your
injection and your import and have a
look at the official docs for Android
you to find out how the methods you use
use now our name that now works
generally though it should work the same
as before
that was one deprecated and 50% new
feature or something like that now let's
have a look at a totally new feature and
that is the email validator in the past
and angular 2 if you had an input field
which should hold the email address you
probably use the pattern validator
together with some regular expression to
check wherever the user entered a valid
email address with angular 4 there now
as simply it's an email validator you
can drop the email directive on your
input when using the reactive approach
imported use it from this validators
class you use there for all the
validators and you're good to go behind
the scenes that is basically that's the
same you
before with the pattern validator but
it's a more convenient way of using this
of course the pattern validator is still
there if you want to use it for any
other pattern for emails this is the
more convenient way now these are the
most important new features we have all
the other new features are again under
the hood changes for example that now
you may use typescript 2 before that
only typescript 1.8 was supported and
you can have a look at the typescript
release notes to find out which new
features typescript 2 offers and that's
interesting for you if you want to use
any of these new features again that's
purely an option nothing you have to
change here another change was as
mentioned earlier d-flat modules which
make importing a bit easier behind the
scenes or specifically which allow your
built tool to tree shake your code which
means remove any code you don't really
use so again under the hood improvement
and we have some deprecations
deprecations as mentioned earlier simply
means these features will be removed in
the future but not right now so you may
continue using them and if you never
upgrade to angular 510 well they are
never removed so what was deprecated
then well mostly to fix the renderer
which I already mentioned with this new
renderer now being available and the
animations package now that's an
important change prior to angular 4 so
in angular cube you imported all the
triggers States styles and so on so all
these functions from at angular core now
you do the same from add angular
animations the general syntax didn't
change but the way you import them
change you have a new separate package
for animations now now you also have to
add a module to your F module you have
to import it the browser animations
module which is then imported from this
path here from edy angular platform
browser slash animations that is an
average application we have and with
that the our new features and only under
the hood breaking changes which
shouldn't affect your code that is
angular 4th so as you see it for you as
a developer not that many important
changes which affect your code
nice changes which should affect the
performance and size of your application
in the end at least once all your tools
are ready to pick up this tree shaking
feature ends on and therefore really a
nice release the evolution of angular I
guess we can really look forward to
angle of five and fold and maybe more
new features then we'll see but for now
this is it key takeaways your apps
should continue to work you don't need
to change anything if you don't want you
you can use the new features like the
renderer or ngf else you don't have to
if you use animations you may use the
new packages the old ones still work
that is what that brocaded means you
definitely will need to change something
in fall when angular 5 comes out and you
want to upgrade to it but for angular 4
no steps are required from your side of
course you may upgrade or may implement
changes I mentioned here and use the new
feature I hope this was helpful see
