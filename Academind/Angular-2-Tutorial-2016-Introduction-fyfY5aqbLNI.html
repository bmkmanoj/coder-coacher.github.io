now with face can because I think I can
even better explain what I want to
explain and talk to you guys when you're
actually able to see me and well it's
more fun for me and hopefully more
education to you it's now about a month
I think I think it was round or on
December 15th that angular2 went into PT
and since then I've really been getting
into it and learning angular to move
there there isn't that much learning
material online right now and well I
thought that's something I should change
where I can change fortunately because
as I said I really got into it in the
last month so this is a small series
here on this channel where I will try to
get you into angular 2 and get you ready
to develop angular 2 applications as it
isn't beta right now there is no reason
to hold back application development
because there probably won't be that
many major changes going on more or less
adding some features and bug fixing but
no ground-shaking fundamental changes
anymore so now is a great time to get
into it and to be amongst the first to
kick of awesome angular 2 applications
in the future and well I'm so excited to
have you on board for this course see
you any videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
