have you here now if you followed along
the other videos on my channel or maybe
also watch some other tutorials you
probably always saw some setup like this
one here not sure if it was in jsfiddle
but you certainly saw the setup where
you simply dropped in a script import to
control over a part of your Dom with TL
property and output some data there
there's nothing wrong with that setup
that's a fine way of using future as it
might be the best way if you are simply
controlling tiny parts of your dawn but
if you're building bigger or even
medium-sized applications that might not
be your preferred way because it also
doesn't integrate very well into your
maybe existing workflow if you're
already building and bundling sales code
well you're not really doing the same
for your view chess code and you might
also want to split your view chess code
up over multiple files and so on
therefore in this video I'll show you
how to easily get started with a nice
setup for a bigger or medium-sized view
KS application using webpack as a build
tool and as you will see it's only a
couple of steps and you're ready to go
so let's jump in in order to get a nice
pre-configured workflow which you can of
course find you in to your needs I'm
going to use the view CLI here now
already googled for it view CLI and then
here we get two interesting links the
first two search results that should be
let's open the first one
the github page of the view CLI there
you can learn more about it you can read
what it really does but I'm of course
also telling you the view Scylla is a
nice little tool which makes scaffolding
out pre-configured view projects very
simple now with project I mean a basic
folder structure and the basic workflow
set up using webpack giving you some
commands you can run to bundle your code
to build it to split it up over multiple
files to have a tender running on a
development server in the end all with
one command and the second command which
allows you to build your files for
production that's awesome of course you
could set up such a workflow on your own
but you can
also finds you an existing one whatever
you prefer I'm going to use the CLI to
quickly get started now we also learn
how to install the CLI on this page so
why don't you follow these steps here to
install the CLI we're going to use NPM
so you need to have node node J s
installed on your computer you can find
it a node J s org and it's just a
server-side language JavaScript on the
server to be precise we're not needing
it because we're going to write node.js
code but it has a package manager which
ships with no HS which is the de facto
standard for managing your JavaScript
packages also for front-end development
which we're doing here so therefore
install now HS and you should have the
NPM command available thereafter and
with that we can stall a global package
on our machine we do this by adding - G
now on Mac and Linux you're going to
have to add a sudo in front of it to get
you right
well rights to install something
globally and then the name of the
package is view CLI now here I need to
enter my password you might not be
prompted to do so and then it should
install the view CLI package globally on
your machine which means thereafter you
will have it available from the command
line by typing a simple command in any
place on your machine I will see you
once this is finished so the
installation of TCL I just finished
without an error here and with that
installed we already can start using it
now how do we use it
let's go back to the Google search we
also have a second finding here now that
is a template we can use with to view
CLI the web pack template a full list of
all the available templates can be found
on the view seal I get a page if you
scroll down a bit here now templates are
really chest
well the templates for the project
system you want to use you could use a
web pack template or a simplified one
without unit tests and so on you can
also choose browserify if you wanted or
a simple template which basically is the
same approach we used in chase fill any
other videos but now in your local
environment in your browser well there
are all the templates you can choose I'm
going to use the WebEx simple one for
there
video here because well it's a quick and
easy web peg template to get started
with in order to use it we have to go
back to the command line and in the
command line you have to go into a
folder where you want to create your new
project folder and there you can then
simply type view since we install the
view CLI in it then the name of the
template you want to use webpack simple
in my case here and then the name of the
folder you want to create I'm going to
you name it view web pack but of course
you may choose any name you like hit
enter and this will install this or
setup this template this project here
you can enter project name if you just
hit enter it will pick the default
between the parentheses same for the
description for the offer and you're
done and with that you got it installed
and here you see the next steps we
should see the into the newly created
folder here you webpack thereafter we
have to run npm install because this
template doesn't install the
dependencies or this command has
installed the dependencies our project
need because of course we do have a more
complex workflow here with a couple of
dependencies a couple of third-party
packages we use and we need to install
those packages with npm install now this
will take a couple of seconds because it
installs WebP x various loaders - well
work with web pack and so on as a side
note if web pack is totally new to you
definitely check out some dedicated
tutorials i'm not going to explain web
pack in this video i'm just explaining
how to use this eli to quickly get
started with such a workflow now after
all these dependencies have been
installed we can let run the last
command if you remember it it was npm
run dev and this will start the
development workflow that means it will
bundle our project and it will start up
a development server so a little server
which Lunz runs on our machine driven by
nodejs another reason why we needed to
install it which will host our
application so that we can see it
running on our machine without deploying
it to an actual server let's have a look
at it we see it here in the browser it
should have opened a tab automatically
otherwise see that localhost 8080 and
this is the basic application this
template
with this is how we can install such a
template with this CLI but now let's
also have a look what got installed in
the first place which folders and files
were created for us I'm in webstorm D
IDE I'm using for development and of
course you could use an a variety or
editor like atom sublime which will
studio goat they should all work fine
and here we see the falls and father's
the view CLI created for us when we
choose that web pack simple template we
get two node modules folder holding all
our dependencies like web pack itself
and a couple of other dependencies we
need for that workflow UJS of course is
all included there and we can see a full
list of TD dependencies installed here
in the package chat Jason as you can see
there is only one run time dependency
view and a couple of development only
dependencies which are needed for that
workflow so that's one thing but besides
that we also get this source folder and
that source folder is important because
here we're going to develop our
application and now here we already see
something very strange this dot view
file here now what is that until now if
you watch maverick videos we only worked
with jsfiddle where we had one single
file where the script was in so we would
have expected a dot JS file here or
simply an HTML file well we do have an
HTML file here index.html desert zip
file which will actually get served and
it's pretty empty but it does have two
interesting things it doesn't a div with
the ID app well we know this from the
chase fill examples and it imports a
script so it looks like we're importing
some script which will then again take
over this ID or this app Dave here and
that doesn't it the case the quest will
just is well where does this boat touch
a script come from this is the bundle
created by web pack and it bundles all
our scripts in the source folder it
starts with the main dot JS file this is
just how it's set up you can check this
new epic config file here you see the
entry point again not going to go
through this file in detail but you just
see where it starts which loaders it
applies to transform these files and
what it outputs
DeBolt that chairs file which we import
in the index.html file
so if we have a look at the main dot JS
file we see it's relatively simple we do
create a view instance there we take
over the element here with the app
selector but then we do something
strange we call this render that method
here now what's the render method doing
the render method is a built-in method
of you instance nose which basically
means replace the part you're selecting
the Dom here with some other code now
the default behavior of UJS is to select
a certain part in the Dom like we did it
in the averages with chase fill with GL
property here so gear step of the app ID
for example and then take this Dom as a
template where we could use string
interpolation and so on but as you can
clearly see this div here is pretty
empty there's nothing in between we're
not having a paragraph where we output a
title or something like this so we're
clearly not following the approach we
solve thus far so what are we doing here
instead what we're still selecting this
part but the render method now overrides
it it tells view jeaious don't use the
Dom as your template instead just use it
as a hook and now override it with some
other template some other HTML code you
could say now the render function simply
takes an input here which is provided by
view chess which is a function which
gets executed in the end but the
interesting thing here is not how this
function works that's a relatively
complicated one the interesting thing is
what we pass as an argument to this
callback function this H function here
and that's app which we're importing
from the app dot view file now let's
open that file and Wow that certainly
looks strange here we got a template at
the top then we get a script tag and
then we get some Styles dot view files
are special files in view chests which
allow us to store all our template our
script and our styles in one file we can
therefore split our view KS app into
logical pieces components you'll learn
about this in one of my earlier videos
and each component could live in a view
chase file in it excuse me that dot view
file and each component of
has at least a template so something we
render some HTML code we store that
between template tags and you always
need these template tags and then we
have maybe a script we don't need it
necessarily but if we want to have some
logic we probably do need and probably
also optionally we do have some styles
we apply to this application that's
important these Styles by standard are
applied to the whole application they
are not scoped to disavow file that we
could force this by adding scoped here
as an attribute to style just to say
this right away with that you're telling
you chest please only apply these styles
to this file to this template up here if
you don't have scoped here they will be
applied to your whole application so but
back to this template here we do have
some HTML code and here one important
restriction is that inside of this
template we must have only one root
element so this div in this case here
it's not allowed to let's say I have
another div next to it this will throw
an error because you must only have one
root element a lot of talking about
these view files but what does it do
here in the end well web pack has a
special package the view loader which
knows how to handle dot view files what
the view loader will do is it will take
this file transform our template to HTML
code kind of you can of course represent
HTML elements with JavaScript code it
transforms it to JavaScript code I
wanted to say right so to JavaScript
code it will also pack in our script
part here it will add our styles to the
top of our index.html file in the Hat
section and therefore it allows us since
we only have JavaScript here all this is
transformed to JavaScript to bundle this
Q R and pet to pass this JavaScript code
to the render function which needs
JavaScript code which it renders in the
Dom in the end which it executes in the
end it does all there for us therefore
one single bundle gets created but it
gives us the nice possibility of
splitting up our code into multiple
files of using this dot view fault
concept to have a
clear separation of the different
components in our application now here
we're not really using a component this
is kind of our root component if you
want to think of it
we're just taking this EPP you faulty
template in the stripped of it and we're
rendering this and replacing our
selected part in the Dom here with the
app selector but in the next video you
will see how we can use dot view files
to actually create model components and
work with them I hope this video was
helpful for learning about the view CLI
how to quickly get started with a better
workflow with a local project using
webpack and to at least dive into the
basics of these strange dot view files
which make life really easier in the end
would be great to see in the other
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
