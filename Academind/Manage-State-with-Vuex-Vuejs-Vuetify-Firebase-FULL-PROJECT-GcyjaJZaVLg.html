you've applied fire based applications
taking shape we get our cover solo
meetups you can click the meetups to see
the individual one forget the list of
meetups here
well only one meetup in there right now
which is one less than in the carousel
and the reason for that is that we're
not managing the application state
central yet time to change this in this
video where it will add view X to change
the way we manage our application state
to change the way we display our or we
manage our meetups we need to install UX
so I'll cancel my death server process
and run NPM install - - save to save it
as a production dependency view X that's
all with that I'll now create a new
folder in the source folder which I'll
name store that is where I want to
manage my store and here I'll simply add
a index dot JSP for now now in that
index dot JSP of first of all import
view again from the view package with
with a lowercase B oops without a colon
semicolon and then import view X from UX
we just installed that with that I can
now use it so with view use I can add
this plug-in so that you will also
inject the buicks store into all our
components and now we can start working
with that so for that I'll export a
constant which we'll name stored which
is a new view X store and we need to
pass an object to that function here in
that function that object or excuse me
we're now going to configure our store
the store has a state and we also set up
the initial state there will have some
mutations - oops mutations to change
that state will then have some actions
to dispatch the mutations and if that's
all Brent you make sure to check out my
view X series I have here on this
channel and will actually also have some
getters to get to stored in our
components now let's start by setting up
the state here and I will add a property
called loaded meetups you load it
because we actually do load them from
firebase later you could of course all
just name this meetups what it will be
though is an array of objects and
actually if you go to the home component
I can take this array here for now we
might change this throughout this
application
but that is what I'm going to start with
so that now oops wrong folder here in
the state
we actually stored our meetups in UX now
in our view X state so that once you
work with it we use the same state
everywhere in our application so that is
the first step here I do have my loaded
meetups there I will also add a user
object that should be authenticated user
and right now with it nothing about user
authentication will also add that but
for now hard-coded user in there the
user shall have an ID let's again roll
over the keyboard here and the user
should have a registered meetups
property which is an array which will
actually list IDs for example this one
year of meetups the user date register
for and/or implement a registration
functionality soon - that's the state I
want to work with for now now the next
step is to actually add a getter so that
we can use these meetups in other places
of our application I'll add the first
scatter which I'll name loaded meetups
just like the mutation here loaded
meters is a normal getter so it receives
the state and here I want to return
state loaded me taps referring to well
this property up there and then I
actually want to sort them so I call the
sort method a normal JavaScript method
this will then also return a new array
so not this original array but a new
array and sort takes a function which
basically takes cue argument me to have
a and meet a B because it will always
compare a pair of meetups until it has
compared all of them and here we now
return true or false if you return true
that means we'd have a goes first if we
return false
this means B so that allows you to sort
all these pairs and their I now want to
compare meet up a the date which we
haven't added yet so that's a property
we have to add should be greater than
meet up B date so that we just play them
by date so there is a data property to
comparation I'll also add date here and
actually why don't we make this a bit
more readable by splitting all these
properties over separate lines so that's
how we can quickly do that
let's reformat that now that's a bit
more readable and now we can add this
new date property now how should that
look like
for now I'll store it in this format
2017 17 as 717 to reference to 7th July
visuals also something which will
probably change later for now they
should do though and maybe let's put the
second meetup here to 19th July so that
is how we return loaded meetups here
sorting it in together and then
returning this new sorted array I also
want to add a loaded meetup stay
together
so not loaded me depths but only one
here I want you load one single meetup
and I actually want to receive that
meetup ID here to find the right one we
can implement such a methods or such a
gather by returning a function here
actually and that function takes the
meetup ID I will show you how to pass it
to the function soon and then here we
now return our state reach out to our
loaded meetups in the state but then use
the find method to find only one meter
this will be executed for each meetup in
the array so it will execute this
function we pass here to find for each
meetup in the array but then we return
true only if it is to me that we were
looking for and that's the case that the
meetup dot equals the meetup ID we're
passing in here as a function so that is
the second quatre want to get all V does
and want to only load one meetup the one
we selected by ID
now we're not using these getters yet so
let's use them let's start in the home
that view file where we have our color
cell here I now want you well load them
and not hard killed them so I'm going to
get rid of data and instead I'll add
computers here computed is the way to
use view X
Anders since it will update
automatically and always give us the
latest state and here I'll add a
property named meetups or actually what
I'm using here yeah Smith apps so let's
name it meetups here queue we just is
the computer property and here I want to
return this store gathers and then load
it meetups that looks like a good idea
actually we might opt into a different
functionality maybe we want to have some
featured meetups here on the carousel
featured meetups to have not all the
meetups here but only a subset so we can
do that by going back to the store and
adding a new gather featured me that's
the one I'm calling right now
and this actually now is a special
gather here I'll not just receive the
state but also the avid gathers because
here I really want to return getters
loaded meetups referring to dis gather
but then not all the meetups but simply
just a slice where I take the first
meetups and not all of them so now only
returning a subset here at a typo so now
I have two featured meetup scatter which
I'm using here in this computer property
in the home dot view file for my
carousel so with that I'm only fetching
some meetups
let's run anything around EV and see if
we made a mistake thus far and if that
works side note it won't but can you
already tell what won't work go back
here you see we get an error cannot read
property getters of undefined
well we set up the store here right we
exported but we never imported we never
use it i it's not included in our final
bundle so we have to go to the main dot
JS file and actually imported here so
here I'll add I import and I'll import
stored from dot slash store and we could
add slash index but again this specific
web pack config we're using here will
automatically look for index dot JSP and
in there we indeed do export a constant
and store which is why I'm using it
named import here now we have to use it
by simply adding it to our root view
instance now if we save this we get an
error
extra semicolon here in the store we see
where do they do that yeah you're
working with typescript the last day so
I'm back in to put semicolons everywhere
state and now however this looks good we
loaded the same me that's asked for it
but now from our do X store now let's
make sure that we all load them here in
our list of meetups so in the immediate
start view file here I'll now also add a
script area like that
want to export a default object here at
my computed property to be able to get
my meetups here to meetups should also
reach out to the store
oops return this store gathers and then
here it still loaded meetup so not just
the featured ones here but all the
meetups also never make the mistake of
adding parentheses here even though you
set them as up as methods in the index
dot J's files these getters
you don't call them as Gators but as
properties so we're referring to your
loaded meetup scatter now and that gives
us a chance of actually replicating this
card so here I'll add v4 and loop
through meet up in meetups
binds the key to meetup ID now because
you should use a key when going through
a list of something and outputting it
and now we can use that meetup here to
actually replace the hard coded content
with meetup title here the image here
with meetup and then it was image URL if
I'm not mistaken image URL this property
here so we can use that in our meetups
of you file we need to bind source
dynamically with we bind or the shortcut
just colon source the data something we
can all the output though the formatting
won't be super pretty for now meetup
date and that is it actually so here
well almost but there's one other thing
we're now creating a list that's not
super pretty though so maybe we actually
add a margin below the individual card
and for that I'll actually take my for
loop and place it not on the card but on
the V layout to replicate these rows now
you see it looks the same but this now
makes it easy for me to add a class
where we use margin bottom Q maybe learn
about that spacing
to add a little bit of margin so now we
got our meetups distributed here that's
working now there's one thing missing we
need to make this link work right now
it's hard-coded to always point to meet
up slash one
now we're loading the meetups though and
these meetups got an ID so we can
actually use that ID here in the router
link to bind the queue property
dynamically again with be binds to or
just : - and then here it's meetups as a
string here but then combined with
meetup dot and this ensures that our
link now to check it at the bottom or in
the URL once I click it actually loads
the idea of the meetup we actually load
so that is now a way of getting well -
Demi double you want to go to and of
course you could come up with a solution
to actually transform the title of the
meetup into an ID to have a nicer
looking URL here for now I'm going to
stick with that approach here on the
single meetup age though I also don't
want to load you hard killed one so I'll
meet up you here I'll also add a script
section export my default object here
and the computed property because I want
to reach out to view acts here queue and
there I want to get my meetup the one I
load it that should also be a functions
and says well in the computer property I
want to return this state and so we just
store getters and now here it's the
loaded Meetup and do you remember that
once you set it up we actually use this
special syntax of returning a function
which took the meetup ID such getters
can conveniently be called by now adding
parentheses what you normally don't do
but now you're calling the function
you're returning and here we can now
pass the meetup ID we have to get it ID
we could reach out to this colon route
parens ends on or we use
another nice feature of the view router
we expect to get props here I expect to
get the ID as a prop and therefore I can
simply pass this ID by default I don't
get my route parameters as props though
but we can go to the router and actually
set this route which has a dynamic
parameter app to use or to pass
parameters as props to the component
we're loading so you're we do this by
simply setting props to true and that's
all with that you'll now see that is
loads correctly we don't get an error
and you will see that it really works
once you start using the meet up we're
loading here so that we actually output
it here with string interpolation meet a
title replaced earlier replace the
source by adding a colon to make it
dynamic and then pointing to meet up
image URL and then changing the date
that's all we have right now so here
meetup date like that we do that now you
see still works that's to be Devon Paris
I click on the middle in New York we're
in the meetup in New York page so that
is working as expected
of course we still have the location and
dummy text articles in there we're going
to work on this for now I'm super happy
with how that works
that is view X added to the party now
let's see what else you can do with our
application in the next video of this
