made the split between components and
containers though there still is one
problem our application would quickly
get pretty complex to manage or at least
unreadable if it grew more complex
because all the redox code is handled in
the index dot JSON isn't it typically
you would split this up you would create
a new folder in your app folder named
reducers and you might guess what this
folder holds you would also create a new
folder called actions so that's the
typical split you have and then you also
create another file called storage
sheäôs which holds your store so let's
populate them with live step by step
what does the storage JS file do well if
we go to the index chess file it of
course holds our store this one here I
will copy my store or cat it inserted
here but I will not set this to be a
constant its but instead I will set this
to be my default export so the acting
this file exports the store created here
I also since I use logger here need to
import logger from readex logger of
course you may get rid of it entirely if
you don't want the log messages and you
should get rid of it for your production
application of course in order to set up
a store here we also need to import some
things from readex namely the same
things we used in the index.js file
before so that's create store combine
reducers and apply Milla where we also
get the problem that these reducers are
not in the same file so this will not
work for now but I'll come back to this
soon in the index dot JS file I'll get
rid of my own logger here I'll get rid
of the subscription and then I want
creating you reducer files here I'll
create a new reducer file here which
I'll call Mafra user KS and then the
number one which will name user read
user dot j s now the mod producer file
will of course hold my math reducer
which I'll cut and copy into here and
the user reducer well what will this
file hold the user reducer of course now
that should be a constant it should be a
default export and the same is true for
my mofford user your export my index
chess fall its get it getting pretty
lean here isn't it can get rid of all
the imports they don't need anymore
I of course still render my app here I
still hook it up with the provider
component so that is how my index.js
file will look like in the store chess
file and now I need to import my
reducers so I need to import that from
RIT users and then MAF reducer and of
course user read user and what do I want
to import well I could just name this
math and user which allows me to again
use this shorter way of setting this up
like so so now I'm setting up all the
reducers if we have a look at the
application you see it's not running we
get the error that store is not defined
which makes perfect sense because in the
index chest file where I need to pass
store to provider I don't have my store
so I need to import that and to import
it I'm exporting it here as a default
and you store the chair's file so here
I'm importing it from store though with
dot slash at the beginning to mark it as
a relative import store like this now in
order to finally make this work I have
to adjust my reducer files here in order
to be able to export a fat arrow
function what I need to do is I need to
actually store that in a new constant
which I'll name
Moff reducer oops
like this and then export this Moff
reducer constant here without
parentheses so simply put a number words
make it a constant and then export this
constant here like this so if I save
this and reload my application it works
it works if I click this button so now I
split up my reducers I have my smart and
dumb components we're still missing the
actions though so let's take care about
this here I'll also create you new files
the math actions and the user actions
like so now how do i define such actions
actions here i will export multiple
functions here I'll name it add number
for example we'll get a number here and
this will simply return a JavaScript
object setting the type add and setting
the payload to number so that's just one
function I'm going to duplicate this and
have my subtract number function here
which is also the same but with subtract
here as a type and as you can see these
types here are or the way I set them up
here is just as JavaScript object and
dispatching later on that's all these
functions are returning they are
returning this JavaScript object which I
wanted to Spach later on now I'm copying
all this and in my user actions I'll set
up set name and set H here I'll pass H
and name name and age rename this set
name and this to set H like this and now
to hook this up I'll go to my app chest
file and here in the map dispatch to
props where I want to hook up set name
well I still want you hook up set name
and I want to pass name but here I'm
calling dispatch on set name and pass
this name now what is set name here well
set name is something I import from my
actions so import from actions math
actions here for example and I want to
import no not math user actions and I
want to import set name like so and it
should be double quotation marks outside
now to stay consistent so now I'm doing
this if I save this reload my app click
this button it's still working as you
see but now I'm using these actions
files now it would be a valid point to
ask well what's the advantage I still
can't use duplicate action names I still
have the same problem as before if I
want to use a action with a type of add
here I would still have the problem that
I also trigger my math reducer which
listens to add right and now I split it
up over multiple files but what's the
advantage of this the advantage is that
in bigger applications it's much easier
for you to manage your actions and
reducers you're probably seeing the
pattern here that I have math actions
and am off reducer user actions and a
user reducer and I have clear clear
mappings of what I want to use there it
makes very easy for me to maintain
bigger applications to add new actions
to change existing ones and to make sure
that I'm using these actions in the
right way or that I don't get one big
file
all factions and one big file off
reducers but instead I split them up by
features which makes it far more
manageable regarding the issue of having
the problem that I overwrite my my names
for my types here well one workaround
would simply be to prefix your types so
you could see say that set that you have
user set name here at the beginning
since we're in the user actions file and
then of course you will also change your
reducer to listen to user set name and
so on so that overall makes your
application much more manageable and
much cleaner now rightfully you would
say that we're using a lot of
boilerplate code here for this very
basic app here and you would be right
such a simple app is probably nothing
where you want to use Redux but in more
complex apps you'll quickly see it shine
and this initial boilerplate which we
set up here all these files and folders
doesn't have to be expanded anymore
you'll only use or add some new reducers
and action files and components and
containers but you don't have to add
multiple new folders or write much more
code in any of these core root files
here and that's the advantage it's much
more manageable your state as clearly
manage and so is your app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
