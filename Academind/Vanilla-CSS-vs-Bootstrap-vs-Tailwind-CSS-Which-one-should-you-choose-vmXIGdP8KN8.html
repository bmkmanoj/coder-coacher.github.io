have a look at which approach you should
actually take use vanilla CSS so just
CSS write all the styles on your own use
a component framework like bootstrap and
what does this actually mean component
framework or should you use a utility
framework like tailwind CSS we'll have a
look at all of that at the simple
example of a button sounds boring it
isn't
so we want to style that button and
obviously styling a button is not the
biggest challenge you face as a web
developer but it's a good example for
the question I'll try to help you answer
in this video should you do it on your
own
should you use a framework for that a
component framework or a utility
framework now let's do it on our own
here's the HTML code for this button and
right now I only have a little bit of
styling setup for the container to
basically present this button in the
middle of the screen here's our button
and since it's the only button on the
page I can select with the button
selector but let's still use a class
that's maybe named this class button
though so if we want to start us on our
own we simply add a class to that button
with that well button class we just
setup and now how do we want to style it
well maybe we want to inherit the
general font of our page
and therefore also set a general font
for this page with a fun family of cents
serif at least to not use this ugly
serif default I have on my system
otherwise maybe you want you overwrite
the border to be 1 pixel solid and then
in this purple 5 to 175 one maybe want
to set a background color of that same
purple and therefore set the text color
to white and with that if we reload it's
already looking not too shabby
maybe we then also wanted to add some
padding to the button jus well let's say
three pixels top and bottom and six
pixels left and right so this is how we
use the padding shorthand like this
let's maybe add 10 pixels left and right
looks better and we probably also want
to add a cursor:pointer and also add a
hover and an active style so button
active button hover like this and in
there I want to set the background color
to
basically the same purple though I will
pick a slightly brighter one maybe this
one here just with the color picker
which is integrated into my IDE so that
now I got a little bit of a hover effect
if I go over that yeah doesn't look too
bad and last but not least I want to
override the Focus style to set I'd
outline tuned on there with that I got a
nice button which I can click and which
I start otally on my own and if you want
to learn more about CSS in general how
to write styles and way more than these
basics definitely check out my complete
guide on CSS which I got link can be
found in the video description however
you probably didn't look into this video
just to see how you can style a button
after all these lines of code are maybe
interesting but all something you do a
lot now imagine you of course have a
bigger web page with way more than just
a button on it and you need to style all
elements that are on that page if you
write these styles on your own if you're
not using any CSS framework then
obviously everything has to be styled
and positioned and layout it by you now
let's compare this approach here to
using component framework like bootstrap
so let's wizard get bootstrap calm I
also got a serious on bootstrap on this
channel in case you want to dive deeper
and on bootstrap let's check out the
documentation and there let's go to
components and let's whizz it the button
section there and as we see here we add
the button class and then we decide with
button primary secondary and so on which
stalled but you should have and we get
the hover style and all that out of the
box automatically so what we need to do
for that to work is just click on
getting started grab that CDN link which
gives us the bootstrap CSS package from
a CDN let's simply import it here can
remove that import here by the way
that's from old snippet we're not using
an external style file and in here in or
with the help of this import here
we can simply start using these
bootstrap classes like button button
primary or maybe let's not override this
one but simply add a second one so that
we can see the difference and now we
only add two classes and if I go back
and reload well unsurprisingly we got
that bootstrap button next to ours the
cool thing is we of course didn't write
any styling for that and we got the full
behavior we want out of the box that
already shows us a big advantage of
component frameworks like bootstrap we
just start adding CSS classes to our
HTML code we don't need to write a
single line of CSS code if we don't want
you we can simply start working with the
different components and layout options
this framework gives us this already all
shows us the disadvantage of course
we're bound or we're limited to use what
bootstrap in this case you can use any
other framework of course what it gives
us if we want this to look differently
we can of course override it with our
own CSS code but if we start over
writing a lot we quickly end up in a
situation where probably using that
framework isn't the right choice in the
first place
because then we got the worst of both
worlds we're pulling in this extra
library which of course needs to be
downloaded by the user
and we're still writing our own code
which also needs to be downloaded and
we're not even saving time then still if
we don't plan on overwriting a lot using
bootstrap or its elaborate component
library definitely is a great thing we
save time there is a third way though
there are utility libraries like
tailwind CSS we can wizard the tail and
page and there we learn that Taylan is a
utility CSS framework now what does this
mean it means that unlike bootstrap
Tailwind doesn't give us automatically
pre-styled components like buttons cards
and so on it instead gives us utility
classes which add a shadow which colors
something in a certain way which color
the text in a certain way and we can
build our own components with the help
of these utility classes this means that
we
have to write less CSS code not zero we
probably still need to do some things
which the framework doesn't offer but we
can simply add a bunch of utility
classes combined with our own styles to
get our final result so here if I add a
firt button and we then import tailwind
CSS which we do by clicking on
installation here on their page here we
also got a link to a CDN so let's
quickly add this next to our bootstrap
link and with that edit we can go down
to our button here and now we can start
adding some of the classes table and CSS
offers us and you can of course find all
these classes in their documentation
there are things like rip background
purple for example and hover : BG -
purple dark - Turner's to a darker
button when we hover over it then things
like text whites to give it a white text
color maybe a font which should be bold
and then also some padding on the y-axis
so top and bottom with py - and all to
the left right with px for and then
rounded corners now these are all just
classes the framework offers us you can
look them up in their documentation to
learn which classes are available and
how they work
they generally always follow that
pattern of giving you that utility to
assign a color a background color some
padding margin stuff like that if we
save that and we reload the page we get
this button here which also behaves and
looks like a button which is not a
priest style component but compose as we
need it but with the help of tailwind
CSS so that's like the middle way there
in between way between write everything
on your own and use a component
framework where you get everything
working out of the box but which one
should you use then first of all here's
a quick summary vanilla CSS means we
write all the styles on our own and
therefore we can style everything as we
wanted of course we therefore have to
know how to write CSS component
frameworks like foundation is an
alternative to bootstrap basically or
bootstrap
give you everything pre-styled and you
mainly use the classes they give you the
CSS classes and utility frameworks like
tailwind CSS are in between and they
help you build your layout and your
stars with utility CSS classes which one
should you use them well vanilla CSS
obviously gives you full control that's
awesome you got full control over two
styles your writing you don't
necessarily have unnecessary code of
course if you write bad CSS code then
you might end up with spaghetti code or
a lot of unnecessary CSS rules but in
general you can control which code you
need and which one you use the downside
especially and I'll come back to that
with component frameworks like bootstrap
is that you import a lot which you might
never use back to vanilla CSS though
there we can also name classes as
exactly as we want
so for tail and CSS you set up padding
with two top and bottom with py two and
so on that might be unintuitive so it's
something you have to get used to with
custom CSS you decide how things should
be named the downs out of course however
is that you have to build everything
from scratch that's a lot of work
obviously that you have to paint here
off writing bad code because maybe
you're not a CSS pro and maybe you're
not really knowing how CSS works and you
just copy solutions from Stack Overflow
which is fine to a certain extent but
which can also lead to bad code if you
don't know what you're doing so these
are downsides of vanilla CSS for
component frameworks like bootstraps you
can develop very very fast of course
everything works as soon as you add a
CSS class to an element and that of
course means you get a prototype or a
complete product page up and running
extremely fast you typically also a half
code behind the scenes that follows best
practices and therefore is performant
and not too long too big and you don't
need to be a CSS expert you can just
start using beautiful styles without
even knowing CSS in the end that is why
bootstrap was super popular like three
four years ago and why it still is
popular
these days downside of course no or
little control now with bootstrap as you
also learn in my bootstrap series on
this channel you can override the
defaults it sets you can customize its
theme but that's more advanced and still
might not always be the best way for you
to really get the result you want you
might also have unnecessary overhead
code if you import the entire bootstrap
library and you just style buttons and
images and you never touch things like
you never use the cards you never throw
these alerts it offers you well then you
import all these Styles still without
using them so that might be a downside
and one thing you can sometimes see all
websites look the same
you can customize bootstrap themes but
they tend to have a shared look so a
look which you just recognize if you
work with it a bit that might be totally
okay for you it can also be something
you don't want though now what about
utility frameworks like tailwind CSS
tailwind CSS and Co they also allow you
to develop faster the fast way because
you just start adding more classes than
with bootstrap but still you start
adding classes you don't need to write
that much code they also typically just
as bootstrap should follow best
practices so you typically can rely on
that and here too you don't need to be
an expert you probably need to write
some custom CSS code because it doesn't
offer everything you want in exactly the
way you wanted but it's certainly less
code then if you build everything from
scratch the downside of course still is
little control more control than with
bootstrap and so on but still you're
using a CSS framework so you don't have
full control that's just the nature of
it although you might still have
unnecessary overhead code if you import
the entire library and you don't use the
margin top and bottom helper class well
then you still have it imported
so that's downside here q and with all
that the question of course is what's
the verdict what should you do and it
depends on your CSS knowledge the time
you have for your project and which kind
of project it is
is it for your company where you have
your own brand and your own style guide
anyways and it's rather hard to squeeze
bootstrap into that well probably you
got no other chance then styling
everything from scratch do you enjoy
working with CSS are you an expert or do
you want to become better at it
well besides taking my course then
writing stuff on your own also is a
great practice in the end if that is not
the case however if you want to finish a
product as quick as possible
if you want to finish your webpage as
quick as possible and or if you don't
know CSS that well using bootstrap might
be awesome you get great-looking results
quickly if you were kind of in between
or if you know CSS but are now expert
and still you want to style some things
on your own a utility framework like
tail end might be the best choice
actually in a lot of situations that
might be really helpful and it's
definitely worth playing around with it
so that's my overview that is my opinion
on these things that is my answer to
some of the questions I got regarding
what should you do and I hope it's
helpful hopefully see you in our videos
