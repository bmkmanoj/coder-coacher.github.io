a comment below a couple of videos is
that some of you would be interested in
seeing how to set up larval homestead
and I thought this would be a great idea
to make a video about you
so the roadmap for this video and the
next videos is that in this video I will
explain what level homestead is next
with you we will install it and in the
last with you I will dive a little bit
deeper into how to configure it and how
we can use it and how we can adjust it
to our needs so what is level homestead
lateral hopes that in the end is a box
for vagrant and now what is vagrant
vagrant is a virtual machine'
provisioning service and what is this
well a virtual machine basically is a
computer running on your computer to put
it simply it has its own operating
system it has its own resources which
are assigned to this virtual machine and
we may use it like a well like a
computer like our laptop for example
just that it runs inside our main
operating system or main machine have
you can use virtual machines for many
tasks because while we have this clear
separation and we can try out things
there that won't well destroy our main
computer because if we mess something up
well we just finish we shut down the
words from a seed machine and start up a
new one for example now this is the
point where way current comes in if we
start up a virtual machine if we create
one we have to well install the
operating system Linux for example and
we also if we want to use it for web
development we have to install PHP a
webserver my sequel we have to configure
everything and so on the job where grant
does here is that it allows us to kind
of define a basic configuration so
called boxes which include the operating
system and a couple of other programs
like for example a web server like
Apache or engines or a
P interpreter that are already installed
on that and using way current we can
then quickly start up new virtual
machines that use this default
configuration and that of course has the
great advantage that if we shut down a
virtual machine and start a new one it
is exactly the same as the last one was
and for web development this is of
course great because we can ever use one
virtual machine per project though that
will take up quite some space on your
computer or we have one virtual machine
for all our projects but nonetheless if
we say once you shut down to free up
resources or whatever then well we can't
just restart it with the same settings
as before now that being said of course
while destroying shutting down the
virtual machine beta database and so on
will be lost however it is possible and
this is where homestead also comes in to
configure for example which databases we
want to have when starting up our
virtual machine and using label
migrations then for example we can
quickly well get the database back into
the state that was before for our
development purposes so does the
advantage that we have thus clear
separation from our development
environment configurations the server
config and so on we need for that and
our local computer or laptop or whatever
that we don't have to spoil our own
machine with a couple of different web
servers or whatever and we have to
separation also it's quickly possible to
well use our pre-configured boxes or our
boxes then homestead to get our features
like at our web server or the same web
server with a different configuration
and this is really powerful so this is
way grunt now as I already said
homestead is just a box a bundled
configuration so to say which wavelet
can use to set up a certain machine
which uses the software level homestead
comes with and what is the software lets
how look at the official
little page in there the homestead
section now as you see there what we do
have is this soft word Ubuntu 1404 as
the operating system get PHP seven and
Ching's as a server my sequel and a
bunch of other useful server software
and this is of course great because this
is a perfect web development environment
out of the blocks hit it a little at
liberality so this is really great and
other questions how do we set all these
things up and this will be targeted in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
