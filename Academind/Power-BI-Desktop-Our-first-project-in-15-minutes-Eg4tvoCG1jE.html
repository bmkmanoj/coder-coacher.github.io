your desktop in this video we will get
data work on that data and finally
create a visualization a world map to be
more precise in case you are not sure
what you can see right here just take a
look at this video otherwise just stay
here and take a look at our first
project now so this is the starting
screen that we can see when we open
power of your desktop the important
button is that get data button right
here if we click that then this menu
opens and as you can see you can connect
part of your desktop to a lot of
different sources well actually we don't
have any sources at the moment right so
a really good source could be if we
simply go to other right here and then
double click on web I guess now you can
see that we only need a URL with data in
it of course and as soon as we got that
we can simply import the data or
actually connect power bi desktop to
this data on this web page now let's
first find a web page with some data in
it so this is the table that I would
like to visualize in power bi desktop we
simply have paid up for 30 cities
regarding the passengers at the
corresponding airports now you can find
the link to that page of course down
there in the video description so what
we have to do right now is we simply
have to copy the URL up here like this
now go back to power bi desktop and
simply paste the URL right here then we
click OK and wait a few seconds of
course and now this navigator opens this
navigator allows us to specify what data
we want to connect power of your desktop
to so this means if we simply click on
to document right here then we see that
we probably selected the wrong data at
the moment the good thing is we can
simply change your web view appear and
if you now scroll down a little bit like
this then we can see that table 0
is the table that we want to connect
power of your desktop to if we now
simply tick that box right here which is
then also ticked in this left part and
switch back to the table view appear
then you can see that generally yes we
have the right data but you can also see
that there is a lot of information in it
at the moment which we don't actually
need and this is the reason why we have
to decide between load and edit at the
moment because the difference is as
follows if we press loads down here now
then this data will be automatically
loaded into our real data model if we
press edit then we will go to the query
editor this is kind of a separate tool
inside of power bi desktop that allows
you to prepare your data so you can for
instance delete rows which include
information that you don't need as soon
as you finished your work in that query
editor then you load the data into the
real data model and this is really
important because if you really clean
your data in a good way this means for
example you get rid of all the
unrequired information then you only
load the important data into the data
model and by that your data model
becomes smaller and more efficient
because it consumes less memory this is
the reason why we now select edit right
here like this and now we are in this
query editor so in this data preparation
tool and in the center you can see the
information that we connected power bi
desktop to now so if we just scroll
around right here so we can scroll to
the right for example to see all the
columns we can also scroll down if we
want to and see the last row for example
well then we see that we have some work
to do the first thing we have to do is
we should get rid of those first five
rows because these roles include
information well that we don't need but
if we look into row number 6 and scroll
to the right then we can see that this
total value right here this is something
that we should keep and that's the
reason why we only delete Row one to
five so to delete rows in power of your
desktop you
and simply go to the home ribbon which
you can find up here and now in this
reduce rose area right here you can
click on to remove rose and in our case
we want to start removing rose from the
top so we simply press remove top rose
like this and now we said that we want
to delete the first five rows so we
simply type five and press ok and you
can see that we immediately deleted the
first five rows of all the columns of
course but we now have this new first
row and this row includes information
that we don't want to delete because
what we actually want is we want to have
this total right here as the column name
so we could of course delete that row
and simply rename the column this is one
way but the more easy way is to simply
go again to the home ribbon right here
and now select this use first row as
headers option if we click that then you
can see that we now renamed that column
to total and the first row is of course
gone which is totally correct at the
moment for us now another thing we
should do is we should scroll down to
the last row because as far as I
remember yes this information this is
also not required and as we already know
how this works well we can simply do it
quickly by going to the home ribbon
again where we still are now go to
remove rows right here press that and
now don't select the top rows but the
bottom rows like this and only select
one row now we press ok again and as you
can see now the last row is also deleted
this is fine now we talked about the
roles but I think it's all the time to
take a look at the columns now and to be
honest I don't think we need all the
columns we have right here if we scroll
to the left like this column one and
column two I don't think that's required
the same thing is true if we scroll to
the right like this well we don't need
this column and that column so basically
we only need this color
and this total column now to delete
these columns we have now multiple
options but a really easy option is to
simply go again to the home ribbon now
go to choose columns right here press
that select choose columns again like
this and now let's simply select the
columns that we want to keep well in our
case we can first unselect all of the
columns and now only select this one and
the total column so the two columns that
we want to keep now we press ok down
here and as you can see I now cannot
scroll to the left and to the right
anymore because we only have these two
columns left this was also quite easy
right so let's now take a look at the
column name maybe the column name in
this case well I don't think this is a
good name so we should rename that to
city well to do this we simply double
click on to the column right city
central center now we rename that column
this is also nice but I don't think
you're done with the columns yet there
are two more things that I would like to
change the first thing is I would like
to get rid of all the information after
the comma because we have the city right
here
which is enough and I don't need that
country information afterwards to do
this we again as a great function in
power bi desktop and this function can
simply be found in the transform ribbon
right here now we go to the extract
option right here and if we click onto
that we can now specify what kind of
information we want to extract from the
column that we selected in our case we
would like to keep all the information
that is left to a specific delimiter in
our case the delimiter is this comma
right here well so we can simply select
the text before delimiter option like
this now define the delimiter which is
the common our case like that and if we
now press ok well then you can see that
we only have the city names now in our
column
so the country information is gone again
this was really easy right now let's
take a look at the second column this
total column right here what I don't
like right here is that we have this
spaces between the different numbers I
would also like to change that well to
change this we simply have to go back to
the home ribbon right here and now
select the replace value option right
there
if we click onto that then we simply
have to specify which value we want to
find in our case we actually only want
to find a space so I press space right
now on the keyboard and replace it with
well nothing because then the space is
gone and then we have the number the way
you'd want it to be so we type space
right here and cannot press ok
and again as you can see this perfectly
worked and now we're actually done with
our two columns so we now have the
information about the city and the
corresponding passengers well one less
thing is maybe there that we should
change this is the formatting of that
second column right here at the moment
this is formatted at text and you can
see that easily by this ABC symbol up
here and if you click onto that then you
can see that ABC well this is text so
maybe it makes more sense to change that
formatting from text to a decimal number
for example like this and as you can see
now that's ABC changed to one two so we
got that we now worked on the rows
worked on the columns and change the
formatting and we only needed this
simple steps for that pretty awesome
right and now we also finished our work
in this curia deter so in this data
preparation step this means that we
aren't all ready to finally note the
data we have right here into our real
data model so we need to leave that
query editor and we can do this by going
to the home ribbon we still are and now
press until close and apply right here
now we are in the data model you can see
the interface is different and also the
functions are but we're going to talk
about that in detail right now the only
thing you have to know is that we left
this creditor and we are now in the
actual data model at the moment we are
in the so called report view this is the
view where we will create our
visualization in a few seconds but first
I want to show you something else
because we can change from this report
view that we selected right here to the
data view which is the second option
right there if I click onto that then
you can see our two columns or actually
our whole table that we imported into
that data model and we need to adjust
one important thing before we create our
chart this first column the city right
here is text at the moment so power bi
doesn't know that we have cities in here
and as I would like to create a world
map it might be important that power bi
is aware of the fact that these are
cities to make sure that power bi knows
this we simply have to select the column
which we already did now go to the
modeling ribbon up here and now change
the data category so we simply click on
to that and at the moment we have that
uncharacterized category which is not
true because if you look at the second
option right here city then this is the
right option for our data we have right
here so if we click on to city then we
well we don't see that it changed right
the only thing we see is that symbol
right here so apparently some kind of
geographical information is now
available in a data model let's see now
if this works by creating our
visualization and to do this we simply
have to go to the report view right here
and now create our visualization as I
said I would like to create a world map
and to create something like this you
simply go to that visualizations column
right here and now select that symbol
right here map if we
to that then we see this frame right
here this is actually the area our chart
will be displayed in as soon as we load
some data into it of course at the
moment we don't have staidum so we can
simply change the size of our future
chart by clicking right here and
dragging it right there for example well
and now we need to get the data into
that visualization and to do this we can
simply go to this field column right
here now select the city for example and
drag it to the location area right here
because now we see the different cities
that we have so this 40 cities on the
world map but we didn't load the data so
the actual passenger amount into our
visualization well to do this we can
simply drag and drop this total column
right here down here into this size area
like this and now you can see that the
size of these bubbles changed depending
on the passenger amount but you might
have a problem with identifying the
different cities you can also change
that quickly in part of your desktop the
only thing you have to do is you have to
go to this formatting area right here if
you click right there and simply add the
category labels right here like this
then you can see that we now have the
names of all the cities that we have in
our data but this is too much
information right so maybe we should
apply a filter as I lasted and only
display the top five cities for example
this can also be done quite easily we
only need to go back to our fields area
right here now scroll down a little bit
and here in this filters area we can now
simply well filter our data so we click
on to city right here
change the filter type from basic
filtering to top n maybe scroll down a
little bit and now define which items
should be presented in our case I would
say we select the top five cities for
sample and now we have to decide well
the top five cities by what and by what
this is the passenger amount right here
so we drag that into this field right
here like this and press apply filter
like that well and if we not unselected
visualization you can see that we now
have a world map visualization with
different bubbles with different sizes
depending on the passenger amount of the
top five cities in our data and this is
it this was our first project we
connected how the data to data clean
that data loaded the data into the data
model and created that visualization
with those few steps only I think this
is pretty great so if you want to know
more about power bi desktop now I would
be really happy to see you in the next
videos but we will talk about more
things in power of your desktop or I
would also be happy to welcome you in my
power bi a complete introduction udemy
course you can find the link to that
course at a discount price down there in
the video description however this is it
for the moment thanks a lot for watching
and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
