video we left when we well kind of had
our list we had the first item we had
the general styling now and this is the
next value I want to make this an actual
list and I want you at the moment not
replaced dummy data but I want to create
a special type for the data we output
here and we'll start with this in this
with you so at the moment if you have a
look at our Weber item I'm outputting
well hard killing a text here that
certainly isn't the believer I want and
I'll start with creating a new file
which will hold a special class I'm
going to create which will define my
Weber item so I will just call this
Weber dot TS now our description here
because this is just a class just a
typescript class which kind of defines
the type Weber item which I will use
throughout this app then I will
therefore your let me zoom in a bit
export a class and I will call this just
Weber item for sake of completeness or
to stay consistent I will call this file
weather item TS and now let's see how
this class should look like if we have a
look at our weather item component we
see that each Weber item seems to have a
city name it seems to have some kind of
weather description here and it seems to
have a temperature these are three
things we see here therefore in my class
I will know I will add a constructor and
inside this constructor argument list
here I will specify the three properties
this class will have and by doing this
here in the constructor I of course also
provide this constructor so that I can
easily create new items with the new
operator we will see this in a second so
what I will do here
is I want to have a public property city
name I also and this will be a string I
also want to have a public property
that's called a description this will
also be a string and I will have have a
public temperature and let's make this a
number so this is my weather item class
here and then in my weather item
component what I will do is I will for
the moment add a constructor here too
and all I do here is I will create some
dummy data so I will create here or add
a property which will call whoever item
this will be the weather item displayed
in this Webber item component and this
is not a dummy thing I will need this
later
I will only fill it with Demi data in a
constructor in a second and this weather
item property will of course be of type
weather item this is the classic just
created or the type which has created
and you can see it here at the top that
the import Weber item was added and this
is how you generally create your own
types in typescript you can do this fire
interfaces like you probably saw in my
first English you series I have here on
the channel
or you just create new classes which of
course are then types because you can
create instances of these classes and
we're going to create such a instance
here in the constructor whereas okay my
web item will be a new Weber item so I'm
creating a new instance of this class
because if you remember maybe what you
heard about object orientated
programming classes are like blueprints
what did you find here in this file is
the blueprint how each instance of this
class should look like which properties
or methods
it should have in this case only these
three properties so here I'm going to
create a new instance of the new keyword
here and I will well let's say gives us
the name of London and I want to have
description which says rainy and I think
that kind of fits you London and then
let's say we want to have 32 degrees
Celsius let's say the Celsius by default
but you may of course use Fahrenheit
whatever you like now in my template
here I'll enter template expression 2 or
I add this expression here to output
data now we haven't had a look at this
in this series I of course had my first
thing let you series what I'm doing here
is I'm using string interpolation by
using double curly braces here in my
normal HTML code and this allows me to
enter any expression between these curly
braces this might be any shower close to
any JavaScript expression I might want
to write here so I can write JavaScript
code here just be sure not to add a line
break that won't work but in this case
all I will do is I will write whether
item too well output is property
basically now of course this is a class
this is an object so I will access the
city name property of this object and
this is all how I do it I I would put
this information by using the double
curly braces and then just entering the
property name and in this case s is an
object the property name of that object
which I want to refer but if I had like
a property my numbered which is equal to
2 I could just output my number here of
course but we don't have to here so
whoever items city name is going to be
let me save this and as you see the rest
here did not update because I have not
taken care about this year but the
Webber ID of city name London is right
here so this works
now a string interpolation is one form
of data binding and we're going to see a
lot more forms of data binding
throughout the next videos but data
binding is essentially a key thing in
angular 2 which allows us to manipulate
our templates and to let components work
together to have data flow for
application and finally to render it to
the screen of course so this is my city
name I'll add an average string
interpolation here and this time I will
refer to the description of my Weber
item and then here of course I will
replace the number with weather item dot
temperature now here remember that
temperature is a number and I'm
outputting it here is a string which
will work fine because JavaScript is
able to well cast this number to a
string so this won't be a problem here
and after look here it already updated
you can see it added now say it's rainy
instead of clouds and well all this
works just to make this little bit more
realistic let's make this four degrees
and looks good so this is how we add our
own types add our own class and output
data dynamic data kind of with data
binding string interpolation in this
case in the next video we will actually
make this a list and make sure that we
got multiple entries here see you there
