here and it's really time to jump into
it in this quick start video you'll
learn everything about setting up your
development environment both components
directives data binding two-way data
binding and how you get started with
your very first angular 2 application so
this is what we like sack people we will
build this nice little shopping list
application here where we are able to
add items added items and delete items
and we will cover a lot of the
fundamentals of an angular 2 application
so let's get started alright here's my
empty workspace now for setting up my
project I have got two options here
first one is head over to angular dot IO
go to their docks check out their
5-minute QuickStart and here I'll find
everything I need to set up my
development and fire environment but I
don't like that very much
I'll instead go to github and here I got
my by a boilerplate repo where I
basically set up or created a repository
which when I clone it has everything I
need to get started writing angular 2
apps right away so I'll do that fire up
my terminal here and I'm in my project
folder here and here I'll just type git
clone and then enter the link to my
repository here one status then I'll
open this folder here copy all the
contents I got in here into my root
folder get rid of this one here there
needed and now I'll execute NPM install
to install all the dependencies and
packages required and once it's this is
done I'll see you again somewhere
installation is finished now I will just
execute NPM start to start my live
server here and I'll just drag that over
here so that we can see it here so this
is my application running and I'll fire
up another terminal here and just
execute go up to get my job compiling
going which will compile my typescript
files and my CSS files now regarding the
folder structure here in my dev folder
I'll have an I'll have all my typescript
file
so the source code of application the
assets folder I have my CSS code for
styling and in the app folder the
typescript files will be compiled too so
I won't change anything here and in my
source folder
well my for example styling will get
compiled too so I'll only work in the
Daffy and then the assets folder here
now as you can see I got my hello world
text here running and that is because in
my root component the app component here
I have this hello world text in my
template now this is a component
component I created myself components
are a key part of any angular 2
application they are essentially
directives which have a few attached to
them so something the user can see and
your angular 2 application will be
composed of several components working
together now here as you can see I get a
selector of app which means I can embed
this component in my HTML code by using
an HTML tag so to say which just
contains app and I do it is here in my
index.html file where I got my app tags
here with the text of loading between
them so that this text is displayed in
case of something goes wrong or it is
indeed just loading so if i refresh this
page you see this loading text blink up
for a second so this is my root HTML
file which has my root component or at
moment my only component embedded here
and this is when will be loaded when
this component gets embedded into this
file of course just outputting plain
text isn't that exciting and we will
change this in this video now for this
component to be recognized by angular 2
and to be bootable I have my boot GS
file which just executes one method the
bootstrap method which basically loads
up my app component so that angular 2
knows this app component should be
loaded upon the start of this
application so when this page is loaded
that is readily readily available and
can be displayed on this page here so
this is the basic set up I got here and
that's the basic setup you'll have in
any of your angular 2 applications
now I showed you the beginning of the
video what we're going to build in this
video and therefore I'll first need a
component which basically displays my
shopping list and I will therefore
create a new component here which I will
call shopping list plot component dot es
that's like naming convention the
angular 2 team put out into the world to
say that we specify which kind of file
which kind of calm classical style so in
this case we're defining a component
just hit OK
and now for this to work I first have to
import the component package from the
angular queue or the component class
from the angular 2 package I do this by
typing import and then in curly blazes
Grace's component from angular 2 core
this will enable me to give the class I
specify in this file file a decorator of
type component so to mark this class as
a component see how to do this first I
wrap my class and I export it which is
the typescript specific thing which
basically says make this class available
outside of this file and it will be
called shopping list component so camel
case naming convention here and it won't
include any logic as of now but at the
moment it's just a just a normal class
now to make it a component I attach a
decorator decorator is something which
is really easy to do in typescript and
which just add some metadata to the
class and which will basically then make
it a component or make angular to
recognize it as a component so therefore
I add this add sign component and then
from the season in the parentheses I
specify a JavaScript object with curly
braces and now we can give this class or
it is component some color
raishin which really makes it then a
component because a component is
basically just a virtue directive which
also has a few now here we want to give
this a selector so again an HTML tag we
can then use in the rest of our
application which should just be let's
say yeah I guess shopping list makes
sense and I'll also give you the
template so that we can see that it was
actually embedded by just writing this
is the shopping list save this and now
to display this component here in our
template template I'll just use backtick
notation here so these are cute back
ticks which allows me to expand a string
over several lines and here I'll just
have my this is the app component and
then I'll have my shopping list which is
just add by writing shopping list here
now if I save this my page gets reloaded
but we don't see the shopping list here
this is because I include the shopping
list tag here but my app component
doesn't know what a shopping list should
be and just as I have to tell my app in
the boot ts file that it should load an
app component I'll have to tell my app
component that it should load the
shopping list component and I do this by
adding their directives metadata here
and this specifies our array of yet
directives and as I said a component is
a directive which should be loaded in
this application or in this component so
that I can use it in yeah in the
template for example of this component
so do this by just specifying my
shopping list component here and very
important this import works
automatically added with by phpstorm
here so you need always to import the
components or the classes you're using
in your components in classes in your
files so now if I save this we see that
I got this is the shopping list here
now let's get rid of this this is the
app component and here I get rid of this
and now let's let's output us a list now
I'll define a property of my class here
which will hold my some items I want to
output on this shopping list
so we'll call it public shopping list
items and this is just an array of some
strings so let's say we have milk sugar
and bread now to output this I take
these items here I'll first change this
to backtick notation again so that I can
write on multiple lines and now I want
you somehow loop through this array and
here we will use a directive so another
component but just a directive a
structural directive so to say which
will change our document and we need
some kind of flip so the ng4 directive
seems about right
so I'll add an ordered list here and
inside this unordered list I obviously
have my list item and these list items I
won't write free list items just one and
I'll add the ng4 directive now a
structural directive which changes the
document on depending on a condition or
on the on the math to be executed in it
too so to say has always has a star at
the beginning so mg4 is to name them
star ng4 and the star is very important
it's part of the directive name equals
and now in quotation marks I'll write
the logic so to say the logic which
defines this loop and then we'll loop
through all my items and shopping list
items so it will have shopping list item
of shopping list items there now here
between the l8x I want to output the
item now and I can simply eunice by
using this name here and I need to add a
hash tag that's very important because
this is a local variable
the hashtag in front of it specifies
that this is a local variable which is
only available within in this case the
context of this loop so I would would
not be able to use shopping lists
outside here like here I could not
access the value of this variable here
but I can exit it inside access it
inside of loop so it's just out put it
here and I do this by using this curly
brace notation which is just the anger
to template some tags were part of the
angular 2 templating engines able to say
which allows me to basically test output
a string now if I save this you can see
I got my free shopping list items here
now let's say I want these items to be
clickable and then I want to be able to
change their name I'll do this by first
adding an input field down here type
text is OK and then I want I click
listener in this list item element here
therefore I'll let me just structure
this sort of this easier to read for you
I'll add a click event and I do this by
using parentheses click equals now as
you can see here we got the star because
it's a structural directive here we got
parentheses because it's an event that's
the kind of logic anglers who follows
but you can clearly see what this
special directive is doing and
parentheses means event star means
structural directive it changes the
document and later we will also see
curly braces which just means bind
something to there are in push some data
to this element so to say so this click
event should execute a method let's say
on item clicked and I'll pass the item
on which we clicked by just again using
this local variable here because in
aside this loop it is available now
he'll here I'll just define this method
which is on item clicked
and receives this shopping list item now
what will I do here the problem is I
want to access this item in this input
field so that I can change it but I
can't use this local variable here so I
will create a new variable which I just
call public select selected item and
this will then here be bound to the
shopping list item I clicked on and now
I can use it here now here we will use
two-way binding something angular one
was really popular for it to be able to
both see it and change it so as I said
we would use square brackets to push
data to the element or to get it to
display data in element or set binds the
data to this element so we need this
because we will display the name of the
selected item into the element but we
will also use curly braces because we
will have events here namely when we
change it that will trigger something
namely if they will put it back to us a
day they will reflect the change in our
list here so we have both directions
going on and to do this we then use the
special ngmodel directive here which is
necessary for two-way binding and set us
to selected item now if I save this we
got that and if I click on these items
you can see the load up around here but
as you can see we got no two-way binding
going on here this is because here we
get plain strings now let's make these
objects JavaScript objects so therefore
create some objects way which all will
just have a name like milk and then
let's say sugar and bread again this one
here will then also be such a item just
you find an empty item as if now and now
here we have to change this because now
we have an object here
so we need to access the name property
save this and now we get this and now if
I change it to say I'm lucky way that is
working so now we get the ability to to
change our items on the list here now
let's also add the ability of adding
items to the list so let me just add a
button below here and this is called add
item and it will also trigger event
which has the name on add item and the
item will be this one here I'll just
give it new item for chest let's give me
shopping shopping list item here this
will be used here so same name as here
but not the same variable since we're in
a different context on add item shopping
list item and now let me take my
shopping list items area and push a new
item to it namely the shopping list item
here let's save this try it out by
adding let's say honey
now you might expect this to work but it
doesn't because this variable is not
bound to the value of this field but the
whole input field so in order to just
get the value I have to use dot value
here which will here basically just give
me the value of this field but this
isn't enough because now it would pass
just string but we need to pass such an
object here so to do this I'll push a
new object which has the name property
and this value now if this reloads and
we now add honey you see it showing up
there now if you change bread here this
changes and we can again add it and we
can add let's say um
apples now as you can see we also change
the name of this
that's why I'll just change it such that
we have one input field for adding new
items and one for editing that currently
a while it was here so that's the basic
setup here now last thing is I want to
be able to delete items from the
shopping list here and I will do this by
let's say just adding a delete item
button next to this input here so button
delete item let me add break here so
that we get two separate lines and this
will again have our click event here
which executes the on delete item
function edit will obviously delete the
selected item which I don't really have
to pass here because it is already
stored here so let me create this
function here on the lead item no
arguments and this will just use our
list shopping list items array index off
this selected item so we find out where
is this item in our index and then I'll
use the splice function to get rid of
this selected item here save this now if
I click on sugar I can delete it and I
can again add sugar here now that
doesn't do anything anymore but I can
now delete it again and this is how I
can interact with the shopping list and
now this is your very first bird basic
angular 2 application we build but it
uses a lot it has components it has
directive structural directives two-way
data-binding
and so on so a lot of cool stuff going
on which is a little bit core of really
any angular 2 application and if you are
interested in building a more complex
application be sure to check out my
complete tutorial series I got here in
this channel on angles you
I'll be very happy to see you there have
a nice day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
