first component wasn't it but it was
worth it it's so important to understand
what you're doing and with what you're
working so let's start with the first
component then I told you that react.js
is all about building UIs and well
components so how do we build such
components
it all starts by importing react we're
using es6 import syntax for that
importing it from react that's the
package name and import something from
react dawn now I'm getting some IDE
errors here because my IDE still thinks
I'm writing es6 code so just yeah think
you'll change this no I have paper set
up on my own all the IDE magic here well
so pull in something from react Tom and
to something is the render method which
allows me to render my component later
on to the dawn so with that I got only
required dependencies now it's time to
create a component as well how do you do
it it's actually really simple you
create a new class with this year six
class keyword name it whatever you want
to name it I'm going to name mine app
since it's my first component my root
component kind of and then this is
important it has to extend the base
component in the react package so react
component with that boom you get a new
component but not a very useful one
right now components have a lot of built
in methods you can use and I will come
back to them in a later video when I
talk about the component lifecycle a
very important method you need to have
if you want to have your component do
anything which you can see on the screen
is the render method this method is
called by react.js whenever react.js
thinks it needs to render the component
and I'll come back to when it thinks it
needs to render a component
the labor with you basically it has a
right way of thinking so it will
rerender it when it's necessary and then
you define what it has to do when
rendering this component now you might
have noticed that until now we have no
place where we store the HTML code and a
component of course is not only about
JavaScript it's also about HTML code
right it's about elements which get at
added do to DOM a div a button something
like that now here is where react es can
make you feel uncomfortable if you're
totally new to it and are used to the
clear separation of HTML and JavaScript
this render method needs to return
something and it needs to return what
should be rendered
I'll enclose it in parentheses and then
here is what I want to have rendered a
div and yes
switch to JSX X thank you a div and
let's say then something like a h1 tag
where we say hello whoa that is strange
HTML code in that JavaScript file well
I'm actually not kidding you that is JSX
as the creators of react named it it's
JavaScript mixed with XML or HTML here
and well it looks like we're writing
HTML code while behind the scenes this
will be transferred to JavaScript code
creating the appropriate elements so
you're probably aware that you can treat
the element in plain vanilla JavaScript
with something like document create
element and then you could say a div and
so on and that is what's happening here
in the background but that of course is
a much more convenient way to write it
so we write the code which you want to
have on our page in a chava script file
and it's perfectly fine to do so
so that would be the very simple first
component it only displays hello and
I'll stylus a little bit more soon but
for now let's display it in the
application and that leads us to the
next question how do i render this app
it's nice that we have it but thankfully
react.js is not going to take our page
and replace everything with that HTML
code that would be a rubber bat behavior
instead I'll go back to my index.html
file and I'll set up a hook where I want
to render this it'll be a simple death
with an ID of your choice I'm using app
here and I will tell react.js to
basically render my component in this
place here we already have the point I
was talking about in my first video in a
series react.js doesn't necessarily
create a single page application you can
tell it where to render individual
components in your view you don't have
to control your complete view with
react.js though that's what I'll do in
this serious and what you will see in a
lot of reactions you don't have to do it
you can't just build single widgets or
components which you dump into your
normal view and that is totally fine and
that actually is what react.js was
created for in the beginning so back
into your next chest file we have to
tell react that we want to render it in
this divs place i will call the render
method from react dom for that and then
i first tell it what to render that is
my app and i define it like an HTML tag
if you're coming from angular 2 that
looks familiar that is like you use
these selectors in HTML and angular 2
app here is of course the name of my
class and then I just enclose it in
opening and closing tags whoops that's
the first argument of the render method
the second argument is the place where I
want to render it the place shall be
without a document and then get PI ID
get element by a hoops by ID and then
the ID was app with that it should
render it there that I'm getting an
error let's see yeah that's a rather
annoying error here module that should
be module so restart the web pack
process here didn't throw this error in
these setup video of course because well
there we didn't use react now it should
work and we see hello here so sorry
about this error really annoying but
with that we got our first working
component and before I finish this video
I want to point out an important thing
about this component or about react in
general in this return function here you
can only return one element now you
might say we're returning to yes next
elements that's fine but only one root
element so here a div it wouldn't work
if I have a sibling div next to it that
my ID already doesn't like it that will
not work because here only one element
may be returned and also before I leave
I want to add some styling so I'll head
over to get bootstrap comm to get the
default bootstrap styling so that
everything looks a bit nicer without me
having to write quite a lot of code and
I will import it here in my index file
at the end of the Hat section like that
and with that I'll go back to my
index.js file and use my bootstrap
Styles here now you might think that we
use class like we do but keep in mind it
looks like HTML code here but it isn't a
real HTML code it's JavaScript it just
looks nice or something some syntactical
sugar therefore we have to use class
name here not class and that's just
something you have to keep in mind class
name is it here if you're lucky you
have an IEE which helps you like I do
otherwise that's reaches something to
memorize so this will get the container
class then I'll add a row thankfully
Emmet my plug-in also knows I'm in JSX
here and then I'll just provide some
columns here so that's all just some
bootstrap stuff to make it look nice
basically like so and then I grab my
hello element here again saved is it'll
automatically reload and if you go back
to your application you will see the
restyle thing without having to refresh
the browser that's the great thing about
web page server here it automatically
reloads everything and if you got hot
reloads hot module loading working then
it even does this without reloading the
page automatically it just changes the
page of the background so with that we
built our first component you'll learn
that this render method is very
important that you may only have one
root element in here that you then tell
react where to render this component in
your view and how it gets rendered there
and with that I think we're well
prepared to move on to the next lecture
where I'll have a look at multiple
components working together see you
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
