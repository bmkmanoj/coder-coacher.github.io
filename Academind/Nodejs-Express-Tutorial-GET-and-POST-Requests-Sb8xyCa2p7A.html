had a look at handlebars and this
weekend what I want to do is go away
from the templating engine stuff a
little bit more again and we'll finally
get a bit more going with our Xpress
application and how to use Express in
this video we will have a look at get
and post routes how to pass parameters
and how to well retrieve and use them
let's start so what I want to do is I
will first copy this handlebars project
here and I won't just rename it to get
post something like that yeah let me add
it to get and Here I am so this is the
same structure as in the last video
where we set up handlebars and what I
want to do is in my routes file here I
have to get home page file or route
excuse me and what I want to do here is
I will add a new get route which I will
let say called test and then ID and by
writing : ID I specify that this route
expects an ID get parameter after well
ii slash here so the routers like slash
test and then it will get a parameter
and then the URL we will have like slash
test slash five five was the ID so this
is how you style your URLs
nowaday and this is how we set up this
URL to expect such a parameter and get
route again because we're passing
parameters in the URL which we do when
using get routes right so next figures
again a function which holds the request
response and well our next parameter
here
and that what I want to do here is I
will again render something and I want
to render let's say the the test view
which doesn't exist right now but will
soon and I will pass an object to that
fewer to the rendering engine where I
will have my output property so I will
be able to access this output as a
variable in my templating engine and
this should be this parameter the ID for
example I can access this in my request
object and there I have this parents
property and here I can simply say dot
ID because ID will be a parameter
available in this route because I'm
specifying ID here when setting up the
route as a parameter which should be
passed to this route therefore I can
access it by dot ID and of course this
name here ID has to match this name here
and if I were to have multiple
parameters here like let's say param to
I could of course access param to here
this is how I set this up now let me
undo this and now I would output this ID
let me create this view to show this
will create my tester HPS file once
again I'm using handlebars and here I
will just say you accessed this page why
I get request and then ID passed and
then here I will just output the ID
again back my neck such as file I'm
binding this to this output variable so
I will just use output here in my
handlebars expression
now when I restored my server here on I
enter tasks and then five let's say you
can see I get this page and I get the
parameter passed into this route output
here so this is how we pass parameters
to get routes and retrieve from and
output them now let's add a post route
let's say somewhere I will have a form
which gets submitted and this will well
call test submit let's say like this I
again will have my function with request
response and next because remember this
is how Middlemore in Express is set up
to have these free parameters and then I
also want to well render something or
let's say I wanted to redirect to a
number URL because I don't really want
to render something after Xing with
accessing this post route because the
post route would typically write
something to the database and then
redirect user to a number page therefore
what I will do here is I will then
redirect to just test ID and here I want
to pass the ID which is input through a
Ford okay that might be a little strange
your let's make this more clear in my
index dot HBS template here I will
remove all of the fun we had and I will
add a form which should have an action
of test submit since the route has just
set up and method will be post and then
here I will have an input which will
give a name of party and well a button
to a very basic form which allows me to
submit it is okay so my index page I
have this form where when I click on
submit I will be taken to test submit
this route here I will obviously pass
the for write and in my form I have
input field the only input field which
has an
of ID therefore I want this ID parameter
I want to retrieve it in this post
fungineer this post method I can do this
more ID by accessing my request again
but this time not params ID because it
no longer is a parameter passed to this
function it no longer longer is a
parameter specified URL because with a
post request but for post requests all
parameters the content is sent in the
body of the request right there for
iakhs request body and turn here I know
I will have this ID parameter this is
how I get it now let me get rid of this
these dots here and then just add ID so
that I get redirected to this test ID
route and I pass the ID I get from the
post request as a get parameter to the
next route I restart the server and then
we'll go back to the home page and I
will enter 10 year and then click Submit
and now we can see I'm redirected to
this get route we created a few seconds
ago and this time well 10 is output
since I passed this now of course this
is very constructed and theoretical
example and the next videos who will
create a more realistic app and we'll
also add validation to our forms but
this is how we use get a post request
which will basically are the two most
important requests we have when creating
a normal website like this and therefore
it's very important to know how to use
them see on the next videos why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
