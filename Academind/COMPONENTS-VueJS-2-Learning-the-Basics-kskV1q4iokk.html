video in this video I want to dive into
something very important components
components are a key concept you can use
in view chess which allow you to build
your application or widget or whatever
you're building from a couple world from
a pool of reusable pieces of components
you can build these components on your
own and each component holds a template
and D business logic belonging to the
template into that component therefore
in this video I want to dive into the
very basics but on this channel I will
have more videos on components where we
will learn how to use them in bigger
projects and which advanced features
they have how we can let them
communicate and so on now let's start
with the basics first though I'm in
chase fully here again with a very basic
setup where I have my app control by my
view instance down there and now let's
let's make this app a little bit more
interesting let's add a horizontal line
and there add another div and in this
div let's say I'm going to have a
paragraph where I say username : max
something like that now not that
interesting I guess but it's a bit more
content now let's also add a new field
here which is the user name field in the
data object which is max which allows me
to output the user name dynamically here
at least so a bit better at least we see
the same but now with dynamic data now
imagine that this would be some kind of
user is sectional which you want to
repeat over and over again so to
actually see this I'm going to not stall
as I'm going to give this a class of the
user and set up this class in the top
right corner where I can configure my
CSS styles here we can give this user
class some very simple styling let's say
a border of one pixel solid and light
gray maybe a background color of white
and maybe some light petting of ten
pixels let's see how that looks
better so that is our user object and
now we not only have one use
but multiple users so let's remove user
name and instead have users and now with
users we have an iterate clearly and in
this array we want to have some objects
where each user simply has a user name
like max and then let's add to everyone
so here let's say we also have Chris and
we have a last one with a user name of
Anna maybe now I want to output that of
course and the obvious solution here is
to use v4 to create a loop and to loop
through the array and replicate this
diff and to content as often as we need
to so loop through this and then simply
say we for user in users and here I can
simply then output user user name
referring to the user in each iteration
now that gives me my three parts here
and there's one thing we can already see
this part here is like a contained piece
in our application it has its own
template we could say this div and its
own logic or at least its own data here
so if that were a more complex object
even with some calculations around let's
say a button to edit the user or
something like that then this would
quickly grow and therefore in our only
view instance we would quickly populate
a lot of methods and data fields with
data and methods only related to this
part of our template this dev here so it
would make sense to outsource this into
its own piece of code and of course we
can do this with view jeaious we can
create a new component for that we do
this by accessing the global view object
and then accessing component like this
this will create a global component
which means we can use it at any view
instance application wide so here we
first give this a selector which means
our custom HTML tech you could say and
you would typically prefix this with a
unique well prefixed to make sure you're
not accidentally overwriting some
existing HTML element or something like
that so it could prefix it with app and
then give it the
name of user maybe so this name in the
quotation marks is totally up to you and
that in here we pass an object and now
that's important view component
basically just extends your view
instance so this means this object has
the same fields as your view instance
with one major difference the data
property here is not longer an object
it's now a function it is a function
which now returns an object and this
object again will hold your data so we
have this extra step of having a
function here and we need this because
due to the fact of it extending our view
instance and maybe having multiple
components or at least using this
component here multiple times they would
all share the same object and therefore
we need to make sure that this is an
instance where we make sure that the
object which holds our data which should
belong to a single component is not
shared across all components which use
this selector here so therefore here we
could then simply copy our users the
user property here and insert it here in
the object having the users in this file
now or not in this file in in this
component here I should say so let me
tidy this up so here the users in this
newly created component which again is
like a view instance with this extra
data thing here to make sure we're not
sharing data across same components and
what this allows me to do now is to also
get rid of that I would say but for that
you for me to be able to get rid of that
I also need to set up a template so
let's add a template here by adding the
template property that would have also
been available for the average view
instance here but there we didn't need
it because we automatically fetch our
template here with the LEM property
fetch the element from the dom and use
that as an element but we could have
overwritten it with the template well
here for the component we definitely do
have to override it because we don't
have any other template we're not
fetching anything and we can't so here I
simply will place my template which is a
string and
of course that when I grab that HTML
code and put it in the string and we
have to make sure to put it into one
line here because a string doesn't
supply or support multi-line code you
could use if you were using a
environment where you can work with es6
code you could use template literals
with the backticks
to support multi-line strings but here I
will simply stick to the single quote -
well treat an inline string and we will
in one of the other videos in the
upcoming videos here at maybe at the
point of time you're watching this we
will have a look at how we can find a
better solution because clearly this is
not an optimal template if you get more
code than what we do have here well
anyways with that in place what I can do
is I can simply replace this code in my
template of you view instance with app
user the selector is set up here and if
I now in control enter we see nothing
the reason for this is if we open the
error lock that there seems to be some
problem with the for and there is one
restriction you have to be aware of in
this template here in the template of
any component you must only have one
root element now you could say we
clearly do have one element we have one
div but we're looping through it with
the four so in the end we will have more
than one div so we simply have to wrap
this in a novel outer div so that we
only have one root element that's an
important restriction if we now add
control-enter we see the free user
sections and now we got a working
application using our own component
where we outsource this user related
code now with that in place the great
thing about components is we can simply
reuse them so add an average or hit
control enter again and on we go that's
the great thing about components we can
reuse them now of course the major
restriction here is this ugly inline
string template if we have anything more
than the very simple code we're using
here well this will quickly be no fun to
work with it that's the reason why the
next video may be already out at the
point of time you
this will cover a much better way of
working with view components and their
templates it will also leave jsfiddle
and start setting up a real development
environment and workflow nonetheless
what we saw here is how easy it is to
set up components how easy it is to work
with components and what their major
advantages containing your code in a
single reusable piece or part you can
then use wherever you need it and don't
have to crowd your main view instance
with all that logic one important
annotation here you can also set up
components locally by adding the
components property to the view instance
and then having the selector as the
property name like app user and then as
a value here the object which you pass
here as an argument to your view
component method so that's the
alternative if you know that you want to
use the component only locally in that
view instance here well then you would
or you could set it up locally otherwise
do it globally like here to make sure
you can use it in any instance or in any
component you have in your application
see you in the other videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
