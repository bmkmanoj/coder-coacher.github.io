flow you already know right now we're
having our store and we're having our
view our application and in this
application as you already saw in the
last video we're really only wiring up
one component to read acts a rap
component the home and/or domain and the
usual component they're not wired up
they get their data through props that's
typical pattern in your reacts react
application you typically have multiple
components ones that are smart so-called
containers and ones that are dumb so
called presentation components the dumb
components are not directly connected to
read acts they don't know about the
state that's why they're dumb the smart
components the containers they are
connected to redux that's why they are
smart they know about the state so back
in our application the app component
here would be a smart component a
container because it's connected to
redux it's knowing all about the actions
and these state already props
main and user are dump components and in
bigger applications or in smaller ones
too if you use Redux you typically split
up you have a folder named container
which holds all your smart components so
the app component and then you have the
components folder which has the dump
components
now since this really is a well dump
component there is no need to create a
class extending react component here
instead we can use a stateless component
as taught in the reactor is it serious
if you remember this so here I can also
simply export a constant called main
which is not extending this because it's
not a class instead this is a method or
a function which gets props passed into
it and then simply returns
me well some HTML of you what I call it
like this here I can then still use
props but without the disk keyword just
props the one passed here and I can
assign or reuse the same pattern here in
my user component it's a stateless
component to gets the props whoops and
simply returns me the HTML of this
component like this now in order to use
this and to make it work again I'll have
to go to my app component first I need
your chest the imports my IDE
automatically did this but make sure to
adjust them to if your IDE doesn't do
this and then this should still work but
in my index dot J's file I also need to
make sure that this import here is
adjusted again my IDE did this but make
sure you're importing your app from
slash container and knots from slash
component and this might also be renamed
cue containers again adjust this import
should hold old so containers should
hold all your smart components might be
one more than one your containers and
components well holds all these
stateless the dumb components so if I
save this reload my page it should still
work fine and it does but now I get this
separation of presentation components
here in the components folder and
containers connected to read X in the
containers folder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
