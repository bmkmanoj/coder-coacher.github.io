in the last video we tied up our editing
of posts and this now works really great
here with our modal and yeah with the
possibility to change it and get this
live updated here now without it you in
this section or in this video in the
next videos is I want to add a tiny
little account section where I can
basically change my first name and also
upload let's say an user image now this
image will only be visible in the
account section but it's a good exercise
to see how we can upload data images
store them and retrieve them let's get
started
the first thing is obviously the account
page therefore therefore I'll create a
new few here and I will call it account
of blade PHP by weight with more and
more files being added here it might be
a good idea to structure this a
different way like let's say have a
back-end folder and the front-end folder
or in a different way but for now I'll
leave it like that this file here will
extend the master layout and I will set
the title to let's say
- let's say just a count and then of
course we have our contents actually and
then this contacts actually will have a
form where we can add our contact
details and below that form I want to
display the image now to do this I'll
paste in some code which I have already
prepared in which you will of course
find in the github repository link to
this video now what this basically is is
just a form with the first name and the
image upload button the first name is
fetched from our user here where where m
we're passing the user to this view and
therefore we can extract the current for
its name which will be in the input
field by default we're routing to
account save route which we have to
create we will handle the saving
procedure here we get the file button
and all we have here is well it's a type
file and it's also important to add
something in our form element here the
egg type encryption type should be
multi-part form data otherwise this will
not work if you don't add this attribute
here file upload will not work as level
it's not able to well understand that
you're sending a file and that should
not just some text basically yeah so
that's very important below here I got
another section which I only show if we
do have the file stored now oh this
logic here is not important right now I
will go into that storage thing once
we're actually storing the file but
basically this function here just checks
does this file exists we'll give this
file certain file name so that can
uniquely identify each file for each
user and if it exists well then we will
have a our image element here basically
where we're fetching the file all the
food
and this route will return us to file
because we will use the lateral storage
engine for this which is an engine which
well does what the name sounds like it's
stores files in a certain place namely
in this storage folder here in the app
folder to be precise and we can put data
there and retrieve it obviously now for
setting our image source here we need to
retrieve this file and therefore we'll
have an extra route doing this ok so
that is our view here now to be able to
display as Hugh we also need to route
and well the controller function which
is responsible for getting this view
starting with the route and routes file
obviously I'll just put it here below
that log out route so route yet should
let's say slash account and whoops and
we'll come type and we'll use a
controller here and it should be in the
user controller and here we will have to
get account route let's call it like
that and this should also have a name
this road and I'll just name it account
now in the user controller I will
obviously add something I will add this
function here at the bottom public
function oops function get account was
the name I used here under a spell get
account thus name of a function and all
this function does is it will it will
record a few return few the account view
which has created this account later PHP
file and we want to pass a user to this
now that's really easy because the user
will be shipping quotation marks will be
the currently logged in user therefore
we can just pass off user cause calling
this user method on this office aid will
get us to currently locked in user
that's what'll help allowable offices
here now obviously we could just call
off user and appeal as well but this way
it's a little bit shorter and we have to
just use the user variable in the view
okay so now this retrieves our user and
gives us the account view the last thing
I want to add is in our header I want to
add a link to that account so to do this
go to my header blade file and in here I
will duplicate this logout route here
we'll call it account and of course
change to route to account now whatever
thing I'll do here is my brand here I
will replace this hash sign with an
actual route leading to the dashboard
this way we will have well an easy way
to always navigate back to the dashboard
okay let me save this and reload this
page so you see you now got an account
button here on an account link and if I
click on it I get an error route account
save it naughty fun
yep okay because in my few I prepare it
as in advance as I said I am saying okay
once on submitting this form we're
executing there we'll be using the
account safe route now I haven't set up
this road yet so let me do that real
quick so we'll do this right below here
route post and then we will use update
account and we'll use a controller here
oh of course uses and again it will be
the
your controller and here the post save
account you may choose whatever name you
want of course this is chess name
functions will be executed in the
controller as you are aware probably and
then this router the name of account
save and the names are important because
that was the error we just got so the
name here has to match the name in on
that cow blade but PHP file so let me
reload it here and then we can see this
works we got our name here fold-out now
saving what won't work because I haven't
implemented that yet but yeah we can see
this you can tag go back to our
dashboard so that's great in the next
video we'll make sure that we can
actually upload a file and see something
happen
see you there why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
