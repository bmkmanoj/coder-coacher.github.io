video with the sign up functionality in
place next it's time to allow the user
to actually sign in and to log out there
so I want to do this so I will just copy
the code from my sign up view here and
paste it into the sign-in page because
it's pretty similar we still need email
and password for all of that I will
change to router user dot sign-in even
though I have created this route yet and
what I also want to do here is to change
this to sign in as well as this button
here so with that my sign-in page looks
looks ok so far and the next step is to
go to the routes PHP file and create the
appropriate routes and I will just copy
the sign-up routes here since well I can
easily adjust them to it handily sign in
case so load the sign up page here with
the hope star was the wrong one load it
here with the get sign in action low T
sign in page with the get sign-in page
in here submit it of course also adjust
the route names so that's fine
and then the user controller I will
create two new functions I'll create D
get sign-in function here which will
basically just return me the sign-in
view so user dot sign in a staff you I
want to return of course referring to
this user sign under play dot PHP file
here and then the next is the post
sign-in function here which will take a
request object since it is a post
request and here I first also want to
validate however I'm of course not
validating if this email address is
unique because it will always poor it
will oftentimes be if someone tries to
sign in because you already created a
user right but I'll validate the
remaining data here and
theoretically I could also leave out the
validation because I am checking if the
provided credentials match my usual
credentials in the database anyways so
invalid data would never be a problem
here but I still want to provide nice
error messages in the case of invalidate
or to the user so I'll leave it here but
you could leave it out theoretically
next I want to use levels of indication
for say to try to login the user so I
will import this visaed here use all
allows me to do this and then I simply
run off attempt and I want to pass the
credentials here so I will pass an array
where I have the email address with the
provided email address on the request
and the password referring to D of
course D password provided in the
request so this will try to lock the
user in and it will be placed in an if
block here to check if this is
successful if this is successful I will
return a redirection to the profile
route which I also still have to setup
and otherwise I will return a redirect
back so in this case validation or login
signing it user in would fail and as
shown in previous videos of course you
could add error messages here and output
them in the views but here I want to
focus on the core logic for now so
that's why I'm doing it this way and
with that I'm trying to block the user
in will see if that is successful and in
case you are wondering how does level
know that well what the password is and
so on well basically because we named it
password here and therefore if we were
to rename this in our database table and
we would not work with the default
password too
level is expecting we would have to tell
the off the side or level that we're
using a different naming convention but
here I'm using passwords so this is all
fine and with that I will go back to my
sign-in page
I already adjusted this round so I will
go to my header then make sure that I
hook this route here app so this should
lead to user sign-in and I also want to
load the bro file page so I will copy
this just to have the skeleton get rid
of all this form related code here and
just output user profile here so that we
can see that this works I'll also create
the appropriate route and routes the PHP
file so route get let's say user slash
profile and this should use the user
controller and then the get profile
action which I also have to create and
I'll name this user profile so in the
user controller I'm creating one final
route for now or one final action to get
profile profile action here which simply
should return me a view namely the user
profile view which I just filled with
some life here in the user folder so
with all that in place I'm going to
reload this page I head over to the
sign-in page and I try to sign user in
and since I get to the user profile this
looks pretty good
however I'm currently not protecting
this route I could have accessed it
without being locked in and I don't have
any log out functionality in place so
I'll take care about this in the next
video see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
