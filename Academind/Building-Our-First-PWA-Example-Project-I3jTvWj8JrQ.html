build a basic progressive web app with
you now I already do have a video about
progressive web apps on my channel you
can find a link in the video description
of course and this our video it's
basically taken from my complete
progressive web of course I host an
udemy of course you can also find a link
to Disney video description now in this
video here I want to build a progressive
weather with you which works offline and
which we can install on the device home
screen of an Android device so let's do
that let's dive into that and let's
learn what it takes to create a basic
progressive web app
so in the video description you can find
a link to a starting project which I
already opened in webstorm it's a very
basic project and as you can see in the
readme of that file you'll need no js'
to run this development server this
project uses and you'll also need to
install the dependencies though their
dependency is really just as one
dependency here at HTTP server and then
we have to start command which spins up
the HTTP server so let's do that let's
first of run an NPM install to install
that server and once we did this we can
start it with NPM start and of course
keep that process running because we
want to keep our development server
running you'll then find the addresses
under which you can visit the project in
the console but you can also simply
wizard localhost 8080 1 now this page is
a very simple web application it's not a
progressive web app at all and all we
can do right now is we have this huge
card here which you can click and when
we click it then the text down here
changes with a little animation and we
can go back and forth between the
different content so obviously the
application here might not blow your
minds but the cool thing is that it's a
nice application where we can add
progressive features or features of
progressive web apps to make it a
progressive web app I strongly recommend
checking out that other video I
mentioned which I took from my complete
guide to get you into the basics of
progressive weather app so that you
learn why you might want to build them
and what makes a progressive web apps
now with that let's turn this
application into a progressive web app
by first of all adding a manifest file a
manifest file is a file which is read by
the browser's by browsers supporting it
at least and this file then allows the
browser to get some extra information
about your page something like the icon
it should use or for example the name
description of the page things like
these which allow the browser to display
your page correctly and very important
to install it on the home screen with
your own icon and so on so that's the
idea behind the manifest file in general
though we need to understand which
browsers do some
word which progressive web app features
let's have a look at that on the web app
manifest page of the Mozilla developer
Network you can not only find some
information about how this file should
be structured and which properties you
can add I strongly recommend this
article but of course I will also walk
you through the most important
properties in this video but you can
also found if you scroll down you can
also find some information about the
browser support now what you see here
browser compatibility that it's not
supported at all that's not entirely
true many features like installing it on
the home screen simply doesn't work on
desktop like that but if you check out
mobile that's the more interesting part
because that is what we want to add our
application to the device screen and
there you see how it gets how it is
supported and support is pretty well on
Android now iOS Safari the support is
not there yet but Safari is also working
on progressive web as we see some
development there so chances are that
this file will also be readable by
Safari on iOS or other browsers on iOS
in the future so for now let's focus on
Chrome for Android and all the other
Android browsers and then we see it's
pretty good so this is the web app
manifest and to use such a file we
should add it to our project now the
application is actually served from the
public folder this is where all the
source code of the web app you saw lives
now if we have a look at it the river
index.html file and then we have our
source folder with the different asset
scripts images and so on now important
here I only got one HTML file I'm not
creating a single page application ship
though well it is only a single page so
I guess technically it is one but I'm at
least not using any framework I'm not
using angular react or view here if you
check out my JavaScript file it's a very
simple file using vanilla JavaScript and
this is important you can turn a single
page application driven by react angular
and so on into a progressive web app you
can also turn any other application into
a progressive weather also multi page
applications and the course I mentioned
at the beginning my udemy course
actually uses a mult
Paige application to show you how
versatile this concept is and that you
can apply to any web app that's really
important to me that you understand this
any web app so back to that manifesto
chase have folded the right place to add
it is right next or index.html file so
there I'll create a new file and I'll
name it manifest Jason it has to be
adjacent file now with that added
without any content in it yet I'll go to
the index.html file and there at the end
of the head section I'll now add a new
link it won't be of type stylesheet
though instead it should be relating to
a manifest and the link should simply
point to slash many faster Jason so to
this manifest file once you did this we
can start filling this file with life
and since it's a JSON file we should of
course write jason code in there so what
goes into such a manifesto Jason fall
first of all you can give your
application a name like a basic
progressive web app whatever you want
this name will be used in some places
for example on the splash screen which
Android will automatically show you if
you start your application after you
installed it on the home screen however
there are all the places like below the
icon where this name is simply too long
that's why there's also a short name
property and this showed us the name
indicate be a short name like basic PWA
this will be used below the icon on your
home screen and to make sure it's not
getting cut off you should pick a short
while string a short text here now
beside that we also have a start URL
because all lowercase by the way because
if you think about your app being added
to the home screen and the important
part about this installation thing which
I'll later show you is of course that
all the time when I say install it's
still a web app it's not a native
Android app you're running then it is a
web app in its core it's going to wizard
your web page which gets served from
your servers so this is why we have to
specify a start URL here
you could just say dot to simply use
this folder where the manifesto Jason
for lies in as a start URL which makes
sense for me here because that's the
public folder and that is our route web
folder but you could of course also say
slash index.html or whatever it is so
I'll go back to dot though because I
simply want to serve my root folder
whenever the user taps this icon on the
home screen now there's also another
important property that's the display
property here we can control how our
progressive web app runs in the end if
we open it if we open it from the home
screen I mean does it should look like
it's running the browser with the
browser toolbar at the top or does it
look like a real native app still again
it will always be a web app but we can
change the way it looks and to really
create an immersive feeling we might
want to pick standalone here our
alternatives would be fullscreen or
browser so here I'll pick standalone to
really make it look like a standalone
application and therefore reassembling
this native app look we also have
orientation now orientation allows us to
control how the user should view our
application now we can't rely on the
browser and forcing this actually or the
device but here we could say portrait to
make sure that this app can only be
viewed in portrait mode if started from
the home screen so I'll add this here
too and now the nice thing is the
background color and this is again all
lowercase here the background colors for
example used on the splash screen which
is created automatically which will be
the background color and your app icon
now I'll come back to the icon thing but
that is for example reset the background
color
what the background color here is not
it's the background color of your
general page so it's not this white
background here this is not controlled
for the manifest and I'm really talking
about the background during startup of
the application for example so here why
don't we pick some greyish color we also
have a theme color and the theme color
now for example Styles the toolbar
already when your application runs in
the browser the browser toolbar color
should change but also especially if we
started our app through tapping the icon
and then for example we open the tasks
which are on our mobile device we will
see that our application runs as a
separate task colored in our theme color
so that is where we can see that now you
can pick any color I'll simply pick a
color from this image here so maybe this
blue here which is the following hex
code 5f AAA e5 and that again will be
used in some places for example the task
switcher now with that we can go to
another important part the icons and
this is I cans not I can and I can say
is an array because you can specify
multiple icons in different sizes
basically each icon is defined as a
JavaScript object here in this JSON file
and then has free properties the source
pointing to the I can file now in this
project you are using you already will
find this images folder and in there
this icons folder where I prepared some
icons for you and here we can simply
point to them so we can say source
images icons and then for example app I
can - 96 by 96 dot PNG that is the path
to the I can I wanna use we also have to
explicitly set these sizes of that icon
because we can probably guess that it's
96 by 96 but of course we could have
named this file anything we want so we
clearly have to tell the browser what
the size of that icon is and here it's
96 by 96 and this is how we should
specify this format this value here now
why do we need to tell the browser the
size of the icon because the browser
should pick the right icon for the
different devices where this application
might run on and depending on the
density of the screen and the resolution
of the screen of the device it should
pick a well-fitting icon the last
property for each icon is the type and
here this is image PNG and it should be
a PNG image if you want to use it
as a home screen icon as a splash screen
icon theoretically other formats are
supported to hurt you but to have an
installable application where chrome
actively prompts the user whether he
wants to install it add a to the home
screen or not you should set this at
least this is the case right now
now this is one icon but we got more I
can store it so I'll specify them all
the next one we'll check ft dimensions
144 by 144 and this is actually an icon
which you should always provide this
dimension 144 by 144 this is an icon
which is required so that chrome shows
this do you want to install this app
pop-up to the user basically 144 by 144
has to be provided if you don't provide
any other icons provide this size so the
next icon I want to add here is of
course the the next I can - that folder
so 2 5 6 by 2 5 6 and then let's add the
last icon this last I can here is pretty
important for the splash screen display
though it will work without it
now this is a basic app manifest a basic
manifest adjacent fall now with that
let's save all of that and let's go back
to this application let's reload it and
let's open the developer tools now I'm
using Chrome here and I strongly
recommend using Chrome because they have
awesome developer tools when it comes to
debugging or working with progressive
web apps there you can visit the
application tab and let me increase this
so there you can visit the application
tab and there you'll find this manifest
area if you click on it you should see
the information the browser could get
from the manifest you specified so the
name the short name the color and all
the icons you specified here so that's
awesome this seems all to work fine now
we could already manually add it to the
home screen we could go to a mobile
device an Android device simply open
this application if it were to run on a
server and then tap deep Add to Home
screen I can manually D add to
homescreen menu option we should then
already use this icon ansan but
Jerome won't actively prompt us to do
that to install it however there are
some criteria and a link to the criteria
can be found in the video description
which to find when Chrome will show you
this actively so when it actively asks
the user whether he wants to add the
page the user is currently on QT a home
screen or not now right now when I
record this video the criteria are that
you have a manifesto JSON file with 144
by 144 PNG icon that you of course
should specify a name and so on short
name and that you also have a
serviceworker
we don't have dead yet that you also
visited the page with a five-minute
pause in between budget that you came
back basically because you probably
liked the page and that's important that
your page has served over HTTP now
during development localhost is actually
an exception but you should serve it
over HTTP because service workers
require HTTPS and service workers are a
requirement for the app manifest again
localhost is the single exception that
exists where you can also serve your
progressive web app over localhost and
see all the features of course that's
not available when serving it on a real
server so there make sure you're serving
your page over HTTPS so what did we get
the manifest let's now add a service
worker and for that I'll add a
JavaScript file because a service worker
is just using javascript you could be
inclined to add it in the JavaScript
folder in the source folder but here's
an important thing a service worker
always has a scope scope defines which
pages a service worker can control
because a service worker is JavaScript
but not like your normal JavaScript like
here in the app dot J's file a service
worker isn't attached to a single page a
single file this app dot J's file is it
gets loaded by the index.html file here
at the bottom and it is attached to this
fall this is the reason why in app dot
ajs we can access the Dom off this
index.html file now a service worker is
also rich
through your pages but I'm deliberately
saying page s because you could add it
on any page but then it runs in the
background on a separate fret so not on
your main UI thread like this script
file runs but on a separate fret this
also means that for example on Android
it will keep on running even if your
page is closed which is amazing for
getting push messages for example
something I do show in my udemy course
so this is a serviceworker it runs on a
separate fret it's not connected to a
single page but instead it has a scope
which could be your entire domain all
the pages on the domain or a subset if
you limit the scope to a given folder in
your domain on your web page here so to
say and that's the important thing if I
were to add my serviceworker in this
javascript file the serviceworker could
only interact with pages stored in the
javascript file or in sub pages that of
course isn't helpful because we haven't
any pages in there so we should create
the serviceworker on the public folder
here so I'll create a new file and you
can name this file whatever you want
I'll name it s wjs this is a file which
will hold my serviceworker related
javascript code and again it's not
attached to a single page it is
event-driven and it can list is to
events fired by any of your pages or
other events not even coming from your
pages like incoming push notifications
now here I want Q react to some events
triggered by my index.html fault though
and first of all we should register this
serviceworker this is done in JavaScript
and of course in your normal JavaScript
because you have to tell the browser hey
here's a serviceworker related to my
page or a subset of my pages please
register it and if the browser doesn't
notice serviceworker yet or the
serviceworker file changed so if the
file size changed the browser will take
the serviceworker
and register it override the old one or
register it as a new one to code to
register a service program
therefore as I said has to be added in
the app dot JS file or directly in a
script part in the index.html file and
in there
I'll now simply add navigator that
refers to the browser Service Worker dot
register now here's an important thing
you should make sure that this code
where you register a serviceworker gets
executed on every page in your
application so that the user if he
Wizards a different page and not your
main page if you had multiple ones so
that even if the user wizard at some
other page like slash about that he
still installs the serviceworker and
then again you have one serviceworker
for all the pages so it's always the
same one you register but the user might
enter a different place a different path
in your app so you should be prepared
for this back to the registration code
there you pass an argument to register
and that simply skip off to the
serviceworker file so in this case it's
/s wjs pointing to the root folder and
then s wjs this is the serviceworker i
want to register now we have one issue
here though this code will work phone
will work fine on Chrome on the latest
version however what if the user uses a
browser which doesn't support service
workers we can check serviceworker
support on his serviceworker ready this
is a page on check our cobalt github do
link can be found in the video
description and on this page you see the
different serviceworker features and
which browsers supported or are working
on it and you see that Chrome and
Firefox support is decent but that
Safari and AD are working on
serviceworker features the general
features or some special features so if
the user uses Safari or edge right now
the code we wrote here this one will
throw an error because the browser can't
handle this
there is no serviceworker object on the
browser so what we should do is we
should wrap this into AF check where we
say if service worker in navigator so if
this object exists in the navigator then
we want to execute this code otherwise
we won't register a service worker
that of course means we don't have
access to the features we are about to
add but that doesn't matter because the
browser doesn't support it anyways so
with that we were just sir to Service
Worker now we can fill the service
worker with some life let's go to the
service worker and I said that the
service worker is event driven you
always react to events in there so what
you can do is you can add an event
listener you add it on self this refers
to the service worker process so to say
and then you call add event listener and
now there is no click event or something
like that because we're not reacting to
Dom events here because the service
worker is decoupled from the Dom you
can't access the Dom in a service worker
but there are other events or events
available for example the install event
this will be fired when a service worker
is you guessed it installed which is the
case as I mentioned if it's brand-new or
if it's an updated version and the
browser replaces the existing one for
the given scope for the given domain in
this case so if the install event fires
then I want to execute a function here
and in this function of first of all
simply log service worker installed this
is something I can do here
now we'll soon add more code to the
install event though let's also listen
to the activate event here now in the
activate event we know that it has been
activated and the difference between
installing and activating is that
installation happens instantly if the
browser detects a new service worker but
it will keep it waiting until it
activates until you or the user using
your page closed all tabs in his browser
where your page was open the reason for
it is is simple if you install a new
service worker and you overwrite the old
one if you would immediately activate
and replace the old one then you might
break the air page the user is currently
visiting because maybe your page is
firing somebody went to which the
service worker should react and you
suddenly push a new version onto this
page now existing processes might get
interrupted the page might not work
anymore that is why we have two separate
steps here
it will only activate after user closed
all tabs and then open it again then the
installed service worker will get
activated so these are two events we can
see here now let me also go back to the
app dot JS file and chain something to
the registration the register method
returns a promise and therefore here I
can execute a function where I can
simply log service worker registered now
with all that added let's see this in
action so the server is still running
I'll go back to my application here and
I'll reload it now if you go to service
workers here you should see that a
service worker was registered and this
is the scope of your service worker this
domain here's the service worker file
you see it's activated and it is running
and this is your first service worker
added now the service worker like this
doesn't do too much though you typically
the most basic use that you can do you
typically use it for caching caching
means that you can actively add some
files to your cache a special cache not
the default browser cache and you can
also define when these assets should be
served so that you make sure that your
page even works if you're offline let's
add such a functionality in the service
worker and the best place to catch some
files which you know will not change
that often you always want to be able to
access them is in the installed step
here because there you can pre cache the
static assets off your page you do this
by simply reaching out to the cache API
a special web API which allows you to
access this special cache I was talking
about not the default browser cache but
a cache you can manage you can use
caches open to open a cache there next
you pass a name and this could be static
or whatever you like if it doesn't exist
yet like it does for the first time you
execute this it will simply create it
and thereafter it will open this cache
caches open returns a promise and in the
function which gets executed once the
promise resolves we get access to the
opened cache so let's pass this as an
argument now in this open cache we can
call the add method to now add an asset
for caching now the add method is pretty
cool we can simply add a path to an
asset here and the browser will
automatically make an HTTP request to
the browser and store the incoming
response in the cache it will actually
store a key value pair in the cache
where the key is your request and the
response is well excuse me and the value
is the response you got back so here we
can simply specify a path like for
example let's say we want to cache the
app.js file so we could cache source J s
AB dot J s we also might want to just
cache slash so that if we wizard just
localhost:8080 1 nothing else we have
this response cached we should also
cache slash index.html because that's
not the same as just slash both load the
same file and yet but is these are
different requests to different
endpoints now with that we would already
cache quite some files we wouldn't cache
any images and CSS and so on though and
you can see that you're calling cache
add a lot now that's fine but I'll
comment it out there is another function
which is cache at all cash add all takes
an array of strings and simply does all
these individual additions automatically
in one turn so here again you can now
cache slash slash index.html so this is
just an area of strings as I said source
JSF J's and what else we have
like for example source CSS and in there
we have the app CSS file now we also
might want to store an image so here we
could now store source image as PW a dot
JPEG you could also store the icons here
now I will store something else though
if we have a look at the index.html file
there you will see that we're also
reaching out to a CDN to fetch this font
so what I'll do is I'll also try to
catch this so I'll copy this URL you can
cash assets from Abra service - it's not
just from your server you can enter any
URL into the cache add method so I'll
reach out to this CDN here by simply
adding this URL here queue and keep in
mind these are all just you are else
these are relative URLs on your own
server and this is a URL reaching out to
an average server in the end the browser
will make these requests and store the
response for you
this code won't work though service
workers are only idle working for an
unknown period of time and then they
will shut down to make sure that the
service worker doesn't shut down before
cashing is done we can take advantage of
the event which we get passed into this
function for the installation event
automatically this event has a wait
until method and we should execute this
to make sure that this recruit waits for
a certain process to finish before it
possibly shuts down and shutting down
doesn't mean instead it's just passed so
to say and it will wake up the next time
it receives an event now we can take
cache open which returns a promise and
pass it to wait until wait until
conveniently expects to get a promise so
this is just fine now with that it will
wait for this process here to finish
before it possibly goes into idle mode
again now let's try this out let's save
this keep in mind we now change the
serviceworker file so the fault size
changed so the browser should install
the new one the next time we refresh the
page so let's do that let's refresh the
page and there you now see if you go to
applications service workers then we get
a new service worker waiting to activate
in the console we therefore see that it
was registered that it was installed but
that it wasn't activated yet to activate
it we have to close this page and reopen
it close all active tabs with the page
and the next time you visit your
developer tools
you see it's activated and running
you'll also see also under application
if you go to cache storage
and right-click it to refresh you'll see
there is a static cashier this static
cash actually cashed all the requests
you specified in your service worker you
also see the response here and the date
and time when twas cashed now with that
we haven't gotten offline support yet
though all these things are cached but
we never try to fetch them so what we
can do is we can add a new event
listener to this service worker and this
is for the fetch event now the fetch
event is for example triggered whenever
you fetch something in the index.html
file like through this link or fruit
desolating to the apt osseous follow or
through this line link pointing to the
script file whenever this is the case a
fetch event is registered in the service
worker now for the fetch event we can
now react with a function where we also
get an event as an argument and now
there we can decide what we want to do
if we don't do anything the default will
happen the browser will go ahead reach
out to the network and make that request
but we can change that behavior we can
basically use our service worker like a
network proxy here we can use event and
now not wait until but respond with to
make sure we respond with something
different than the default Network
request now here we could respond with
our own fetch request to some other URL
or we simply reach out to their cache
and try to find the given network data
from that cache get it from the cache
the data we wanted to get I mean we can
do this with the caches API again and
there we have a match method this allows
us to match the incoming requests with
some resource in our in our cache so we
should simply pass event requests there
is a request up a request object on an
event object and now the cache API will
have a look if in any of its caches in
this case we only have one but it could
have multiple ones if in any of the
caches it finds this request and for
some assets it should indeed do that if
that's the case or actually always it
will then execute a function where we
get their response from the cash from
the cash not from the network back now
this will also be executed if it doesn't
find something in the cache so it will
not fail it will not throw an error
response will then just be null if
response is set though we can simply
return the response so we return the
response from the cache if we have it in
there else
we can simply do something well else we
can reach out to the network so we can
then make the fetch with the fetch API
this is supported by all more modern
browsers and since we're in a
serviceworker which only runs on modern
browsers we can safely access this so
fetch is now available and fetch will
now make a network request to event
request for example and there we can
then simply return fetch which is of
course a promise but we can return a
promise or directly response both will
work here in caches match and this code
should make sure that if we have the
request in the cache we get the response
from the cache if we don't find it in
there we go ahead and make that Network
request let's see if that works
let's save this and let's reload the app
to install the new serviceworker now as
before it's waiting to activate so let's
simply close that tap and reopen it and
let's have a look it was activated now
let's see if this works if I reload this
all works but now under a serviceworker
here an application
let's go offline and let's reload the
app again and even though I'm offline
I am offline this is simulating that I'm
offline the app looks like before and
it's the works like before I can still
tap this the reason for it is this and
we can confirm this if we have a look at
the network tab that we're getting these
assets from the serviceworker here you
see that from the serviceworker we're
fetching it from there that's of course
the cool thing because now we got an
offline ready application with a
serviceworker
now you can find whom this whole caching
and get something from the cache thing
way more there are different strategies
you can use to get something from the
cache first but then reach out to the
network to get a more up-to-date version
of that asset but to go to the cache
first to show something on the screen
immediately and so on and I will walk
through all these strategies in my udemy
course which I mentioned at the
beginning linked in the video
description this basic caching here the
spree caching we're doing here
already is a huge first step though now
with that let's see how that looks like
on a real device it should actually all
work on an Android emulator for example
a one you create through the Android
studio so feel free to do that if you
don't have a real Android device I'll
quickly connect my real device with my
computer though and then I'll try to see
this run on the device and see how the
application looks there now I connected
my real Android phone with my Mac here
and the cool thing is on Chrome which
you have Chrome on your Android device
again should also work on an emulator
and you have Chrome on your Mac and
somewhere on your Windows machine - as
your default browser you can go to the
developer tools on Chrome for desktop
these free dots you see in the top right
corner and then more tools and then
remote devices now if you expand this
here this a simple window you actually
see all connected Android devices now
there you should also make sure that you
check port forwarding so that you can
visit a port which a server I should say
running on your local machine on your
desktop machine here also from your
mobile device because by default if you
enter localhost 8080 one on your real
mobile device or the emulator this will
not be your page on your machine here
this will be localhost on the device
which is the device itself but with port
forwarding you can make sure that you
could enter localhost 8080 1 on your
device and wizard the server running on
your Mac or Windows machine so with that
let's now simply go to that connect
device my oneplus here and there I now
will simply open a new tab so let me
quickly do that
so now here in Chrome for my desktop
machine I can inspect this tap I opened
and I now got the same developer tools I
have on my Mac Chrome here on my Mac
still this window is running on the Mac
but it's referring to the page running
on my mobile device which I can show by
tapping here and so on
and you see I already get this
installation banner here you can also
manually trigger it by going to manifest
and then clicking add to homescreen any
developer tools connected to your device
now I'll click Add here and now it's
again well as I just said adding it to
my home screen we now have a look at
that here it is quite a bit here it
opens and this is now opened through the
icon on the home screen now right now at
the point of time I'm recording this
this is a bit buggy at least for a
localhost
testing there you see it still looks
like it's running on the browser even
though I opened it from this icon and I
promised you that it would look like as
like a standalone app at least since we
displayed a set display to stand alone
in the manifest now on localhost we get
this back we don't get it if we surf
this from HTTP though so why don't we
quickly do that as an extra bonus task
to make sure to really shift us to a
real page so we can see how it would
work if we were to serve it from HTTPS
now you can upload it to any of your
favorite hosting providers as long as
you ensure that your application or your
hosting your server - ship the app
through HTTP I will use firebase because
it's super simple to setup and super
simple to get started so I'll quickly
head over to firebase and there I'll go
to the console to create a new project
for that and again you can use any other
hosting provider as long as your app is
served over HTTP so here I will name
this basic PWA
and region can be whichever region you
want Germany and create this project now
firebase also offers a lot of other
features like database which
she was at all here I'm just interested
in their hosting so once it is finished
I want you well host my app here so if I
click on hosting and click on get
started you get instructions on how to
host your application and first of all
you should install the firebase tools
again of course only relevant if you are
using firebase so I'll quit my local
development server and I'll quickly
install the firebase tools globally on
my machine with sudo and people install
- gee firebase tools does basically a
seal i buy firebase which allows us to
do some things like easily deploying it
to our web server now once this is
finished we can simply click continue
here in this window to see the next
tasks we should sign in and then initiai
initiate our project now I already am
signed in so I'll type firebase init
here to put this project folder under
control of firebase and I'll simply just
check posting here by hitting the tab
bar in this drop-down in this menu and
then hit enter and this will now set us
up to be a host of a project now I have
to pick the project and its basic PWA
for me the project just to create it
I'll confirm that my route web directory
should be the public directory which is
the default
I will check no here it's not a single
page application though that
theoretically would theoretically would
be one and you could write Y for yes
here but I'll write no and I don't want
to override the public index.html file
so I'll enter n here for no to with that
it's initialized and the last step is Q
enter firebase deploy so let's run this
deployed to ship this project to a
server and once this is done we'll also
get the URL under which we can wizard
this here Q so let's wait for this to
finish real quick and now that it
finished des is the URL where we can
wizard our project let's quickly check
it here on Mac so I'll quickly enter it
here instead of localhost looks good
looks very good let's reload this one
more time let's now try offline mode
here by going offline it's looking days
decent now let's try it on the mobile
the
so there I'll visit the same URL of
course you should enter your URL and I
see my project here I'm also asked
whether I want to add it to your home
screen or not so I'll quickly do that
and once it has the same icon it's a
different app for my phone here because
it's not running on localhost and now if
I tap this icon now you see what I meant
it's running standalone like a real app
and if I open the task switcher here you
actually see this here is the app with
the theme color you can see the blue
toolbar and here is Chrome so it's
running as a separate process even
though technically it still runs powered
by Chrome it still uses Chrome it still
is a web app but it looks like a native
app it behaves like one so that's the
cool thing here we got this application
and finally if I check offline mode here
- by simply going into airplane mode
real quick if I now reload the app you
see it's still working it's still
working fine here and now if I reenable
Internet we're back to the online
experience so that's the cool thing this
is how it looks like if we run it on a
real server again any server you like as
long as it's over HTTPS since that is a
serviceworker requirement and i hope
this video gave you some insights into
how to create a basic progressive web
app which is installable and which pre
caches some files to give you a basic
offline functionality if you want to
dive much deeper check out my you deme
course and of course i'd be more than
happy to also welcome you in all the our
future videos on this channel bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
