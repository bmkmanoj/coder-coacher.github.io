flexbox mini series in the last video we
had a look at the Flex container and we
saw that we can add different properties
and by that change the way the elements
nested inside of that container the
so-called Flex items behave the problem
is that with adding properties to the
Flex container we can only change the
way all items behave but if you want to
change the behavior of a single flex
item well then you can also do that
let's find out how this works so how we
can work with the Flex items in this
video
back in our code and as always a link to
the code can be found in the video
description and if we look at our page
now well it basically looks like that
well let's maybe increase the width
right here and also delete a line
content we don't need that actually so
we can get rid of that and now we want
to focus on to these Flex items just
remember these are the different
elements we have right here so these six
elements inside our container of a Flex
container which you can see right here
and now back to the code again and now
how do we start well let's start maybe
with diff one right here because the
first attribute we could add to a Flex
item and that's important we added the
properties in the last video just to our
Flex container but now we can add all
these properties we will have a look at
in this video to all flex items and they
will only affect well this flex item
basically now coming back to a proper
team the first property we could use is
this one this is called order now what
does this mean
well let's maybe type one and save that
if we now go back have a look at it if
one is positioned right here if we now
reload the page we can see that the item
is now placed at the last position wise
is happening well because we added this
order property to this div this means if
I set this to zero and save it again and
reload the page it will be displayed
again in the beginning because normally
all items have an order of zero or value
for order of zero now if we change it
back to 1 and then go down to the free
maybe and also add order right there and
change it to free right or it could also
be to actually let's maybe make two like
that so if we change it so we have now
order 1 right here and order free in
this third item and now reload the page
well you can see what happens now the 1
is positioned at the end because order 1
is bigger than 0 but order 2 is bigger
than or the 1 so we have placed it right
here and if I now change to 1/2
order free then you can imagine what
happens this will now be placed to the
right of this stiff right here that's
basically how order works really
important we talked about that in the
last video this also is based on the way
we have set the flex flow for example if
we change that to Rho reverse if you're
not don't know what we're doing right
here just have a look at the first video
of this flexbox miniseries so robbery
worse save that and go back well then
you can see that if one is now placed
here this looks like it will be the
first position but now it's basically
the last position because we have Rho
reverse then we have the diff with the
order value of 2 so this different air
where is it here it is and then we have
all the other divs in the normal order
right so always keep that in mind that's
why I talk a lot about the flex
direction in the last video because it's
really important to understand how this
works because otherwise well results can
be confusing in Flex box but let's
change it back to Rho because I think
this makes more sense right here and
lets us show our examples easier however
let's maybe get rid of that we don't
need order actually in our example and
right here and let me show you another
property you can add maybe we use the
two right here because this property is
kind of familiar two of the one we had
already but now it's different because
it refers to a single element or a
single flex item and this is called a
line but now you can see it already we
had aligned content we had aligned items
but now we have aligned self and as the
name kind of indicates this simply
defines how our Flex item is positioned
related to D cross access that's really
important we also talked about that a
lot in the last video but aligned self
refers to the position in relation to
the cross axis now let's have a look if
we now say we want to align this item
flex start maybe and do it like this and
go back and reload the page then you can
see exactly what happens you remember we
had
that slide in the last video this means
we have now a flex direction of roll set
in the Flex container and this means the
cross axis starts right here and goes
from top to bottom this means adding
flex star to this will simply add this
item well at the start of the cross axis
if we go back and change it to Flex end
like that and go back then it would be
at the end right here because again
cross axis starts here in our case ends
here
so we position this item right there and
this is basically what you can do with
align self it is kind of related or
similar to what we saw with line items
but this time only relating to a single
item
now you might again ask yourself where
can I find all these properties and all
these values what can I apply right here
and the answer again is in the MVN the
Mozilla developer Network you can find a
link to this page down there in the
description
the important thing is right here you
see all the properties that we have we
talked about a lot of these actually in
the series and if you click on to align
self then you can see that you have a
lot of different values that you can
apply basically too much values to cover
them all in this video but we just had a
look at flex start and flex end but feel
free to play around with these to make
sure that the single items behave the
way you want them to behave however we
saw this now and we know how aligned
self works so we can actually get rid of
it right here because there are three
more properties that I would like to
show you which can be confusing but
actually they are not difficult if you
had a closer look so let's take this
closer look now and for that we'll focus
onto the last two items right here so
that 5 and tip 6 why are we using these
well basically if we go to page
basically because they have an equal
width and the properties I want to show
you now well have something to do with
the width so let's add a property right
here and this property is called flex
which is quite intuitive actually and
flex is just like flex flow for the Flex
container a property which combines
multiple properties the standard value
is 0-1 in Auto and this simply or these
individual values stand for the
following properties
I'll again add them as a comment here
just to make it clearer for you the
first value stands for flex row right
here the second value stands for flex
rink
oops shrimp like that and the third one
stands for Flex basis like that now what
does it mean let's maybe go for it step
by step makes the most sense I think so
flex crow this is the first value we can
see right here the standard value is
zero as I said so if we save that go
back and reload the page we can see that
the elements grow up until the point
they reach their maximum width and so
this is the width that we defined so 200
pixels let me quickly go back and let me
change justify content to flex start
like that because then it's easier to
see that because now we have more space
so as you could see we don't increase
the width of these items as soon as they
reach the maximum width that we defined
okay so that's the basic value that's
right here flex 0 let me now change 0 to
1 right here that's not a standard value
so if we save that and go back we can
see that the item right here increased
although we actually reached a limit of
the width of 200 but it still keeps
growing and that's interesting right
because by adding a flex grow and a
number larger than zero this simply
means that we make sure that this item
that we add this property well kind of
increases its width although we set a
limit
now what's basically happening right
here is that the width of this item will
be increased or will be stretched up to
the point where the entire free space
that we have on our page is occupied by
that item you can see it actually right
here because if I increase it or
decrease it stay
right there and if I decrease the page
you can even see that it still behaves
like that and make sure that the enter
page is occupied by this item so that is
what you can do with Flex Grove
basically this first part but there is
more and to see this more we simply copy
down this right here including the
semicolon of course and add it right
there and now change flex right here for
allative 6 to 2 so keep in mind the
other items have flex zero so they won't
stretch the the 5 has a flex value of 1
and the 6 now has the Flex value of 2
now let's see what happens if we go back
and reload the page we can see that the
space is again occupied entirely by our
elements and if you look at it you can
see that only these two elements are
kind of stretching or not stretched but
if you look at it closely it's hard to
see but the last item increases more
because let's have a look if we start
right here and inspect that we can see
that the first item right here has a
width of 200 2.84 now the second item
right there has a width of 200 5 point 6
9 now that's just some rounding but
basically we can see that the width of
this item increased two times the amount
this item increased now that's important
this item is not two times this first
item that's not true it's just the case
that we have a space a free space that
should be occupied and we defined that
the space should be occupied by these
two items but this space well you could
imagine like that the space can now be
cut into three equal pieces and two of
these pieces are added to the last item
with the Flex CRO value of two and one
piece is added to this first item with a
flex CRO value of 1 now if we go back
and change it to free so the value for
flex right here for this six like that
and
back you can see that this item now is 2
0 2 point 1 3 and this one here is 2 0 6
point 4 so 3 times 2 growth that we saw
for the first item and that's a really
important concept that you have to keep
in mind always think about this space
you have available divided into the
parts that you have right here that's at
least how I remember that and then think
about it how many parts should be added
to each single item depending on the
Flex value that we have added right here
so that's flex grow basically you can
specify how a single or multiple items
should grow if you change the size or
the width of your website but we have
more because we also have this second
value right here flex shrink now as the
name indicates flex shrink helps us to
decrease the size of our items let's
have a look at that now and to show you
that we will change our parent right
here our flex container from wrap so in
the Flex flow property to no rep like
that oops sorry to no wrap now it's
correct like that because if we now have
a look right here and we load the page
we can see that well we can see a thing
because of the inspect to we can now see
that our items decrease and they kind of
decrease equally as you can see right
here we learned that in the last video
they decrease up until the point where
the content is basically displayed and
then we have the following behavior so
far so clear we saw that and if we look
at the size or the width of these
elements we can see one on seven point
eight one or seven point eight okay
let's increase the size again we can see
again the following behavior as soon as
we reach the defined width we can see
that this item right here has two three
four point three eight and this one here
has three times the value so free of
3.15 so the same behavior that we saw
before now let's go back and let's maybe
change that flag strategy to one because
it can be confusing now but now change
the flag score off right here sorry D
flex shrink we just talked about growth
it's flex rink to free like that if we
now go back and reload the page well we
basically don't see a big difference
because both items now keep growing the
same value because we just defined it or
the same amount of width so that's equal
but if I now decrease the website right
here can you see it already mm I don't
think it's clear enough let's add a
shrink of four maybe even because then
it becomes clearer yeah I think now it
becomes evident if we increase the size
again and then decrease that page can
you see it I think now it's clear the
amount the fifth element right here
decreases is five times higher value
decreasing level we have right here for
our fifth number six where we have flex
crink of one like all the other elements
have so if we try to get it back to a
width of 200 which is way too much right
here as you can see still too much maybe
like that you can see that now we have
here a width of one hundred ninety nine
point seven so 0.3 smaller than the
actual width that we defined and here we
have four times
the decrease because the Flex shrink
value was set to four so this item
decreased by 0.3 well zero point three
times four is one point two and this one
point to decrease can be seen right here
and that's basically how flex shrink
works it allows us just like flex grow
actually when we increase the size to
specify the shrink level or the amount
an item can shrink specifically for a
single item or for all items so that's
another important property that you have
to keep in mind when you work with the
different flex items but there is one
less property that I would like to show
you right now
it's very unselect that and for that
let's set that back to one maybe grow to
zero and also here and save that because
we talked about flex grow and flex
shrink but we also have flex basis
so the standard setting is flex paces
Auto and before we have a look at that
and change that
what does flex paces actually do or what
does it mean well flex basis and this is
really important simply defines the
starting size or the standard size of
your element or of your Flex items
depending on the main axis and that's
really important depending on the main
axis so flex basis is not something like
the width or the height it's actually
always the size of your element relating
to the main axis now let's see what that
means because generally you can define a
width that's no problem but if you
define a flex basis this will be kind of
the value that is considered this means
in our case we can see that our Flex
basis is auto so we will fall back to
the width but just in case that our main
axis is related to the width now this
can be really confusing therefore let's
just have a look at that now because if
I now keep it right here on auto the
width but right here define a Flex basis
of one of the pixels for example like
that and we can go back and we can see
which is quite as expected that for this
fifth element if we just increase the
size maybe like that that for this fifth
element a width of 200 pixels was
applied why did this happen well we saw
that we have the Flex basis of autumn we
also see right here that our Flex flow
is row
this means the main axis is equal to the
width of our page we talked about that
in detail also in the last video and
because of that the fallback will refer
to the width that's why it works like
that in the second example or in the
second element we have a flex with
offeror pixels
therefore the width doesn't play a role
so we have a width of 100 pixels right
here so far so clear and now you might
still say well apparently the Flex basis
is just something like the width but as
you will see now it's not because if we
go back right here
and change our flex flow from row - oops
to column like that and save it and now
go back to our web site and reload that
page now it gets more interesting right
because if we inspect these two items
right here we can see that the width for
both items is still 200 pixels but the
height is totally different and if I
would also have increased the size of
the box I'm sorry for that let's
increase the size of the Flex container
and here now you can see better and now
back to what we just talked about you
can see that for the fifth element we
have a width of 200 and a height of well
just the amount of height we need for
the content but for the last item we
have a width of 200 and a height of 100
and if you look back at our code right
here we can see why this happened
because our code it can now be read like
this we have a flex flow of column so
the main axis let's go back goes from
top right here to the bottom this means
for the code we will have a look at the
Flex basis which is auto so the width
doesn't play a role because you would
would only be important if the main axis
would be from left to right which is not
the case so if you would have height
right here it would use height as we
don't have height it just uses the
standard value which in our case simply
means just give me enough height to
present the content that's the case for
this fifth element but for the last
element we have a flex spaces defined
right here and this flex basis now
refers to the main axis again the main
axis goes from top to bottom
this means it now specifies a height
right here so we have a height of 100 as
written right there and for the width
well we can of course use the value that
we defined that's why we have a width of
200 so always keep that in mind
flex spaces always refers to the main
axis and it only refers to flex
items so only in a flexbox context you
can use flex basis one last example
maybe if I would add height 100 right or
50 maybe right here like that and save
that and go back then you can see that
now a height of 50 was added just
because what I just said now we have set
Flex to auto and therefore it will look
for a value for the main axis in our
case the main axis goes from top to
bottom
therefore the height will be used now if
we change it back to row finally right
here and save that we can see that now
we will have a width of 15 a height of
50 and we will have a width of 100 right
here and a height that will just be
enough to display the content let's see
if that's correct as you can see we have
a width of 200 a height of 50 and we
have a width of 100 right here because
we defined that for the Flex basis and
we have a height that is just enough for
the content and that's it actually what
I wanted to show you regarding the Flex
items as for the Flex container it's
really important to practice what we
just talked about because with that you
now have an understanding of the real
basic concept behind it but just by
watching the video I think it's hard to
really understand all the details
therefore I can only encourage you to
play around with this example code
because you don't need more code than
that to understand flex box and if you
play around with that and think about
back what we just saw in this and in the
last video I think then you are really
ready to go with Flex box and use it on
your websites and with that as always I
can only say thanks a lot for watching
hope to see you in the next videos and
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
