seeing this before the video starts I'm
actually recording it after I've
finished it I'm just saying this video
is rather long as you can tell by just
clicking on it and I go through the
development or the setup process step by
step if you already know how to set up a
react.js project feel free to skip
through it and just go to the github
code so the code provided you get a
repository individual description to get
the finished setup I just wanted to make
sure that everyone interested is able to
follow along what we're doing here with
that have fun with the video or see you
in the next video where we actually
start with react.js
as promised let's start from the very
scratch I'm in my terminal window here
command line on Windows and I never get
it into the folder where I want to
create my react.js project now I'm going
to create one single project and I'll
extend it step-by-step I will create
different branches with git so that
you're able to download the code of each
step from a github repository provided
in the video description
so the first step of course is to create
a new directory so I'll create one and I
will name it react.js basics I'll then
navigate into this new directory here
and in this directory I want to set up
the workspace we need to work with react
shares now react is of course uses
JavaScript unsurprisingly so what would
you guess we need well we need to react
is core library and actually we need two
parts of it we need to react to your
score and then we need to library which
is responsible for rendering it to the
Dom there are two different libraries we
need so we need to pull in these two
libraries and then of course we are
going to write modular code which means
we're not going to put all our
JavaScript code into one single file
well therefore we need some way of
bundling our code or making sure that
our more
our code gets bundled when running it
because as you might be aware most
browsers currently don't support es6
imports therefore we do need to bundle
them there are also other advantages of
bundling your code of course for
react.js the default way to setup a
project so the way you will see in most
tutorials which is kind of the
acceptable way of creating react.js
projects is to use webpack now if you're
not aware of what web pack is it's
basically a tool which allows you to
bundle all your assets like JavaScript
CSS and so on into a single file or into
single files which then get imported in
your HTML pages
additionally web pack not only bundled
stuff it also is able to transform it so
- for example compile SAS code all these
things so you can load a lot of plugins
into web pack into this tool to really
tailor it to the needs you need to
tailor it to and actually we're doing
some kind of transformation because it's
also common to write react.js code in
es6 syntax now he has success you might
be aware is the next javascript version
and also isn't natively supported by all
browsers yet or not all features are
supported yet they have work we will
need to transform our es6 code to es5
code and we will use webpack and babel
for it
babel simply as a es6 transpiler
which will transpile you six two years
five and we can load the babel plugin
into we're peg to do that but why am i
talking about all that well maybe
because you need to know the core basics
but let's get started setting up web
pack and everything and you will see how
it works so i'm in my brand new folder
here which I created you react.js basics
folder and I will start setting up web
pack now in order to install everything
and manage all my packages I'm going to
use NPM
notes package manager so if you don't
have node.js on your machine right now
go to node.js dot work we can go there
together actually
so no chaser org and make sure to
download the latest version here on the
right six point three point one in my
case download it run through the
Installer and thereafter you will have
node.js on your machine which is great
because we'll need it for our
development server which hosts our files
and even more importantly maybe we have
NPM no its package manager which again
we'll use to manage our dependencies so
all the packages we need to have
everything work the way it should work
so with node.js and NPM installed it's
time to open up a console like ends or
terminal window there's a shot just one
integrated into my IDE and then I'll
have to initialize NPM in this project
so with NPM in it inside this project
folder that's important I'm setting up a
new project managed by NPM that means I
can use NPM to pull in packages and so
on so I'm just adding entered and then I
get a couple of questions I have to
answer because it will create a basic
initialization file for me now you can
use the default which you see in
parentheses here or adjust him to your
needs I will go with the default here so
that is fine on some basic react.js
maybe as a description that doesn't
really matter that's fine or fine get
repository
yeah we'll trade one later on keywords
mod let's throw in a react chase here
offer you may put your name in here by
the way everything will work if you
don't do that to license I'm going to
choose MIT ok with that a brand new file
was created package Jason and it should
look something like that that is the NPM
file which is responsible for managing
your dependencies quarterly we don't
have any but that will change in a
second precisely it will change
now I need a couple of dependencies
obviously so let's install them I do
this with MPM install and I'll start
with the production dependencies first
wealth protection dependency
I mean dependencies which are not only
need for development
what peg would be an example for a
development dependency but which I will
need to have once I deploy my
application and which important
production dependency do I have react
chance of course so let's install react
yes just like that actually it's just
react and also react Dom that is the
second library I was talking of earlier
which is required to access the Dom then
I provide the - - site flag to tell NPM
that these are production dependencies
if you go to the updated package that
JSON file you see that the dependencies
were added here with that I'll install
my development dependencies so npm
install' and then what will we need well
we will need a web pack and we also will
need some kind of server which runs our
application because we want to see
during development and a common
misconception is that since we're only
doing front-end development here we
don't need a server because we could
just double click on the index.html file
and view it in the browser right but
that is actually wrong because we're not
writing a normal HTML file we have our
JavaScript file and we need to have some
server-side functionalities so basically
if you double click on your file in the
browser you can see it in the URL bar
it's opened with the file protocol you
see something like file double double
point that's German :
/ / localhost or not local as you find
them and so on so this is the file
protocol it's not HTTP but we need the
HTTP protocol to really simulate the
state as it will run later on when it is
by a server we need that protocol to
load any imports correctly we might have
and so on therefore we need a
development server and handle yet pack
has one but we have to pull it in as an
extra dependency it's called web pack -
dev - server so that is web pack but I
also need Babel remember Babel is
responsible for transpiling es6 code -
es5 code and since I will run Babel as a
plug-in or loader as it is called any
web pack world in web pack I need to
pull in the Babel loader and I will show
you how to configure this and web pack
later on of course I also need three
other Babel related packages which
basically define which es6 commands I
can use if you want to put it like that
these are some presets I will need to
not only have the transpiler but also
the kind of logic that transpiler needs
so these are called presets babel preset
and the first one is es2015
which is es6 but then i also need to be
able preset react that's just some react
specific babel logic it needs and then
we have the babel preset stage - that is
responsible for having some extra
features like destructuring i guess was
one of them with all that at the - -
saved death flag - well install them all
as development dependencies which means
don't deploy them if you're deploying
your application leave out all the
development dependencies only install
the production dependencies so that
we're not installing something on our
deployment server which we don't need so
that might take a couple of seconds and
thereafter we'll have all the
dependencies we need in the package to
chase the file you see these new
dependencies now with that I'm just
pulling in a readme and a license file -
that
forget that for the github repository
later on but that's not really important
the next step of course is to configure
the other parts of our application
I'll start by creating a new folder and
I'll call this folder SRC or a source
this is the folder where we will write
our source code so where we will change
code and later on I will set up web pack
210 take all the code in this folder and
kind of prepared for deployment and copy
of somewhere else so in the source
folder I will treat an app folder here I
will write my react.js F and I will
treat a new file any source not in the
app folder which I'll name index dot
HTML that of course is my root file main
entry point of my application keep in
mind with react yes you don't have to
create a single page application you
might have multiple ones but we'll start
simple here so here I'll set up a basic
HTML skeleton html5 skeleton like this
give it a title of react yes basic
something like that and should be good
to go now I'll come back to the HTML
file here but first let's configure web
pack for dad whoops I'm going to create
a new file which I'll call web pack
config dot is now in this file and
JavaScript file I'll write the logic to
setup and configure web pack and now
this is no web pack course it is or no
web pack video it's long enough without
being in-depth web pack lecture but of
course it's important to understand what
web pick does so I will walk you through
all these steps step by step if you are
already a where will of what web peg
does and how it works you can feel free
to skip this section of course so your
web pack is the first thing I pull in so
require it from web pack here and then I
will also pull in path which is just a
default node JS library which
is globally available once you installed
noches this will just allow me to
resolve the path of my application here
basically then are going to set up the
distribution directory so the directory
where I want to copy all my transpiled
and prepared and bundled files too so
the directory from which I will actually
serve my app and this should be and here
I will use the path package pause
resolve then does global variable their
name and then dist so that looks a bit
strange but basically what this line
here means is just copy everything which
has been prepared for while serving it
into the dist folder which doesn't exist
yet but will be created automatically
then I'm going to copy that replace this
with source and at the beginning rename
it to dist - - source dear Durr
so the source directory to tell web pack
well you know where to copy it but where
do you actually find the entrance Paul
source code well that is this folder
then but that's time to create another
variable which is called config and
which holds the web pack configuration
here I'll simply set this equal to and
JavaScript object and this javascript
object will actually get exported there
after web pack will then pull in this
object and we'll read it and configure
itself
following the config we set up here the
first thing to setup here is the entry
point to tell web pack which file is the
first file you should start your
transpiling and bundling journey in
because web packs logic is that it has
one or multiple entry files and then it
looks on the dependencies of those files
or the import statements at the top and
pulls in these imports so it builds up a
bundle
adding in some entry point and then
bundling in all the required imports it
automatically also makes sure that they
are all pulled in in the right order and
so on so really clever here I'm going to
use only one entry point and that is
going to be in my source directory and
then a file which I have yet to create
in the app folder the index.js file this
should be my route file because this
will be the file which starts my
application later on I'll also have an
output configuration now this tells
webpack where to output everything we
set up the disco variable of that alone
doesn't tell webpack that this is our
distribution or our target directory the
variable name is totally up to you in
the end so output will be another
channel script object I'll first specify
the path which is in the distractor II
and then in an app folder which will be
traded automatically because remember
I'm talking about each other script code
here and then I'll set up the file name
which be bundled chess because
everything will be bundled and then I
have this public path variable here now
that's important for the web pack
development server because we're putting
everything in the dist folder but on a
real server we would deploy this disk
server so this would be our public
folder now since we have a different set
up here we have a source folder node
modules folder and then the dist folder
we have to tell the web pack server hey
what would be the public server on a
real server server where we only deploy
the dist folder so we can tell it that
the app folder would be the right place
to to look because that will be where
our app lives in with that modules is
the next part in here I defined all the
modules I want to use during my web pack
process with entry output I would
already bundle everything but I would
not transpile es6 to es5 that is what
i'm setting up here in the modules part
you don't have to prove
like modules if you only want to bundle
your code if you don't need to well
compile or change anything if you're
writing when Ella CSS when a lot
JavaScript and so on well then here
there might be no need for modules but
here I will need some I will set up some
loaders I use here and if you want to
learn more about web pack and how to
configure everything definitely have a
look at dedicated tutorials or the
official documentation of course loaders
is an array of Lord loaders and each
loader is defined as a JavaScript object
but here I'm only going to have one
object on only one loader table now a
loader is set up like this we have to
test key which basically tells the web
pack which files should you test or
which file should you have a look at
regarding this loader and since I will
write everything with es6 I want to have
a look at each javascript file now I
will use a regular expression to
identify them so regular expression is
enclosed in two slashes and then a
backslash dot J as question mark means
have a look at all JavaScript files
there after I add the include key which
means which file should you scan for
such files well the source directory of
course then comes the actual loader
which will be the babel loader that's
the package we pulled in via npm and
then i add the query key here which is a
javascript object where i then have some
presets so it might all look strange but
again definitely have a look at the
official documentation to learn more
about that basically here I'm telling it
while the loader is Babel
but Babel in this case also takes some
presets to work correctly and I'm
specifying them here one is the react
preset so presets here basically are
these presets but only now the last part
of the name so
react for example then we also had
es2015 and stage - - that's all that is
the webpack configuration
actually I don't need to pull in a
weapon here at the top by the way so
that is the finished web config file as
it should work and we will see if it
works very soon so with that we're ready
to run web pack but of course we are
missing some things first is the NHS
file we don't have any code so I will
write this soon and we also need some
scripts which you can execute like
appear start some script which actually
starts our web pack process anti
development server so let's continue
with that next I'll start with the
index.js file so I'll go to my app
folder create the index dot J's file in
there and I'm not going to write any
react code here I will just lock
something to the consult
later on see if it works so console.log
it works and then I'm going to go to the
index.html page and here I want to pull
in my script so I'll add script tags
here and then the source and now what
what do you think is the source folder
well you might think that it is app and
then in XJS right because that is where
your file lives but keep in mind
everything will be bundled and moved to
the dist folder later on so we actually
have to import it from slash app slash
bundle dot j s because remember that is
what we set up at your web peg file
everything will be moved to D dist
folder then to the slash app folder and
then it will be named bundle cheese
so dist folder will be the public folder
later on and the app path well will be
where our app will live
therefore app bundle J s with that we're
almost there now we only need some way
to trigger all those webpack copulation
and
so on so I will go to the package.json
file and we have this test script which
I don't really need so I'm going to get
rid of that and I'm going to create my
own script start which is a default
keyword by the way which allows you to
just run NPM start and then execute
something well what you want to execute
and I will well wait a second for
setting up this script I will first
create another one which are name build
and get an oops and yet a number one
build prod so a production build that is
how you create scripts and NPM and then
you can run them and I will also show
you how to run them so let's start with
NPM build which should be our
development build process and what's the
difference well in protection we don't
want to have source Maps we want to
minify everything and so on
so let's start with the development
build all call webpack - d and this is
all i need to do that will execute
webpack this again is d2 will be pulled
in in via NPM and it will automatically
find the config file since we named it
web pack convict oj s - t then tells it
to run in development mode that would
already transpile our code and
everything but we're not done yet I also
need to copy my index.html file because
that also needs to be in the this folder
now I could use webpack for that but I
can also use NPM for dad just use the
copy command that's a default system
command here CP on Windows by the way
that would be copy and then I'm telling
it to copy the index.html file here to
the dist
index.html file so basically copy to the
dist folder that's what I'm telling it
here with that all the files are
prepared now it's time to run the web
pack dev server with this command here
and I need to configure it a bit I have
to put content base here and set this
source the app tells the server that our
well content basically comes from the
source folder which is only important
here for our development server right
then I'll add the inline command just
change the way the server runs or
displays everything and you may add - -
hot for hot reloading to be honest I
always have problems with that
well you can't try it of course and that
should be everything we need of that
it's time to come to the production
environment well in this environment I
basically you will do almost the same
copy all that stuff here until we copied
the HTML file copy that all in here but
change web type - D - minus P which will
remove source Maps minify everything and
so on with that what should NPM start do
well I should just run the bold script
NPM run build and of course I could MP
rambled in my terminal or console but
since NPM start is shorter than NPM run
both I'm giving me this shortcut here so
with that I'll go to the command line
and run NPM start and that looks good no
errors and if you scroll up write it
begin you see that everything is served
from localhost 8080 that's default web
page uses and you can override it by
adding - - port and then your desired
port number but I'll leave it at the
default of 8080 so let's head over there
localhost 8080 and let's see if we see
it works in the command line let's
reload this it works so that was quite a
lot of work I know rather long video but
I wanted to step through that step by
step I hope you're all still awake and
you got a working development
environment now with that we're ready to
get started with react Jas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
