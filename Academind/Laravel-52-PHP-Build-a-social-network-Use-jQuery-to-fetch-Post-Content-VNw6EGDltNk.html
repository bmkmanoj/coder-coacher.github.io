we set up our view so to say to edit
posts and I made an error there or two
errors to be precise and I want to
quickly fix them so I'll jump to a
project and yeah I got a new femur but
should should not look too unfamiliar at
all I hope and now what's important here
is first in your master polite PHP so
our master layout here this last line
here where I import my app dot J's file
this is very important otherwise it
won't work so make sure you get this
import using URL to function as we did
with our CSS file at the top I apologize
to everyone spending hours looking
around why it didn't work well probably
because the import was not added excuse
me
the next thing is that I can delete my
note text urinate myself dad that one of
our errors when you had multiple posts
you could add it like let's say I have a
new post here in the past only the top
one would open the modal and the others
would not now I already fixed this I'm
going to show you how to fix it it's
very easy all we have to do is start in
our dashboard blade dot PHP file I gave
gave this edit anchor tag here a class
of edit so this is new this edit class
here the CSS class and then in my app KS
Fallon JavaScript I change - a query
selector - yeah I have post final
interaction but then find the edit class
and then on each of these and class
buttons I would attach this on click
event and then it will open the modal on
every edit like you click so this should
be fixed and now we're ready to dive
into the next part which is fetch the
actual text we have in our post and
insert it into our modal textbox so that
we can added it now to do this let's go
to the dashboard view and here we get
our edit button which you click in which
will be
the target of our event and here or is
it here I do have the post body in which
I'm interested so the best thing would
be if we get the event fired by this
anger tag to use check which you just
Traverse up and then pick this now this
this first paragraph here in the article
which has the text I want so let's do
this
I don't forget to my app dot JS file and
then I want you in my click function
here I will pass the event as an
argument I can do this jQuery or
JavaScript will passed it for me and
then I can call prevent default to
prevent the default behavior of this
anchor tag to begin with now I want you
stored tags from a post body and
Traverse up I will well you have
followed this route one level up to
interaction what about the post one
level down so this will be the you went
target which will just be the anchor tag
then the parent node again the parent
node now we're in the Arctic level and
then of all the child nodes the index
one and obviously this should be index
one so and here then I can get the text
content I hope let me just print it out
to check real quick if this is working
as intended
yeah this looks very good so now this is
working next step is I want to insert it
into my modal form here right into my
text area I got here which is the ID
post body therefore that is really easy
to do I can just select it post body and
then I can just set Val equal to post
body now let's try this and you post a
post by Chris and perfect so that is
working and now we limited the text into
our into our text box here now in the
next video we will make sure that we can
successfully send this text to the
server through a checks see you there
