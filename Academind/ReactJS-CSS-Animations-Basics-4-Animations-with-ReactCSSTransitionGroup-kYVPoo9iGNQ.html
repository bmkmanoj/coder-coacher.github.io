videos in this miniseries here already
you already know it
animations are important they support
your user when using your website he
knows when he changed something when he
clicked somewhere he gets a direct
feedback so animations are important and
more than just a little extra we already
had a look at the normal CSS transitions
and CSS animations we also had a look at
the react CSS transition group element
which we can add to our application to
use this object to animate the adding or
deleting of elements I'll stick to that
but in the last video we use the CSS
transition property to do that
so we transitioned the opacity here I
want to use a real animation instead so
I chose to use this flip animation and I
will also show you how to use a slide
animation to animate
a element in or out so let's start the
setup here is the same as before I have
the same list with the same array of
items so you might watch the last video
if you want to learn more about the
setup just a brief recap I do have an
array of items which I display in this
collection down here and I already added
the react CSS transition group which has
to be installed with npm install' react
at on CSS transition group you can see I
imported here at the top when I click
the Add button I execute this method
which adds a new item to my array here
and when I click the delete button well
it deletes an element with this method I
do all the adding and deleting in a way
that I can be sure that the state gets
updated so by creating a new object
instead of pushing or popping elements
of my array so I already used to react
CSS transition group and I explained the
general usage in the last video we set
up a transition name and then we create
some CSS classes which get attached by
the react sees as transition group
element here QT element nested between
its opening and closing tag so DLI
element in this case
whilst animating it in or out there
after these classes will be destroyed or
will be removed they're only available
once the element is added or deleted and
we specify the name of our classes here
with the transition name property we
also set up how long the initial
transition so when we fade something in
should take and how long it should take
to fade something out with the
transition enter timeout and leave time
out properties here so that is the basic
usage and I want to start with sliding
in some elements or sliding them out so
as you saw in the last video by setting
it up like this I now I have to provide
some CSS classes which this react CSS
transition group will apply or will
append to my nested element the li
element in this case which is this
individual list item of course since I
named it slide it will append a slide
enter CSS class to this element right at
the beginning of this animate in time
frame so when we add a new item this
will be added first so here I want to
set up the initial State now since I
want to slide it in I will set this to
transform and then translate X minus
100% so that it's just pushed out of the
width of this element the text sets in
so this allows me to slide it in so
initially it will not be visible then I
add slide enter active this class will
also be added during the add an item
time frame here these 300 milliseconds I
set up but a fraction of a second or
millisecond after slide enter so this
will be set after we set this initial
state up here so here previously I set
up the final state anti transition
Elementary transition attribute now here
I want to use the animation instead so I
will add animation here and I will name
the animation slide in of course this
name is up to you it should take
300 milliseconds since this is a time
frame I set up here in my react CSS
transition group and I will ease it out
of course G easing functions up to you
very important setup for words so that
the final state of the animation is kept
you don't want it to pop back to the
initial state you want to keep that
final state so that's slide enter let's
also set up slide leave before then
creating the keyframes for this
animation so slide leaf of course should
start at 0% and should be called slide
leave here we should have slightly
active and we want to animate the slide
out animation here
so now we need to create two different
sets of keyframes for slide in and for
slide out so let's do this next I'll add
two keyframes right below keyframes for
slide in and thereafter I'll add slide
out so slide in here I'll use Fromm and
two but you could also use 0% and 100%
and you could even build build more
complex keyframes of course so here I
will start transform at translate X
minus 100% this of course should match
the initial stage you set up and slide
enter and it should navigate to or
animate to transform translate X 0% to
move it on this x-axis now this should
animate it in now to animate it out here
I will add slide out and of course here
I want to start it
0% again this should match your initial
state up here and the goal is I want to
move it all the way to the right so
sliding in will start at the left move
it in the center and sliding out should
start in the center move it out with
this this should work so let's see this
if I reload this application and now
click item its
right in and if I delete the item it
slides out wonderful so this is a really
easy and quick way to add beautiful
animations and make your lists more
reactive than just simply pushing
element to the end of it and then it's
there this is much more beautiful and
actually shows the user hey I did
something great
now let's enhance this or alternatives
by also adding a flip animation so that
we flip it in instead of slide it in I
will for this copy all that code all the
classes and keyframes and now the goal
is to rename them first so all slide
text here should be renamed to flip in
webstorm I can do this by marking it and
then hitting ctrl G a couple of times
you might have a similar feature in your
editor or IDE so now I get a couple of
flip enter flip leaf classes here and
flip in and flip out keyframes but of
course here I don't want to translate X
instead I want to rotate Y wrote it
white just to bring this back in line is
this rotate around the y axis this would
be rotate X rotate around the x-axis so
wrote it Y but we of course don't want
to start at minus 100% we need to
specify some degrees here and since I
want to rotate in I want to start at 180
degrees not zero decrease because that
will be the final state it shouldn't be
rotated in the final state after all
right so the initial state should be
something else 180 degrees now for the
leaf state here I will set rotate Y to
zero degrees because it should start at
the final state of the flip enter
animation which is zero degrees it's not
rotated and this is the definitely state
we want to have when animating now let's
just copy this and in our keyframes the
initial state of the flip in animation
should of course be the same as up here
in the Philip and her class but the
final state should be zero degrees now I
can copy that and set this as the
initial state for you flip-out animation
which of course should be the final
state of the flip in animation and then
I will set this to let's say 90 degrees
here now in order to see this in action
I will switch this here and this should
no longer be slide but now it should be
flipped to use our new animation and if
I now reload this and add item it flips
in and if I delete it it gets removed
notice the difference between 180 and 90
degrees for flipping it in
I start at 180 degrees which is why we
see a full turn when I flip it out I
only flip up to 90 degrees which is why
it is removed right at the point when it
is well almost invisible so right now
you see that of course you can change
this and find you in this to your needs
so this was the very basic introduction
to react chase and CSS animations and
how to animate the addition and deletion
of elements if you like this of course
I'm happy to dive deeper into that show
some advanced animations show some our
things you can do how you can use
JavaScript to animate and much more let
me know your opinion see you in the
other videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
