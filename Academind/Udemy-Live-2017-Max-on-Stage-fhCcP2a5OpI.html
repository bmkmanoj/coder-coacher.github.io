the San Francisco trip report videos
show up into San Francisco together with
Manuel I was able to join you to me life
which is udemy's conference for
instructors and there I fortunately was
always able to participate in a panel
where some of udemy's instructors
basically share how they became you to
be instructors how they handle course
creation and Zahn I'm happy to share the
questions I got and my answers with you
in this video I hope you'll enjoy it
oh so let's split them to tell about who
move on our Channel today I'm going to
have each of our Channel and actually
introduce themselves by sharing a little
bit about what they were up to before
unity and then also if you guys can
share the story or so of the 20 years of
students I think it's always interesting
so I'm act just as many of my students I
teach I'm actually not a what to
overrule orders in college but I myself
thought what we offer I do teach web
development now on duty but before I
start doing that I worked in there and
how quickly began to study Business
Administration and just many of my
students I decided this is not of a
child I wanna do for the end of my life
so I could at least acknowledge it was
absent one hurt you in a world but
development on my own and started
learning it working as a freelancer and
the psychology that started putting up a
YouTube channel it was a thought would
be interesting to share some technology
garden shears or VHS and Elliott
self-taught developer and YouTube
channel work very well so then I thought
well why should I wanted you to say one
on GTB and strengthening a force rich
people web development identified that
started and the cool thing about the
community is he interacts you actually
have with all the students and they're
both memorable moments which are
attended weird and also really awesome
so weird moment rest of the world
student we actually was we thousands of
questions the Q&amp;amp;A section to Chris
every single x-rays us mentioning the
mr. Armstrong never fight you every
questions ever that not fun because of
the business I played on how it is and
why it claimed the way it is a lecture
and as yet awaited London five-star
reading which was pretty amazing now
totally to experience was when I went to
vacation in Greece and I kind of dropped
it in the mountainous sense a week
earlier and again he would start a
pretty necklace where they said hey max
on vacation so we should probably help
him out in on two questions in queue
later this year on vacation it was
pretty or it was a real big help
yes so exercise those were you to start
us off can you tell me a little bit of
just the first point right here how do
you think about selecting what course
you're going to create next for your
coin operating sure nothing that would
teach web development and I can get to
the broader area very if you actually
work as a developer stolen I'm taking a
project but they still develop a log by
project and on and so I still am active
in the community to get a feeling for
what's coming up with what's trending
and especially you for me in the
front-end frameworks we're all a lot of
changing or what have changed over the
last years and instead they act as an in
building new project all the time we're
or diving into discussions on tech over
clothes on which which gets you a
feeling for once what this council is
coming up with interesting what people
want to learn and you want to get to be
picked by your students once you have
them but don't have Senate we just does
diving into communities you can ask for
brief you can't look as usual thousand
YouTube channels on on tap and see what
they are teaching that's super
interesting to their 6 p.m. to know and
to just look at what you know what's
coming up what's awesome let's change
even what you might want to do to cover
and then you can use tools likely to be
in situ which was launched a few months
ago against a week ago which is really
great for being
when you cover the nudity and which
opportunities you have there and you'll
obviously you're not always the first
ones present of course there are areas
where there are all the art was
accessible courses but then you can go
further than that it's not just a topic
it's also the kind of risk you can cover
the Commish like focus on specific
aspects like security or
just call the full-text or swing even
Otago and web development we just
respond with area which is something and
you can all differ by the course length
there is like a birdie Altoids I went to
Japan l1 which is like the compact
variation of focus to one area or you do
the long one isn't there yet and this is
basically how I approach it and you have
to be pretty flexible there because
things change rapidly or the course
coming rapidly to change to when you
plan that's also artistic course
creation process it's not like set in
stone when you write your first
curriculum it's not necessarily what you
end up with at the end of the day okay
can you give a few examples of some
sites or that you actually yes sure
Cabrillo for example angular my first
big of course which I created I try it
out on YouTube and I saw that there
again a lot of traction with individuals
even though one channel was relatively
small so it's not coming from my
subscribers but actually from new versus
visiting my chest and YouTube is a great
area to try on topics because it's free
to bring up a video as a grouping will
use especially if you don't have a big
audience probably a month topic and that
I decided to do something there into the
court and then I create more for saying
order the future because it gets at see
second you see what's interesting there
in time can diversify that that would be
some sort of good time in an extra large
how do you guys--do expectations
students about answer questions to bigs
ideas for one I try to read encouraged
students to also answer questions on the
road for they help each other because
for one degree helps them because they
learn more as a consequences instead of
just ask employees to ask the harder to
answer
and nothing I do for questions which
come up very often because you typically
like 70% were ticked except the
questions you get are questions you've
gotten before
and for me I really just have a black
channel where I paste in GD answers they
gave in the past that I just pull the
miles we have the links to the original
to Nate resurrected I answered it but I
can quickly point you to the right
resources to the right answer that's
also free cup sometime maybe this is for
everybody
quickly curious the mechanics of how you
create a course things like what screen
capture tools or how to get that quality
one of the things I've had with Excel
for instance is low quality when I was
trying to be with you know capture the
screen image so how do you guys do that
get rid of all of the clutter so you can
really just focus on the content and not
the tools themselves but what tools are
you're using to create it not the coding
the videos
yes I actually voted upon complicated
setup and I believe it's worth it
because I do put my head in a lot of
videos actually at least at the
beginning section because I find it
important that people don't just have a
screen to look at but also to see who is
teaching them and doesn't if you go
through the full course because the most
even there it becomes very cumbersome
quickly and might not be worth the
effort but now since you asked for
specific tools now I found it very
different on a Mac or on Windows
actually on Mac super simple there is
Greenville there it's super easy it
stars you basically press the button and
you can record it you can record the
audio whether you just need a good
microphone and regarding the the editing
I do actually put quite some time into
post-production who was once you have
clean cuts and a 1/2 unnecessary errors
in there on adding them I call out
sometimes too much words it with I use
that their primary and after effects but
of course you're all the free tools or
their cheap tools you can use on whether
it is actually a bit more difficult I I
directed nice to get a good screen
quality especially on Windows 10 on to
no one would train Tony was a bit more
difficult as a little bit of a mess
together to look
but there there are free tools like a
OBS open broadcaster software suddenly
freeze both works on that and you just
well search for the settings for for
screen recording print out Felder cuz
you can just search for bed set up or
let's say Jordan 720p or at an HP
protection and use them and don't mess
around too much with aesthetic because
it's easy to get a bad picture but as
Stevie said it does need a good picture
and not like perfect calibration for
everything that's basically what I have
to add there hey Alfred is I have
another question but how much percentage
wise you talk about the following how
much do you feel you do you say to put
your head in it so 10% 50% I mean what
do you find is working that was my
original question which is expired yeah
it really depends like words the do of
course is where I only have my head and
like the getting at the end of each
section where I lay out there at the
module and then summarize it in other
words that I had in every single video
buzz over time all the records that
might be a little too much also some
students don't like it because it can't
be distracting so typically what I try
is attributed it tries to it at the
first section of the course because
there is where most students are still
with you and watch the cord and there it
can be a real benefit and it is the ones
engaged in its beginning and handle
every section so patience when I do a
summary I want them to be able to see
myself because if you don't have that
much in the screener can some PowerPoint
slides and yet you want to be able to
communicate with your students tear it
for safely course roundup so that is
what I try to do there in the center
twice then it's not like maybe only 5 to
10% but if the parts rated you it is
important my actual question zone with
what I just had is um so how much time
how do you produce the obsessive
projects not his snap sent locomotive
sniffles I mean we're talking about
researching new stuff and sure you can
get little snippets but
sounds like I guess I assume everybody
has like some kind of sample project but
as you go along to do another one how do
you approach that to me that that's a
veteran point who made it figure out do
I do create new sample projects when why
leverage rum and how do I come up with a
whole cohesive project for one class I
thought a same approach Ross mentioned
earlier I try think about the topics
that when I cover in the course and then
I was thinking about project very good
this is all into word as many features
off the language or break or whatever
other types of teaching this gives you
would fit into one thing order two or
three projects and I think about real
life websites you know like Facebook you
can try building a simple clone of that
of course not put all the
functionalities in there but have
project students read clients then build
it on your own see if you can fit all
that work on the content of the course
into it and that's basically how I built
it out the weapons you also hit pain
points or things where you rent micro
issues that have to come to bed and of
course too because it's going to be
difficult to implement or we need some
additional knowledge there that is how I
typically approach Ted and then I just I
just build it i builders that taste
obviously a couple of days weeks depends
on the project and then I build it again
through the course sometimes they
deviate there if I see what that would
be interesting to comfort you
but that's how I approach it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
