welcome to this video my name is Max and
as you might know I got a serious on
this channel about view beautify and
firebase now when I started this serious
what you should definitely check out a
pair skins reached out to me now Abe is
a developer working on the firebase team
at Google and he offered that she could
walk us through some of the more
advanced features of firebase such as
how to structure your data or how to
write database rules and maybe give us
an overview over firebase now since I
was going to San Francisco anyways check
out the trip video on this channel too I
thought why not take this opportunity
and here's an important thing this is
not a paid promotion or anything I don't
get any money for that and that's not
why I went there I thought it would be
awesome to talk with someone who really
works on this product which I use
anyways so Abe Haskins definitely follow
him on Twitter if you like this firebase
serious this is his twitter ID here
advise us to Google so why don't we take
a closer look at firebase together with
him so hi egg MX great down here in San
Francisco at the Google office to talk
about firebase I'm super excited that
you could come out here to chat yes
thanks so much for having us here this
is an awesome opportunity and I think
what's important to people what would be
nice to know is what actually is
firebase and what are the cool features
how can be used what can we build with
our base again so far base is a platform
of hosted cloud services that are all
exposed to simple sdk so if you're
building on web these are mostly
features related to your database
storage authentication running
server-side colored things like that so
it's this whole suite of tools that you
can pull together to really build your
app without running your own servers or
dealing with any of the complexities
that come what security and optimization
and things like that and what's really
cool actually is that we got our cloud
solutions to like obviously eight oh yes
but all you do climate but harvest is
basically simple right but it make a
little things easier yes so we kind of
as Google cloud is infrastructure server
so if you need virtual networks and you
need nvidia gpus and crazy complex
computational power go look at Google
cloud but if you're building a mobile
app that's dealing with a lot of those
kind of things most people are dealing
with like signing users and yep or you
know storing that synchronizing this I
mean push notifications all these things
everyone does so we don't need to make
you breathe but the wheel on top of a
virtual machine or your own server we
can just give you these services in a
very simple easy-to-use way and if you
ever need it Google Cloud is better for
you to step on to from firebase to build
up a really complex and get structure
that's Rakuten can actually look at it I
prepared a little project but that
basically I'll every new project looks
like an entire based consult and the one
can add it to different platforms like
iOS Android and weapon mentioned yet
that's cool figure you can build one
bagging for all these apps right
absolutely and the core features he
mentions our authentication database and
storage probably or web all the hosting
and cloud functions that Rosaline you
like yep yep cell function is our newest
offering and it's one of the most
important things we've ever launched
basically we have all these different
services that all were really really
good in there are guides authentication
sign in user that's great but you
couldn't do much more with that you
couldn't send an email that easily
functions ties it all together if you
want to send engagement email if you
want to go and send it push notification
text message anything like that
cars honking - lets you do that without
running your server that's actually
interesting thing because I started
using firebase or experimenting with it
like two years ago I was in the thing
and the one missing thing always lost
the ability to run them code when
something cancels right well for the
real-time database you could do a lot of
things with rules we'll also going to
talk about but cloud functions really is
an isolate on to really have all the
remote a really powerful and it's funny
usage is because I joined firebase four
years ago get mosque and we've been
talking about making functions in four
years so it is amazing to finally get it
out in just a PC the real
you know what we are what we knew
everyone you far away that'd be and to
get out after the contest yeah I believe
that um so maybe what fruity core or
feature ship quickly um forget
authentication I actually already have
one signed in method picture but like on
them which basically you do provide a
couple different ones I have email and
password already enabled um tragically
stores the user data you know one hazard
on your on Google servers but so we
don't have to manage that we don't have
to cash anything to or anything it's all
encrypted and you have to handle that
you know all you have to do is call a
function on your clients or new jobs
together examine here's an email use the
password will let you know if it works
if it fails will let you know that you
need your access know dealing with any
of these security of it that's that's
really because always getting security
rights is super important super easy to
memorize fairly and and it's nice
because you mentioned annexed we can
have a look at it in code and have a
little application in which you would
have CD signup code where basically I
reach out to that's an angular app to
reach out to service where we then
called the use the SDK to simply use
this create user with email and password
methods and that's alright we we just
handled a response or potential error
here and pretty cool because nothing
else to mentor us yeah and this is one
of those points right now this was old
part of its functionality we've had user
email password sign in for years but now
if you wanted to go and you know send
someone a message as soon as they sign
up that's a cloud prompt yes you
can go and say alright anytime when your
user gets created we run this bit of
code do this thing you'll send me a
message saying I'll someone signed up
yet all of that was running the server
so cool so that's really nice reception
but if you need it you actually have
morals that you can use all these social
sign-in provides like Google Facebook
Twitter get Evan when it please
anonymous and phone yes absolutely so
anonymous is a classic one that's been
around for a long time and the basic
idea is that if you have someone come to
your application even if they don't sign
it even if they're not going to go give
you their Google
anything like that you may want to know
who they are where they come back so it
just likes them gives them a unique ID
and since all right anytime this person
revisit they all have that same ID so
you could give them temporary resources
you could just keep stage for them
between page refreshes and when they
leave come back next week anything like
that so it's completely headless they
don't get prompted anything to Desai's
them in that you are anonymous user 422
and you always know that you can rely on
that identity and we use the SDK for DES
you to send basically request you to
firebase Jack and then stick it's just
one method just like created user visits
when it's signed an anonymous gray and
that's all it is
oops yes it's very useful it's a lot
more useful than you think at first
because you're going like why would that
be cool but anytime you're building
something with like a trial mode or like
a demo you can do write all the code
that deals with authentication it
expects to use it to be there a get
object and have their identity but you
needed to other sounding anonymous so
everything happens as it would normally
but they're anonymous yes and one of the
really cool part services more advanced
about authentication is that if you had
a float where someone comes to your
website they're trying something maybe
they're you're creating a document or
something you tie that to that anonymous
user ID now they go when they say all
right I'm going to sign in with Google I
really like your service generally
that'd be a really hard transition in it
you'd have to like look at the anonymous
data and migrated or something when they
found out Google which firebase
authentication is one method called
linking the credential okay and when you
do that you say all right I'm currently
an anonymous user but I just signed in
with Google so I can link that now that
anonymous credential and that Google
credential all tie back to the same user
mm-hmm so when if they come back sign
with Google it's the same versus and if
they said oh I want to add Facebook and
Twitter login as well this can all tie
back to the same credential that same
user ID so regardless of how they're
choosing designs in they're all linked
together that's pretty useful it's also
also be educated so yes it's all in the
etiquette but that's process very useful
and so on I guess I thought in Google
i/o the role the MU teacher we're
basically we get a like a number of key
on our phone which can use to to sign in
yes yes on integration
is part of us integrating with fabric
that you might've heard we recently
joined forces with the fabric team from
Twitter and the phone authentication is
exactly that you enter a phone number to
text someone a unique code and enter
that code and they've signed it so they
don't even have to have a Google account
or Facebook account or anything like
that
it was pretty useful - and that's
basically authentication let me see is
more to it we can Cisco life like
templates which we send for email
notification and resetting and then when
you get users we can actually show that
me demo because it setups we can use
sign up and which will just seem to
execute this method here so if we enter
some email address and some valid
password there or we try invalid one
first and click sign up now we actually
get here here because I am catching it
here so that's the default our Bates
message elements which is always just a
tiny thing when it's nice we get the
final meta - you know error code or code
we have two parts and then really just
display the message character to the
user because that's pretty useful but if
we then switch to the correct
credentials were actually locked in on
canal's you here refresh the users that
you know that's actually user ID which
we can also get in the SDK to get exact
right do whatever want and come back to
what we want to later when we match it
to database data so that's the database
next future arm but don't you give us a
brief overview yeah so the permit real
time database is extremely simple real
time database and it's not a term you'll
hear a lot because not many databases
that have real time functionality but
basically what this means is that the
knee of a client you can use our SDK to
interact directly with the database so
you're not dealing you're not like
calling a server
and having your no dress like right to
Mongo and then Raymond API is talking
directly to the database and saying I
want to put this data expectation and
any other client who's interested in so
if you're building like a chat
application every other client who wants
to know when a new message hit that it
can get updated in real time so you're
dealing with like
asynchronous handlers instead of HTTP
requests do get the data other new
messages no other messages no so it's
really clean easy to use model through
building
oh yeah and which is that it's for
interesting because I actually get this
question a lot in common and in our area
that the question is how can I reject
your database for my angular app and the
answer is you can't you can't better to
connect to a database or you shouldn't
yeah you can connect to a server which
then connects to the database and
fetches data and sends it back to you
but that obviously requires you to set
up a server and if you want real-time
integration you need to use WebSockets
or basically that and believe with that
and setup that on your own or and some
polling where you'll send a request and
we second or something like that and
here it's super simple because the the
API is super simple to use here it gets
us listen to messages method where I
simply use the of a reference for that
basically points to a certain part in
the database right and then we just
specify on every new event I want to do
something with the data and that's super
super helpful here completely different
why haven't you met databases if you've
tried any of the other options out there
is so much is yet so much similar we can
actually show this to you because we do
have it here in the demo so if I enter
some test message here no actually will
include put it side-by-side so that if
we know and you're just test message we
actually see it appear here instantly
level the top of the nice to know it
super fast right yeah and Emmy it looks
like I mean we're dealing with two tab
from say computer here so you might have
like our team local it's synchronizing
back and forth but that's not what's
happening this is going all the way to
the data center from one tab all the way
back yes so this is a complete
round-trip the same type of performance
you'd expect if you are in New York and
I was in Berlin or anything crazy like
that it's that type of speed yes the
dead reduce to process so we were doing
this edge of maintaining socket
connections heavily optimized protocols
and a lot of things way over my head
all I know is that it works and it syncs
my my data
yes it doesn't eat and we can actually
see the other way around if I change it
here in the database like test message
and at my explanation marks we enter if
it really doesn't define us and it hit
into the updates they're like yeah so
generally we try to keep a round-trip
time under the threshold of human
reaction time which is about 200
milliseconds so hopefully if it's change
a change should be fast enough that you
should be able to notice the delay so
it's pretty bad
yeah it really assessment yeah as
refasten super helpful because just
again all I did is I used database
reference then basically specifially
code stop for the treatment database you
could say not a table that's maybe
interesting we don't have multiple
tables right we have like a casein data
ski if exactly all your data and purpose
is traces yes you can think of it as
Jason when you get it back into Java
into javascript or into any of your
other apps they're always native objects
represented in a way that feels natural
so in JavaScript that's always just a
plain Java object and if you're
wondering what can I put into this
database which other types anything you
get your own jason we store both in here
and it's really cool because you can
actually take any given piece of
information in your database and get it
back as jason yeah so if you're dealing
with a legacy platform if you're like I
have application rigid PHP and I wanted
to use real time database you can use a
REST API can get back and talk in Jason
and it'll send out real-time updates
just as if you reduce it realized okay
that's cool and where's this key
actually coming from so we didn't pass
it there so it is related to how we pass
it with the push method so that's
probably interesting too we get two
different ways of setting data right
after week which are these yes so your
two real methods for writing there's
actually three so the set up date
portion set and update basically the
same the big difference is that you give
a specific location so hi would say
messages message one set this value and
that exact location would get set
Valluvar David pushing is a little
different because of the way the
real-time database works where we have
one data source being written to by
potentially tens of thousands or
hundreds of thousands of clients we need
to make sure that these unique IDs can
get added and you can make lists where
people aren't over rating each other
could you imagine if you had messages as
a traditional array where your keys were
integers and it's just like message zero
message one message - if you have things
moving this fast and tens of thousands
of people doing it the likelihood you're
going to be a message for and two people
against I write to five is really really
high so what we do instead of using
those keys is we use what we call push
IDs which is this crazy idea here which
are Alexa graphically sorted keys okay
so the really long way of saying if you
push in a message later it will show up
later so they act just like pushing onto
an array but they're sensitive to race
conditions where you don't have to worry
about race conditions and I don't have
to worry about people over writing each
other if a hundred thousand people push
to the same location at the same time
they're not getting that same push ID so
every single one of those records is
gonna be there that's interesting inside
so just not a random string but actually
a random stream which keeps track you
order yep yep so it's really important
sorry for building a chat like this on a
bush later my trap messenger belated in
chat so that's that's lessons like um
and actually now if we if we well we saw
it before but if we now want to read it
then the educator will video on method
and they're always in a an alternative
site we can all just get one data the
once message so I'm technically on set
up an ongoing listener and once it's
just getting once and pretend like yeah
yeah exactly
so once is the more traditional we're
hitting an HTTP endpoint getting the
data back one that exactly that's at
once if you want to drill time updates
are using on yes I guess we go into that
we use the SDK and how it works in a
line video where we go back to the other
features turnout um real quickly maybe
let's the storage that's um like just a
traditional cloud storage can all be
used in our application you're pretty
SDK doesn't work saying and the
interesting part which makes it not so
traditional is actually that we can
easily upload all
files for the SDK again so we don't have
to waste bigger of pause or do any
multi-part
order keeping and stuff like that we
just call a message yep yeah
traditionally file uploading is one of
those things that seems super simple
like I just take take binary dance is it
yeah but it's super complicated if
you're dealing with mobile networks
where people have flaky connections so
the likelihood your data is going to get
messed up it's super high there's so
many concerns that come with uploading
things and even once you get it uploaded
there's security that think about what
did they just upload to my server is
this actually an image or is it some
malicious binary you don't know so
storage takes care of a lot of that
cloud storage for firebase will let you
restrict what people are uploading you
can say they can only upload images that
are so large
let me check mine types that they have
to be an image and you can say who can
run where you can say alright this user
has a directory that is their folder but
they can do whatever they want that can
upload anything they can delete anything
we aim anything but they can't touch
anyone else's data so your again you'd
like that security aspect that's so
important we take care of for you and we
give you a really easy way to configure
so that your application lets your users
interact resided in the way they want
and this is all completely separate from
everything else so even if they did
manage to upload some malicious binary
it's never going to influence your cloud
function like it's not going to be able
to get over there yes so it's just a
really clean easy to use way to upload
images files anything you want yeah so
the story safely away and not running
for the same server blurred illegally
it's not easy go at it yeah and we can
configure it everything else here on the
rule so we can get you lost down we can
upload wise you can upload away
everything like that cool um and then
maybe to to wrap it up quick walk
through hosting and functions yep so
hosting is difficult Hosting is if
you're building an angular app that's
entirely client-side is going to use s
up as an entirely client-side
you might be asking stuff where do I
host this how do I should get this
public that people can use it and you're
a few options people think of like
github pages a lot which is not the
greatest solution and the main reason is
that it is a single server or a single
point cell or it what I should know No
but for a long time if you have a page
hosted there it would be one server and
if I was in Berlin and I hit that page
it would have to go all the way to
wherever that there's one hosting is a
real easy way to deal with static sites
that are distributed on a CDN so if you
have one site you say on a deploy this
using the command line tools we offer
and it sends it out to like 30 different
servers all in key points around wall to
whatever your user is they're getting
that app serve to them as fast as
possible cool so it has that and then it
also has some cool integrations with
functions and caching and things like
that so you can cache function responses
and it's actually really really powerful
but its simplest mode it's just a great
great place to prepare applications yes
and actually easy to get at SSL
Certificates you right oh yeah you get
one thing people to get one by the
college app so by default with no effort
from you you get something dot firebase
opcom totally your project entities
they're ours here is like birch at 75 P
32
that's very base outdoor yeah that's
great but not very friendly
let's see instead of a custom domain you
just routed it to us and say all right
now when you domain we eat your an SSL
certificate we enforce that all users
use SSL which everything is nice and
secure and it's something that's really
very useful and cost of something
interesting to which we can talk about
at the end but um just a quick look
would functions we had a brief look
you'll reset it it's basically a place
we can run code in the cloud right not
saying only jealous type code right you
know so you get access to a full
operating system like Linux environment
but we only officially support in there
just you can't do crazy stuff if you
really want to and like upload binaries
and run node but right now all our epic
is our JavaScript element but which
makes sense because I gets to node.js
since we work along with cello cello
scope these days is like a million we
wanted it to feel as natural to web
developers as possible so if you you
know are used to scripting up little
JavaScript logic it's literally like one
extra line like import our SDK into node
and then deploy it on up and you're good
function yes so that's that's really
nice you is it finally a pricing maybe
arm we can actually teach it we have you
have to pre different plan your arm like
where is the sparkle and every new
project starts
or cleanse because and then we have the
choice between two pay plans either the
win which has like a fixed capped amount
yeah but when we talk about capitals it
will cap some other things yeah anyway
it'll cap your your growth yes so if you
had say I only have twenty five dollars
a month to spend that is my limit and
I'd rather have everything stop it if it
goes past that you can use that fix
Alaska so it's basically like a very
strong city net but the bad part is if
you do go past that you'll have to
either quickly switch to blaze or deal
with downtime in your application if you
don't want that and what it's honestly
cheaper most of the time is to use the
blaze plan which is just pay-as-you-go
every firebase feature is either free or
has a cured or attitude today as you go
usage so for every gigabyte storage into
this month and almost everyone I've ever
seen who is on a plane plan should
really be on the blaze plan because it's
just you get a ton from like the ability
to use less it doesn't use two dollars
worth of storage or you use five cents
worth of real-time database that's how
you pay for with the place where with
the twenty five dollar amount on your
o'clock dad $25 yell on yeah that
doesn't leaves like an important thing
to say because I think some people might
look at this and say okay here like plan
I have to danger of paying too much and
actually here with place I'm you up to
guarantee to pay yeah 25 dollars a month
and if you need more than that you ever
cap as it has to grow qf which is
probably don't want to do now or it's
fine if you pay more because you're EPS
growing and then well yes we cover you
exactly and honestly 25 bucks a month is
a ton of firebase you can look through
this list but a lot of these things are
included for free things like fire bits
cloud messaging are completely free even
if you send a billion messages a month
I run a bunch of side projects and apps
and pirates and my total bill is in the
double digits and the obscenities that
came to steam box a lot because all
these things are really designed so that
you can get going easy and two years
down the road when you are a really good
company and you need more power then we
have more powerful us Google cloud if
you want to go there yes but this is for
young young company in started you're
building prototypes and things like that
so you learn how great our ecosystem in
and that's why it's incredibly cheap
yeah I I agree three a nice option and
yes definitely one which allows you to
will after all right that was a nice
introduction
um or don't we take it from there and
never till to look at the database
awesome
