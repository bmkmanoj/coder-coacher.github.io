building our restful service with no js'
and in this video I want to start adding
authentication so that we can ensure
that certain resources on our server are
only available to users who are logged
in now of course one important question
will be how we actually implement
authentication in a restful service
because it's different to your normal
node.js application you might have
written and I'll have a look at this and
then of course actually implement it in
our project in this video so let's start
let's start by first understanding how
authentication works in a restful
service as we are building it so we get
a client and a server and remember a
client is for example your web app your
building so the front and facing the
client facing web app which you might
write with a framework like angular
react or do or with an vanilla
JavaScript or any other client could be
a mobile app that connects to a back-end
to also have a data layer to be able to
store data and fetch data these are your
clients I talked about them earlier in
this series so make sure to go through
all the earlier videos too so that's our
client that's our server now we want to
log in and for that the client is going
to send some off data to the server with
off data I mean email address and
password of a user if we have a typical
email and password of indication flow on
the server we then if we're signing up
we can then store this data in the
database by hashing the password and
storing it and so on or if the user is
logging in because you already did sign
up in the past then we would simply
check these values on the server so we
would verify if the user who's sending
us this data actually has a valid
account for this given data on our page
so this is what we do on the server and
then we return something in a normal
node app that would be a session but in
a restful service it can't be a session
because remember restful services are
stateless they don't save any
information about connected clients at
least not like this we don't care about
whether a mobile app or a web app
connected therefore we don't use
sessions and we also can't use sessions
because some clients might not even
support the idea behind sessions say a
mobile app might not support a session
or for example if we connect to our API
from an aviary I so from an average
which runs on a server then also
sessions wouldn't make any sense so
we're not connecting through a session
or we're not building such a session
instead what we do is we will actually
returned a token now a token essentially
will be some object some piece of data
that will actually contain some
signature so that we can verify on the
server if it's a Bella token so that we
can't fiddle around with it on the
client and some information about the
locked and user and this token can then
be stored by our client and can be used
to be attached to future requests so
that whenever we in the future try to
access something on the server which we
want to protect we attach that token
which we received from the server we can
then verify this token on the server
because of the signature which is
attached to the token so that we can see
that it still is - token we issued and
it hasn't been messed around with and
once we got that verified we know you
got a token the token is valid so you
may access this resource and this is how
how authentication works here we work
with these tokens to not store the
information whoever you are allowed to
access something or not on the server
but on the client but in a way that we
can always check if it's valid on the
server that's of course important
otherwise anyone could send us a token
and if we just check if a token is there
then this would not be very secure but
by being able to verify this token well
it is actually pretty secure let's have
a closer look at this token though so
this token is called a JSON web token
typically or typically we use this
format to be precise because it simply
is just adjacent data object in the end
where we can add some information like
the idea of the user or the email
address of the user who is signed in and
some signature so these two pieces are
important it also contains data about
when the token is going to be expired
and the issuer of the token overall all
this data which we put together into a
token makes up this JSON web token which
we return to the client now the
important part is what I mentioned
earlier we can verify this signature and
therefore the validity of the token on
the server and if we may
add something to the token or try to
fake the token we could find out that it
is not a valid token on the server
because we use a private public key
combination and only the server knows
the private key so only the server has
both keys it needs to in the end
validate this token one important note
though the token is not encrypted so
once we've got it on the client we can
actually have a look at it we can
extract the data from it but as I said
if we try to change it well that doesn't
do anything
we can still verify it on the backend so
this is how this token works and what we
do with it or how it is structured now
thankfully we don't have to build a
token on our own if you want to learn
more about the token though you can you
can simply dive into the video
description where you will find more
information about the token but I'd say
let's stick to this right now
and let's actually implement
authentication with JSON web tokens in
our restful service so let's add
authentication and to add authentication
we need users right so I'll first of all
create a new model and I'll name it user
J s because here I wanted to find how a
user should look like in my app I'll
then copy the order model let's say just
because I'm going to use the general
same layout I'll rename order scheme add
user schema though and I'll rename my
model from order to user now the fields
here will also vary of course we got our
ID but I don't have product and quantity
here instead here I want to have my
email let's say and there I'll add an
object which is of type strings or which
says that it should be of type string
and also that it's required so let's set
this to true and I want to have a
password of course password also will be
a string and also is required so these
two fields need to be given or need to
be there if we create a new user model
now we can revisit this later to also
add connections to products or orders
but for now let's keep it simple and
let's focus on the authentication
so this is how a user should look like
now I also need routes for the user so
add my user dot JS file here in the
routes folder and I'm going to set up
the routes file file in the same way I
did for the other routes so I'm going to
copy these imports from Express router
and Mongoose and put it into my user J's
file and then at the very bottom of the
file I'm going to export my router with
the module exports syntax now in between
will create their user related routes
and for now I want two routes sign up
and sign in you might wonder what about
logout well since we don't store
information about the user on the server
we don't store the information wherever
the user is locked in or not we can't
lock the user out what would we do we
there is nothing to delete there is no
session we need to clear or anything
like that so we don't need a logout
route so let's create our first route
then and that should be a post route to
create a new user and I'll simply name
is slash signup that will be my path
overall the path will be user slash
signup but I'll load these routes just
as I load the other routes from within
app chess by importing it here and then
using certain prefix and then pointing
to the routes file but that will be the
next step now for now let's simply
create our signup route here of course
we create the routes just as we did in
the our files so I'll add a second
argument where we get the request the
response object and this next function
we could execute if we were building a
normal middle where and then here now
the goal is to create a new user now
let's see how we can do this
first of all I'll import the user model
so I'll trade a user constant here and I
will require it from my models folder
and there from the user file now what we
can do is we can create a new user by
creating a new constable case user and
then this will be a new user now this is
just as we for example create a new
product to write there we create a new
product using our product mongoose model
now to the user we can pass a
javascript object and now there are a
couple of things we needed to create
also keep this in mind we created an ID
and then we assign the different values
so I'll copy the ID value from the
products route because we create the ID
in exactly the same way with the
Mongoose types object ID helper method
here but then remember we had two fields
here email and password so what I'll do
is I'll add email and password here
now why of course need to be populated
and I will assume that we will get these
fields from the incoming request so we
can say the email is request body email
and then we can also say the password is
request body password now this pattern
or doing it like this has one major
extremely bad security flaw do you see
which one which flaw I mean well we
store the raw password in the database
now let's consider or let's assume that
we get the password via HTTP that in the
end we host our app why I HTTP still
still at that case we would get our
password through an encrypted and
protected connection but we will store
it in plain text form in the database
and if anyone ever gets access to our
database be that an employee or an
attacker of our website then all our
user passwords are going to be readable
just like that we don't want that so we
need to encrypt our password we need to
hash it and for that we'll use a package
we'll use node be tripped Jas now github
link can be found in the video
description and yentas is just a package
that will hash our password and hash it
in a secure way that also can't be
unhatched so to say or can't be
translated by using dictionary tables
I'll come back to how exactly this works
in a second so here on this page you see
the installation instructions on how to
use it
I'll copy the install command here and
shut down my server and run npm install
bcrypt I'll also add - - safe to add an
entry to package.json this will now
install this hashing library which I
will use to do the hashing for me now
we'll take a couple of seconds you might
see some errors in between us I do here
but it should be able to recover from
these and fall back and finish without
an error in the end then we can restart
a server with NPM start now we see how
to use it here and I will simply use
that hash method here so this is how we
do hash our passwords I will import it
first of all import decrypt by requiring
be tripped like this and then the
password should be stored using this be
crypt library and there the hash method
now the first field here is request body
email so that will be the password I
want to hash in plain text form and then
we have these salt rounds now what the
salting mean here well the following is
the case if we hash a password
theoretically that is safe because you
can't reverse a hash you can't translate
a hash to the plaintext value it's a
one-way operation and if you wonder how
we then are able to verify if a password
the user enters on sign-in is the same
password we store the database I'll come
back to this so in general it's non
reversible but if you get this hash in
the end which is just a random string
and you would Google that hash chances
are high you would find a translation to
your plaintext password why because
every plaintext string has a clear
unique hashed version of it with the
hashing algorithm getting used here and
that means that so-called dictionary
tables exist these dictionary tables are
in the end just what they sound like
we have plaintext values and the hash
value for it so if your user has a very
elaborate password of course no
translation might existence actually a
dictionary table but if your user uses
something like ice cream chances are
this translation does exist so if anyone
gets access to your database they might
still be able to get the plain text
password from such a dictionary table
the idea behind salting is that we add
random strings cue that plaintext
password before we hash it and then the
strings that were added are also stored
in the hash by doing it like this
googling the hash won't lead to the
plain text version of the password
simply because the plain text version
contains a random string and we don't
have hashing tables dictionary tables
for all kinds of random strings and that
is what salting does and here you
defined a number of salting rounds 10 is
considered safe and with that we make
sure that our passwords can't be looked
up in dictionary tables and then we add
a callback here this is a function where
we as you can see documentation ebrill
get an error or we get the hashed
password so we have these two arguments
and then we can check if we got an error
here then we want to return a response
where we send status code 500 and a JSON
object where we maybe set an error
object which contains our error so then
we simply know okay this failed we don't
have a password we couldn't store it in
yet we couldn't safely hash it otherwise
if you got no error then we have a hash
password and this can now be stored in
the parent in the database so what we
need to do actually is change our code
we don't assign this to password because
it's no synchronous operation instead
here this bcrypt
operation is what we execute first and
only if we make it into the else case
only in this case we'll create a new
user but then in the Al's case we got a
password value and that will be the hash
so this is how we now can generate or
create a user with a hash password now
if we
half the user here then we can call
users safe to save the user in the
database and then we can again chain
then here so just like we did for
products but we also have then and catch
too well do something with errors or
with success cases so if we are
successful we get back a result and
there we probably want to return a
response where we will be don't need to
return even can just say response status
web status 201 because we created a
resource and then Jason where we could
have a message where we say user create
it something like that and we can also
catch any errors of course and in such a
error case we can do what we always did
we can simply maybe log it to the
console and return it so like this and
let's also log our user in the result in
the success case to the console so that
we can see what was created here and
with that if we save all of that we got
our user creation to sign up route now
let's test it and for that I'll go to my
app J's file and in there I'll first of
all imported so I'll import user routes
by requiring dot slash
API routes user so just like I do it for
Diablo routes and then I'll go down
there and also forward any requests
going to slash user slash something to
my user routes with that setup we should
be able to reach that route with a post
request now let's try it out in postman
so here I am in postman I prepared my
request post request to slash user slash
sign up now I need to attach a body
which is now not form data but a raw
body of type Jason let's create such a
Jason body and if you have a look at our
route then you see we try to extract the
email here and of course web Stetson
error here for the password we should
also use body password of course so
password and email these are the two
fields we'll need so let's add them here
let's add an email test at test comm and
let's add a password so password like
this or maybe tester something like that
and let's now try it out that's it's
sent and I get an error because I need
to set my head or a content type
application Jason let's now try again
and now we get user created as a message
here and if we have a look at our
terminal here where we do log something
we see a user was created and this is
this random hash I was referring to so
this is now our password in the way it
was stored in our database and this is
now not possible to look up with
dictionary tables so this is now the
user we create it on our server so now
we're able to sign users up there's one
issue though if I were to send the same
request against I hit send again then
the user is created again so now we
created two users with the same email
address and chances are that you don't
want that you want to ensure you only
have a user with an email address once
in your database so what can we do about
this well we need to check if the given
email address is still a whale
in our sign up route so before we hashed
a password and try to store the user
let's do something totally different
let's simply use the user model we
import from Mongoose from our Mongoose
model and find a certain object where we
search the user entries for an email
address where email is actually request
body email and now we'll exit this to
get back a promise and add then and
catch now here in the den block
I'll get my document so my user in the
end and here's the part where we will
have issues if user exists so if user is
not knowledge or if user is not now I
mean so if it's not false so if we make
it into this if block we know we have a
user and in this case I just want to
return a response where a sends status
code cheaver now we could use 409 which
means conflict we got the request we
could handle it but we got a conflict
with the resources we already have or
422 which means unprocess about entity
which also pretty much means the same we
got requests we could theoretically read
we understand the request but we can't
process it pick the one you enjoy I'll
use 409 even though you don't see that
this often now this is the error core a
code I returned here and I can also
attach a message where I say mail exists
something like this with that we won't
continue in all other cases here we will
continue and I don't even need to catch
block therefore however of course we
should continue inside this then block
here so that is where we should then try
to hash our password and do all our
other stuff so I'll cut this and put it
into this else block here just to make
sure that we only execute this if we
don't have a user for that email address
and now if we saved us all and I send
the same email and password combination
again I get
the mail exists error and if I send a
different one like test two I also get
mail exists why because remember if you
use user find like this user here is
actually not going to be null if you
don't find entries it's going to be an
empty array so instead what we should
check here is if user length is greater
or equal to one that means we already
have that email address and for other
lengths like zero basically we want to
create a new user so now if I save this
and set this again we create the user
but if I send it a second time we get
mail exists so now this is working as it
should obviously we now have the issue
of having one wrong user entry in our
database because we created that first
email address twice or maybe you pressed
the button more often so we will also
need to clean that up and how can we
clean it up well we can simply add a
delete route here which allows us to all
the delete users something we probably
want to you have in our application
anyways so now I will add delete route
here and I'll just have slash user ID
and get my request response next
function here and in there I'll now use
my user remove method to find users
where the ID is equal to require to our
request parents IDs of what we encoded
in the URL and then I'll execute so
basically the same what we also do for
products and so on here with our delete
route and then I'll add up then and a
catch block to do something in both
cases so then and catch here and if you
are successful well that's great umm I
don't really care I will just return a
response where I set the status code of
200 and then adjacent method where I say
message user deleted you really see that
it worked and if we got an error I'll
use the same error code I have in all my
our catch blocks here too so I'll simply
put dad into here too now we got a
method to delete users now we just need
to find out that user IDs and this year
was the user of the second test the test
outcome user we created so this is the
idea I want to delete so let's grab this
and let's switch this to a delete
request and add instead of sign up this
ID now if I sent this I get an error
because here I should of course access
user ID not ID because we named it user
ID here the path tiny mistake now if I
sent this I get an error because I
copied - comma - so if I remove the
comma I get another error would see rest
status is not a function oh yeah I
should have named this result otherwise
we have to rest objects and of course I
want to refer to this one so now if you
save this it still won't work because we
actually did delete it just sending the
response didn't work but I will get that
message over and over again because we
still make it into here because remember
if we don't find an entry it won't fail
doesn't throw an error so we don't make
it into the catch block we just also
didn't really delete anything though but
this is fine here I now got a
functionality to get rid off that user
which I don't need so with that we also
got to delete route we check if a user
email exists before we try to create a
new user one more thing we should do is
we should go back to the user model and
for the email I'll add another
configuration which is unique which are
also set to true now this can be really
deceiving and and strange because you
could expect that by setting unique you
can basically save this code here you
don't need to check whether an email
address exists or not right because it's
some form of validation just as required
ensures that we have to pass this value
now for a unique it's actually not the
same unique doesn't add any validation
on purpose instead unique simply
optimizes this
field you could say to be searched and
to be indexed it can do some performance
optimizations by knowing that there will
be only one of these values in this
field and that of course is helpful to
us but it will not validate the values
speaking of validation one more thing we
can do though is we can add another
conflict here to email the match config
if type is string as it is here you can
add some other built-in validation
shipping with Mongoose and you can match
that incoming string to a given pattern
to ensure that what we're storing really
is an email address so first of all
distribute is over multiple lines to
make it a bit easier to read and then we
need a regular expression for validating
email addresses now as all pro
developers we can simply Google for
email regex to find this great regular
expression email regular expression
discussion thread on Stack Overflow and
there if you scroll through you'll find
this creating an answer here where we
got a couple of demo validation patterns
and I'll use this one which should match
most cases email address validation with
regular expressions is pretty hard as it
turns out so let's copy this and now
match we'll take a regular expression
created with two forward slashes and
then simply put that expression in
between if we do that we should get an
error if we pass something that is not
an email address so let's simply save
this and let's try it out all first of
all stick to my test email address with
test free which doesn't exist yet I'll
go back to a post request and target
user sign up here and I'll hit Send and
I get user created now let me remove let
me remove the @ sign and now I get an
email error validation error and that is
actually what I wanted their email
address is invalid and we could use that
information in our client app and as
soon as I riad the @ sign here like this
I just get mail exists because it only
does exist but it matches our pattern
atleast so this is one on our addition I
wanted to make and with that we added
user signup and
the ability to delete users in our
routes here now the next step of course
is to sign users in and create such a
token</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
