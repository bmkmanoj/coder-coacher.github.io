video we had a look at HTTP and we were
able to access some data from from the
restful service on posting data out
there too and we also covered a lot of
our things in this course and obviously
there are a lot of other topics which we
haven't covered because angular 2 is
very complex and has a lot of things
where we have only touched the basics as
of now one thing where we haven't talked
about at all but which is also a nice
feature our pipes pipes are a feature an
angle at you to easily transform text or
numbers so output in general and in our
templates so that if for example we have
a date which might be a complete they'd
string like four digit year - two months
two digit month two digit a and then the
time string with milliseconds that
that's not something your output
normally so therefore you would have a
pipe which is kind of a enough further
you could say in some way basically a
transformer which will then take this
long date string and transform it in a
way you specify and we'll have a look at
those pipes in this video so in my
contact list here let's say I want to
have the last name of each user to be
uppercase so the shop should be all
uppercase now that's very easy to do in
angular almost similar although you
should check out that video too by the
way by the way to do this is very easy
I'm here in my oops
I'm here in my contact list component
and here's where I output my last name
and all I do now is I just in India same
curly braces here I add the pipe
character and behind the pipe character
comes the name of my pipe and this name
case it's a built in pipe which is
called upper case now let me save this
and let's have a look at yeah what
happened is basically that I entered
three P's but that is not the way you
spell uppercase boom now we got all our
last names written in uppercase
so there are pipes have a nice day bye
no obviously not that that is an example
for a pipe and that was how pipes in
general function
but obviously there are more complex
pipes then for example turning the name
to uppercase so I'll leave that but now
I'll also want to to add something in my
app component where I also had my my
HTTP test here it's kind of - playing
around
it hasn't something to do directly to do
with my contact app but I want to
showcase some of those pipes so beneath
my HTTP requests up here I'll just add a
class pipes and I will quickly add some
whistles styling to that class I'm it
should have like let's say a margin top
and body free to pics those padding 16
pixels it should have um
it should have a background color of
very light gray and a border 1 pixel
solid in a darker gray yeah that should
that should be fine yeah like that and
now all showcase some pipes so we got
our for example the date pipe right now
let me show what date pipe does let's
say in a wrap component here I define a
new date just call it date equals new
date which will give us the date off to
today and then here I could output this
tight like so right let's try this
yeah that's today
and as I said that's not the most
convenient way to read this now we can
add the date pipe here and now we got a
much more convenient way now we got
several ways of configuring that data
pipe and now in the API preview on the
official angular 2 website and here
Eiffel filtered for pipe and then I see
all the built and pipes there that
currently exist and if we have a look at
the date pipe here we see how we can use
it by adding optional argument which we
always do by typing Coulomb and an
argument and if a pipe takes several
arguments then we would separate those
arguments with several colons but date
only takes one argument which is the
format and what we could for example use
this format here save this as an overlap
and now we would have yeah basically
this output here and we also got some
built in quick format so to say we could
use short if you have this kind of
output or let's say we want to have what
looks good yeah let's say this one so we
could either just copy that string here
or just write full date full date and
now we got this very nice representation
of today now obviously you I'm not going
to go through the full list here just
yeah look it up in the API documentation
if you are looking for a certain way to
format a date but that's a really any
thing too quickly output data in a
different way now if we have a look at
the other pipes you got here I'm not
going to go through each pipe in this
video here but we would have a currency
and a decimal
pipe which allows us to yeah just output
decimals or numbers in a certain format
and this format will account for
internationalisation though the API
documentation here warns us that this
uses the International Internet
internationalization API and is only
working reliably in Chrome and opera so
maybe you should watch out with these
but what it was with you in theory if I
just added here number pipe so I'll have
my let's say my number of 4.5 6 7 or 6
and then I use the decimal pipe at the
currency pad currently but let's use the
decimal pipe here then I will just I'll
just use number that's the name of the
pipe and then the digit info which is
the format of how many integer digits
won't we should we display at the
minimum so I won't always have at least
one digit integer digit even though it
might be 0 dot something there should be
the 0 at all times then a dot and then
basically the decimal places and the
first character here is how many and
should be quotation marks by the way so
the first character here is how many
digits should be displayed at the least
after the comma 0 or author the dot in
non-german decimal notation so in this
case I want to have let's say always at
least two decimal places and should also
be at the maximum tube so let me save
this and now we have 4.57 even though I
entered 4.5 6 6 6 so that's how it
handles this and if I entered 4 here we
would have all three and if I had a
minimum of 4
decimal digits well then we would have
to zero at the end here even though I
only entered Freda chats here right so
it should be should be very clear I
think now now think I'm now doing them
all now let's ask at the currency pipe
here and the currency pipe has a very
similar way of working so let's say we
have 15 dollars 99 and again let's go to
our documentation here and pick the
currency pipe now this looks a bit
complicated but it yet it isn't
we have several arguments here as you
can see so first let's add the pipe
symbol and just type currency now we
don't have to specify any argument by
default it will output it will take US
dollars and I'll put it this way now we
can change this by adding the first
argument or currency code so we could
specify euro here and this should be a
string yep so that's why it's not
working Yoram and now we heard would
have euros in this notation now we might
want to change the notation from output
it a long way by displaying the free
characters and by just using for example
true which will output the Euro sign or
respectively of course the US dollar
sign instead of the the whole word world
a word so to say now digit info is the
last argument who can specify and it
works the same way as it did here in our
number pipe we just say how it should
how should it be formatted light right
so we could also say it should have four
dozen of the chests and that's what we
don't care the way it would be output um
no no I'm not going to go through all of
them at least not in this video but
let's say I think lower case pipe isn't
that interesting but a very interesting
pipe would be as in pipe that's a
special pipe
all the pipes here or most of the pipes
are kind of state less pipes ie
I enter a value here I applied a pipe
and I'm boom it outputs the formatted
value right formatting is really all
those pipes do and they don't have to
keep any state for that because they get
a value of their formatted they output
it done now an async pipe is a type
which actually says wait for wait for a
value so don't just take the value
transform it and output it and never
look at it again now instead we will
have like for example and an API call
going off and the request or the
response it will take some seconds to
come back so let me just show you what
this is um I'll add a stateful full pipe
here and the way this will work is just
the following i I have a property my app
component here let's say random data and
what this property is is it it is the
result for promise or new promise not
process promise thank you and in here
we're passing the resolve and the reject
parameters to our fat arrow function and
in there what I will do is I'll set the
timeout to like simulate delayed
response where I will basically just
resolve my my request and return some
random data is just string you really
and I will take like this so let's say
one second for this so now this variable
will only be set after one second
because that's the time it will take
our promise to resolve and return a
string year now if I set random dater if
I try to output this year what we see
it's an object it's not the actual
string it's just this promise object
right now let me add a magic word a
magic pipe here the async pipe aha see
that just reload nothing and now we got
it
so the async pipe tells our hor template
so to say it has angle as you don't
output it yet it will come back with
some data and wait until the data is
there and then re update the few and
then output it that is what the async
pipe does and therefore it's very
powerful if you want to display certain
data which you know it is available from
the start but it might take some time
until it is there then you just add the
async pipe and you're able to wait for
that response to return it to be there
that is how you use pipes now you can
also write custom pipes and there are
more pipes than the ones I showed you
but we need to have some features for
future videos I guess and I don't want
to go into that much of detail right now
I would just wanted to show you what
pipes are and how to use pipes to yeah
mainly transform or reformat data and I
hope that worked and stay tuned for the
next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
