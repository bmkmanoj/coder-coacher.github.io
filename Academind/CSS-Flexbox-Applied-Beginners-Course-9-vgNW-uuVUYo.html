guide in this video we will add flexbox
to our project because if we look at our
site right now and if we increase the
width well we can see that we have some
issues as I would say because for
example I don't like the way the images
switched away they are displayed from
here to here and also right here these
headers or these image descriptions well
these are not displayed correctly
because the California landscape should
be displayed right here this should be
centered and there are some more things
that we should improve and we can
improve all these things with flexbox so
let's do this right now
so as I just said in the introduction we
have to fix some things here and if we
play around again yeah we can see that
the main areas we should improve is
right here the part with the
descriptions of the images then the way
the images are displayed this should be
centered so this should be at the same
position like the gap between the images
and talking about the gap between the
images we should also get rid of this
gap by the way and also down here do
people like my page I would like to
position that kind of on top of the
images so in this area and down here in
our footer yeah I would also like to
change that and use flexbox right here
to display the images in the text and
also to work on the styling a little bit
so as you can see a lot of things to do
actually but we'll see with flexbox
this will be quite easy and before we
start right now one important
information if you never worked with
flexbox before make sure to check out
this miniseries right here because in
this series I will talk about all the
basic concepts behind flexbox so the
theory and some practical examples in a
mini project if you've worked with
flexbox already or have a basic
understanding of how it works then just
watch this video now because right here
I will explain what I'm doing but not as
detailed as in the other videos because
this video has the purpose of applying
flexbox to our project and by that
improving the looks of our website so
enough of to talking right now let's go
back to our code and see how we can add
flexbox right now to our project so as I
said I would like to start right here in
the main part just to remember this trip
text part so the trip text and tripped
XP is basically this part up here let me
maybe may do it like this so we are the
main part this is the class trip text
and inside the class we have the
paragraphs so you can see this right
here so what do we want to change right
now well as I said I would like to
display the California landscape right
here so write to my as a city trip and
each of these elements should occupy 50%
of the space
can we do this space available by the
ways of this entire space right here so
how can we do this well let's first go
right here to trip text and simply add
right there display flex and s just
mentioned if you never saw this play
flex before make sure to check out the
other video but nevertheless this play
flex simply means that we now turn this
trip text class right here into a
so-called Flex container and with that
we also turn the elements which are
nested inside or into this Flex
container into Flex items so basically
the paragraphs inside our trip text
class now what does this mean well this
means that we can get rid of the
display:inline-block declaration right
here like that and if we now save that
and go back to our project and reload it
well then you can already see that the
way they are displayed changed and
apparently we also don't have such a gap
right here as we headed for the images
let's maybe check that quickly by adding
a border I just want to show you that we
don't have any gap right here now and
maybe one pixel solid and let's make it
red maybe just for a few seconds to make
sure that we can really see it so if we
reload the page now you can see that
this is actually the about the 50% mark
I would say of the page width and you
can also see that the images well they
are not really centered at the moment
but we'll work on that in a few seconds
let me first make sure that the text
right here is now aligned in the center
I think this would look better and we
could also change the background color
to this purple right here and make the
font color also white let's do this
so first the background color we will
use our hex code five two one seven five
one it's purple then we need a color of
white like we just said and then we want
to align the text in the center which we
can do like this if we now save that and
reload the page then we can see that
this looks quite good actually we can
also get rid of that border now because
we saw that it wasn't centered in the
beginning so let's see if that now
once more yeah and I think with that if
we play around right here this looks
actually quite good as I would say so
with that we can now continue and work
on the images because I don't like the
way the images are displayed right here
I would like our images to always be
displayed like this but to change the
size so to be responsive depending on
the width we have on our website now we
can also change this or add this feature
quickly by using flexbox so let's see
what we need in our index.html file we
need trip images as a class and inside
this class we have the images this means
that this will become our Flex container
and the images will become our Flex
items so back to the easy assess file
and let's add this right here and we
need the class trip images like that and
the first thing we do is of course we
add this play flex to it as I said
before this will now turn the trip
images class into a Flex container and
the items into Flex items and if we save
that and go back to the page we can
immediately see what that means this
means that we now have our items
displayed like that the problem still is
that well if we decrease the size now
our images are kind of well fixed so we
should change that and make sure that
our images well kind of change the size
depending on the size of our website so
let's go back and the great thing now is
actually that we don't have to add a lot
we can simply add trip images and IMG
because with that we will refer to our
images inside the trip images not image
sorry for that images class and if we
now add a width of 50 percent and a
height of 100 percent then this should
actually work now one important note in
the next video of the series and I said
that before already
but next video will finally be the video
we will talk about all the different
values we can use here so the pixels the
percentages and a lot more so for the
moment and this will really be the last
time I say that let's just keep it the
way it is right here and then understand
the details behind it in the next video
the important thing right here now is
that if I save this and now go back to
our page and reload it well then you can
see that our images are now really
centered you can see it right here
and additionally they behave in a really
well
responsive design or responsive way
because they always are centered enter
keep the aspect ratio and this simply
happens because we defined that the
height should always be 100% of our
class so if we inspect that now maybe
not inspect that let's make it right
here so it should always be 100% of the
height this class has this trip images
class and if we reduce the class we can
see that the images reduce but at the
same time it should also occupy 50% of
the space available from a bit
perspective in this class therefore
applying a height of 1 a percent and a
width of 50 percent makes perfect sense
right here because with that we make
sure that our images are displayed
correctly and keep their aspect ratio
and with that we have a styling for our
images already one important note again
if you make our website really small
like that maybe which is actually a
displaying style that we would have on a
smartphone then this doesn't look good
at the moment we'll also work on that
later when we talk about media queries
so for the moment our responsive design
is rather focused on two bigger devices
like tablets maybe like this or
different screen sizes we could have on
laptops for example however we now have
our admirers of city Tripp California
landscape and the corresponding pictures
well formatted as I would say better
than before or actually quite good and
quite responsive let's now work on do
people like my page because as I said in
the beginning I would like to display
this element right here in
lower part of these two images so
basically well right here that's where
it should be
and for this purpose we don't need
flexbox but we can use our
position:relative declaration that we
talked about throughout this series
already so if we go back and now go to
our feedback class right here and add
position:relative like that if we save
that and go back you learned that
already nothing should change that's the
case but now we can do the following if
we inspect that we can first see that we
have a margin around this element so
let's maybe get rid of that margin first
by adding margin 0 also something we
talked about from this serious now with
that yes our image is basically kind of
added right here we can see that this
element has a height of 18.4 pixels now
why don't we just add a property of
bottom and we talked about that kind of
well kick this element up 18.4 pixels
let's try this out and see what happens
then because if we do that right here
maybe and now say bottom 18.4 pixels
that and if we now go back and reload
the page well you can see that the
element is now positioned on top of our
images and that's the great thing about
position:relative in that case let me
maybe unselect in spectral because with
that we could not easily make sure that
we position this element exactly on top
of our images because as we learned let
me repeat that with position:relative we
can position an element relative well to
its current position and by pushing it
up 18.4 pixels so exactly the height it
has well we can achieve the result that
we want to have right here and the great
thing is that this also stays there so
if we increase the size or decrease the
size it always stays where it is now
we'll see if we have to work on the font
size and if maybe the size of the
element has to change when we make the
screen smaller but actually I think for
the moment
this is quite okay and with that we also
fixed this lower part of our main
element right here and with that we can
actually already continue and work on
the photo right there because as I said
I would like to change the way we do it
right now
because at the moment we are not using
flexbox to display the image and the
text next to each other and I would also
well make the image smaller and add some
more styling to this part so let's go
back and let's now go down here to our
footer and actually we can get rid of
everything you see right here because we
only need review clients again this will
be our Flex container like we saw it in
the other sections of this code so let's
add the curly braces and add this play
flex right here let's save that and see
what happens well as you can see
although it'll eat it all the code we
created in the last videos it is already
almost displayed correctly we only have
to add one more thing and if you watch
the other videos you should know what
that one thing is it's aligned items
because we know that by adding display
flex our standard flex Direction is row
this means our main axis goes from left
to right and our cross axis also starts
here and goes to the bottom therefore we
want to change the way the elements
along the cross axis are aligned because
we want to put this text right here next
to the image so into this part and
therefore we can now simply use align
items not content items like this Center
like that and if we now go back and save
that and we load that and not save that
then we can see that this worked quite
easily and I have to save it again if
this was too fast for you make sure to
check out the other video because I
really talk about a lot of details
regarding this main axis cross axis and
the line items topic so make sure to see
this however back right here to our
topic because it looks the way it looked
before but now we've just using flexbox
but now I think it all
make sense to quickly work on that
images because they are way too big so
if we go back to the code and now refer
to the review clients class but now to
the images in there and now let's maybe
say that we will use another width for
these images maybe let's add the width
and let's maybe say it should be 20%
only like that yeah looks better but I
think it's still quite big so let's
maybe even go back to you 15% like that
and reload it yeah I think now it looks
better we'll have a look at the entry
styling in one of the last videos of
this course when we kind of go for all
the styling once again and see what tiny
bits we can improve but I think this
looks good right now what I also would
like to have is kind of a box around
this foot apart right here because it
looks kind of lost at the moment so
let's go back and let's add such a box
by adding a border maybe one pixel
should be rather small solid and maybe
black and let's also add a background
color which could be white in our case
this could look good let's see if we go
back and reload it yeah I kind of like
that what I don't like is that we don't
have any margin right here so let's also
add a margin to our Flex container maybe
five pixels we'll see if it's too small
maybe ten we'll see yeah rather 10 as I
would say like that and let's reload the
page and yeah I think with that our page
looks quite good we have a responsive
design now our images worked perfectly
and D general look is actually also
quite fine however there are two more
things that I would like to change the
first thing is that I would like to
Center our flex items so the image and
the text right here well to the center
of our flex container and by that to the
center of our page
and the second thing is that if I
decrease the width of our page right
here well I would like to have a
different behavior of our Flex items I
would like to well wrap these items so
that the text is displayed below the
image let's say once we reach roundabout
600 pixels of our page width now let's
change these two things and let's change
the centering of our two items first and
we know how this works because we used
align items already which was
responsible to Center our Flex items
along the cross axis so from top to
bottom and we know that the main axis
goes from left to right so this means if
we want to Center the image and the text
then we have to make sure that we Center
these items along the main axis well and
to do this we can simply go back right
here to our code and now add justify
content right here and this means this
now refers to our main axis so from left
to right in our case and if we now add
Center to it and save that and go back
and reload the page well then we can see
that our Flex items are displayed in the
center of our Flex container and again I
said that before if you are not totally
sure how this works
make sure to have a look at the
understanding flex box video because in
there we talked about exactly these
topics in a lot of detail however we now
centered our items right here but well
the items are still not wrapping so we
have to change that and to do this we
first have to change the width right
here of the image let's maybe say we
give our image a fixed width of maybe
150 pixels so if we go back and reload
the page we see our images are slightly
bigger
well let's maybe say we use 120 pixels
let's see what this looks like
yeah I think this is nice but now we
also need to make sure that our second
flex item so the paragraph right here
also has a defined width and let's maybe
not use
300 let's maybe use 350 pixels so we add
a another selector right here review
clients P because we want to select our
paragraph inside the review clients
class and now we define a width again
and we said that this would should be
350 pixels like that if we save that and
reload the page we can see that well
this is not working
do you know why this is not working you
probably do because we have to specify
our flags rep I talked about that in the
other video you can basically say that
you use flex flow you could do this and
with that you have two different
properties in there this is the Flex
direction which is Rho in the standard
case and you have the Flex rep which is
no rep right here so if you now change
the second value which refers to the
Flex rep property to rap like that and
if you save that and go back to the page
then you see that nothing changes but as
soon as we reach de define width
well then we can see that our page
behaves like that and I think this looks
a lot better now now going back to the
code just to complete that you could of
course also not use flex flow because at
the moment we are happy with our flex
direction of Rho
you could also simply write flex not
flew flex rap right here and now say
flexwrap well should be rap like this
and if you now go back and reload the
page you see nothing changes but now you
specified exactly what you want to have
this is the Flex rap with the value of
rap now there is one less thing that I
just saw that I don't like because if we
again wrap our page we can see that our
text is not centered inside the
paragraph so let's also change that by
going right here into the Flex item and
now say text aligned
sender we used that before so we know
how this declaration works and if we
reload the page now you can see that our
text is also centered and with that well
I think we finished this video and by
that our flexbox applied part and yeah
we seeded our website I think looks a
lot better now
we see that we can use flexbox really
easily actually to make our page more
responsive and by that look a lot more
beautiful and well we also saw that we
used right here in the code pixels and
percentages before and this brings me to
the next video of this series because in
the next video I want to take a closer
look at these things so I'd hide at
would add percentages at pixels and so
on so I hope to see you in this video
and as always thanks a lot for watching
hope to see you in the next videos and
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
