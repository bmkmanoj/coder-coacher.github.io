only click a button and open alert in
your parent component you want to pass
some data with it potentially some data
you insert it in an input field so let's
do this next let's say the name of my
header this home link so if there is
home or something else is something
which should get set through the user so
I want to set this or I want to be able
to change this now in this video we'll
cover a lot of the things we learned in
previous videos like state component
interaction and so on so let's start by
implementing a link between the index
chairs the app component and the home
component and you home component I want
to be able to change my home link so the
name or the text of the link in the
header therefore I will create a new
function in my app component which I
will name on change link name something
like that whatever you like on change
link name and this takes an argument of
new name because of course I need to
know what you name should be now in here
I want to change the name and for dad of
course I will need set state so I will
first add a constructor to set an
initial State this state should be a
chalice with object where I have my home
link key and that should be home
initially then here I no longer passing
a pure string but instead I'm passing
this state home link oops
home link like that then and you on
change link name method I can call this
stead state I'm still in the app
component here and I'm setting the state
such that home link now is the new name
so with that my parent component the app
component is prepared I'm using set
state - well actually then trigger a
rewrite
of the UI of course and to be able to
actually change the home link and now I
need to call this on change link name
method from my home component now in
order to be able to do this I will pass
it as a problem so I will just split
this upper multiple line so that it gets
a bit easier to read and then here I
want to pass change link so this will be
the method which can be executed in my
home component later on and this should
of course refer to this on change link
name but since I use the best keyword in
on change link name I need to find this
here or use the es6 syntax I showed you
a couple of videos ago which you can see
in the home component here on the upper
button so with that I'm passing a
reference to this method to my home
component and I can use it there so
let's go to the home component then here
I will also create a new method which I
call on change name and in this method I
will call this props change link I guess
was it change link name then maybe I
should name this on change link to on
just change link gets executed and I
want to pass this dot state dot home
link I have yet to create this field in
my state here why am i outsourcing this
or creating this in an extra function or
method I could execute it in my code
down here - yeah that's right
I could execute this line here in my
code down here - that would work but I
don't want to do that I want you well
make it a bit easier to read and not put
all my logic in your render method here
which is something you basically you
shouldn't do so with that on change link
is setup and I can then create a new
button which allows me to change this
change
header blank like that that's my new
button and here I'll add my classes
button button primary as always and of
course my onclicklistener where I want
to execute this unchanged link and find
this again since I'm using the this
keyword in the unchanged link method so
with that I would kind of change my my
link but this state home link is
currently undefined because in my state
I only have agent status and not home
link so let's add home link here home
link could be changed linked initially
so with that I just saw that I also need
to call super here in my index.js file
the app component I need to you always
need to call super first if you're
extending from a class forget this I
forgot this so now we see it's working
and if I click on change header link
watch this home text here it got changed
we changed it through our home component
by executing a button here and then
executing a method in the app component
changing the state there and passing the
new state as a prop to our state less
component header so there a lot of
things are coming together which we
learned in the last video changing state
cross-community component communication
and finally updating the props in a
stateless component and as you see
stateless does not mean that that that
it doesn't get rear-ended a few props
change it only means that this component
itself has no access to the state but we
can't change the state from outside of
it that's of course important to
understand so with that we have to
change that up but of course still we
don't have and/or currently we don't
have an input field where we could
change it we're not we're only able to
change it to well changed linked changed
because that is the initial state for
Homelink
I set up in my home component so the
next step of course is to add an input
field and allow a user to define what
should get changed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
