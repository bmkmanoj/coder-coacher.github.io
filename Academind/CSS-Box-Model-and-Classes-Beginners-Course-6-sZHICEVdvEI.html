beginner's guide in the last video we
had our first look at the basics of CSS
and we learned that we can use selectors
to apply styles to elements now there is
one really important core concept that
we have to understand now and this core
concept is the so called CSS box model
now what it is and why we need it let's
find out in this video
so before we have a look at this box
model some quick theory first because we
learned in the HTML part of the series
that we have two types of elements we
have block level elements and we have
inline elements now the important thing
is that CSS refers to all elements
this means all elements really so no
matter if it's block level or inline to
all elements as boxes basically this
means if you use a selector to both
style an element this element is
interpreted or displayed as a box from a
CSS perspective now this sounds really
abstract probably therefore it's not a
time to have a look at our webpage right
here and see if or where we can find
this box model actually so let's go
there and how can we have a closer look
well let's reopen the chrome developer
tools now we are back again in the
elements program right here and let's
maybe focus on three headers so I'm
clicking right here now we have supplied
some basic style to this header with
that purple background and that white
font color but the more interesting
thing now is that if you go down right
here to the header and then to styles
then you can see this well box right
here and in case you cannot see it you
can just scroll right here and you can
also increase or decrease the size so
just adjust it the way that you can see
this entire box now and I mentioned that
already as this is the box this is the
way CSS sees or interprets this element
right here so in our case this header
element now what do we have right here
actually well if you hover over the
center part right here you can see that
this blue color is again applied on our
website to the header part and this blue
part right here is the actual so-called
content of that box around the content
we have a padding the screen part and
you can see on the web site to the left
that we don't have such a padding at the
moment then we have the border also not
available right here or not displayed
right here and we have a margin now I
think the best way to understand this
box model is to just add these three
things to our header element this means
we add padding border and the margin now
for the purpose let's go
our code let's go to the header right
here and let's now add first the padding
and we will then also see what there is
let's say we add 10 pixels as a value
important you can add different values
here so not only pixels but I will dive
into the details regarding the options
we have right here later fraud too
serious for this video we will stick to
pixels then we have the second property
this was the border right here and for
the border we can also define a size
which could be 5 pixels then we can
decide if we want to have a solid border
like that for example or a dashed border
I will use a - border here and then we
need a border color let maybe use
something like red in this case like
that because we will remove the border
after we understood the box model and
then the last thing we had was these
so-called margin right here and for the
margin we could use 10 pixels like that
now let's save that it's always really
important and go back to our website now
if I reload that then you see that the
look totally changed why did the look
change well again I selected the header
right here and if you don't have a look
at our box down here again then you can
see that the content is now the blue
part again we saw that before but you
can see that this blue part now is not
the entire element now actually because
our element which is again this plate as
a box from a CSS perspective consists of
that content now then we have the
padding you can see that green part now
in our element up here we have the
border this is this orange part or that
red dotted line that we created and also
important we have a margin and as you
can see the margin is basically around
our element or it's not displayed it's
invisible but it's still there and as
the name says with the margin we can of
course define the distance between
different elements we'll have a closer
look at that of course also throughout
the series the important thing is that
now you saw the general structure of
this box model with the different
components it has basically and which
allows us to style our elements now I'm
not
option how to get a better understanding
of the structure of the webpage and also
of the box model is if we go right here
there and now select this tool right
here with this tool you can see now it's
blue so it's selected with this tool we
can inspect our website what's mean well
if you go right here you can see that
now we have four that down here the
explanation that we are now in the
header element that's important but we
can see this header element from the box
model perspective basically because in
the center we can again see the blue
part it's the content then we again have
the petting then we have the border and
then we have the margin so with this
inspect tool you can get a really quick
overview of the structure of your
website and this is really important if
you want to apply your CSS Styles now
ice is important well if you think about
the structure of this header element
again you know that we have a nested
element inside that we have the h1
element and of course you can also see
that h1 element right here and if you
think about the logic of the box model
then this simply means that the blue
part right here in the center the
content but what should the content be
off that header element as this header
element kind of consists or wraps this
h1 element then the content of that
header element should be the h1 element
so if we hollow right here then you can
see exactly that let me maybe hover back
can you see it it switches because now
we are in the h1 element in our h1
element right here consists of the
content the blue part again and the
consists of that orange part this is a
margin as you can see in the right lower
part of the screen which means that we
have an automatically added margin to
that element right here but this again
shows you the logic of that box model h1
is now basically the content of the
header element but of course we can also
add appending a border and a different
margin to our h1 element let's maybe try
that by going back to our code and now
simply copying the declarations right
here from the header
paste it right here in the h1 selector
right there let's save this let's go
back and if we reload the page now well
then you can see this well not really
beautiful style but you can see that if
I now go back again into the h1 element
you can see that we now have the content
still the same as before but now we have
a padding around that content we also
have a border and we have the marginal
applied now what happens if I go back to
the header element now did you see it
now the content of the header element
consists of the entire h1 element again
and by entire h1 element element I mean
that this consists of the content of the
h1 element depending the border and the
margin now that again shows you the
general logic of that box model that CSS
uses now we will dive deeper into the
box model automatically throughout the
series when we talk about the styling
and also the positioning of the
different elements but I think for now
it's really important for you to know
that you have this box model that this
is the way CSS this place or things
about D different elements we have an
HTML and additionally that you can use
the chrome developer tools this element
tab and then right here this tiles part
to get a really quick overview of the
current style applied to your website
now as I said we will dive deeper into
the box one throughout the series but
there is one other thing I would like to
show you in this context because if I go
back to the code and well now if you
look at the padding let's use the h1
selector right here if you look at
depending for example already margin you
can see that I just wrote 10 pixels
right here now I talked about the pixels
and that we have different options right
there we will talk about that later but
what happens if I write something
different like 20 pixels right here as a
second value actually well let's save
this and have a look if we love that
well then you can see that the contents
our h1 element is displayed differently
let's maybe select the h1 element for
here and let's go down right there
to the Stynes part because can you see
what happened right here
the padding the distance now changed
because top and bottom is still 10
pixels so that was the first value we
wrote but the left and the right padding
is now 20
so the second value that we wrote you
can also see it now if you look at the
website again with the bigger gap we
have to the left and to the right when
comparing it to top and bottom so this
means that if you only write the two
values you define top and bottom with
the first values and left and right with
the second venue now let's go back to
our code and think about another way how
we could write that because now we have
top and bottom but what if I write 30
pixels now as a third value and 40
pixels now as a fourth value let me save
that and let's go back and if I reload
that now well then you can again see
down here that now the padding changed
like that because the first value
defined the pixels above the content
basic views on the top the second value
defined right the twenty pixels the
third value defined the bottom and the
fourth value defined the left part of
the padding so this is also something
that is interesting to know if you just
write one value then you define the
distance in that case for all four parts
if you just write two values you just
define the top and bottom add in one
value and the left and right in one
value and if you define the four values
well then you define each part so top
right bottom left in that order like we
see it right here now going back to our
code we can of course also apply that
right here to our margin for example if
you want you like that save that and if
you go back and reload the page we can
see that the padding has now 10 20 30 40
and the margin has 10 20 30 40 so this
is what we can do with that with that
approach we can define the size
basically of the different components of
our a box model now with that knowledge
we can actually continue now and have a
look at the structure of our page and
see
if we can already apply some styles
through different parts that we have
right here so for that let's go back to
our code right here and let's now think
about a structure that would make sense
because what I see right here is that
the background color for example could
actually be added right here in the h1
selector like that then we could get rid
of that header right there and with that
we would only have the h1 selector right
here now why am I doing this well we
basically know that the header element
basically consists of the h1 element in
total this means as we just saw it makes
sense to only define the h1 element and
if we then don't apply any kind of
padding border or margin to the header
element so the wrapping element then
this simply means that the header
element only consists of the content
from a box model perspective and
therefore is equal to the style that we
define right here for the h1 element now
as I said we want to have this
background color I will delete the font
size because I will dive deeper into the
font size and text topics later
throughout the series so let's get rid
of that for now the color can be white
this is fine the padding well let's say
we want to have a padding of 10 pixels
all around the actual content we don't
need a border so we can delete that and
actually we also don't need a margin so
let's get rid of that also like that if
we now save dad go back and reload the
page well then we can see that Mike's
world looks like this now now what can
we see right here because we can see
that the that is kind of a bigger gap on
top so let's inspect that quickly yeah
and we can see that we still have a
margin here above and below the age one
element we have kind of an overflow
right here outside of the header element
now I will not dive into the details why
this is happening right now at this
stage of the series the important thing
now is that we can simply get rid of
that actually by going back to our code
and simply define that
margin like that should be zero like
this no pixels nothing just zero and by
that if we go back to the page and we
load that we can see that this margin is
now removed this was automatically added
by the browser basically therefore it
makes sense to define that this should
be zero right now
however let's maybe unselect the
inspector now and think about other
parts of that website I will not talk
about the positioning of the different
elements right here because I would like
to change home and contact it should be
displayed next to each other but this is
also covered later fraud is serious I
would only like to think about the
background now well in thinking about
the background the first thing I see
right here is that we have this white
background right there and actually I
would like to have a slight grayish
background on our website and if you
think about the logic we just saw then
we can actually just go back to our code
and maybe edit right here on top and
specify that HTML so oops HTML so the
entered document like that should be
great the HTML part and with that if I
just write background dad that color
that was the important thing what we
need so that's the property well anti
color should be let's say gray maybe
like that or maybe not that great so if
you're not happy with the color you can
simply go right here and hover over the
color and then simply pick a color that
you would like to have so maybe let's
use this one right here like that
and if we now save that and go back then
we can see that our page now has this
slight gray look so in the background
and with that we have changed our style
a little bit but let's now go back to
our code again and think about the other
parts because if I have a look at the
index.html file right here then I'm okay
with the header this is fine the
navigation part if we look at it yep not
final yet but we'll focus on to that in
the next videos but what I don't like
right here is this main part because if
we look at it
well Yeti image is too big or the images
are too big that's one thing we'll also
work on that in the next videos but I
don't like the structure from a code
perspective because if we go backward
here
well then we can see that we have the
main part so I'm talking about this part
here and we have this list right here
this is okay generally but actually I
don't want to have a list in that case I
would like to change the structure and
what would I like to change well let me
maybe edit up here and explain to you I
would like to have one div and then I
would like to have a second div right
here and like that maybe and in the
first if I would only like to have the
paragraph sorry text so this text and
the California landscape like that add
it right here again select the two and
indent it like this yeah this is fine so
this is the first if and in the second
div I would only like to have the image
right here so landscape image right here
and I know the landscape image this was
the city image and now we have the
California whoops
the California streets image right here
like that this means I would like to get
rid of that list down here like that and
now change the weight is indented and
well now we have a problem because if I
change the structure like that then I
have these two divs and what I could do
now let's say I would like to have a
background color for the paragraphs
right there well then I could say that
the entered div right here should have a
background so what we could do is we
could go right here and write diff as a
selector like that and add a background
color like that that's when we use a hex
code and it's let's use fa9 to free
like that if we do that and now save
also the index.html file and go back
right here and reload it well then we
can see the following the styling so the
background color is applied but of
course not only to our div right here
but also to the div that's kind of
around the images but also the div that
we have with the footer elements so this
is not good this means we actually need
a way how we can specifically target
this div now now one option could be
that we refer to a paragraph this means
we go to the Styles and now defined that
the paragraph like that should have an
orange background color if you do that
save it and reload it we can see that
this basically works it's now orange but
the same thing is also true for do
people like my page because we also have
a paragraph at this position so if you
go back
oops right here we see that we have
these paragraphs and we have two
paragraph down here so also not a good
option because we could then define
something for the paragraph and then
change the paragraph style down here
again not a good idea so let's think
about something different because what
if we would be able to kind of
specifically target this diff right here
now as I'm pronouncing it like that
specifically targeting elements can be
possible if you add additional
information to it and we learned how we
can add additional information to
elements already right we can do this by
using attributes and you know that you
can add attributes to each element and
one specific attribute that we can use
right here and also an attribute that is
only used in the context of CSS by the
way is a class now what does this mean
how does it work well let's add a class
first right here so in the diff and
let's write class right here you can see
the attribute and let's maybe call this
class trip text or
like that just feel free to call it as
you want now if we save that so that
part in the index.html file now go back
to style.css and now change that from a
paragraph to that class as a selector
then it should work the question is now
how can we use classes as a selector the
answer is we can simply type a dot and
then type the class name so in our case
this was trip text what trips text or
trip text I don't remember it was trip
text so let's name it trip text like
that so this must be equal to the class
name so if we save that and go back to
our page and reload it well then you can
see that we now specified the background
color important if you look at inspect
right here the background color is now
specified for this entire div so not
specifically for the different
paragraphs that we have inside that div
but if you scroll down now we can see
that in the other parts no background
color is applied now let's have a closer
look at that actually because what if we
now would like to change the background
color of that paragraphs inside our
class can we do that and again I will
not use the paragraph element as a
selector because then this would again
change the two people like my page
paragraph also which I don't like so
let's go back to our code let's think
about that so what I would like to do is
I would like to be able to specify a
background color for our div class right
here which we did and then I would like
to say yeah but inside this class I
would like to have a different
background color for these two
paragraphs how can we do this well if we
go back to our style sheet right here
and now maybe add a little bit of
padding first because otherwise you
won't see what happens so let's maybe
add a padding of just three pixels
something like that but now we want to
refer to the elements inside a specific
class how is this possible
well we simply
type again d-class so oops trip text now
space and now we say P because this
means that we will now apply the style
that we now define only to the P
elements that are inside this trip text
class what does this mean
let's do it like that let's again define
a background color because I think it's
the best property to kind of show you
how this works
and let's now say this should maybe be
white like that and semicolon and save
that if we now go back to our page
appear and reload that well you can see
what happened now now if we inspect that
we can see that we have that paragraph
right here and again we have a margin so
let me quickly get rid of that margin
like that so I added a zero so no margin
for the paragraphs let's now reload that
and now you can see what I wanted to
show you because now we have that
paragraph right here with the white
background color the same thing for here
right here and right here
this part is now the div so if we go
back to our code and maybe increase that
padding to I don't know 10 pixels and go
back and read out the page then you can
see better even we now we're able to
specify a styling for specific elements
inside a class and define a general
styling for the class these elements are
in now we will also dive deeper into
that throughout the series but this
example should just show you how well
powerful such classes actually are
because you can really be precise about
this styling you want to apply and about
the elements you want to apply this
styling to now vector code because now
we have defined the trip text and the
elements inside the trip text but if you
go back to index.html now we see that we
have another div right here for the
images so let's maybe also apply a class
right here this could be trip images for
example again you're totally free to
name these
classes based on your preference if you
save that and go back to our code and
reload it we can of course see that
nothing changed but now we know right
here that our two images now are part of
the trip images class we will use that
later when we talk about studying of
these images but for now it's actually
fine to just define that class like this
so the main part is fine now so this
area right here important just keep in
mind that classes concept because as you
can see it is really powerful and we
will use it throughout this series a lot
actually and if I now look down to the
footer so right here into this element
well then I'm okay with the content
there is one thing that I would like to
change though because if you go right
here we can see that we have the image
of Max and Max text and here my image
and the text of myself and I wrote that
as a span in the HTML part because I'm
going to show you the span of course
this inline element we have right here
but actually I would like to change that
to a paragraph now like this and like
that and like that
save that because as you can see right
here we now have the text displayed
below the image which is not the way it
should be so it should be to the right
of the image but the thing is that we
just saw that we use CSS to style our
page therefore the styling shouldn't be
done like that with the span but we
should really use the CSS then to work
on the positioning of the text we will
do that throughout this videos of course
so let's go back to our code and
actually I'm happy with these statues we
have right now so we have to continue
working on our side but it's okay but I
would like to take the chance at the end
of this video to change two things in
our code now the first thing is related
to the introduction of classes we just
had because if we go back to our Styles
us s files right here then we see this
h1 selector right here and I said that
we will select the h1 element right
there because we only have two single h1
element in the document and therefore
it's fine to apply a style to this h1
element
now the problem is that in modern html5
times where we are right now you can
have multiple h1 elements on your
website therefore applying a general
style to this h1 element is totally fine
in our case so for this example project
but on your website which could be more
complicated and even bigger well you
might have multiple h1 elements and
therefore defining that general h1 style
is maybe not always the best idea but as
we just introduced the classes we have
an easy way to change that how could we
change that well we could simply go back
to the index.html file now go to our h1
element appear and now apply a class
maybe a class of let's say page
- title something like that and save
this also note the way I wrote this
class now so this page - title that's
the second thing I would like to change
right now in our code but more about
that in a few seconds for now that we
have to change the class right here or
apply the class we also have to change
the selector so let's go back to
style.css and now change just from h1 to
page - title like that if we save that
go back to our page and reload it then
we can see that nothing changed but now
we made sure that we really identify or
select specifically this h1 element
right here in the header as I said
doesn't make a difference in our case
but generally it's a better way to write
it like this
so we edit that class and why did I add
that class name like this so Paige -
title and why should we also change it
down here in that trip text class and in
the trip images class right here well
the reason is that in HTML and CSS we
have a special convention when it comes
to writing text the so called kabab case
and this came up case simply says that
we should connect words so like we have
it right here in our class with a - this
one right here simply to improve the
readability of the code and the second
convention hTML is that we should write
every text with small letters the reason
for that is simply that for HTML and CSS
writing
Paige kite like that or Paige tight like
that it's basically the same so HTML and
CSS cannot differentiate between capital
or small letters therefore we use the
convention of writing small ITER's only
and connecting the different words with
a dash to improve readability now we
change that class right here and right
there so we also have to change it in
our Styles file right here so let's add
a dash right here trip - text and trip -
text P like that so if we save that and
also safety index.html file of course
and go back to a browser
nothing should have changed let's see
yes this still looks fine right now and
with that we are actually done with that
video so now that we understood D box
model and the classes we can actually
move on to another really important core
concept of CSS well actually these are
two important concepts because in the
next video we will talk about the
positioning property and about the
display property really important as I
said really interesting also so I hope
to see you also in this video and as
always I can only say thanks a lot for
watching hope to see you in the next
video and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
