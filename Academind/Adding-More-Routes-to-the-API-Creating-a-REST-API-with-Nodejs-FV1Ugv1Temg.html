thus far in this series we had a look at
what restful api zart
and we started building one we only
support one API endpoint one route one
URL does fart and that's our route route
and we support all HTTP words which
cause we don't care about which one we
got but we got a very basic restful api
working now let's continue working on it
in this video we'll add more routes to
it
so let's start improving this API and
for that I'll start by improving the
folder structure to make it easy to well
to keep this project manageable I'll
treat a new folder which will named API
because all my API related stuff like
the routes that the models will use when
we work with data and so on should go in
there so in that folder I'll treat a
subfolder which I named routes and in
there I will now add a product dot J's
file which should handle my product
related routes now how can we set up a
route here for that I'll first of all
again import express with require
Express and by storing it in this
constant Express now I will set up the
Express router that's like a sub package
G Express Framework ships with that
gives us different capabilities to
conveniently handle different routes
reaching different endpoints with
different HTTP words we enable it by
simply using the Express packet we
imported here and then calling router
with a capital R as a function like this
now we can start using that router to
register different well routes now if we
have a look at the API as we planned it
we're at the products route here right
now and I want you to register or at the
products resource I should call it the
URL is called a resource basically we're
trying to access our products related
resources and it will implement a get in
a post route for that products URL then
on the other hand means that if we send
some other request like a patch request
to slash products that it shouldn't
reach this route so how do we do this on
this router package we can add get we
can call get get is a method that will
handle incoming get requests the first
argument is then the URL and that URL
here should be slash products now to be
precise it should be just slash because
I want to
load or ascend the request to this
products file for incoming requests
targeting anything with Slash products
at the beginning of the URL
so anything that reaches that foul will
already be beyond at that point will
already have slash products at the
beginning so here I only need to parse
the part after that
now that clearly is confusing so let me
show you how this setup works back in
fjs i will import my product routes new
constant product routes should require
slash api / routes / products without
ojs at the end now i want to make sure
that requests are forwarded to this file
if the URL they are targeting no matter
which HTTP web just the URL is slash
products for this I will work on this
middleware where every request is
funneled through and use a different
format not this function with request
response next but now the first argument
is a filter essentially and I say slash
product is my filter so only requests
that start with this path EUR will then
be handled by some handler I pass as a
second argument and that will be my
product routes so anything starting with
slash products in the URL will be
forwarded to this file and therefore in
this file we must not use slash products
again because that would essentially try
to fit slash products slash products
which we of course don't want to fit so
we can just say slash here and this will
essentially target URLs or requests
aimed at slash product slash nothing in
this case ok so I hope this is clear
we're just using this setup so that we
don't have to manage all the files in
one file but can split them on a feature
basis so this is the get method we now
tell it which kind of sup route or sup
URL we want to handle and the second
argument that is a handler and that
again is just a
function where we have to request the
response and this next function we
already saw in the last video now we can
handle get requests here and for now I
again want to send a response where we
set status code 200 jason and return a
JSON object where i will set a message
property and you could send a different
one where I say handling requests get
requests to slash products novel copy
that setup and add a second route with
the post method and this will now handle
post requests to this path therefore
here will output handling post requests
to slash products and now I will simply
say module exports router so that the
router with the routes we configured is
exported and can be used in other files
like the app.js file where we import
these routes and then we assign them
here let's try this out let's now start
the server again with node server j/s
and let's go back to postman which we
already used in the last video there
I'll again send a post request to
localhost 3000 and I get back an error
now that makes sense because I was
sending a post request to just localhost
3000 and I got no single method in my
code that would handle such a request we
forward all requests to slash products
to our products routing file here and I
got nothing else
so error handling is something we can
improve because right now I just get
some HTML text some default error page
basically and I was talking about HTML
not being that useful to us so we
probably also want to return JSON data
in error cases but let's focus on error
handling later let's for now make this
work by targeting localhost 3000 slash
products now if we send this we get back
handling post requests to slash products
and if I do the same for it get I get
handling get requests to products
if I choose some other method like put
then I get an error again because we
only support get and post now let's add
routes for all the other things we set
it up on these slide or we plan on that
slide for products that were also
requests to the individual products so I
want to use a router again and I want to
be able to get information about one
single product so I said I have a get
request and now keep in mind slash
products already is at the start of the
URL but thereafter I expect to get the
ID encoded into the URL now I need a
variable segment for that and with
express we set us up with a colon and
then any name of your choice that will
be a name by which you later can extract
it like product ID second argument again
is this function with request response
and next and then in here we can again
return a response and maybe we even take
a more complex code here and first of
all we extract that product ID so ID
could be request param this is an object
with all the parents we have and there
we will have a Product ID param because
that is the name which shows here and if
you chose a different name you have to
extract it by that name down there let's
now check if ID it's is let's say equal
to special in this case I could return a
response with status code 200 and a
Jason data object where I say message
you discovered the special ID and
obviously this has absolutely zero
purpose Albert and showing that we
correctly read T parameter in all Africa
cases I'll return response status Jason
and dere let's say we also want to
return the object with a message
property and you could mix this up
and maybe we do and also return the ID
property here so ID could then be the ID
we extract and store in this constant
and for the other requests here or for
the other IDs you passed an ID that
could be what we return now let's try
this out we should be able to now send a
request to slash products slash some ID
and depending on what we pass and I as
an ID we either get back this response
or this one so back to postman let's go
to get because we added a gat route and
let's add some ID or one two three
whatever you want hit send and we get an
error because whenever you change
something on the server you need to
restart it so cancel it with ctrl C and
then rerun node server J s let's try
again let's send this and I get you
passed an ID awesome now let's replace
one two three with special and now we
discover two special ID and we also get
back the ID showing us that extracting
it did indeed work and we will also
replace this code with more useful code
throughout this series so we got this
product ID extracted now we also wanted
to support a patch in a delete route so
I will just copy that route here with
this ID in the URL and I will add a
patch method here to support patch
requests to that and in there I simply
want to return rest status 200 Jason and
there we could have a message where we
say updated product and then I will add
another route where I basically have the
same but with the delete method to
support delete requests where I say
deleted product as a side note if you're
wondering why I never return this
there's no need to do so there is no
code running after this we don't make it
into this method here because we either
have a patch
or a delete or a get Enzo on request you
only would need to add return here if
you had some other code after this
response where you potentially again
send a response because sending two
responses isn't a great idea
now with these changes in place let's
restart the server and let's try it out
let's send a request a patch request and
we get updated product if we send put it
still fails because we don't support
this but delete on the other hand does
work and we get back deleted product so
this all works and this is how we add
our routes how we add more routes and
how we can also work with routes that
have an ID now we also had order related
routes so let's add these two and I'll
add them in a new file orders dot J s
because I want to keep my files clean
and focused I can copy the code from
products jazz though put it in there but
get rid of all the routes I just want to
have the same imports and in the end
export to router and then for orders if
you recall that slide we wanted to
support get and post calls so get to
slash orders and I will load this file
just as I load the products file so we
will already ensure that we parsed it
for slash orders at the beginning so we
don't need it here hence there we also
have a request a response and this next
function which we haven't seen action
yet because we never need it to forward
a request we wanted to send a response
so here I will also send a request
response excuse me 200 status code and
let's pass an object where we have to
message orders were fetched and of
course for the serious people update
this to really return a list of orders
now let me also create another route
post to orders
where we can say order was created and
maybe we want to return status code 200
in one year which is the appropriate
status code for saying everything was
successful resource created hence for
products for the post request we should
also return 201 now that I think about
it so make sure to update this too and
back in orders I now also want to have
routes for getting information about an
individual order so I will copy this set
up here place it here handle get
requests to slash orders slash and now
here comes to order ID and our dynamic
path parameter hence the colon there
I'll send back status code 200 and send
back some order details possibly with
the order our ID which we could get on
the request parents object by accessing
whichever name you chose here in the
path and let's do very same for deleting
an order there I will use the delete
route here the delete method to handle
the riddle eat request suitors ID and
there I can say order delete it now
again that's restart this server and
let's try it out let's send a request a
get request to slash orders and it fails
why because creating the orders in that
file is nice
all these routes right but we don't
forward requests to that file yet we do
to products we do that in the app choice
file with this line here we need to do
the same for orders so I will duplicate
this import here and name this order
routes and I will go to slash IP I slash
routes orders here and then I also will
handle requests going to orders with my
order routes so with the route setup in
that file and now with this we can
restart this
server and try again sending a get
request to slash orders and now we fetch
them now let's try a post request which
should also work and I see order was
created here you also see the status
code 201 here and now let's try order /
some order ID can be a number can be a
string let's try a get request order
details and we also see the ID and let's
try a delete request and we see order
deleted and the ID
so all these routes are working they're
not doing super useful things yet but
one thing we already got is a basic API
not perfect not complete but we're
getting there now let's enhance our
setup and things like error handling and
so on in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
