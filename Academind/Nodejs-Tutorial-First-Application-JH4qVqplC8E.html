this video we're going to install notes
yes and we are also writing our very
first application let's get started to
install no chairs we have to head over
to noches org and there you will find a
link to the latest mature and dependable
binary for your system simply download
it extract it and then run through the
installer that's pretty straightforward
once installation is finished you can
check that everything was successful by
running node - V in the terminal or
command line and then you should
calibration number indicating that well
now it is available now that we have
node we can jump right into writing our
first application because the cool thing
about nodejs is we don't have to install
any separate server or something like
this we're going to write our server on
our own and it's very easy to do so as
you'll see so I got phpstorm which is my
ID ear and my personal opinion is that
phpstorm and webstorm are great ideas
for working with well JavaScript
webstorm or if you want a complete
package including PHP PHP store now you
don't have to buy them they cost money
and I'm sure Adam or sublime text or
great editors - but for the rest of well
this channel probably I'll mostly work
with phpstorm and if you're interested
in following along as close as you can
you might check out this great ide but
that's just my opinion so what I'll do
is I'll create a new project and I could
select Noches
Express up here but we'll create a pure
notes ASM without Express for the moment
we'll get into Express later in this
series don't you worry so I'll just
choose this empty project here and then
I will select this nodejs path here I
already set up and in this path here I
want to create a new folder basics is
just what I'll call this series here ok
then I hit create and obviously you can
create this folder in the finder or the
windows explorer to basically just need
to create a folder and I'll let me bring
my my IDE over here
so this is our newly created workspace
and as you can see just an empty folder
here and the first thing I'm going to do
is I will create a new file and I will
call it server dot J s because we're
writing our first server we want to see
something in the browser right from the
beginning let me pause for a second it
might be strange to someone coming from
that say PHP that we now write our own
server because there we would have
Apache we would have our PHP code which
gets interpreted and then our HTML files
would get served to the user with our or
via our server in this case here we're
writing our own server how do we do then
how does this work basically as I
explained in the first video node.js is
just a runtime executing our JavaScript
files now note C as provide certain
functionalities which allow us to well
create a server like functionality or
not only server like but a server
functionality for example we can note
yes that it should listen to a certain
port on a certain domain and all
requests coming in it should be handled
in a certain way and this is exactly
what we will specify in this server file
we're creating right now there it will
tell no chairs to listen to
incoming requests and do something upon
such requests so very very simple in the
end you just have to kind of get into
that thinking I guess let me show you
what I mean so the server Duchess is the
file which no chairs will execute and it
will not only run through it once and
then finish it but in this file we will
kind of start a loop where no chairs
will continue so you listen to requests
to do this we first have to import or to
require the HTTP module now modules are
something you might know from my angular
2 videos but they're we use typescript
how does this fit in here this is
JavaScript right in the next video I
will take a step back and explain some
of these basic Java
script things we should know when
working with no chairs marshals will be
one of them for now just think of this
like we're importing some functionality
we need so I'm requiring this HTTP
module which gives me access to the
create server method here and this does
exactly what it sounds like it creates a
server now I'll chain another method
here which is the listen method and this
tells our server which we will create
here to listen to the port 8000 so all
requests coming in on port 8000 should
be handled by the server now currently
the server is doing absolutely nothing
so in order to do something with these
requests I will specify a method here
the on request method which should
handle these requests now this method
doesn't exist yet so let's create it
I'll create a new function here the on
request function and this function takes
two arguments the request and response
these arguments are automatically passed
into this function by nodejs when this
function here is kind of executed or
whatever request comes in in this on
request method here I'm not doing
anything with the requester but I went
to well change the response I want you
yeah
tell noches which responds should be
given so therefore I will call the right
head method to set the the header of our
response and this will get the status
code of okay 200 and then I'll pass a
JavaScript object as the second argument
the reason as it says here which is
content type and then text planes are
here I'm just setting the content type
of my response and then doing this as a
JavaScript object where the key is
well basically whatever I want to set in
the
and the value is one of the value of the
key unsetting in the header so in this
case which content type of course I
could set our header keys there as well
then I will call the right function to
just render some plain text to the
screen now of course we can also render
HTML and we can use HTML files as
templates and we reload and we will do
all this in future videos for now I'm
just outputting some text have a world
of course the last thing I want to do is
I want to call response and to make
clear that I'm now done with handling
response and that it can be output to
well the personal sent requests so now
our server is created and all that is
now left to do is open up a terminal
navigate into this folder where you
saved a surrogate ES file and then just
run node server JSO execute this Chase
for Java Script file with no chairs hit
enter and all you won't get any message
but you can see it's not creating a new
lines this process is still running and
then in the browser I'll navigate to
localhost 8080 ated and if there are
still some things that are not clear
100% don't worry we will go into all the
details in the next videos and we will
of course then create more awesome
applications and so on see you the next
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
