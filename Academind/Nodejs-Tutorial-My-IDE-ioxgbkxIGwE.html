had a look at some JavaScript base six
very basic knowledge to help us draw
this course now once you add something
else which well will help us which is
very important a good IDE or a good
editor then you choose whatever editor
you prefer I'm not telling you anything
I will use PHP storefronts course as I
knew in professional my project and I
like it a lot now if you happen to use
teach restore or web spun as well I just
want to give some hints how to configure
it to have a nice word flow or to have a
basic workflow of nodejs
so let's get started and of course using
other editors you might be able to find
a similar setup when watching this video
so I got a project from last time over
here and basically it's really easy to
get started with a good IDE setting here
or no jazz app where the thing is
first thing under preferences you want
to make sure that you have under plugins
you have this nodejs plug-in installed
if you don't then go to installed ship
brains plugin and then just search for
it no chance and you want to install
this noches plug-in here additionally
here in the settings you want to go into
languages and frameworks and then
shallow script libraries and you want to
make sure that you've got this node
chest core library but back into the
library will give you some enhanced or
coding support better auto completion
and so on so very useful features the
last thing I'm using here is if you go
to your run configuration here at the
top right this arrow and to go edit
configurations you can setup life
editing now if you don't have this tab
here available or if you don't have live
editing then make sure you again and
your plugins you
your life edit plugin installed if you
do so you'll also be able plug-in for
Chrome by the bestest original
description of the life add a plug-in if
you have all this installed you can here
on the live edit and run configuration
check that you well basically want to
launch your application in a browser
whenever you relaunch it in the word
that your IDE so whenever you make
changes you can relaunch it and this
will be loaded in your browser
very handy avoids so that's the basic
setup I'm using here and which ya really
makes coding in your chairs a little bit
easier that's it where it's at see you
in the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
