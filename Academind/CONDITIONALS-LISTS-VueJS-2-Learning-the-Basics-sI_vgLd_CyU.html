in this video I want to have a look at
how we can conditionally output some
content in our template in our Dom so
that we don't add or show a certain
let's say HTML element some text all the
time but only after certain condition is
met we'll also have a look at how we may
render lists to the Dom so how we could
render the items in an array to a list
in our web page let's dive into this in
this video I'm starting with a nice
little application here on J's file
again with the very very default so that
you can use for a view chess application
I get my app Dave here and in this app
Dave which is controlled by this view
instance down here of course I get a
button which allows me to well click it
and say show or hide something though
we're not executing any code right now
if you have a look at the quotation
marks of this Veon click directive here
and then I have two paragraphs which I
probably telling by their captions one
is show and hide conditionally I also
have a great horizontal line here which
will become very important later so
let's start by conditionally showing or
hiding this let's start with this first
paragraph I don't want to show this all
the time thankfully I have this nice
show property which is set to true
initially in my data object now what if
I wanted to use this show property as an
indicator if this first paragraph should
be visible or not well we can add a
directive to dispara graph again a
directive is an instruction view chess
will find in its template and it will
know what to do if it knows this
instruction well we're going to use a
directive which ships with view chess so
it will know what to do the name of the
directive is if so the name or the code
we have to use here is V if V - to let
view chairs know hey that is something
that concerns me and an AFS T directive
named all directives in view chairs look
like this use a V
- and then well the real name of this
directive so we if and we if then also
takes a value which we pass with equal
sign and then quotation marks and the
value here is now the well condition
which should determine whether we want
to show something here or not so here
I'm going to use my show property as
this condition because it's true or
false and that is what VF expects it
expects you get true or false to know
whether it should attach the element on
which it sits and all child elements to
the Dom or not that's also important we
have attaches and detaches it's not
hiding and showing it's not changing
your transparency it's really removing
it from the Dom or adding it to it
nothing in between so here with we have
show I'm now telling view chairs only
attach this paragraph and of course also
text inside the paragraph if show is
true which it is initially which is why
if I hit ctrl enter here I still see it
now in show/hide I can now change the
value of show and I want to set it to
whatever show is not right now so to
toggle between the two states so I'm
going to set it to not show to really
set it to false if it was true and to
set it to true if it was false so if we
now hit control enter again we see it
because initially it's true but if I hit
the button watch this part of our page
it disappeared because as I said it was
removed now interesting thing if we
inspect this part off the Dom here we
see am i visible and we see the button
but we see nothing in between but this
empty comment here so it really was
removed from the Dom if I click the
button again you see it's back there so
it's really added and removed as I said
before so this is how VF works and with
VF we also get V else we else can be
placed on an adjacent element to dyf
element here as long as it's the same
element so if we use VF on a paragraph
here we have to have an adjacent
paragraph
you can place Vee else now this means we
else is now only displayed if show is
false so if I click the button we see a
my wearable if I click it again we only
see M part-time visible this is how we
can use VF and we asked conditionally
show parts on our screen also important
besides we if we also get V show we
showed also works the same as we have
generally here we can say hooray I'm
here but the important thing is if I hit
ctrl enter it looks like it works the
same as we have right it's removed
whenever the with part is removed
however let's inspector to see the
difference here is our hooray I'm here
paragraph if I click show/hide you will
notice it's still there it's not removed
instead it's display is set to non so
this is the important difference we show
doesn't actually remove it from the Dom
it only changes the display to non so
it's no longer a player just played here
the important implication of course is
that removing it might be better
performance wise because it's really
gone it doesn't have to be rendered even
though you don't see it on the other end
you might have reasons why you want to
keep it around so you got both
possibilities with VF and we show and
with that you should have all the
flexibility you need now that were
conditionals let's now have a look at
lists so how can we output a list like
oh we got one year like this persons
list so let's say here below this
horizontal line that is why it's so
important I went out for the unordered
list and in this unordered list I went
out put let's say the names of my
persons now of course I could add a list
item here and I could access persons the
first element of course and then name
property like this now variate
control-enter we indeed see max here but
that's not really super convenient and
it's not reactive at all if we change
this list somewhere in our application
well that will not really get updated
where
not really able to dynamically add
multiple list items depending on the
length of the list we also have to or we
right now all have them have to code
them manually so that's not super
convenient instead we can use a number
directed so let me remove this code in
here and only list item I'm going to
place another directive which is called
v4
this also takes some value and we if we
told view chess the condition on whether
it should attach something well with v4
we tell view chairs that it should loop
through something so in the quotation
marks here we're writing the loop logic
and that would be that we want to loop
through all the persons so first I'm
going to choose a name for the variable
view chairs we'll use for each item in
this loop here and this is totally up to
you I'm going to name it person since we
do have a person yet but again this is
freely choose abble then we say in
persons so this is the syntax you may
know in your JavaScript loops so with
that I can now simply output person name
here I don't have to specify the index
because prison will change for each loop
iteration and if I now add control-enter
we see all three persons output there
because with v4 this list item element
is recreated as often as needed and so
is the text which is output free string
interpolation here and that is how we
can use a list or how we can render a
list with the four important side note
you can also get ex access to the
current index by simply enclosing person
in parentheses and adding a second kind
of argument here the argument is also
freely nameable by you I'm going to name
it index and this allows me to now also
output the index here which is reset for
each iteration so this starts at 0 of
course for the first element and then
goes up to 2 for the last element this
is the alternative syntax you can use if
you not only need access to the specific
element at the current iteration or at
the current a point of
time but also to the index of that
iteration we can get access to both with
that we had a detailed look at how you
can conditionally output data and how
you can use lists really a lot of useful
things here and hopefully something
which helps you in your view chess
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
