was just a lot to do that and then
recognize that this might be interesting
for our people too I'm setting up get
here now I created it with getting it of
course me to have downloaded and
installed get on your machine so dad
sets up a git repository and then I
created this git ignore file to tailgate
which files I don't want to see on git
and which files and folders are these
its denote modules folder because this
can be recreated with NPM install it
then is the dist folder because that
will be created by web pack
automatically and it's in my case G dot
idea folder which is just the hidden
folder which holds my project
configuration by my IDE it would also be
the NPM debug - log file if you got this
which is a file which gets created in
case of any errors and with NPM and I
don't want to use your version dead file
- so these are the files I'm putting
there and with all these files in place
I will just well make my initial commit
so add all files which are not ignored
you might get repository and then commit
them with the commit - em message which
is my initial commit setup finished
that's actually my master branch here
but I will also create a new branch for
this check it out where it will be
called setup and this should then also
hold the very same cold
so with that I'll continue with the next
video just wanted to share this with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
