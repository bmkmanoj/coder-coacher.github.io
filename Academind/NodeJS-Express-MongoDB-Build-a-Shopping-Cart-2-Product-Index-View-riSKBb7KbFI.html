header in this application because I
will not only have a list or a grid of
products but I want to have a header
which allows the user to go to the user
account or to sign in log out and so on
and to go to the shopping cart of course
and manage the shopping cart and well
use it so in order to do this I will go
to the cat bootstrap comm page again so
to the bootstrap page and on components
ribbon here I'll pick the navbar and
this is the default nap or bootstrap
chips with now you may replace this with
whichever code you want or whichever nap
or you want but I think it's fine for my
purposes here so I will just go back to
the views folder and now we'll create a
new subfolder which we'll call partials
and this folder should hold the well
partials the files which should be
included in a variety of different files
possibly at least I will treat a new
file here a cold header dull HBS and in
this file I will paste this bootstrap
header code now we'll add a disk out in
a few seconds but for now I want to
include this header in the layout
however now in order to implement this I
have to replace the handlebars
templating engine the generator use for
us with number one I do this by opening
up a new terminal window and then
navigate it into this project folder i
run npm install - - save to save an
entry in the package to JSON file and
then Express - handlebars and this will
in store another handlebars templating
engine third-party package which offers
more features than the built-in one with
that I will go to my app Duchy as fall
now in order to use this newly installed
package I will create a new variable
here which I will call Express HBS which
will
just import this Express handlebars
package we just installed and the next
step I will go down here where the view
engine set up and replace this app set
here with app engine register this new
engine with a name I want to set so i
will use HBS here and then I will use
the Express loops this should be
handlebars two HBS not HSB so use this
package it just brought in and execute
it kind of started with this command
here and I will pass a JavaScript object
to this method here to configure the
templating engine I will set the default
layout to layouts so this will always
search for layouts HBS file and I will
set the extension name to dot HBS to
keep this well dot HBS extension were
already used to otherwise I would have
to change all file names to dot
handlebars which is default as package
ships with now here I will then replace
this HBS with dot HBS as well to refer
to this new engine and for this to work
this should be layout not layouts by the
way for this to work I will creat a new
subfolder called layouts and I will move
my layout into the subfolder here so if
all these changes in place if I now
restart the server and reload this page
you can see it still works now I can
include my header here it is partial and
I do this by going to the layout and
then right at the beginning of the body
tag before the actual content of you is
entered I again open double curly braces
then I have to greater than sign close
to Coit braces and then I specify the
name of the partial I want to include by
default this will look for this file in
the partials folder so all I have to do
here is specify header now if I reload
this page you can see this bootstrap
header being at the top now while this
is great I don't
all this stuff here and regarding the
right drop down I will well get rid of
some links and I will also rename this
to be more fitting like user account and
shopping cart for example so back in the
header first I'll get rid of the
complete left part of these naughty nav
bars of this unordered list and a search
form here and next I will get rid of
some of the links in a drop-down on the
right and then I will rename the drop
down to let's say user account or
whatever you like and then I would have
D let's say ya the EDD user account here
so let me rename this to user management
for example and then here the second
link should be logout as human we're
logged in and does what we changed later
on depending on the real state of the
user so if there is in place what I will
next you is I will rename the link here
to shopping cart and if I now reload
this looks a lot better however it would
be nice to have little icons next to
these links here to indicate while I use
your symbol and a shopping cart symbol
here that is real easy to do and I will
use font awesome for this now fun
awesome is well a package of fun so to
say you can import into your project but
instead of changing your text it
introduces a whole lot of little icons
you can use so by clicking on get
started
you're able to grab a link to the CD and
holding this stylesheet and I will just
input this into my layout file here
right before I import my own styles but
positioning doesn't really matter with
this package to be honest and then it's
really easy to use
so if I want a user I can I can go to
icons here and then just search for user
and I find all user related icons I
think the first one here is great so
then I can just copy the code it gives
me here
and enter that in my header right before
the user account and also spacebar to
have it not sit directly on the text I
will also search for another icon the
shopping cart such as chopping gives me
a couple of shopping cards I will go
with this one here the classic shopping
cart copy this and input it right before
the shopping cart link here also have a
space after it and now if we reload the
page this looks good where is the user
icon I inserted it in the wrong place
didn't I right it should not be inside
the drop-down but here at the user
management link now I very load this
looks much better so that's great the
header is in place and the overall
application doesn't look too bad but now
I want to start adding the products of
the product thumbnails on this index
page though so that we actually see
something for this I will go back to my
views folder and I will create a new
subfolder called
shop now I will move my index to HPS
file into this shop folder and if I now
reload this will break because it no
longer finds the index view of course so
in the index dot J's file I will change
this to not look for the index file in
the views folder but instead in the shop
folder and then in the index or then use
the index HPS file so if I now restart
my server and reload this page this now
works again so dad is working again but
back to the thumbnails how do I get
nice-looking thumbnails and a grid
holding these four nails
well if bootstrap of course and this is
no bootstrap course so I won't go into
too much detail but you may just use
bootstraps both in grid system and if
you're not aware how this works this
basically divides your whole page into
several blocks you can use to structure
or to position your data at this grid
system
also supports different screen sizes to
automatically stack or expand these
blocks so that is really great and
allows you to create a flexible
responsive layout without using flexbox
which in furious
batter but doesn't work in all browsers
if this is all totally new to you I
would recommend you check out some of
the many many bootstrap tutorials
courses and videos you will find on the
Internet to learn how it actually works
so I use the grid but I also want to
have a nice looking thumbnail if we go
to the components tab here you can see
that we get this thumbnails point here
on the right and we could even pick a
bump down with only having an image but
I want to have one with having a text or
which has a text as well later on I want
to have a price at the bottom - and I
want you only have one link and move
that to the right but for now I would
write grab this ko here and just insert
it here instead of G current content we
have so now if I save this and reload my
page while we get the thumbnail it
doesn't look that great to be honest but
we'll get there it doesn't look that
great because currently we're using the
thumbnail but we're not positioning this
row inside a container bootstraps grid
works in a way that it has rows and
columns in the rows and all rows sit in
an overarching container now this
container currently doesn't exist so I
will add it in my layout HPS file and
wrap all views or all the content which
might be added by views in such a
container as I have em at install which
is a little black in my IDE which makes
it easy for me to create HTML file or
HTML tags and assign classes I can just
type dot container and then it tab to
create a div element with a class of
container you might just Google for your
favorite editor or IDE and m8e mmm
tea if you're interested in installing
this plug-in as well so now I got the
container and if I reload now it at
least looks a little bit better but
still we need an image we need to fix
these buttons well let's start with an
image for now I will just fetch one from
the internet but of course later on we
want to replace this with images
actually living or sitting on our server
so I will search for a great product and
what do we want to sell on our shop
how about video games and I think well
now I can certainly only make mistakes
by picking the wrong game so great
choice by me therefore I will pick a
game probably no one else but it's a
great game by a German game developer
gothic but older but one of the greatest
RPGs you can know and of course I should
have known that I don't fight the game
by just searching for gothic so gothic a
game yeah that is so therefore that
people buy that game it's great so I
will just pick the link here deep
linking of course not something you
should do on your page but that's just
for testing purposes here you slink back
in the indexed or HBS file at a shop
folder I will paste here in the source
of my image
and if I now reload boom that's big
while gothic is a great game it
certainly deserves to be that big but
that's too big now I want to change this
and I will change the overall styling or
the maximum height this image element
may have inside a thumbnail I will do
this in my own style sheet style dot CSS
here and I just add a rule thumbnail and
an image each image tag in the thumbnail
and we only have one of course should
have a maximum height of 150 pixels and
I will all sail back in the index to HB
s fall give this image and a class of
image responsive which is a bootstrap
class
now if we reload this looks better and
of course you may stall is to to your
needs how you want this to look I'm
happy with it like this and next of
course I want to well add some dummy
text here and change the buttons to add
the band dummy text I will again use
Emmet and the only typing lorem and then
hitting tab I get some dummy text here
now if you don't have that plug-in and
you don't want it or can't have it you
were all through you can also get dummy
text like this by just searching for
lorem ipsum and you will probably find
pages like this one long epsom dot d and
while this page is on german it's really
straightforward to use just enter the
number of words you want to generate
then you choose well if this is the
number of words or number of characters
or paragraphs it go and boom here you
got your dummy text to copy so if I
reload now I got a dummy text now I want
to gift make this little bit more
grayish to later I'll have to Bryce
stand out a little bit more and I have
to fix the button still so first to make
this more grayish I will give this
paragraph holding the description a
class of description and in my
stylesheet I will add it in thumbnail
container of course description should
have a color whoops a CSS class here
should have a color off yeah this is
still a chosen from the level video I
recorded a couple of hours ago so this
is fine yep looks good now let be fixed
buttons mmm first thing is I don't need
the first button I only need the second
one this here should not be a paragraph
but a div holding the button and it
should also hold a div with the price of
let's say $12 and I will give this
difficult in to that
the styling I do want to apply is let's
say this should be bold and I want to
have a font size of let's say 16 pixels
all 0 to move the button I will add a
class to this button and a class I do
want to add is pull right now that is a
default bootstrap class or a helper
class bootstrap ships with which allows
me to float something this button in
this case to the right if I reload this
looks really bad and I don't want to set
it down there it should be inside this
whole box well this happens because it
got a couple of floats going on on this
page and well by mixing them all up this
results in what we see here therefore on
the div holding this button I will add a
class clear fix also a helper class
provided by bootstrap which will make
sure that all the floats within this div
here float kind of on their own and are
not masked up by other floats we had
before this so that looks better but the
text doesn't look good here the price of
course this the case because here we
don't have a float so I will assign pull
left to distaff to float this on the
left and therefore it will now be inline
with this button last fingers I want to
make this button cream and if you have a
look on the bootstrap page on the CSS
rhythm here or the CSS tab you find this
buttons point here now here you find a
lot of information about buttons amongst
the information
how would you style them and I went this
green button I get it by assigning the
button success class to the button and
note you may not only change or style
buttons as buttons so button elements
but also anchor elements or basically
all the elements you want to style as
buttons nothing's keeping you from doing
that so I will replace the button
default style in my index
HBase file with the button success style
to make it green now ever reload that
looks a lot like what I want it to look
like a major step here last thing is I
want to have a couple of thumbnails here
not just one so for now later on we'll
be done in the number away but for now I
will copy this column which holds the
individual thumbnail and just paste it
into two more times to have two more
thumbnails and because this column or
these columns have the classes they have
they look like they look okay that's a
bad explanation so because they have a
class of call MD for on medium sized
screens each column will take up four
blocks of the overall grid and there are
twelve blocks available so three
thumbnails plus gutters will fit in one
row on a medium-sized screen on a small
size screen because we assigned or by
default and the SM six class is assigned
only to fun plants will fit in one row
and of course you may change this make
this year s m1 and you will have twelve
thumbnails on your mobile phone probably
not what you want but try it out so with
this if I save we get free thumbnails in
one row now in order to also have
multiple rows I will copy all of that
the complete row here and duplicate that
and now I have two rows with three
thumbnails each and that is as far as I
want to go for now in the next lectures
or the next videos I will take the next
steps and step by step at data two days
and so on
see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
