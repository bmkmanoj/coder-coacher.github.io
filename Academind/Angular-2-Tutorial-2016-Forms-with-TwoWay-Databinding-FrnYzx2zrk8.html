throughout this tutorial we've already
covered some ground we learn how to use
components how to let them interact what
data binding is we learn how to set up
our routing how to pass parameters with
routing so we've really covered a lot of
great fundamentals we'll need in our
day-to-day applications now there's
still our open issues on our to-do list
so to say the way we handle the forum
currently is not the most elegant and
there are way better ways when it comes
to handling forms in angular 2 we never
touch the issue of accessing the web so
accessing a restful server for example
will have to do something about this in
this course - there are other things in
angular 2 that we haven't touched like
pipes when our pipes the that's the
thing I really want to talk about in a
future video we haven't built any custom
structural directives for example we
haven't discussed custom events and how
to propagate those so there are a lot of
yes I said open issues we'll have to
tackle throughout this course and in
this video well we're going to start
with the forms issue because as I said
there are great ways of managing and
handling forms and angle at you and
we'll learn one in this video then I'll
have another with you where I'll show
you a number of maybe even more elegant
way of handling forms and I'll also put
up a separate forms video where I'll
cover the complete topic in a well very
forum specific way and not in the
context of our overall tutorial like
I'll do in this video so you probably
should watch both but whatever please
leave your feedback and I'll be happy to
have you with me on this course in the
future see you there
bye now here is where we left off we had
our new contact form which could ever
access by clicking this button here and
creating it
contract from an existing contact or by
just clicking you contact up here to
create a completely new contact now
currently we're handling all this by
assigning each input element here a
local variable and then when we hit
submit well we're basically passing the
values of our input fields through this
local variable to our submit function
now asn't really said that is not the
most elegant way because if we add more
input fields we will have to introduce
more and more local variables we will
then have to expand a list of arguments
our method here if we ever change
something to the method we will have to
do it here and at the bottom cell
validation isn't an even a thing in this
case here so that's really not the best
way especially as angular 2 offers us
some really great tools you can use when
it comes to forms now as I said many
tools there are different ways of
building forms with angular 2 and which
kind of way you wanna choose depends on
what you want to achieve now I will show
you the different ways and then it's up
to you to pick whatever you think suits
your needs or whichever way you like
best in this video we'll cover the way
where we will use two-way data-binding
to both our form so let's do this so to
do this I'll go to my new contact
component here I already have it open
and first I'll get rid of all these
local variables here I'll also get rid
of this value field here so let me do
all that and I'll also get rid of this
click function here instead this will
get type submit' and now I'll do
something which makes it a lot more like
a foreigner which is very important for
a role to be able to handle it as a form
I'll wrap this form into form tags so
that's not only more valid html5 or HTML
ageneral it as a set is a
necessary for angular2 to recognize this
block here as a form because whenever
angular2 finds a form tag or a form
element in a documentary it will
automatically attach the mg form class
or directive to that form element and
that's very important because we don't
have to add any directive here like
writing and you form equals anything or
something like this we don't have to do
anything like this
angular 2 will automatically do this for
us so this form is now under control if
you want to say it like this of angle 2
and there is a invisible ng form
attached to it now I'll just set m g4
was automatically added to this form
element here so you may think of it this
way every directive has a selector like
for ng 4 for example that's the selector
of the mg 4 directive now ng form has
let's say two selectors one would be ng
form and one would be form and that's
why every oops every form element in our
document is automatically an energy form
directive and why is that so important
because we can use methods and actions
on this form or with this form that are
only available due to the ng form
directive and therefore it's very
important for you to recognize that we
have access to these methods even though
we're never ever attaching ng form here
directly it's done for us just want to
point that out now with that we get this
form on the control of angular 2
well we might want to access the overall
validity of the forum
or the overall value complete foreign
when it is submitted
so to do this we can assign a local
variable to this form like let's say
money form and then set this equal to
and now the dispassion clue comes and ng
form so now here we're using ng form or
we're setting a reference to our ng form
object that's the best way to say it
that's the best way to describe this
relationship we're setting this local
variable which holds a reference to our
energy form object which in return is
this whole form here and specifically
it's an object of type control group now
control group is a angular to specific
object which may hold several controls
and as you might already guess controls
are our inputs we have in a form that
are the controls but we'll have to
specify our controls with the ng control
directive and so that's what we're going
to do now so I'll just add a line break
here so that we have a more structured
way of reading this DB adage or the
directives I'm attaching to this input
element so I'll make this input element
here a control of this form in the
angular 2 recognition so to say by
attaching the ng control directive and
then I'll just choose the name I want to
have for and with under which I'll be
able to access it so now this input here
is control of this form to which I have
a reference with this my form local
variable here and inside this form I'll
be able to access the for example
validity or the value of this input
field by using this name here this
because that's the control and under
which it is recognized in this over
foreign vice versa the a bird inputs
here are not part of the form as if now
because I'm not setting the energy
control directive now as I said ng form
is of type control group and the control
group holds several controls therefore
we have to specify our controls I'm
really just pointing it out this this
way because it's very important to grab
this concept this ng control will be
automatically bound to the parent
control group so the forum for example
here now we could also make this a
control group here we could add ng
control group here and then give us some
some random name here control group and
now this forum would have this control
group match to it in this control group
would hold all the ng controls we were
to nest inside it and therefore we can
very detailed or in just in a way we
need it
access the you know for example by the
validity and values of whole groups of
controls so for example if you want to
match the first last name of a name
together in two different input fields
but it should be one control group and
we could just check control group for
availability to check if both names have
been entered for example or we could go
down one level and check each input
field so for now I'm just going to
remove this control group here and I'll
just have my ng control here in my ng
form now that's been a lot of talking
about this ng control thing but as I
said that's really the key concept off
of forms in angular q and therefore it's
it's very important to to understand now
well point out at this point already
that there're as I said at the beginning
of this video is another way of doing
forms angular two that is using the form
builder and there we won't have the ng
control attached to the
but instead another directive but we
will see that when we're in that
specific video there enough talking
about that we got our mg control here in
our form and now let's say I want to I
want to make this required this input so
it's required to be filled out now
recognize please that this is just an
html5 validation attribute so to say
just pure HTML HTML here and I'm going
to add these two things here or two to
each of my forms here that's going to be
or each of my inputs here excuse me
that's going to be my last name that's
gonna be my phone number here and that's
gonna be my email so this is my form and
yeah that's just how it looks now I set
it to required so currently this should
all be invalid now let's see if this is
true now a sad validation and so on
would be very easy with angular 2 now
all my fields here should currently be
invalid because I said every input field
to required and I haven't entered a
single value now the cool thing is if we
have a form and that is control
Bangaluru as I said and we have our
controls in this form specified with ng
control then each of these controls get
several CSS classes describing its
current state so if we go into
inspection mode here we see that this
input has the ng pristine class that
means it is empty the ng invalid class
that means it's currently not valid
because it is required in currently
empty it's derived by Inglot you do to
the html5 tag I got here and it is ng
touched because when I clicked into it
therefore I did something that changed
something there if we look at the next
input here we get ng untouched because I
haven't clicked into it yet
therefore it is untouched so we get
these three descriptions so to say which
you can use is it touched as the user
done something with this input field is
it empty pristine or dirty there is some
text in it and as a valid or not valid
so if I go to my first input here and I
just enter one single character you see
that it is now well touched it is dirty
because it is no longer empty and it is
valid because we have entered one
character and that is all the required
attribute requires us to do now I can
just abuse these automatically added CSS
class by going to my Styles here adding
the ng invalid select or your severe CSS
class and she loved it
and I'll just give my input then a
border of one pixel solid red now let me
save this as you can see all my inputs
are now red and if I had to text well
now it's no longer red so that's basic
validation you're at angle at you with
the form the ng4 directive and well that
that's cool now we can validate our form
now we also want to be able to send it
previously we had our click event here
on the button and then we would send the
value of each input well it's easier
with forms we can't just go to the top
of the form and notice that we have no
action or method here that's because
we're not sending and request to the
server here
but we can add another and directive for
an event here that is ng submit notice
the parentheses which always as I
explained means where we're having an
event here it's it's triggered by action
in this case that the submit button will
be clicked so this type submits very
important because if this button is
clicked this action you will be fired so
let's say I want to trigger the on
submit function then I don't pass any
arguments to it and if you're in
the body of my component I'll have my
unset mid function and now as someone
needs to pass the values now how could I
do this now there are different ways but
one is I could somehow get a reference
to this form and then as all the
controls are bound to it access the
value of these form controls but there
is a more elegant way and as a set we'll
discover another very elegant way to in
the next video but this one we're going
to use two-way data-binding
so I'll just get rid of this past last
name because I won't need it anymore
and I'll just add a new property here
which I will call it this new contact
which will be of type contact so that
will be just the object will will theta
binds to and I will add this on each of
my controls here so just the good old
data binding two-way data binding we
know the ng model and bind it to new
contact first name here and I'll just
copy that find that to last name find
that to phone and that unsurprisingly to
email so now I got my IQ a data binding
here going on and now I want you cope
for the for the fact that I can pass a
parameter to this form and have my last
name already filled out there for our
chimp we'll change this here in my ng on
init method and instead of setting this
past last name I will set my new contact
to well a new contact chest here where I
will bind the last name to this value
we're getting here
possibly getting through our flower
routing and I'll also set a first name
oh that's just going to be an empty
string last name as this value the phone
number will be an empty string and the
email will be an empty string too so now
we get this new contact set when we load
up this form and you can already see
this if I go here and I click create new
contact you can see my last name is
already filled out so that's working now
this is two-way data-binding
arm I can change all these values and it
will get added to this new contact but
to actually see that or to set that back
and create it in our list I'll just use
my own submit function here or method
here and here there's one simple thing
I'll do or two things I'll do the first
one is I call my contact service and
I'll insert a contact and which contact
will insert well exactly the new contact
because it will be bound to this form
and the second thing is well I'll just
navigate back copy that get rid of this
on add contact we're not using it
anymore and I'll let me save this and
let's get back here loader click create
contact
well that is html5 so just gonna fold
that out with some dummy value create
and now we can see our contact here and
that is how easy we can create a new
contact with energy format the two-way
data-binding and now compare this to our
last solution here it's very simple to
add new inputs or anything like this as
long as our model we're binding to
supports it but what that will always be
the premise because otherwise why would
we want a value we're not storing
anywhere in our application so if that's
the case well we won't have to change
any arguments in this function here or
in our function below down here now
all we have to do is bind to this model
and that's really everything and then we
will just
send our new contact to the to direct
contact service here and if we weren't
to have the possibility of creating a
new contact with the last name so if
this forum wouldn't exist with a
possibility of a prefilled input field
well this part wouldn't be necessary and
then all we would have is this line here
and our standard form of ng submit and
ng control to handle the whole form
including the validation and that I
think is really a strong argument for
angular 2 because that is really fun and
really easy to do so that was quite a
long video because there were some key
things I really wanted to stress and to
emphasize so I hope you now have a good
picture of how you can build forms in
angular 2 and how you can take advantage
of the built-in tools now I'll be honest
there are other advantages because us by
using the ng form directive that I
haven't even told you here for example
we can as we're binding to the form here
we can add a local variable here at the
input and just bind this to ng form as
well which will then not bind to the
whole form but instead to this single
input field here now that would allow us
to do something like adding a span
behind it that is only shown if the the
first name is valid valid is just a
property we can access to in a in a
control in ng
control is the class which will be
inserted here so to say or reference
here with the ng control directive so we
can access this valid property and check
check if it is not valid to display like
a text of not valid here and if we now
save this wait we see we could not
here which disappears when we type
something so we can bind to two elements
by two input elements by using this ng
form reference here we always a code for
example binds to our overall form here
by using the disabled binding here and
saying if our my form I think I called
it did I call it my form yeah if my form
is there to access the foreign property
of then valid if that is not well it
well then the spot we should be disabled
so I can't click it until I filled out
everything here then I can click it and
now I got my contact here so that was
really quick because I think that talks
for itself but that that are the
concepts which I have been covered in
detail here but there will be future
videos coming up on this channel for
sure and the next one will talk about
the form builder which is another way of
approaching that form issue well
obviously not totally different but for
example it doesn't use two-way
data-binding it has a number approach
and well you will see everything in the
next video see you there have a nice day
