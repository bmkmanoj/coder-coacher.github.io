wet pack too serious in the last video
of this series we learned what a web
pack is and why you might use it now
that's going to be a short video here
before we dive into the cool concept of
web pack and create our first
configuration file I want to explain
what you wetback development server is
and why you might want to use it now
right now in the example app we're using
the file protocol as you can see here
and the file protocol here simply has a
couple of disadvantages compared with
the HTTP protocol in the end it only
loads our file locally on our machine so
it doesn't send a HTTP request and
whilst this works fine here a lot of
other features won't be available or
won't work in the same way as they work
on a real server we all the can simulate
that the assets were using like a
JavaScript files are really downloaded
from a server because they are not they
are simply accessed on our file system
which of course is super fast therefore
in the network tab if you reload the
page you see zero bytes here for all
these packages because they're not
reloaded via HTTP besides the fact that
they are of course really small so it's
not a great thing to test your app in
this mode instead you should use a real
server of course you shouldn't rent some
server on some hosting provider and then
try to test there that would be probably
expensive and most importantly very
cumbersome instead you probably want a
little server running on your local
machine and it would be great if the
server would add some extra features for
example automatically reloading your
application whenever your code changes
webpack offers the server which does
just that the web tag dev server let's
go go for it to learn more about it web
pack dev server here we can choose the
github repository of the web pack dev
server and you can learn more about it
and find links to the documentation and
so on so that is you epic dev server
room what it does is it spins up a
little node.js server hosting your app
with some extra features let's use it
in our project here I will install a
tree using NPM again it will be a
development only dependency therefore I
will add - - save - to indicate this and
then the package name is webpack deb
server which will download the latest
version of it it will also create an
entry in our package digest and fall
here as you can see so now the web pack
- to reward download it and what we can
now do is here on the build script which
is kind of our development build script
we can replace the web pack call here
with website dev server
it's basically by the same developers
and it will work like web pack it simply
wraps itself around web- offers all the
functionalities all the features of web
next Plus that extra feature of
providing as a development server so now
here if i run npm run build now what
will happen is it will still compile our
code but here was an important message
web pack output is roof from slash
project running at localhost 8080 so dad
at the address on our local machine
where it spun up this development server
as a side note the bundle of which it
creates is no longer stored the dist
folder here so if we deleted here it
will still work instead of the stored in
memory for the server if you run the
other command for prod it will of course
still output that but there is no need
to output the files physically on your
file system if you only want to test it
so let's look at this page let's go to
localhost 8080 now which is the address
we saw in the console and if we have a
look here we see it seems to be broken
especially if we have a look at the
console we see that now here it somehow
doesn't find our bundle and if we go
back to the project and try restarting
the server NPM result we now get an
error now you could say yeah of course
because you did a liter the disk folder
but that's not the main reason it's
really is served from memory but before
we didn't get an error because we had
the oldest folder around - it loaded
this now that it's gone we see that
something doesn't seem to work about the
web
dev server command and the reason for
this is that you have to tweak the
command line options here unlike your
normal web peg command you can just
specify entry and output like this here
instead you have to be explicit about
which pop refers to what so you add - -
entry where before it is we're in front
of this source JavaScript app touches
pop here and important prefixes pop with
dot slash to indicate that it is to be
seen relative from the package.json file
and from the index.html file that you
write so where we run this command from
the root folder basically and the same
for this here you should specify an
output and now not just output the
output file name and that also dot slash
this to indicate where this should get
stored and now if we rerun this command
after canceling this again with ctrl C
if we rerun this now we see it works we
still don't have a dist folder but if we
reload the project here it works
correctly because now it has the right
inputs and now it is able to load our
files and create a bundle in memory and
then serve it and now you can see that
if you visit the network tab here now
you can see that if you reload this you
really have some real file sizes here
and now you really are using your code
here now you really are using HTTP here
and you're accessing the files via HTTP
requests now if you wonder why the
bundle is so big well that simply is
because it does not many fight not
optimize at all and it contains a lot of
code the web dev server simply uses and
that only is available during
development of course this will
disappear once you prepare this app for
production so that is now the web pack
depth server a better way of testing
your projects of running them in on your
local machine and how you should really
work with fronted apps with that out of
the way let's dive into the config file
which we can create for more
about how we can find human web tag to
our needs or the usage of web tech to
our needs and dive into some a little
bit more advanced features in the next
