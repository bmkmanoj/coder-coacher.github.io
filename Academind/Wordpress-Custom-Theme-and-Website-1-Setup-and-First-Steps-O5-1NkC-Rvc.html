beginning with WordPress custom things
in this course we're gonna create our
own WordPress website and we will do
this by using standard theme at the
beginning but we will continue and
develop our own theme so that we really
have our own customized website based on
famous and very very good WordPress
back-end which delivers us the content
that allows us to yeah really create a
an exciting good website now why don't
we get started right now okay let's get
started by setting up our development
environment we will use cloud 9 dot IO
or C 900 which is a cloud IDE which
allows us to program and and yes store
our project in the cloud where we will
have a pre-configured workspace so we
don't have to set up anything on our
local machine we don't have to go
through any installation processes or
something like that we just set up our
workspace there and get started right
away yeah to start as you should he'll
where to see 9 dot IO and then hit a
sign-up button to create an account it
doesn't cost anything it is free you
don't have to take the paid accounts for
this course free one is absolutely more
than sufficient so set up your account
and we'll be right back ok so once
you've set up your account and logged in
you should see your basic dashboard
which looks like this one and the cool
thing is cloud line already comes with a
pre-configured WordPress workspace so we
do have to do even less than anywhere
else so all we have to do is hit create
in your workspace so all you have to do
here is enter a project name word press
basics and a short description this is
the wordpress basics course doesn't
really map to be honest because we will
mark it as a private workspace which
means
and where people won't be able to have a
look at it okay so this is that nothing
to enter here and here we pick which
kind of workspace do we want and as you
can see cloud 9 really provides a broad
variety of pre-configured workspaces to
get started with and we could also set
up our own workspace and configure it
and edit ready to our needs but here we
can just select the WordPress workspace
and hit create workspace and now cloud 9
will set up everything every need to
have to get writer started with
developing so let's just wait until
until this guy's finished and here we
are now cloud 9 already set up some
basics we would have to setup when
installing it on a real server or our
local machine specifically what cloud 9
did here is yet take care about the
database details but that is not too
difficult and we will cover that when we
come to deployment later in that course
ok so we can close this window and it is
already installed so let's just hit run
project and get it going oh I think we
can already go open in preview and here
we are
so what shows up is the normal WordPress
installation screen because we have to
set this part up and this is really
really easy so let's just enter a site
title word Press basics the user name I
would just pick max here let's set up a
password we don't need this certainly
very good but very complicated password
here because we're running a local
development environment or not local but
it is our development environment it
hasn't to be that
we just want to be able to access it
fast so I will just pick one two three
and as this is a very very weak password
and certainly not recommended for
protection I have to confirm to use this
this weak password now just enter an
email address and then hit install okay
the next screen you should see is the
success screen because normally we would
have to enter as a set some database
details away especially the database
name password user but cloud9 already
did that for us okay so now we can just
hit login and yeah well login and here
we are in the wordpress background now
we can pop that window out of that
smaller in browser browser to a real
browser tab so that we have a chance to
look at it in its full beauty and as you
can see this is our front end as it
comes out of the box and if we go up
here and hit the dashboard we are taken
to the backend of our application so the
backend is the part where we will be
able to create posts pages to administer
our whole site and to provide the
content which is to be seen on the front
end on the other hand which we let me
just open it in a new tab which you can
see here so front end back end now maybe
you have here the indicator that there
are updates to be installed because
cloud 9 seems not to provide the most
recent version of WordPress so let me
just do that real quick and you should
do it as well if you have the
possibility just hit restore now okay so
now I do have the most recent version
and I just want to wrap this very first
video up with a quick tour through the
WordPress back-end because as I said
this is the part where you will fill you
side with life and although we will come
to the development of themes in just
about next with you it is very important
that you understand how you do control
your website so you have you dashboard
why is showing updates again I really
should have update like ends maybe I
have to do that to be left on now okay
now that's gone okay so now the
dashboard this is the first page you see
when you log in to your admin back-end
and it is basically just an overview
over all the options you have on the
left here or over the most important
ones so you can start customizing your
currently picked theme and don't mistake
that with what we are going to do here
we are going to develop our own theme
whereas here you have an existing theme
which you can configure in certain ways
which will be doable for our own theme
as well
that means deciding which options show
up in which menu and so on the some
basic modularity you can provide with
the theme yeah so here we can customize
an existing one whereas we will create a
brand new one which is obviously even
more customizable than using an existing
one we also can write our first blog
post actually we do have a blog post but
that is the basic one WordPress comes
with when you install it so just you can
see something on this page really so
yeah we can write our first blog post we
can add an about page with this which is
basically we just add a page which
happens to be about us because WordPress
thinks that might be a clever thing to
do and we will come to patience in just
a second
we can view it which we are already
doing in the step and yeah we got some
more options here so basically most
is the posting because after all we're
presents a content management system
especially useful for blogs so we might
want to create posts on it at some point
which would you hear posts add new and
boom we're in the post editor where we
just enter a post title and the post
content with formatting if we want you
okay so very straightforward here over
here we can preview a post we can save
it as a draft which won't publish it yet
and we can yeah immediately publish it
here we get the option of you choosing
the format of the post so the default is
there little nice sentence but we could
also say it's it's just an image just a
with you it's just a quote just a link
just a short little note which should be
a show but it's not a ring post and so
on
and we will come back to this section
when we get into creating our own theme
because these formats depend on Feenie
left installed not every theme supports
all formats and you might not need all
formats so that is something we will
come back to when we develop our own
theme here we can attach a category to
our post like video games that we have a
post about we do get a specific video
game you can add tags so that it is
found when we were searching for those
tags and we can set a featured image
which basically just as a yeah yeah a
specific image which will show up next
to the excerpt on the front page or
above the post depending on the theme
which is really just an image
outstanding of the rest of the images
which might be attached to a post here
we can do the categories and tags
administration
under media yeah oh because I didn't
publish it it's asking me if I really
want to do that that's okay here we
could see all our photos we uploaded
we're using in our blog and so on under
pages we can create additional pages so
what our page is to begin with we do
have our blog with our posts but that
might not be everything we have on our
website we might happen about a section
we might have a contact page and that is
what we create here here we're creating
static pages which are accessible by the
user additional to our blog posts and
that is if you remember this thing here
add an about page it's just a page if as
if we were to add new and enter about
now we have an about page we could also
have a test page or an any page that the
title is arbitrarily for not arbitrarily
but you wanna choose the title which
describes the page so let's just add an
about page about me as a post we can
save it as a draft we can preview it we
can publish it we can add page
attributes so we could set that it is a
sub page to serve our page and they can
decide the order so for example if you
want this to be the left page in our
navigation we would set it to order 1
and the next page to queue and so on we
can also set a future image so I will
publish this one and now we have an
about page if we go back here you can
see that it's not showing up as of now
that is because we would have to tell
WordPress where it should show up and we
will come back to that later so the
comment section basically just shows all
the comments which were created and to
which posted belong
and here you can mark them as spam
delete them and surrender just you get
an overview what people think about your
posts really that is the end of the
content section to put it that way and
down here we got various configuration
settings various things we can use to
yeah get to page twerk the way we want
so under appearance we could choose our
themes you could customize our theme we
can add widgets and we got this point
here which is important to menus because
as I said if you look at our page we
don't have any place to navigate to our
new about page right we would do this
here so we just add add a new menu let's
put a name it main menu and here we want
to add the about page and yeah let's
throw in this set page as well add to
menu here we have everything configured
we hit save menu and now we have to go
to manage locations and tell the theme
where it should stick that menu and we
have two possible locations we get a
primary menu and a social links menu and
those locations are really specified by
the theme and we're going to do that as
well when we create our own theme so
let's just stick it to the primary menu
save the changes and now if we come back
here we got our menu here where we can
navigate to the about page so that is
how you create and manage menus in
WordPress you can also edit the headers
or something which shows up at the top
of your page and so on you can install
additional plugins you can manage she
was because you might have more users
than just your root user you might have
offers which are able to create posts
but don't have to write to change all
the settings in the backend and so on we
get some additional tools and here are
some general settings about the behavior
for a page and so on so that's really it
for the first video we set up our
WordPress installation cloud9
we had a look at a custom at a standard
theme and you should now be aware or I
have a clue how WordPress works and what
we're gonna do in the next video is get
rid of that theme create our own one and
build it up to be a real cool-looking
modern website so excited to start I
hope you stick with me
does this max see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
