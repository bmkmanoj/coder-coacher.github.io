building a restful service with no js'
serious the last video we added Mongoose
and we connected therefore our MongoDB
database and we worked a lot on the
products related routes in this video I
want to find you an hour setup there a
bit add validation so that only valid
data makes it into our database and also
come back to these restful constraints I
showed you earlier this serious because
right now our responses we give back
from our endpoints here are not really
dead great so let's work on both in this
video
let's start by adding validation now for
that most interesting class is the post
route here where we create new products
and there we store an ID which we
automatically generate so nothing to
validate here this will be unique and so
on but we also store a name and a price
and what happens if a user passes let's
say a string as a price well let's find
out let's go back to postman create a
new post request to products let's work
on the body and the body now needs to
change again should be a normal JSON
object here ray set the name to
something something awesome and then I
set the price to hello which doesn't
look like a correct price if I sent this
and restart my server which I adjusted
so if I sent this I do get back an error
cast number failed for a value hello so
that's great what important lecture we
can already take away we can't store
strings as numbers and so on this is
already something mongoose checks for us
and it correctly throws an error if we
try to do so however what happens if we
don't pass a price but just pass a name
then we still get back a valid response
and if I now get all my products you see
we created a product without a price
that is not how it should work so I'll
go back to my product model and there
where I set the values to string a
number we can also pass an object which
does not mean the type as an object but
now we can provide a more detailed
configuration we can set up a type
property here where we can still set
this to number so now we had the same as
before but we can also pass more
configuration like for example we could
set required to true here and this does
just what it sounds like it makes sure
that this field is required if I now
save this and I try to send that same
post request from before again
I now get an error that path price is
required and this of course makes sense
because well it is required I don't want
to allow this right excess and the same
can be done for the name of course here
I'll now also set is to type string and
require this and if I now send this here
sorry without setting a name so let's
just set some names property which
doesn't exist now this also fails
because price is required and name is
required if I do set a name to something
awesome and if I then do set a price to
something awesome then it succeeds if I
now add a third argument here like sales
price which I set to 999 and I said this
it also succeeds and if we get all
products we see that here know where the
sales price was safe though and that
makes a lot of sense because if you have
a look at our back end just sending the
sales price as an argument to our route
doesn't do anything because here we're
configuring the product we plan on
storing and there we never extract the
sales price we never assign it to a
property in our object which is going to
get stored so we can send which every
day that we want we're just making sure
that the day that we do expect is valid
and this is now the case with the set up
we well set up here now let me quickly
clean up that data here by sending a
couple of delete requests so I'll delete
this product which doesn't have a valid
price and thereafter let me quickly
again grab all products whoops
without that ID which correctly failed
because we just deleted it and let me
also delete one of these something
awesome products here or if you want of
course both so let's delete that
two now that also Rachelle's us some
other issue i want to work on in this
video the response now this is not a
good response in at cert
doesn't fulfill the constrains I
mentioned earlier in this video series
where the responses should be all kind
of self-destructive so what we want to
do is provide better responses let's
start in products file here which is the
only file where we really do something
with the data and there let's take a
closer look I do have my get request
where I get all my Doc's and we can't
improve that because if we send such a
get request we clearly whoops without
the idea again we clearly get back a
response that is interesting to us it
gives us all the IDS and we know that we
can take the ID and appended at the end
of the URL to get data for this object
at but this is not necessarily something
you know when you're a newcomer to this
API so it would be nice if we could also
provide a link here which you could then
programmatically fetch to send another
request to it and maybe we also want to
send some metadata like the amount of
items we fetched so overall I don't just
want to return the docs here as the
response I want to return more I'll get
rid of the console log which I don't
really need anymore
and now I will create my response object
here you can name this whatever you want
and in this object I want if account for
example and I will simply set is equal
to Doc's length so that I give some meta
information about the amount of elements
we fetched thereafter I'll add a
products property which now will be an
array of all the products now there I'm
not interested in this strange
underscore underscore V thing which
seems to be some internal thing so that
is something I don't want to pass along
I can make sure that I don't fetch it by
adding some other method prior to exit
the Select method where I can define
which fields I want to select and you
can pass a string here and there you can
pass name price and underscore ID and
this means I will
fetch these fields and no other field
and this is a great way of controlling
which data you actually want to fetch so
now if I attach Docs here it will be an
array of talks without that strange
underscore D thing and we can see this
if we just save that and send again a
get request to fetch all products now
these are a new structure now we don't
see the count field because I'm not
using my new response constant here I
should return that instead of the docs
so now if I do that again you see now we
got an object with count two products
and then the products and then as I said
would be interesting to also have more
information on the individual product
like the URL that leads us to the detail
information for that product so for that
I'll actually change my Doc's array here
I can use the normal map method for that
to basically map it into a new array
there I'll get my individual document I
fetched and I will return a new version
of it now that new version will use all
the old data and for that we could use
the object spread operator if it is
supported by the node.js version you're
using but you can also map it manually
to say name is doc name and price is
dark price and then underscore ID is doc
underscore ID but then also pass
something like URL which could be a
JavaScript object where we or maybe
request which could be type where we say
okay you can send a get request and this
is just meta information you can write
this in whichever way you want pass
whichever information you want now I
want to pass information about which
kind of requests do you have to send to
which URL to get more information about
this object so here it would be a get
request which you send to given URL that
would be and now it's the URL of our
service here so in my case is HTTP a
localhost but of course you can also
dynamically fetch this to get the ID off
the service you are running on or you
can of course
also hard-code the domain in here which
you're going to use in the end so I'm
going to fetch my address here localhost
3000 to be precise but then you would
have to connect to products
slash and then dark underscore ID
whoops should be dot ID now if I save
this and I send a get request we get
back dead extra information with the URL
I can send a get request you and I can
indeed do this by simply clicking on it
where I get detailed information for
dead given object so this is now how we
should style this and how we should
structure this this is a better response
for getting all the documents and of
course you can find you just totally to
your needs now let's have a look at the
AMA routes if we created a new object
right now I simply return a message
which is okay but maybe not this message
so we could say created object or
created product successfully though that
is kind of a redundant message because
we do have status code 200 one but still
let's keep it then create a product make
sense but I don't just want to paste in
the result here instead because let's
maybe first have a look because if I do
send such a post request here with the
body I have here without the sales price
maybe if I sent this what I get back as
a response is also again with this
strange V thing and so on so what I
could do is I could also simply return a
new object here where may be manually
mapped name to result name price to
result price and ID to result ID but
where I then also and my request object
I used before where I set the type equal
to get and the URL to the same URL as
above to gift user an idea about where
to say
a subsequent request to get detailed
information about that new object the
one difference is of course that here
I'm not accessing doc ID but result ID
so this would now be a better response
for creating products if we have a look
this looks good now we get this type of
response and feel free to continue on
your own of course to practice this we
can do the same for the other routes too
like here when we get data about one
single object
if I do send such a get request here we
also get back that we thing the rest
actually might be fine though you could
also pass some meta information about
where to send a request to get a list of
all objects maybe so that is something
you can change on that get route for a
single object so on this route here for
one I can add select here to say I only
want to name the price and the ID and
then as I just mentioned you can adjust
the response here to not just give back
the product which is your document but
also that request metadata where you say
yeah you could also send a get request
to a URL and that URL which be HDPE
localhost / products to get a list of
all products and of course you could
pass also some description property
where you say get all products so that
it's clearer what you're doing here or
use some identifiers like get all
products that could be more machine
readable I'll remove that but you can
style this and set this up in whichever
way you need it where you want it for
your API it is something you should
always keep in mind though you create
descriptive api's if you plan on using
them publicly if it's only for you you
might not need that but if you want to
create an API that's used by other
people you should be clear about how to
use it and you do that by using it like
this and for that let's also do the same
for patching here we obviously also
update and we then return the result of
that operation which isn't that
meaningful it's just is the strange set
of now
so there I could also just pass nothing
that's also valid or simply pass
something like an object where we have a
message product updated and then again
our request object to know that you can
send a get request queue a URL to get
the details about the new product and
that would be localhost / products / and
then the ID which we fetch from our URL
here so that would be a meaningful
response for patching so let's try this
out - if I want to send a patch request
to this URL and there I do instead
indeed set a meaningful body well let's
do that on the first tab where I already
configured this a bit better so let's
grab some ID here which I want to patch
let's turn this to a patch request and
then remember here the body is array
where we got a couple of objects
describing the operations we want to do
like here we would set the prop name
property - let's say name we want to
change the name of a product and then
the value will be something more useful
if I now send this I get back this
updated response and I can send a get
request to dis of course and fail oh
because I of course should encode the
port into that URL queue so that is
something I also need to do up here
where I return the data for a single
Product ID so this should be the full
domain of course so with that fixed
let's try this again let's again patch
this object here and then simply send a
get request and now we get that data for
this changed object and with that for
deleting we also might do something
comparable here we try to delete this
object and if we succeed I can either
send an empty object or again something
with a message where I say product
deleted and here
I don't need to send in a link to the
product because it was deleted but we
could add our request object here maybe
to show hey you could also send a post
request to some other URL so here would
be HTTP localhost 3,000 products to
create a new product there you will need
to send data and that data then would
simply be in the form of having a name
which is a string and price which is a
number and with that we would give
instructions what the request body
should look like maybe we name this body
therefore so now if we save this and we
delete our object here we get back this
language cells hey you can send a post
request to this URL and if you pass that
payload then you will create a new
product so these are more meaningful
responses and you can as I said
fine-tune them to your needs you might
need different responses obviously I
think we spent enough time on that
now one thing because just as I said I
want to work on it's just application
warning which you also might have seen
and which you may be also asked about
already now this is not a problem you
could ignore it but we also can fix it
by going back to the app.js file and
there when we set up mangu is right when
we connect it there I can also say
Mongoose promise equals global promise
to use the default nodejs promise
implementation instead of the Mongoose
one and with that if you restart the
server you shouldn't get this anymore so
now if you again start sending your
requests and so on it should still work
as before but you shouldn't get this
deprecation warning now feel free to
find you this more to adjust it to your
needs and requirements I'm happy with
the current state and I'd say in the
next video we take a closer look at
further evolving our data structures and
also adding some orders and making sure
that we save these in the database too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
