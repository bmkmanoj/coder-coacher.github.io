power bi project in this video we will
finally work with the cloud solution
power bi service because of that I'm
already on the pricing page because as
you can see right here we have three
different versions available now what's
the difference and what version do we
need well the first thing we can see is
that power bi premium right here is for
large deployments this means in our case
we do not need that so let's focus on to
these two versions now now the first
version the left one is the free version
this includes of course power bi desktop
we work of that already
and also partially kind of includes
power bi service
this means publishing data from power bi
desktop to power B a service is possible
without paying the problem is that
sharing the information that you publish
to power bi service with other people is
not possible and therefore well the free
version is great to play around but if
you really want to use that you will see
that these limitations might be a
problem soon and that's the reason why
power bi Pro is the version we will use
in this project now you can see that
this costs almost 10 dollars per user
per month but the great thing is that
you also get a free trial right here
this is a 60 days free trial by the way
so not just one day or something like
that so for this project you can simply
sign in to power bi Pro we're using this
free trial actually and then play around
with the tool there is only one
important thing that you have to keep in
mind to create such a power bi service
or Pro account you'll need a corporate
or a school or a university email email
domains like Gmail for example won't
work to create a power bi account that's
important but as soon as you got such an
email address you are free to create
such an account and by that use the
sixty days trial of power bi pro now as
soon as you did that and log in to power
bi service then you will see something
that well as part of this project we
will not cover all of the functions of
power bi service actually we will just
focus on to the core functions and these
core functions basically include how can
we now publish our project from power bi
desktop to power bi service and how can
we then share our results so let's do
this right now well the first thing you
can do is we can well we could use that
but I want to go to my workspace first
right here because this is well as the
name says your workspace where you can
see your dashboard you report your
workbooks and your data sets we can skip
the workbooks because that's rather
related to Excel which we won't use
right here but dashboards reports and
data sets that's important and we can
also see these free or these four words
actually right here so you have it right
here and right there just as you prefer
I will work in this interface for the
moment now we know the data set so this
is kind of the data mode let me create
it and we know the report this is kind
of the visuals that we created but what
about these dashboards then well we will
take a look at these dashboards right
now but to create a dashboard and to see
our report we need to be able to get the
information of power bi desktop into
power bi service and for that we have
two options actually the first option
would be to simply go to create right
here and now select data set right there
you can now go to files just get button
and then go to local file and by that
select your power bi desktop project and
then import the data this way one option
you can use this totally fine but I
would like to show you something else
and to do this we can go back to our
workspace actually right here and now
switch back to our power bi desktop
project that we finished in the last
video so our project text you right here
because there are two important things
in probably a desktop now when it comes
to kind of publishing it information to
power bi service if you go to the home
ribbon right here well then you can see
this publish button I'll come back to
that in a few seconds any
also see that sign-in button and that's
kind of connected of course because we
now created our power bi service account
and by that we have log-in data and we
can now also log in right here into
power of your desktop to kind of connect
these accounts and to kind of be able to
well publish the data then now let's
simply press on to publish now
and here we only have to enter our power
bi service login data so here we need
the email address step 1 let's press
sign in now and now we need the password
of course step 2 and in female press
sign in well then you can see if that
our project is immediately published to
power bi service additionally you can
also see that you logged in right here
because well your name is now displayed
right there and now the publishing
process was successful we got it so we
can actually close that right here and
if we now go back to power bi service
then we also see that our data set is
ready so we can close over here now
where do we see our data set now well as
I said you can click right here if you
want to but then well you kind of don't
see a lot of it but if you click right
here into this left column onto your
project data set on here well then you
can see if you click into the skills
column to open it your project and the
different tables actually with the
different columns but we don't see the
report here but this makes sense because
if you look right here in that report
part click onto that then you can see
all the different visuals that we
created locally in power bi desktop
which are now available right there this
is nice but let's go back to that data
set now because as you can see right
here we are in the data set but this
kind of looks like the reports you that
we had in power bi desktop and this
simply means if we click right here into
that pie chart for example and maybe
increase it a little bit and then simply
add the passengers as a value and the
or maybe let's select the weekdays again
and a legend
then you have well not the most
beautiful chart to be honest but you can
see it that we now created a new report
actually and if you don't want to switch
to report for example to the existing
report then you're asked if you want to
save the changes to this report and if
you now press save then you can create
roles it's called it report test maybe
like that and then you can save that
report like this well and with that you
can see that we still have only oops you
can close that if you still have only
one data set of course but you have to
report you have your project taxi report
and the report test now the important
thing is also and this is true for both
reports that you're now in kind of a
reading view but if you change it to the
edit report view then you can also work
on your report so you can simply change
the size or drag it to the left and
maybe create a second bar chart right
here like that and again at the date and
I don't know the distance maybe as a
value like that again not the most
beautiful chart to be honest but the
important thing is that you can now
press save right here that and now you
save that change to the report right
here you can also do this right here by
the way but of course you won't change
your underlying power bi desktop report
if you change something right here so I
won't change that report actually I just
wanted to make sure that you're aware of
that that you can import the data set
that you can then display your report
that you created a power bi desktop and
that you can also create a new report
based on the data set that you created
in power bi desktop so we kind of have a
basic understanding now of the data set
and of the reports but we didn't talk
about the dashboard so far this is
something we should do right now because
let's go to our project tax report right
here and see how we can now create a
dashboard based on the information right
here so before we do that a dashboard is
actually just kind of a cover page so
this kind of includes the core visuals
that you want to show to another
immediately so if you have ten pages in
the report we talked about that about
the report with the different pages then
you might want to pick the best or the
most important visual of each page and
show this in a dashboard if the other
person then wants to dive deeper then
the person can do this by jumping into
the report let me show you how this
works because basically you have two
options how you can create such a
dashboard well the first thing is you
unreported then click on to pin live
page then you can decide if you want to
pin that whole page that's important to
an existing dashboard well we don't have
any dashboards so we can do that or to a
new dashboard so if we now give it a
name let's call that - page maybe and
press appeal life it's interesting so we
can close that but now you can see that
we have a dashboard and if we click onto
that well then we can see that we have
our entire dashboard right here we can
click into the charts and play around
with that that's important but well
normally you won't pin your whole page
normally as a set you want to pin some
specific visuals of the report so let's
go back to our project tax report then
and now maybe pin only our column chart
right here
this one if you select that visual then
you can find that pins in volunteer and
it says pin visual so if you click onto
it then we could add that to our
existing dashboard the one we just
created but we don't want that we want
to create a new dashboard and this could
be - visual then like that for example
if you now press pin right here and yes
we know it's created but then you see
that we have the second - or create it
and if you now click on - - visual well
then you can see our dashboard right
here and if you click onto that then you
jump into the underlying report and
that's also what I wanted to explain to
you a few minutes ago you have the
dashboard with the first cover page that
first important information and if you
want to dive deeper then you can jump
into the report right
there you can play around of course
again so this is interesting but so far
we simply publish the information from
horrible desktop to power bi service and
we then created a new report page and
created a dashboard but what if you want
to share that information now so let's
say you want to share the - visual this
dashboard and the underlying report with
another person how can you do that now
well the answer is really simple because
we only have to go to - visual so the
dashboard that's going to share and then
we can see that share option but here
now if we click onto that well then you
have to make sure that only users with
power bi Pro will have access to this
dashboard and that's what I wanted to
tell you a few minutes ago when we
talked about the pricing and the
different versions you basically need
power bi Pro to really use this sharing
features that's just what it is actually
but if you have another person which is
using power bi Pro then you can now
really easy share the information
because the only thing you have to do
right now have to enter an email address
right here in my case is the gmail
address so if I press enter now then you
can see that sending that or sharing the
dashboard with a person having Gmail is
not possible but again this makes sense
because if only people who have power bi
Pro can access this dashboard then well
these people need a power bi account and
as I told in the beginning to create
such an account you cannot use a gmail
address for example so that's important
I just wanted to show you that again so
you need a person that has power petrol
and buy that valid email address so
let's change it now to an email address
that is not Gmail which I did right now
and now we get another warning the good
thing is that this warning is not a real
problem it's only a hint that you will
share this information now with a person
outside your organization that's
important you can share the information
with people inside your organization of
course but also with other people which
are not part of your organization
however if you share it the person can
access the information and therefore you
should be careful who you share your
information with but we want to share it
now so this is fine so we can now scroll
down and now we can specify if the
person should be allowed to share our
dashboard again no we don't want that
and if the person should receive an
email notification yeah I think this is
totally fine so we can now press share
right here and now we see that our
dashboard has been shared successfully
so let me now check my emails of my
other accounts because obviously I
invited myself with another account
right here to show you this well and
after you share the dashboard the other
person will receive an email with such a
link so if you click onto that link then
the other person gets the information
and sorry this is German right here but
this basically means down there this
means register and this is simply well
sign in so this should be in your
language then so I click on to sign in
of course and after the other person
then signed in into the account then
well we can access the dashboard right
here you can see that we can click into
it of course and by that go to report
and also jump around in the report this
is great but we cannot access the total
data set that's important the only thing
that's available for this other person
and that's also something you have to
keep in mind is of course the underlying
data of the different visuals because if
the other person simply clicks right
here then it can export the data so
that's important this means with that
method you share the dashboard you share
the report and you share the underlying
data of the visuals that you share but
you don't share the entire data set and
that's it actually that's our power bi
project because now you're so kind of an
example workflow how you can use power
bi and how to combine power bi desktop
and power bi service so we had a look at
power bi desktop the local application
to prepare our data to create our data
model and to create our report with the
different visuals we then publish that
results to power bi service
and we're then even able to share our
dashboard and our reports with other
people and with that I hope that you
learned something in the videos that can
help you in your work with power bi and
with that the only thing I can say right
now is as always actually thanks a lot
for watching and hope to see you in the
next videos bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
