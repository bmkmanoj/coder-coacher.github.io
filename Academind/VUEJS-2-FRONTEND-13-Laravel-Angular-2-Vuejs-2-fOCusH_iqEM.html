we are going to hook up our level back
end with angular Q or view chairs as the
front end now in the last video of the
series we finished hooking up our
angular to front end so we were able to
basically create a new quote submit that
and that would then be saved on the
server on the lateral back end so if we
reload here or we don't even need to
reload if you click get quote we should
say we can now load this quote and we
can also edit it and save those changes
to the server as you can see if I reload
and get the quotes again that persists
so this is working with the angle or two
fronting now we finished building this
the goal in this video and the next
video is to build the same with the view
chairs framework serving our front end
here or creating our fondant here so
let's dive into this now in order to
create this beauteous application which
I'm then going to connect to this level
API and as a side note I will later in
this series also cover how you can embed
new chairs on level views using the
place templating engine but not here so
in order to create this project I'll use
the view CLI and you can find the video
where I explain how that works on this
channel the web CC line Styles tools you
can run view in it then the template you
want to use I'll use the web peg simple
templates and then the project name I'm
going to name this view level now I will
hit enter and yes there is a new version
available but that still works and then
I will basically confirm all those
defaults here and with that all set up I
can now see the into this newly created
project run npm install as i'm guided
here and thereafter we can run npm run
def to see our view chairs project
running in the browser so i'll skip
forward to this step so all the
dependencies were successfully installed
I can now run NPM run death to start
debug process and this little
development server which automatically
spins up this new tab this is now the
startup project or the starter page
which was created and I'll now open it
in my editor webstorm here it is and of
course you can use any apparatus or you
can use sublime atom which'll studio
code whatever you like so I opened it
here in webstore
now we can start editing this
application - well give it the same
functionality we implemented an angular
2 in the last lectures so where should
we start
well I'd say let's start with adding the
feature of being able to add quotes to
this app that would be amazing because
that would be the first step
fetching them is not the best first step
because what would we fetch so in order
to add this we of course need some
components in this application some
additional pages and I also want to use
routing to go to this new closed page
and then the quotes page which will list
all the quotes so let's start by
creating those components now here I
will create a components directory in my
view project in any components directory
I will create two new components for now
that is the quotes dot view file which
will hold well all my quotes and then
the new quote dot view file and I will
later also add another file but I'll
come back to this so with that I also
want to have some styling and I will
simply download bootstrap to get some
nice styling so I'm get booted up comm
under download bootstrap I would quickly
all only grab this link here de CSS code
simply grab this and go back to the
project queue well just dump it into my
index.html file and welcome there I can
also change the title to let's say view
plus level course that's purely optional
and I also want to clean up this app dot
view file here I will already get rid of
all the steps in this template here this
unread list all this starter stuff will
get rid of the content in the object I'm
returning the data method here will get
rid of the name here I don't need that
and of all the styles set up here
they aren't needed queue so with that I
cleaned up this file we can now start
working on the new quote W file in this
view file R of course need a template
section where I want to set up well the
template for this component and here I
will simply add a form without an action
though because we're going to handle
this
through view chess and will not let it
submit a new request or sending you
request to the server instead we want to
do this behind the scenes through UJS
here I will then add a couple of things
or well one thing I guess
and you did with a class of form group
that's a CSS class implemented by
bootstrap or made available by bootstrap
which you will simply give two semis
styling and then there I'm going to have
a label for the content of the quote and
this will also receive or will receive
this text of content in between and
thereafter I of course need a input
which allows me to enter the actual
quote so here we will have type text
then this will be the ID content because
this is what this label is referring to
and then I will add a class of form
control and now this is important
v-model this is a v-model directive
which will set up two-way binding in
view chess and which will allow me to
get the input the user enters here so I
will quickly distribute this over
multiple lines so that it's easier to
read and now the model has to be bound
to some data property defined in the
view instance responsible for this
template so before filling this with
some life let's add this instance in the
script section here of course and in
this script section here I simply want
to export as a default JavaScript object
this will be the view instance
responsible for this template and in
there I'll have the data method which of
course needs to return an object as you
always have to do this in components in
the view instance behind a component and
this data object here just object that
returning the data method I should say
cannot hold all the properties I can
access in my template so here I will
simply set up the quote content property
this name is of course totally up to you
and I'll set it to an empty string by
default I can now bind this to quote
content here this is the model so that I
have this connection between the data in
my view instance and the data and
template or the data the user will enter
into this input so with this the fourth
is almost finished I will now add a
button with a class of button and then
button primaries and bootstrap classes
to give it a nice
to look and then add the e type submit'
to make this button actually submit the
form and of course I should give it a
label of submit so with this the form
can be submitted I of course also need
to catch that submit event so on the
form element here I'll add add submit
and add prevent so that it doesn't send
a request doesn't use its default stuff
instead here I want to simply execute
the on submitted methods you can of
course choose any method name you want
here and I will add this here in my view
instance under methods which is a
JavaScript object of course and here I
will set up the on submitted method like
this so this will get executed whenever
this submit button here is pressed so
whenever this form is submitted this is
therefore the part where I want to reach
out to well my back and to level and
send that quote content we have here now
we could also add some validation here
I'm not going to do it here I didn't do
it on the angular two examples you you
can of course try to add some validation
for view chess as a side note validation
is not paid into the framework but there
are great third-party packages available
like we validate which you might have a
look at if you need for validation I
actually might create a video about this
tool now that I think about it anyways
so now we can submit it the next part is
to be able to send an HTTP request with
our quote data to our lateral back-end
so that we can actually store the data
in the database there so let's work on
this next now submitting HTTP requests
in a mutase instance is actually not
baked into view chairs there is no HTTP
service as it is the case for angular 2
therefore we can add any HTTP service
any HTTP or HX third party package we
want now choices would be a view
resource which used to be an officially
supported package but isn't anymore but
it's still a great package to add or
it's very popular to axials which is not
related to view chairs in any way but
again you can drop in any wealth HX
package you want to use so I'll use a
Axios here I hope I did pronounces
correctly
Axios whatever and we'll find the
instruction on how to add it on the
official github page which you can
simply find by googling for access so
here npm install' x you'll see four
steps let's quickly do this I'll open up
the terminal and on NPM install
Axios with the say flag to also create
an entry in the package to JSON file and
now that it was installed here on my
well on that project I can start using
it and on this get up page you can also
find the code we need to run Axius post
now of course we need to get access so I
need to add an import here in the new
code component simply name it access
from Axios from this package this name
your so the up to you it will simply
import all the content from this package
and then on submitted I can therefore
then run Axios post and here we need to
insert the URL and that URL is the same
URL s and the angular huge section in
the angular 2 lecture it's HTTP and then
the well or generally to pop to your
lateral back-end whatever just runs on
your local machine might be localhost
whatever address something like this I
assigned an alias so therefore for me
it's level ng choose - view dot death
and then slash API slash quote is the
path we set up on our back end where we
should send the quotes you
the second argument for the post method
then if the actual data we want to send
self the posterior so this should
actually be a JavaScript object where we
have a Content property which is our
quote content here and I'll simply wrap
this into a new line so that it is
easier to read or to see so let's the
second argument to the post method again
this follows the same structure we used
in the angular 2 lecture source videos
in this series and this of course
follows the structure we impose from our
back end or by our back end what we
expect data to arrive in this format to
have a content property which then holds
the actual content and if you're not
sure about us
definitely go back
the videos in this series where we set
up the back and where does it show so
with this we're sending the data we're
sending this post request now we can
also chain of n method because access
will actually give us back a promise to
listen to any response you might get and
let's simply lock that response to the
console I'll also react to any error we
might get so I'll add a catch method
where I could receive an error which I
will then also log to the console just
to be able to debug this so with all
this out of the way I should restart or
rerun my process here NPM run dev and we
won't see anything to be honest because
well I cleared my apt of view file I
added my new component but we're not
using this component so let's use it for
this I will go to my apt of view file
and I will add it as a local component
you could of course also setup globally
in your project here again I'll use a
local one so I will import this
component I'll name it new quote from
top flash components new quote dot view
file add this import and then in my view
instance here are at the components
property which allows me to register
local components and here you set up any
selector you want to use like app new
quote for example and then assign new
quote as a value to the selector and
this now allows us to use this F new
quote selector in our application so if
we now save this and we have a look at
this application this now looks better
we do have this new quote input it does
look a bit ugly though is of course is
because well we have nothing else but
this element here right so let's use a
little bit of bootstrap styling let's
actually add a container here let's then
add a row class add a fourth class row
and then we call excess 12th column here
to place our quote our quote component
new quote component inside of that now
this should look much nicer we're also
going to add routing no worries
in the next video in this series we're
not going to see that this works so now
if I reload this this looks better we
now have it a little bit more centered
and not spanning the full width here so
I'll now open up the console to see any
potential errors and then I'll send a
new quote out I'll try to send it at
least let's see if it works it looks
pretty good we get back an object but we
have status text created status 201
looks promising now let's also have a
look at our database our back-end
database on our well back-end server if
this was indeed stored in a database I
did load my database here of sequel pro
a nice tool to look into a my sequel
database and there in the quotes table
we see a new quote the first quote here
is the one created through angular 2 but
this is the quote created review chair
so now we have both clients being able
to work with that and actually let me
start the angular 2 project we created
I'm doing this on an outer screen so
that I'm able to have a look at my
running angular 2 app here at localhost
4200 once this stops finishes building
the project now if we click get quotes
we should also get the quote we created
in our review app and we do here the
second quote so this was working great
we are able to create quotes in our view
chess client it was super simple to
setup since we did most of the heavy
lifting in the previous videos and abled
cores and so on so this was really easy
to do the next step in the next video is
to add routing to also have a page with
all quotes and to enable ourselves to
well fetch quotes and review app two so
that we don't constantly have to do this
in really angular 2 application we'll
work on this in the next video in this
series
see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
