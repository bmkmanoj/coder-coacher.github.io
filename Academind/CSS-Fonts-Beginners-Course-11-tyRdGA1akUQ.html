this video we will talk about fonts now
what does this mean well we will talk
about font sizes so specifically the m
and r m units what these are how we can
use them and we will learn how we can
import font families to our code and by
that to our website so let's start right
now
so back on our website and before we
start I would like to change one thing
because if we increase the size right
here you can see that the image the
maximum width of the image is limited
right here this is due to the max width
property this one right here that we
added in the last video when we talked
about box sizing
well I actually only wanted to show you
how max width works but we don't need it
on our website
therefore we should delete that now and
save the code and go back and we loaded
and with that we can see that our image
now again uses the entire width
available right here so this was one
thing that I wanted to change and there
are two things that I would like to make
clear before we start because as I said
in the introduction we will focus onto
the font sizing with the M and M units
in this video of course we have more
units available how we can change the
font size on our websites
this can be absolute units like pixels
or points or also other scalable units
like percentages but as I said we'll
focus on 2m and REM mainly in this video
and talking about m and r m mmm cannot
only be applied to the font size
actually you could also apply them to
the padding for example but in this
video we'll only focus onto the font
sizing property so now that we clarified
that let's think about the most
important question what is a medium and
especially why do we need it or why
could we need it well the thing is that
the way we use our websites changed a
lot in the last year's we have a lot of
different devices we have smartphones we
have laptops and we have large screens
so the key word nowadays is a responsive
design so basically we want to make sure
that our website looks good on all
devices and this must of course be true
for the general look of the website
we'll talk about media queries in the
next video also something that we need
to make our site well responsive but
this is also important for the font size
because imagine that you define a fixed
font size which is equal
on all devices then this might look good
on big screens and might be really good
readable but on smaller devices this
might be really tiny and you can hardly
read a thing therefore we need to make
sure that our text is readable on all
devices and M and RAM are units
scalable units which allow you to do
that now how does this work and do we
have m and r m right here actually and
the answer is actually yes because if we
look at the website right here you can
see that the font size for actually most
of the text we have is equal but Mike's
world up here is bigger than the other
elements or than the text of the other
elements now what's the reason for that
well if we look right here and open it
and click on to the h1 class then we can
see that our browser applies a font size
of 2m to this h1 element and with that
the browser simply specifies that the
font size of this h1 element should be 2
times the font size of the parent
element now this might be confusing
right now so let's have a look at the
code and see how this works
let's go to the index.html file and
right here we have it here we have the
h1 element Mike's world as we know our
browser applies a font size of 2 m to
this class so 2 times the size of the
parent element the parent element of
this h1 element is here d header now if
this size is 2 times the size of the
header what's the size of the header
actually let's have a look let's go back
and let's select it right here and if we
scroll up right here we can see that no
font size is defined for this header
element but I just said that the size of
our child is 2 times the size of the
header element and apparently we can
calculate the size right here so how
does this work well the answer is if we
do not define a font size for this
element right here or in general for the
elements on our website the default font
size of the browser is
applied and the default font size of our
browser with the default settings
normally is 16 pixels and because of
that as we know that this header right
here does never force as applied we use
the default browser settings so we know
that this header has a size of 16 pixels
well and as our h1 element is 2 times
the size of our header element well we
know that our h1 element right here has
32 pixels so that's the first thing you
should keep in mind using M for the font
size simply means that font size of the
element you apply em to depends on the
font size of the parent element and if
you didn't specify a font size for this
parent element or for the font size in
general on your website then the font
size simply is defined by the browser
and the default browser font size is 16
pixels that's really important now let's
dive a little bit deeper and let's see
what else we can do right here because
maybe we want to change the size of
Mike's road here to do that let's go
back to our code and 2d CSS file and let
me add one thing right here to our HTML
selector and this is font size 100% and
don't worries as I said in the beginning
will only work with M and REM in this
video it's just nicer to add this font
size 100% to the HTML element or to the
HTML selector right here because with
that it becomes immediately clear for
anybody that we simply use the default
size of the browser as the general font
size for our HTML element and by that
for our website if we save that you can
of course see that this doesn't change a
thing now back to our code and now let's
change some things so I'm again here in
the header and we learned that the page
title right here so this is the class of
the h1 element we saw that this has a
font
size of 2m we saw that this was
interpreted like that by the browser and
we should make sure that it's not our
browser who interprets that but that
it's us who is defining this so let's go
back and let's reload the page as you
can see nothing changed but now we can
see our font size to M right here
because now we defined it so let's go
back and let's now add the font size
right there you remember the fixed bar
class this is basically the class of the
header element this is the parent of
page title right here now what happens
if I add font size to M also to this
element let's see let's save it let's go
back now we see that the size of Mike's
world doubled why is this happening well
think about what I just said about M I
just said that the font size of an
element that has the immunity applied
depends on the font size of the parent
element and what we did now is we simply
said that the page title should be two
times so two m the font size of the fix
bar class of the parent element but this
fixed bar also has a parent element of
course and if we look at in XHTML right
here we can see that the fixed bar has
the body as the parent element well and
the body has the HTML element as the
parent element and as we said the font
size of the HTML element to 100% and as
we also know that the default font size
defined by the browser is 16 pixels well
what we can simply see right here is
that we have 16 pixels for HTML in
general we have also 16 pixels for the
body element but now we have 2 times the
size of the body element for our header
element with the class fixed bar
so 42 pixels well and for the h1 element
right here with the class page title
we have two times the size of the parent
which is 32 pixels and because of that
we now have 64 pixels for our h1 element
right here and it's really important to
understand this behavior because this
can be helpful if you want to make sure
that the font size depends on a specific
parent then it's totally fine but this
can also lead to unsatisfying results
like we have it right here but we can
see that Mike's world is well generally
a little bit too big but there is
another unit that we can use to easily
change that because I said that we have
M which means that the font size depends
on the phones as off the parent but
there is also REM and REM stands for
root and the root element is the HTML
element and maybe you can imagine what
happens now if I change m to REM for our
h1 element so for the class page title
right here if I go to this style file
right there and now simply add to rem as
you can see it like that and save that
well what do you think will happen I
just said that the size will now depend
on the root element so on the HTML
element right here now if we go back to
our page and reload it well you can see
that Mike's wrote now is the size that
it had in the beginning no bias is
happening well because the HTML element
has a font size of 100% so 16 pixels in
our case and the font size of the page
title class right here now simply is two
times the font size of the root element
this means if I change this to one Ram
and this right here to 200% save that go
back and reload the page then this
doesn't have any effect on to Mike's
world because now we doubled the size of
the HTML element the font size of the
HTML element but we reduce the font size
of the h1 element by 50% so we
the same thing right here but for all
the other elements you can now see that
the size doubled because as I said
before we didn't define a font size for
the remaining elements and therefore the
font size of these elements depends on
the size defined for the HTML element so
let's go back to the code and change it
back to 100% right here and for our
website actually I think it's fine to
use REM because we don't need em right
here as I said M can be really useful if
you want to have some specific font
sizing depending on the parent but for
our website we can actually use the font
size of one REM for our text as I would
say so right here for the navigation
items right there and also for our trip
text and for the feedback and for the
text down here so if we save that and go
back to our page everything looks like
that now maybe should go back and
increase the page title two to REM
things look better this didn't look bad
in the beginning so let's reload that
yes I think this is fine there is one
more thing that we could add to make
sure that our text is also display
correctly on all the browsers which
might not support em and REM correctly
and this can simply be done by adding
font size let's say 16 pixels right here
before the actual REM definition as I
said this can be helpful for all the
browser's where mrm cannot be displayed
correctly so we have it right here and
right there and right there like that so
if we save that and reload the page well
I still think it looks quite good
actually we don't have any big issues
and I'm quite happy with the font size
that we have
what we didn't talk about so far is what
is now the advantage of using ramen our
case and not the pixels that we
implemented as a fallback well the
answer is that by using the structure we
have right here we can simply change the
font size of all the elements by simply
changing the font size of our root
element so of the HTML element and by
adjusting the RAM units of specific
elements on our page we will do that in
a few seconds we can make sure that the
relation between the different elements
on our website and the root element
always is the same additionally this
structure also allows us to make sure
that the page is displayed correctly if
the user is not using the standard font
size in the browser because if you use a
bigger font for example this will of
course increase the font size displayed
on the website or the way the fonts are
displayed on our website but it will
again maintain the relation or the scale
between the different elements and the
root element the HTML element so that's
why using a structure like that is a
really big improvement when it comes to
responsive web design however as I said
we want to see that in action or a
practical example and one example could
be the way the home and contact elements
are displayed right here because I think
they are not correctly sized so we
should change that in our code so let's
go back to the code and increased it to
1.5 Ram maybe and let's see what that
looks like
yeah looks better from a font size
perspective maybe a little bit too big
let's maybe make 1.3 Ram right here
let's see and this does look better from
the font size perspective but we should
change that which may be to let's say
20% we talked about box sizing in the
last video so I'll not talk about the
details regarding that right now and if
we save that and go back we can see that
the boxes look fine but we have the
problem that contact well is not
displayed correctly and that's simply
due to the fact that we don't need that
navigation a selector anymore right here
so let's save that and by the way that's
the selector that was referring to that
anchor tag in here but as we defined the
text-decoration:none and the color for
this anchor tag right there you can also
get rid of that background color red by
the way well if we save that and go back
and we load the page then this looks
wrong oh sorry I forgot to delete the
comma right here so let's save it again
and let's go back and let's go to the
page
yeah and I think now it looks better and
that's actually the basic concept behind
M and REM and before we finish this
video there is one more thing that I
would like to show you because at the
moment we are using the default phone
family on our website and although this
look might be quite okay I think we
should choose another font family for
that and the great thing is that we can
do that really easily by just googling
for google fonts right here and if you
now click onto that link you can see a
lot of different font families you can
choose from for our website I choose a
specific font I choose Barlow can see it
you can search for the font families up
here and I'll simply use that standard
style we have right here so this regular
400 style and if you now click onto the
plus right here and then right here in
the lower part of the screen then you
can actually exactly see how you can
embed the font family to your website
the first thing is you need to copy that
link right here let's go back to the
code and of course add that link up here
in the head element of our index.html
file right there so that was step one
now back to the page and now we can see
that we simply have to use the following
CSS rules to specify the family so we
simply copy that part right here go back
and now go to our style file and add it
up here maybe in the second position in
our HTML selector important this is the
font family that we applied support
and this is the fallback so in case
Barlow cannot be loaded cannot be
displayed now if we save that and go
back to our page right here and reload
it you can now see that we easily
applied that new font family to our
website if you like it or not that's
your choice the important thing is that
after this video you now know how to
make your font size more responsive with
M and RAM and you also know how you can
easily import font families from google
fonts and with that the only thing i can
say right now is thanks a lot for
watching hope to see you in the next
video and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
