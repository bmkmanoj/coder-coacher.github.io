on board in this video we'll add a
navigation bar to our page so that we
can get started building a real page and
what better way to get started than by
adding a responsive navigation bar of
course using bootstrap for
so I'm back in the project as I left it
at the end of the last video and there
we just played around with the grid
so therefore what I can do here is I can
get rid of all these style assignments
in the head section and actually get rid
of the entire body content because that
was just the dummy grid I'll now also
add a main dot CSS file which I'll used
to store my CSS code for the future and
I'll import it with a link element in
the index.html file pointing to main dot
CSS okay so this is how I wanna work
with CSS now I don't actually to write
that much CSS code though in this video
my goal is to add a navbar now since we
cleaned up that body content our web
page if we reload it essentially looks
like this so let's add a navigation bar
now by adding a nav element now this is
the default HTML nav element and here's
one important thing just as in all the
other cases bootstrap pretty much only
works with CSS classes it doesn't
automatically turn this into a nicely
styled bootstrap navigation bar because
there might be cases where you want to
use that element without getting the
bootstrap navigation bar hence to turn
this into your navigation bar controlled
and start by bootstrap I have to add a
class the navbar class like this now if
we save that and we reload the page we
still don't really see that much do we
well the reason for this is of course we
need to add some content so inside of
that navbar why don't we add an anchor
tag which leads nowhere in our case well
we have our brand let's say so in my
case a catamite and this could also be
an image now I will give this anchor tag
a special class and that class should be
navbar - brand which will make sure that
this is stalled and positioned in a nice
way in the top left corner of the
navigation bar which is where you
typically have your clickable brand
which leads you back to your home page
on most pages if we add this and we
reload
we see that brand here but I don't
really see a navigation bar do you well
we need to add more classes to the nav
element there we should also add nav bar
light to set the theme and BG alight for
the background theme if we add that and
we reload now the Sun we got a nice grey
nav bar spanning the full width of the
page and you see the brand style all the
was adjusted it's still clickable but it
looks less like a link which is of
course what we want so this is now our
better-looking nav bar now you want to
have more than just a brand in the nav
bar you want to have some clickable
items so for dad what we can do is we
can add an unordered list in that nav
bar and give that unordered list a class
of nav bar - Neff to indicate that this
holds our actual menu items there we can
add a menu item by adding a list item of
course with a link inside of it
maybe our users page and that list item
and turn also receives a class didn't
have - item class now we can also give
that link a class and that will be the
nav link class so this is the structure
we typically set up for navigation items
or for menu items in the navigation bar
we have the nav bar nav wrapper around
all the list items then the individual
list item and in that list item we
typically got a link which then also
should get in F link class here now if
we do that and we save this if we reload
the page we can see the link here nicely
positioned on the right side of the
navigation bar so this is automatically
done for you by bootstrap now you can
change the positioning by going to that
unordered list with the class Neff porn
F and adding M R Auto margin-right:auto
if you do that it'll actually be
positioned on the Left instead of on the
right since bootstrap uses flexbox this
automatically leads to that position
we can inspect this if we have a look at
this unordered list you see that with
margin right set to auto it actually
fills up all the entire space with this
wealth margin to the right and hence
this unordered list with all its list
items is pushed all the way to the left
if you remove that rule which you do by
removing mmm our auto it actually is
positioned across the entire navbar
because dad on the other hand is just
how the navbar works it uses display
flex and then it also positions its
elements with space between so mr Auto
is a nice way of moving the elements to
the left if you want that I will remove
that though because I don't want that
behavior I want to have this space in
between and with that let's dive deeper
let's add more or less items for example
we can add a second list item which
could be products something like that if
we now say if this hmm
this actually adds a new line instead of
adding this next to the our list item
now why is that the response can be
found if we inspect the unordered list
with the navbar nav class there we see
that the Flex Direction is actually set
to call him instead of Road now this is
not a balk this is on purpose because
bootstrap four is built in a
mobile-first way now because of that
mobile-first approach we can also build
our navigation bar in a mobile-first way
we do that by adding a div with the
class collapse nav bar - collapse and
this route if will actually wrap this
unordered list now with that if we save
dad and we reload this is gone we don't
see the nav items anymore this is
because we now need to tell bootstrap
how long or from which point on we
actually want to render our menu items
in the nav bar instead of in a toggle
drop-down menu so to say we do this by
adding a nav bar - expand class to the
nav element and then you set a break
point of finding from which
point on shoot elements be added to the
navbar this could be LG to only add them
on big screens for example with that if
you reload if you increase the size you
add them on bigger screens and now you
see they are also added on the left here
instead of on the right now this just
happens to be the default you can go to
nap or Neph and where we used em our
audio previously to push it to the to
the left we can now use ml order to add
some margin to the left automatically to
the list items to move them back to the
right if we want a dead behavior so I
will go back to the very default though
so that you can also recognize this code
in the official documentation if you
look it up there and so now we're back
to a navigation bar where items are
removed once we go below a certain size
and of course we can change that
breakpoint we could set it to SM for
example and now the menu items will be
there much longer
they will only disappear on small
devices now the question of course is
how do we bring them back for small
devices then they disappear because
maybe we're running out of space in the
navigation bar but where do we then
display them well in some extra menu
which can be toggled the problem chest
is we got no toggle button well we can
add this to with the nav bar boots Tripp
offers us to add such a toggle button we
can add it here after the friend
you could also in front of it add a
button and give it a class of navbar
toggler because that is what this button
will do in the end now on this button
you don't write anything but in there
you simply add a span which in turn
should get a class of navbar toggler
icon this will give you the hamburger
menu in the end now if we save that and
we reload now we get that toggle button
here and for bigger screens if we
increase that this will be removed and
we get the menu items instead that's
cool but clicking a button doesn't do
anything this has two reasons the first
reason is that we need to add something
to that button to make it work and that
is the data
- toggle property or attribute I should
say which we set to collapse now this
will be used by bootstraps JavaScript
package it will automatically listen to
clicks on a button then and it will open
the menu for us and close it if it's
open all of that done automatically the
problem is even with that change if we
reload nothing happens the reason for
that is very simple though we haven't
included the bootstrap script packages
so let's head over to get bootstrap comm
and click on get started and previously
I only fetch the CSS portion let's now
also fetch these free scripts that
includes jQuery yeah bootstrap still
uses jQuery on which it builds up
however in a very slim version so it's
probably fine for that and now we're a
helper library and the bootstrap
JavaScript code itself which in the end
will do that click listening I was
talking about we can put that code at
the end of our body section to load it
last and with that if we now reload the
page we can click that button and still
don't see anything well there's one more
missing piece we added that data toggle
which is great this will actually lead
to a listener being set up but we also
need to define a data - target attribute
which points at the element the menu we
want a toggle because there is something
you can configure there you choose a CSS
selector recommended is using an ID for
example the nav bar menu the name is
totally up to you the important thing is
you now just need to assign this as an
ID to your collapsible menu and with
that I'm referring to that diff which
wraps the menu so this div now receives
an ID which has to fit that data target
you to find up here navbar menu in my
case here and with that added we can
save this and now if we reload the page
we can indeed toggle our menu here this
is how we can add a very basic navbar
now below the video you'll find a link
to the official talks where you can dive
much deeper and also learn how you
can include a search bar into your naff
and so on one thing that I want to show
you right away is how you can set
different schemes color schemes for this
navbar right now we're using the light
scheme here with nav bar light and BG
light and we can change this for example
to navbar whip-snap bar dark and BG dark
if we do that we got a dark navbar and
you see the text and the menu button
automatically adjusts so this is pretty
cool and this allows you to quickly add
a navigation bar with basic features to
your page now I hope that these basic
explanations were helpful especially
regarding the responsiveness and how you
can move menu items around position them
to the right to the left
definitely dive into the official Docs
if you want to learn more about it and
hopefully see you in a future video tube
