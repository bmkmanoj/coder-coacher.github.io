the excel youtube channel insights video
series now in this video we will build
the base for our upcoming analysis of
this YouTube channel so let's have a
look at what kind of data we actually
have how we can import those data into a
new Excel workbook and why we need an
input summary sheet let's start so this
is our starting point we have a more or
less empty folder the only thing that's
in here are some source files let's
first have a look at those source files
and then we can start building the
workbook so I'm opening the source files
folder now in this folder we can see
that we have free CSV files these files
contain the YouTube statistics that we
want to analyze and we have another file
named country codes txt we will have a
look at that country code txt file in a
few seconds let's first focus on the CSV
files if you look at the name of those
files you see that we cover the period
from january 2016 until februari 2017 in
total let's now open one of the files to
see what kind of statistics we actually
have some opening the January file now
and you see that we have in the first
two columns the country name and the
country ID so this is basically where
you're coming from and in the following
columns we have the statistics like
watch time in minutes views likes and so
on now let's focus on that country ID
Madine we just saw a file named country
codes text so we might connect this
column with the country code text files
let's have a look at that so I'm not
opening the country code text file and
in the first column we see that CC so
that's basically the regional or the
continent code of that country in the
second column we have the a to code and
this is the country code and this is
equal to the code that we saw in the CSV
files so we might remember that when we
imported a turn and it might make sense
to only import the first two columns but
we will see how we can do that so as we
now understood the input files and by
the way all these
see files has the same structure so the
only difference is related periodic
cover we can now go back to the YouTube
folder and start building our workbook
so in the YouTube folder I'm pressing
the right mouse key new and Excel
worksheet now let's name that may be
YouTube statistics that's it and now
open the new file and of course we don't
have any data in here so far OneNote
maybe before we start I'm using the
latest version of Microsoft Excel for
this analysis if you use an older
version of Microsoft Excel this is not a
problem because all functions and
formulas we will use are also covered by
the older versions of Microsoft Excel so
now we want to import the data and
before we import the data let's think
about the amount of data we actually
have we saw that we have four input size
so it might make sense to create for new
sheets in this workbook and we can
create a new sheet by simply pressing
that little plus symbol down here so one
two three this is it so we will import
our data into those four worksheets and
I'm now selecting the first worksheet
and now we can start importing the data
i will use the Excel integrated data
import function why am I using this well
we saw that we have CSV and txt files
and that those files are really good
structured so this function is really
appropriate for situations like that of
course we have other ways on how we can
import data into excel but we will not
use them right now so to find the data
import function we have to go to the
data ribbon which sounds appropriate and
in the left area we find the get
external data button if we press that
button once then we see that we have
several options on where we can import
data from in our case we will use the
from text import function so after
pressing from text I now have to select
the folder where the source files are
located in my case this is the desktop
youtube
and the South Side's folder now I will
select the first you see file and the
first I mean the one from January to
June 2016 so I click the file and press
import now the text import wizard opens
well what is the text important result
the text import wizard basically helps
Excel to understand the structure of
your input data and helps you to define
how your data should be imported into
your Excel workbook so the first thing
you have to decide is whether you have
the limited data or data with a fixed
width group now you might be confused
what kind of data you have so the
easiest way to find out what data you
have is the preview of file you can see
down here and if we look into our data
we see that we have the country name a
comma the country ID economy and so on
so the delimited function is best used
if you have characters such as Commerce
which is true in our case or tabs to
separate each field as this is true in
our case we will use that function if
you would have a fixed width well this
would be applied if you could simply
draw a vertical line right here between
each of the items you have in your
columns so this is not the case at the
moment so we will stick to the limited
function the second thing you have to
decide is what you want to start
importing your data in our case we would
start importing in Row one because this
is where we have our header the final
region is automatically set by Excel so
no need to change that and the last
thing we have to decide is whether our
data has headers in our case and we saw
it in the preview before we have headers
so we can take that box right here now
we are finished with that step so we can
click Next and now we have to select the
delimiter at the moment the taps
delimiter is selected which doesn't help
a lot as we can see in the preview down
here so we need to unselect the tab and
select the comma as a delimiter as we
learned in the previous step because
that's our delimiter that we have in the
input data and we can immediately see
that now our data are formatted
correctly which means that we don't need
the first step remember we are in step 2
a free gnome
we can already press finish at the
moment so I'll press finish now and the
only thing we have to decide now is
where we want to import the data tool in
our case we will use the existing
worksheet then cell a1 which is the one
selected right here so this is fine this
means we can press ok and the data are
immediately imported into our new Excel
workbook one important note may be at
the moment we imported the data
hard-coded this means we don't have any
link to the input data that we
originally had so we are almost done
right here the only thing we should do
is we should rename the sheet according
to the data it contains and as we
learned that all the data in the CC
files more or less cover the same
statistics but they are different in
terms of the period together it might
make sense to name the cheat according
to the period it covers so I simply go
down to the sheet name here double click
it and write January to June 16 so
that's a sheet name of the first sheet
now that you're done with that I will
import the remaining two sheets for the
remaining two periods and then we will
have a look at the import of the country
code text file so see you in a few
seconds now we import it the YouTube
statistics and we can now go to the
country codes text file we will again
use the data import function so we go to
the data ribbon get external data from
text again so everything like we did it
before select the country code text file
press import keep the delimiter or the
file type s the limited better set the
data has headers which we can see right
here now press next and now we see in
the data preview that the data are
already organized correctly and this is
simply the case because these days now
and this is what we saw when we had to
look at the input files before have a
tab as delimiter and as Excel
automatically sets the tab as the
limiter this is the reason why this is
already correct so now we could of
course press finish again but you won't
do that here and why won't we do that
well when you look at the day
we saw that we only need the first two
columns actually for all our analysis so
why should we import five columns if you
only need two and the good thing is we
can select the columns that we want to
import in the text import wizard so if
you click Next and go to step 3 we see
in that column data format the last
option do not import column skip this is
what we want to do so let's select the
three columns that we want to skip and
this is Callum free and now I press
shift and click the left mouse button to
select all the free columns that we
don't want to import and now we click on
do not import and Excel immediately sets
the welder description of the column to
skip column so this is it now we only
import the first two columns and can
click finish right here this is the same
logic as before we want to import the
data to the existing worksheet this is
okay and here we are we now import it
only the first two columns as we wanted
it to be so this sheet is also almost
finished the only thing we have to do is
we have to rename the sheet let's double
click it and call it countries so this
is it now we imported all our data into
the new Excel workbook now we can start
with that input summary sheet and now
you might wonder why do we need an input
summary sheet and how do we build that
let's have a look at that first now that
we imported all of our data into the
Excel workbook we could simply start
with the analysis part this means we
could start working with the data with
some tables and prepare our data for the
final output charts and we could do that
with direct links so this means read
directly linked the analysis part to the
input sheet so if we need data from the
sheet from January to June 2016 we
simply retrieve data with a direct link
to a cell in the corresponding she'd
well there is nothing wrong about that
and you could do that but there is also
another way on how you can work with
input data like that and how you can
connect those data to your analysis part
of your workbook and this is how we are
going to do it
we will put the input summary sheet
between the analysis part and the input
sheets which are supported and we will
do that with dynamic sheet references to
the source files now why are we doing
this well the main advantage is that we
have to put some work into that input
summary sheet of course first but as
soon as the structure works we can
easily change the data so we can delete
periods we can add periods and we can
link all those sheets so this means you
can link analysis sheet to the input
summary sheet and the input summary
sheet 3 input sheets dynamically so we
don't have to write any new formulas we
only need to copy existing tables and
change or she'd reference and this is
really nice and this is why we will
build that input summary sheet now now
that you talked about the wife you might
wonder how we can build that input
summary sheet let's have a look at that
so the first thing we need for the input
summary sheet are the row names so in
our case those other countries and this
is a little bit more complex because we
have three different periods and we need
all the countries we have data for of
course but without any dublicate so it
might be that we have countries like the
United States where we have data foreign
oil free periods and we might have
countries which you only have data for
in one of the free periods for instance
so we need to make sure to include all
of the countries we have without any wks
as soon as you got the wrong names we
need to define column names so our
statistics actually this is more easy
because as we saw all three CSV files
has the same color names so they should
not be a problem as soon as we get the
row names and the column names we will
need a dynamic formula which allows us
to retrieve the results based on those
two items so the country and statistic
that we want as soon as we got the
formula we want to add one more thing
and this one more thing is the sheet
reference as an input cell now what does
that mean we simply want to be able to
define the sheet name and in our case
this is the period that we want which
will then define the source file brother
results will be retrieved from
so in total we want to be able to define
the country the statistic and the period
the data should be retrieved from as
soon as we build a table we will copy
the table once and twice because we have
three periods so we need three tables
after we copy the tables we simply have
to adjust the sheet reference to July to
December 16 for the second table and to
generate two februari 17 for a third
table and then we are done with our
input summary sheet now as you can see
some work ahead of us so let's start
with the row names and the column names
in this video series so as we want to
create an input summary sheet we need to
create a new sheet and I simply press
the plus again click and hold the left
mouse button to drag the cheat to the
left of the existing approaches why am I
putting it to the left well this
workbook will follow an input analysis
output structure and the output part
will be to the left of the old workbook
so that you can see the results
immediately after opening the world book
and this is the reason why also position
the input summary sheet which is not a
pure input but some adjusted input bias
to the left of the pure and unchanged
input let me quickly name that sheet
input summary meeeee and now let's start
with the column names and if we look at
the input size we see that the column
names are equal for all three input size
so we can simply select the first row in
one of the files press ctrl-v go back to
the input summary sheet and now press
ctrl alt v this will open the paste
special menu of it this is a really big
help because the paste special menu
helps you to exactly define how you want
to paste the data you previously copied
in our case we won't focus on formulas
or values or formats we will focus on
the paste link button down here let me
click the button to see what happens so
as you can see we pasted the column
names as we wanted it to be but we also
see that we pasted those columns
with a link to the source file and this
is the great advantage of the paste link
function if you simply pay studies hard
coded so without any reference you will
never find out virtus where you came
from if you have a bigger workbook so
sometimes and although in this case
actually the paste link function might
be better than pasting hard-coded values
let's now just select all of the columns
and press that little line between the
last column be selected and the
following column to increase the column
ribs so that we can basically read all
of the color names so as we now got the
column names we now need the row names
you remember we need a list of all of
the countries we have statistics for
without any dublicate and we can simply
do that by again using that paste link
functionality and we will start in the
first sheet so January to June 2016 if
we now select cell a2 so the first
country and now I'll press shift ctrl
and the down arrow key now press ctrl-v
go back to the input summary sheet into
cell a2 and now again press ctrl alt + V
and paste link we paste it the first set
of countries now press ctrl + a donkey
and screw all a little bit down and now
we can select the second sheet so to lie
to December 16 select cell I to just all
the third shift ctrl and the down arrow
key ctrl V and bacterium put summary
sheet now into cell a2 or freeze control
lv pace blink and ctrl + down arrow key
I know it's kind of repetitive but only
one last time and now we go to
january-february 2017 cell a2 shift ctrl
+ it on arrow key ctrl v and paste that
again with ctrl alt we paste link now
that's it now we got the linked list
with all the countries but of course
with a lot of wks so let's select the
whole column a and now applied even move
dublicate functions which
well as the function says remove the W
case and we can find that function in
the data ribbon data tools and remove
wks then Excel ask us if we want to
expand the selection well no we don't
want that because why would we do it
here doesn't make sense so we will
continue with the current selection
press remove w codes we see that Excel
selected the column a this is the one we
need and we press ok and now we see that
excels down the road of WK values and
only some unique values about not some
it store it 17 so a lot of countries and
I that a lot of users of the channels of
thanks a lot for that by the way so we
press ok right here and now we see if we
scroll down we have nothing else right
here but we have the list of the unique
countries up here so we are almost done
the only thing we should do is we should
also copy that country name to the
country ID column because country name
and countries should go along with each
other so let's do that so we will simply
select cell a2 press shift ctrl + D down
arrow key and now press shift and the
right arrow key and control are to copy
the formula to the right and now it is
the base for our input summary sheet now
in the next video we will have a look at
some formulas and we will think about
how we can retrieve the data dynamically
from the input sheet using that formulas
so thanks a lot for watching see you
next time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
