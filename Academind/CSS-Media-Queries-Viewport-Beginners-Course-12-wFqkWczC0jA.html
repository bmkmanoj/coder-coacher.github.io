videos left for the CSS part of the
series in this video it's time to talk
about the viewport meta tag and about
media queries because we want to make
our site a little bit more responsive
before we dive into the basics of
responsive design let me fix one mistake
I did in the last video because right
here with our fallback for the font size
of our page title
I added 16 pixels well if one Ram is 16
pixels then - Ram shouldn't be 60 but 32
pixels just to make sure that this is
correct now back to our website and now
back to responsive design and before we
dive deeper
let me change one thing because at the
moment I'm viewing this website right
here with a zoom level of 200% just to
make sure that you can see all the
details the problem is that we will work
a lot with our page width in that video
and because of the zoom level of 200%
this would mean that a width of 1000
pixels right here would be a width of
500 pixels in our code and I think this
can be confusing therefore I'll reduce
the zoom level right here to 100% so
basically I won't have any zoom in here
and with that we can make sure that the
pixels we can see right here for our
page width are equal to the pixels that
we have in our code now that we talked
about that we can see that we already
have kind of a responsive design we can
see that down here in the footer right
here we see that the way the images and
the text is displayed changes that
simply due to our flex box that we
implemented because we here if our
display flex a declaration with the Flex
wrap and the wrap value applied and we
have a word 50 fine for 150 pixels for
the images and 450 pixels for the text
this means as soon as we are below these
values the way the content is displayed
changes to this part we got another well
kind of responsive design already appear
for our images also because as you can
see as soon as we are below here is 400
pixels can you see it right here so 400
right here and if we go below that
then the way these images are displayed
also changes this is you to our flex box
also which we applied right here so
display flex flex wrap and we defined a
width of 50% but additionally a minimum
width of 200 pixels therefore if we
reduce the weight of our page below 400
well there is not enough space for two
images with 200 pixels of width for each
therefore it is displayed like that with
a wrap so this is what our let's call it
responsive design looks like at the
moment in our desktop view that's really
important because at the moment we are
just playing around with the width in
our desktop browser the problem is that
well this behavior right here cannot be
observed if we have a look at our mobile
browser or at least at the simulated
mobile browser because if we increase
the size maybe and now click right here
in the chrome developer tools we can see
that we can increase that more even we
can select different devices let me
maybe select an iPhone 8 right here and
as you can see right here well although
we have a width of only 375 pixels which
would be below these 400 pixels 2 times
200 for the width of the images that we
defined the site is still squeezed into
that mobile phone screen in the desktop
view the reason for that is that our
mobile browser is not aware of the
actual device width of our device and
therefore doesn't adjust the viewport to
that size and because of that our site
looks like this and doesn't look like
that on our mobile phone because we
should actually expect that with a width
of 375 pixels it's 373 now but basically
it should look like that actually and as
I said this is you to the fact that the
mobile browser is not aware of the
device width and cannot adjust the
viewport according to that the good news
is that we can easily adjust that by
simply going
to our code at this time to the
index.html file and now add a specific
meta tag it's called meta name now it's
interesting it's viewport so that's the
first step now we need to refine one
more thing and this second thing is the
content which should be equal to width
equals device width like that now what
did we write right here
well basically what I just talked about
with that we tell our browser that the
viewport should be equal to the width
right here of the device we are using so
if we save that and go back to our page
and reload it we can now see that our
mobile browser is now able to identify
the actual device width of our iPhone 8
right here which is 375 pixels well and
then the browser knows that he should
keep a minimum width of 200 pixels for
each of these pictures well and because
of that he knows that he has to switch
the view to that view that we defined so
far in our basic responsive design this
is really important always make sure to
add this meta tag with the viewport and
content width equals device wood to your
HTML file there are more things you
could specify right here but we'll just
focus on three basics in this video well
and with that if we go back to the
desktop view we can see that we have a
really good responsive design now on our
website that's not true of course this
was just a starting point actually
because with that we now make sure that
our browser is aware of the device size
and adjust uh viewport according to that
now we have to work with this
information and think about the
consequences and this means we cannot
specify what should happen to the way
our website is displayed depending on
specific well borders we can specify we
could for example say that as soon as
our device has a width of 400 pixels or
more then the way our elements are
positioned should
change or the font size should change
for example basically you can change
almost any property now and you can
change these properties depending on the
device size by using media queries now
this can sound really complicated and
confusing now therefore as always let's
think about that step by step and before
we think about that I have to admit that
we made a mistake right here no worries
the site is totally fine no big issue
but the way we developed this website is
actually not according to the standards
nowadays because as we have a lot of
different devices on the market well one
of the most important devices is of
course the mobile phone therefore
normally developing a website should
always work with the general rule of
mobile first so you start building your
website based on the way it should look
like on the mobile phone and then you
think about how the site should adjust
as soon as you have bigger devices the
good news is that we can do this now by
working with media queries so let's dive
into that and as I just said we want to
work mobile first now to make our site
responsive and because of that we should
think about the smallest device size we
want to build our website for let's say
that this could be 300 pixels so right
here write 301 I think this is fine but
let's say 300 pixels should be the
smallest device so this is our starting
point but we want to develop our website
for and at the moment it doesn't look
good right here
so this means we have to go back to our
code because that's important keep that
in mind with the mobile first approach
this is now the code that is responsible
to make sure that this page is displayed
correctly and this means we have to
change some things the first thing we
should change is maybe the width of
these images because as we can see right
here these are too small so we can't get
rid of that minimum width right here now
and say that the width should be 100%
for our images like that yeah now this
looks better
however I still think that the home and
contact buttons right here don't
good because the font of home in contact
or the font size is a little bit too big
so we should also work on that
let's see this is the navigation so we
have to work in the or on the navigation
class so let's go back go to navigation
and to the navigation list items to be
more precise and let's maybe change the
font size to 0.9 remm something like
that and let's reload the page yeah and
with that as I said at the beginning I'm
sorry I hope you can see it now but I
have to keep it that small as you can
see now our website now has a good look
actually on this really small device the
issue still is that we have this massive
City trip and this is the California
landscape text right here and I think
this should not be displayed on such a
small device so let's say we don't want
to display this information right here
on our really small device we can also
change that by I know I forgot the part
to be honest I think it's the main part
right here and the trip text class
that's it so let's go to trip text right
here
and let's now comment out all that part
because we will need it later for the
media queries so if we now say if then
go back to our website and reload it
yeah we can see with the left that text
in here so let's add trip text right
here and now simply say display:none
therefore we now made sure if you load
the page that it is not displayed right
here so with that we now if our base set
so we have the mobile first approach for
our smallest device and I think until
right here it looks good but for example
you could now say that you would like to
change the way the website is displayed
right here at 400 pixels let's say you
want to increase the size of these home
and context buttons of the font and this
can now easily be done by using media
queries so let's go back to our code and
let's now add such a media query and I
normally add this Curie's at the bottom
of the
yes s-code because of that you can
easily see and immediately see what type
of media queries were applied and the
media query is simply written like that
so add media make sure to check out the
mdn I added a link in the video
description because you can specify well
specific media where this should only
apply to you in our case at media simply
means in general that from whatever
medium you access this website from this
media query will be applied if that's
naughty if if the min-width so the
device width is 400 pixels as we just
said we can add curly braces right here
and now we have to specify what should
happen so what happens if we have a look
at our website with a device that has a
minimum width or a width of at least 400
pixels we said that we want to change
the font size of the navigation items so
this navigation Li right here so what we
can now simply do is we cannot simply
select everything copy it now paste it
right here and now get rid of all the
properties that should not change that's
really important because we only want to
change a specific property in this media
query in our case this is the font size
now we could also adjust the fallback
for the simplicity of this tutorial I
will not adjust it now but you could
also do that of course but I will just
stick to the font size which could now
be let's say
1.2 m like that if we save that and go
back to our website and reload it can
you see it the font size now increased
because if we decrease the size it jumps
back to our initial size and as soon as
we hit that border we can see that our
font size adjusts according to the new
font size that we defined with that
media query and that's really important
to keep in mind with that media query
you can start building your website
mobile first so just as we did it now we
just had a look at the smallest device
we want to
our website for and then you specify
media queries for certain breaking
points for example in our case the min
width of 400 pixels and then only
specify the properties of specific
selectors elements classes anything like
that and define what should happen as
soon as this case is true now of course
there's not only min width available you
could also use max width for example
again have a look at the link I provide
in the below description to the MDM but
from a mobile first starting point this
is probably the easiest way to start
with just start with the smallest device
and then use min width to adjust the way
your website looks depending on the
device size however we are not done yet
because so far we can see that our
website looks fine right here but I
think as soon as we hit maybe 500 pixels
or let's maybe check it out let's have a
look at a specific device let's make it
bigger let's see what an iPad looks like
yeah I think for example on an iPad our
website could be viewed in the desktop
view so we could not also specify that
let's maybe say as soon as we have a
minimum width of 700 pixels our website
should change back to the normal desktop
view so basically to the view we had in
the beginning because right now as you
can see we only have our mobile view
right here and I don't think this looks
really good on a desktop device so let's
reduce the size and let's go back to our
code and let's now simply add another
media query so you can just copy that
right here and now say that now the main
width is 700 pixels and now really
important just take the trip images
right here so this width you can copy
everything actually copy down paste it
right here don't forget to close the
curly braces of the media aquarium and
now you want to say that well as soon as
our device has a minimum width of 7
three pixels well our we don't need to
hide by the way get rid of that our
width should not be 100% anymore but it
should be 50% like that if we go back to
our website and reload it well we can
see that as soon as we hit 700 pixels
right here the way our site is displayed
changes and again based on that media
query so you can see for our initial
site right here we have the normal
viewer then we have the 400 pixels where
the home and contact font size increases
and then we have our 700 pixels there
suddenly the entire look of our website
changes now there is one thing we forgot
right
we had these headers right here let's
also add these that's why I commented
them out right here because if we now
simply cut these out from here and now
add them to our media query as you can
see you can also combine different
selectors in here and get rid of the
commented out part like this just some
basic formatting right here and like
that maybe and also get rid of right
here and put it right there so that it
looks nice
well we add line right here well and
then with this code being added this
simply means that as soon as our device
has a width of at least 700 pixels well
this should all be true now let's see if
that happens
so we reload the page and indeed now we
can see that our massive City trip and
the California landscape text is back
again
and if we reduce the size can you see it
it switches to our mobile view and if we
reduce it further the font size
decreases and with Dada
can you see it we basically have a nice
responsive design as I would say not a
really sophisticated one of course but I
think for the basic steps we applied
this is really awesome you can also
switch to the different mobile devices
right here so the iPad has the best of
you so has the iPad pro
but on the iPhone X for example we have
the mobile view and so do we have it on
the galaxy s5 and on all the other
devices that we have right here so this
is quite cool actually as I think and as
you could see it it was really easy to
implement there are only two things that
you have to keep in mind the first thing
is always add the viewport meta tag
right here we talked about that with
that you basically explain your mobile
browser that your device has a certain
width and that if you port should be
adjusted according to that with with
that basic information in mind or stored
for the browser we can then work on the
media queries and add these curious down
here for specific device sizes
additionally keep in mind that if you
build mobile first the entire code you
have right here should refer to your
mobile so to the smallest device you
want to create your code for and in the
combination with the media queries down
here you can then tailor specific
properties according to the needs that
you have on the bigger devices that you
may have and with that we now actually
also have our first responsive design
implemented now as I said in the
beginning we have two videos left for
our CSS part of the series this was
video one in the second video so in the
next video we will then clean up our
website a little bit because we might
want to work on some foreign sizing
topics maybe or we could also work on
the contact page because right now well
I don't think this looks really cool so
as always I can only say thanks a lot
for watching and I hope to see you in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
