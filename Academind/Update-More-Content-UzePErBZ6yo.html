you guys really are amazing I'm just
going through my youtube analytics here
and it's not the first time that I'm on
this page but it always blows my mind
it's amazing what you made this channel
over the last year I started this
channel a little over a year ago and
it's incredible to see how many views
watch time and subscribers this channel
already has a big thank you to you now
I'd really like to go deeper into all
these analytics because I'm pretty sure
there are some interesting statistics to
be found top countries autumn countries
something like that but unfortunately I
don't have time I got a record new
videos for you guys don't I so I need
someone to have a look at these
analytics and turns out there is someone
I have in mind so let's take a closer
look eyes in the sky kaizen far into the
night sky read my hand
they're gonna fire but it's no you if
you can't stop it from shining through
it's true baby at the live through you
shall I do
so after travelling through hole Germany
I finally arrived here in Munich at the
place of a friend of mine and I asked
his friend to analyze the YouTube data
and thankfully he did that and he both
he exited you saw in the last couple of
seconds and he did not only built this
extra sheet he also recorded how he did
it and explained a little bit about that
and the videos where he explains this
will come out on the next Friday's
additionally to the existing content
which will of course continue being
released just as in the past and well
let's take a brief look at what it
created there and why don't we also take
a look at the person who did it so
welcome manual hi so here I am and the
first time in front of the camera so I'm
not as experienced as next of course so
I might be a little bit nervous as you
might see you hope you all were at the
beginning so yeah that's true that's
true volume so ethnic said it would be
great if I could welcome you on board of
this video series which will show you
how I created that excel file which
basically analyzes the data you created
and I think the best way is if we just
start getting a look at the results
right yes on screen right so let's do it
so in this chart right here we see the
views of the videos on this channel and
by the top 10 countries and we see that
we have in addition to the chart of
course a table where we can filter data
and we have that selected statistics
cell up here and I think it might make
sense to go to another sheet so this is
the output region sheet right here to
see where we can select a statistic so
I'm here because you can see that we
have a little table right here to select
different statistics okay and we have to
date in a more aggregated US or in that
case those other regions or the
continents actually Ethel Asia Europe
and so on and max I don't know you have
any kind of statistics or view or
information that you want to have and
want to take a look at now maybe let's
take a look
the views again on the output country
sheet okay so they already had to select
it and no but I just wanted to highlight
that I've been really cool to see which
countries made it into the top 10 are
obviously United States and you're at
the top which one and two places thats
not that surprising I guess but to see
Ukraine Poland Vietnam in the top 10
year it's really interesting so yeah
definitely big thanks to these countries
course to all the other countries too
but written as you see that you made it
in there yeah that's true and maybe it
might also make sense to have a look at
the subscriptions in addition yet
because there is something like views
okay this is what this is how many
people are watching videos but how many
are really subscribing to the champion
so let's go back to the output regions
and select the subscribers right here
and now we just can go back and we have
to update it filter also that the charge
would update yeah and we can do it in
the number of filter top 10 and
disability selected and we press ok and
now we saw that the charges updating and
yeah maybe you want to comment on that
also yeah what we saw and wire it was
really interesting as you said is that
the top 10 subscriber countries are not
necessarily the same as the top 10 view
countries because here we have
Bangladesh and Pakistan we don't have
Poland and Vietnam I guess and just just
another interesting take away to see
countries where the most views are
coming from are not necessarily
countries were the most subscribers are
coming from so if you were sitting in
Poland probably time to press the
subscribe button if you liked this
channel but yeah that was really
interesting to see in my opinion yet it
shows you the difference right so that
it's not like you is equal to
subscriptions and yeah maybe let's have
a look at one last thing right because
we shouldn't make it too long right
because you just should get a general
overview but I think that we should also
have a look at the views again but at
the bottom 10 because Tara might also be
some smaller countries and just for
information there are more than 200
countries in that statistic so let's see
what are the smaller countries maybe and
so we have to go back to the outer
reaches again change to views go back to
upward regions and now really intuitive
by the way we go to our filter number
and top 10 and we change the top 10 to
the bottom
that makes perfect sense yeah that's
what it is actually it's kind of strange
but a chicken feed works at least and
max maybe one last time yeah I'm a
domestic we are really just ready to see
who is watching that so we were talking
about single views here so that is not
in thousands not hundreds that's when
view here for Northern Mariana Islands
for example to adapt you clap yourself
on the shoulder but there's all the one
thing you noticed yes true because if
you look at the data of this year's or
january-february 17 well not a lot
happened right yeah so maybe guys I
don't know what went wrong but there is
some potential right guess I covered the
wrong topics there but maybe one topic
you might be interested in and that's
how we close the circle is this extra
seat of course was filled by manual so
that we can see what what happened over
the last months and years but also to
show you how you might feel such a
dynamic shape of a lot of linking and so
on but yeah why don't you tell ya I can
do that holding so like a snake said
would be great to see you in that video
series and we will start really basic in
the first video which is coming I think
right now we're young videos released
and it will just show you what kind of
source data we had and how I imported
the data is read she'd and Hawaii
summarize the data and so on and in the
next videos this will continue and build
up on the previous knowledge we have and
in the end we will well just see how we
can build that dynamic charts with an
integrated Excel workbook and some
sounds amazing yeah it would be great to
see you there and that's it for a moment
I think yeah so see you in June the
other videos obviously these will
continue to come out but if you like
that's not to check this video again and
hopefully see you there too yeah so
thanks for watching this video and
that's it yeah bye bye have a great time
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
