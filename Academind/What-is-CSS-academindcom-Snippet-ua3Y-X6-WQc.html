cascading style sheets and to use CSS
you need this as a starting point you
need you or mere having a look at a
website and the content of this website
is entirely displayed in the browser now
how can the browser display this
information but the answer is the
browser needs code specifically the
browser needs HTML
he must have HTML without HTML nothing
would work but then the browser could
also receive CSS code or JavaScript code
that what's the purpose of all these
well as I said hTML is the base of each
website because it's responsible for the
content of a website CSS is responsible
for the style of a website so you don't
need CSS but if you want to have a
beautiful website well you probably want
CSS and you have JavaScript to add logic
to your website now we will focus on to
CSS on to this style part because what
can we style with CSS well the answer is
we can add a lot of style to our website
examples would be color so we could
change the color of the text or of
specific elements on our website we can
also change the size of fonts or
elements for example we could also work
on the position of specific elements
imagine that you want to have a
navigation bar on your website which
should always be sticked to the top of
your website this is something that can
be achieved with CSS
additionally you could also add a
responsive design to your website
because nowadays we have a lot of
different devices we have best of
computers we have laptops we have
tablets or smartphones and you want to
make sure that the user gets the best
experience on every device this is also
something that you can do with CSS now
let's maybe have a look at a really
quick example to see how CSS can change
the look of a website because this
website right here is based on HTML only
it works no question about that but does
it look good
I don't think so now let's add CSS to
our website and then it could look
something like that as you can see we
have different colors we worked on the
font style we worked on the positioning
of the elements and a lot more in
addition to that we also added a
responsive design to our website because
as you can see right here our website
also looks good on a mobile device and
this is actually what you can do with
CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
