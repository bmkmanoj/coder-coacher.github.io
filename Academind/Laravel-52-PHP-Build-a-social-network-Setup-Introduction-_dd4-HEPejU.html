had a lot of angular2 stuff going on on
this channel and while I really enjoy
Englert you and I work a lot with
front-end frameworks on my client
projects I also worked a lot on the
server side when I create well server
side projects and I'm not talking about
setting up restful services or anything
like this
I'm just talking about yeah blind
simple websites which have their code on
the server written in in my case PHP
because I mostly work with PHP and
that's the point I want to talk about
I'm using lateral which is a very modern
and not too old and very cool PHP
framework I'm using in my projects now
thought it would be a nice idea to to
share some videos on level 2 because hey
there might be people out there who want
to get into level or who just want you
up their development skills or what they
can do a little bit because if you're
just able to write PHP well you will
have to do a lot of work on yourself
that a framework will already solve for
you probably safer and overall in my
opinion it makes developing websites a
lot more fun and you wouldn't be able to
have a complex project if you weren't
using a framework of some kind doesn't
the PHP framework could also be Ruby on
Rails but yeah frameworks are there for
a reason and so we should use them now
in this video and the next videos will
create a nice little lateral application
which won't be too complex but which
will always showcase some of the
strengths and of the main features of
laravel so we'll create a little social
network so to say where we can on the
one side sign up and log in and then
post things and ready to read like a
global timeline of all people where we
then can just like or dislike there
posts so kind of a Facebook Twitter mix
you could say I guess so I'm going to
start by installing lateral which is
really easy
I assume you already got a development
environment that means you got a web
server PHP interpreter and MySQL if you
haven't and description below you'll
find some links which will get you
started and you will see it's really
easy to install packages which include
all the things you'll need so as I said
I assume you already gathered in one
open environment so let's just dive in
install laravel and get started with our
app oh and by the way I don't have the
app finished as now so I'm doing that
blindly with you together because I'm
pretty sure that is where you learn the
most or where you can see making me
mistakes or yeah sometimes not being
100% consequent and you'll see hey that
is the thing I have to watch out for
that is something which ya can't get
overlooked easily so see you in the
videos heroine so I'm finally sitting at
my desk and before I get started a
little information for all the people
who already know a little bit about
laravel who are familiar with how to set
up laravel and move the food structure
flare well you might want to skip ahead
and you will find a link up here which
will get you there because now the
beginning will I will quickly install
their amo and then I will yeah talking
about the folder structure and Hilaire
over it's just a quick quick very quick
roundup so you may skip ahead and then
we'll meet later in the video or we'll
start with our real application see you
there then for all the people who are
still there now be aware that as I said
at the beginning of this video and the
setup of your development environment
will not be included in this video but
you will find useful links in the
description and I promise it's really
isn't easy to get going now I'm here in
my empty folder and I will install level
through my terminal using composer now
if you don't know what composer is and
you probably don't have it then just
google for a composer and on get
composed record you'll be able to to
download it and yeah as a
here composure is really just a
dependency manager for PHP so favorite
line like level but also a lot of
packages they state which dependencies
they have because the guys from wearable
didn't write all the code themselves
they used existing packages and then the
compute ate it in like a special file
adjacent files specifically and composer
is a software which will then scan
through that file find your dependencies
find them in the internet the most
recent version or a version you
specified in your file and download it
get everything in your folders that you
were ready to start so a really really
helpful tool for for managing your
dependencies I already have composer but
if you don't as I said just download is
here follow the instructions you see
here and you should be good to go now
what I'll do I'll just open up my
terminal here and I will execute
composer create project another project
is lateral slash level this will install
it and I specify prefer just to make
clear that I wanted to be downloaded and
installed on this folder here so now
composer will get going and as you can
see it is now installing level and it's
yeah it's fetching it's downloading all
the dependencies
I'll need and that will take some time
so I'll see you once this is finished so
my setup just finished and if I just
RiRi let us refresh this over here we
can see that we get all these files and
folders here now they're inside the
lateral folder that's just a default and
I would just move them up one folder I
simply do this by typing MV for move
laravel all everything that isn't an
aural folder just dot just to the
current folder so yeah that worked and
now I can
I must check hurry up now that left out
there is dot files here those are
important too so let's just manually
move them up so that my lateral folder
is actually completely empty now that
should in theory work yeah so now I can
get rid of malarial folder here and now
I'm good to go
now if you see if that worked you want
to fire up your your browser and
navigate to wherever your local
development environment is bound to sell
so Evert you specific host if you bound
to that so wherever you normally
navigate for your projects and there you
wanna navigate navigate to your little
folder and then you have to target the
public folder that's important if you're
a URL or if you're just navigating to
this level folder you won't see anything
or just an error because level is
serving it's files from this public
folder so another way would be to set it
up such that your server is already
pointing to the public server and all
your application files so to say our one
directory above so that will be how you
set it up on a web server so I'll go to
my file here and now you should see this
lateral five message which means hey it
was successfully installed now by the
way if that was a little bit too fast
for for how to set all that up again
please look in the description there
will be useful links provided there let
me clear a step and that is our very
first level application let default we
see when it's starting up now that be
quickly guide you through all these
folders and files we got here we got a
rap folder this is where we will write
the majority or a bit all our business
logic will live in this app folder we
will
that about routing or control us in this
folder the bootstrap folder is something
we won't touch most of the time the
config folder we got several parts of
our lateral application which we can
configure like for example the offering
authentication package or general
configurations for the whole app at the
moment we don't have to do anything here
in the database folder there we can use
a very cool feature of Larry law namely
one to create database migrations which
are PHP files which define or declare
how a table in a database should look so
which feels it should have and how these
fields are configured so stuff you
normally would do either through like
graphical interface like PHP myadmin or
directly through SQL in this case we can
write a PHP file and then use the
lateral command line tool which we'll
see soon and to execute that file and
that will create all that the sequel
code we need and will automatically
write it into the database so very easy
and intuitive way of setting up database
so that's that's one of the greatest
features in my opinion of flair well a
very great feature at least the public
folder is something we won't have to do
much there
however we will soon set up our source
directory for our CSS and JavaScript
files in our recent resources folder
well we got this assets folder where we
could use SAS or SPSS if we wanted you
and Laurel ships with a default galled
file here and the app CSS file so if you
want to use it it's kind of built in but
I will get rid of that and I will use
even my own a gulp file on my own gulp
workflow or I'll just in this toilet
just write pure CSS so but we could use
this assets folder to have dread up I
mean compiled version of our CSS and our
javascript and setup our god workflow or
whatever you're using to copy them into
a source folder in the public directory
that the language folder the land folder
we can set up translation yet file so to
say so if you look in one of those files
it's basically an array which has a key
and then the text to be displayed and
they could specify additional language
is here obviously and we would have to
need each file and each key then for
every language you want to specify so
that we can provide a perfect
translation but we'll stick to English
in in this application here now the fuse
folder that's a very important one here
we will create or refused so what gets
rendered to the screen lateral ships
with its own templating engine the blade
templating engine that's why this file
is called blade dot PHP and that's
basically just a templating engine yet
like you might know others like smarty
for example where you create your fruit
views from several components which are
then stick together and you have a very
structured way of accessing data you
might pass into those views so that's a
cool thing to Alera
and all our fuse will live in this fuse
folder here as you can see it currently
has this welcome view which if we have a
look at it it's just has level 5 and
that's exactly the few were seeing here
it also has I think one year one error a
few it already has defied and here in
this vendor folder if we were to install
additional packages those packages might
publish views which are part of the
package which would then go also in that
vendor folder where we could edit them
if we wanted you because we should never
ever end that as the vendor folder if I
briefly skip those two I'll come back to
them in a second in the vendor folder
all our dependencies live all the
packages were using live including the
labral framework oops
including the laravel framework itself
you can see it here
and we never never want to attach
anything inside here that are the files
s they were installed by composer and
those will only be changed if we run
composer
update or anything like this yeah we
might install new and also remove
unwanted or unnecessary packages but we
should never mess with any content here
because it will be overwritten if you
run an update and we don't want to do
that also if we mess something up there
it might be very hard to find that out
so most packages or old packages that
want you to added stuff will add a
possibility for you to use a certain
command in the level command line
interface I will show you that in a
second which will publish all the things
you should be able to change into one of
those folders here so that's very
important to keep in mind now the
storage folder here that holds yeah for
example the cache of your app and yeah
that s generally it also some files
might be stored there as what the name
says it's a storage and tests folder
well that is if you're running unit
tests well you will do that in that test
folder so that'll fit all the folders
let's briefly talk about those files and
don't worry I'm not going to go through
every file to be honest I'll only talk
about two files the first one is the dot
e MV file that file provides a basic
configuration for our app for example
we'll set up our database connection
here and yeah for if we were to use
mailing we would also set a set of our
mail server here so additionally to our
config files here that's like the
quickest way to set up some basic yep
connections mainly as you can see anti
artists and file where that is not
important on its own but the are titian
file or command is like to come
and line unilateral and we access it by
writing PHP artisan and then whatever
command and we will look into those
commands obviously throughout our
application we can for example create
new models or database migrations
speaking of models migrations views and
controllers level is a MVC framework as
you might have probably guessed by now
and as such we have that strict
separation between or yeah between view
model and our controller and this is how
we will structure our laravel apps
enough of the talking we got our level 5
few here at the moment and i as i said i
want to build an application where we
have like a mini social network we have
a stream of of posts and we can post or
create posts ourself and we will be able
to see all the posts of all our people
posting things we can then like and
dislike those posts and yeah we will be
able to sign up and or sign in if we are
already signed up so what are the core
features we have well we need some kind
we need a database to store our users to
store our posts and to store our likes
and dislikes so that's one thing um we
also need some kind of authentication
logic because our user should be able to
first sign up and then when they were
created they should be able to sign in
and we also need to be able to check for
certain functions to be available if the
user is signed in so that's something
which we will have to take care about
this authentication thing and you will
see we won't have to take care about
that much because lair or goddess err
yeah so we have to create our different
views for posts for signing up and
signing in for creating posts so a lot
of stuff were very
using models controllers fuels who have
routing because we all have different
views where we have to route - depending
on the user's reaction we obviously as I
said have authentication we might throw
in maybe let's see some some mailing
that we get sent a mail when we sign up
so even though it's not the comm most
complex application out there it already
has quite a lot of features you will see
in in yeah in day to day applications
out there now enough of the talking now
the video is already quite long what I
want to do is first let's talk a little
bit deep were different the various
views I mentioned so we get our welcome
view here and we will have kind of
welcome for you in our final application
to which they'll basically say whatever
we should log in right because we only
want to be able to see post if we're
logged in so kind of Facebook if you're
not locked in or not signed up well
you're not to able to do much yeah there
are public pages but in our application
we'll only be able to see something once
we're locked in so we should maybe just
added this default view of it so that it
is not final version because we will
need some styling and that will take a
little bit longer but just so that we
yeah feel the direction we're going to
so let me first get rid of all my of all
that here or and of the container def or
two and here of the styling I won't need
that fund here um what I want to do is
and that's the first thing about lateral
views or about the templating engine
more I want to have a skeleton file like
a basic layout which I can then reuse in
my different pages because my usual
login page will will be an html5
document it will require my styling
sheet and so on so basically this
skeleton here
yeah that that's the same for each
document more or less right and there
might be other parts like for example a
header which will be the same for many
pages at least and so on so what I want
to do here is I will create a basic
layout which my different views can then
extend and pull in the the functionality
or the document structure provided in
the layout and add additional
information or the really core of the
future with them so therefore I just
copy all that I'll create a new folder
in my views folder which I will call
layouts and inside this layouts folder I
just want to create a master dot plate
or PHP and it's important you have to
use the plate to PHP if you want to use
the blade templating engine you don't
have to use that you can write normal
PHP code but in this course we will use
it because I'm a fan of it I like it I
think it's it's a really cool way it
makes things easier it's it's well
thought so yeah I like it
in this master file here let's just copy
the skeleton I just yeah I just copied
here right get rid of it in the Welcome
view and in my master view here first
what I want to do is the title it's not
really part of the master layout but it
should be inserted by the individual
view right because we will have a
different title in the please sign up
document and a different title in that
are all posts document so therefore we
kind of have to provide a hook in the
skeleton here and we'll use a blade
templating function so to say our
expression which is the following
at yield and then title here in an
equation marks and that's a typical
blade templating engine expression they
always start with an @ sign so that
means hey here comes a blade templating
expression then comes the special
command
thanks you want to use so in this case
it's a yield function which says here
should be something something should be
inserted here hi I'm a place holder so
to say and then we have a name for the
place holder which is title and in our
brief use we'll be able to access that
title through this placeholder name here
and actually and insert our content and
we'll do that in a second because we'll
obviously also need this in our body
here right but because especially in the
body
we'll need to insert our actual content
what I'll do is I'll create a container
div which will be wrapped about around
our content all the time so that hasn't
to be part of the actual few what will
be inserted here and then again I use
yield and I'll give that a name of
content and obviously those names are
purely up to you you could name this
sugar-boy if you want it but I think
titles a little more more intuitive
maybe so here our content will live let
me save this
and if okay we go to our welcome whew I
will now have to extend this master
layout and I will do so by writing
extends at extends again a blade
templating expression then the path to
the file we're extending from so in this
case it's in the layouts folder so first
I write layouts followed by a dot to
kind of access that folder and then I
have my master 4 file and I only write
master without top light dot PHP so I
always leave out that top light dot PHP
part so that extends from that file but
I'm not inserting anything now if I'm
just writing like that
I won't insert into specific sections of
the layout I target a section by using a
number expression at section and here I
specify which section and now the key I
enter a year for example title always
has to fit the key
off the section here defined of the
yield function where I want to enter my
content so I'm entering my my title
section here and I'm closing it with n
section and this will tell level or the
blade's templating engine that
everything between the opening section
and the closing section tax so to say
will be inserted right here instead of
that ad yield
title so here we will have cut just
welcome now I'm going to copy that and
below title I'll do the same for content
and I'll just write this is the content
save this and now I'm inserting this
into the section content which is in my
layout defined here with yield content
so if I now reload my view here you'll
see that we get welcome exclamation mark
as a title of this page and this is the
content as the content and now while
that page doesn't look super awesome
what we did is a very interesting and
very foundation of using fuse at least
when using the plate template again
channel arable which allows X exactly
that to define a skeleton and then just
use components to create our fuse so we
might have another file where we have a
different content and we could just copy
that and throw in the other content in
the other file so that's the real
powerful feature of the templating
engine and yeah as I said I really like
it and it's it's enabling us to quickly
create and it will also change fuse and
you only have to make changes in one
place because you're not copying code
over and over again because don't repeat
yourself very important paradigm ok so
that's quite a long video 30 minutes or
something like that 20
five I guess but I think that was very
important now
we're familiar with the structure of
Lera well how to use to play templating
engine and where to edit files to
actually change what is displayed here
in our browser it in the next video
we'll get going with our actual
application and we'll start building
that so see you in that video and have a
nice day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
