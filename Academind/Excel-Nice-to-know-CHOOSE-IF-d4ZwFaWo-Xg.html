video series in this series we will talk
about Excel about formulas about charts
about problems you may have and a lot
more in this video we have a little
problem let's take a look so this is
what we have we have the table to the
left with the top 20 cities by
population sorted from largest to
smallest and by the way you can find a
link to the source data down in the
video description we have that ranges
right here sort of free until top 20
which is basically the input for our
drop-down list right there so here we
can select the different ranges this is
fun the only problem that we have is
that we need a formula which retrieves
the sum of the population of the
selected value in the drop-down list so
if we select top 5 here we want to have
a formula which retrieves the sum of
those 5 oops
of those 5 cells right here this is what
we have to do right now and to do this
two options would be to either use an if
formula or a choose formula now let's
take a look at the if formula first to
do this we simply type if into that cell
for instance and right if this drop-down
list so the selected value in that
drop-down list is equal to top three so
that part in the ranges right here so if
this is true then calculate the sum of
the first three cells like this this is
fine but if that's not true if it's
false then we need a second if and the
second if simply tells us that is again
the drop-down list is equal to top five
right here then we should calculate the
sum of the first five cities okay but if
that's not true again so if you close
the bracket then we need the Firdous and
you can see where this is going right
now so we need the third is if the
drop-down list is equal to top ten then
we need to calculate the sum of the
first ten cells right here
close the bracket and finally if our
drop-down list is equal to the top 20
well then we need to sum for the top 20
cities right here like this float and if
that's also not true then we simply want
to return n/a let's enter twice like
this so this is working right if we
select the top 3 it works
top five works top 10 works and the top
20 work really nice but not really good
right because this is formula right here
wasn't really nice to create and
although it doesn't look nice so we
should think about a second option how
we could calculate that to do this we
need two things we need a truce formula
which we will create and we need the
developer tools you can find them up
here and I already selected it if you
don't have that developer tools ribbon
just take a look at the video
description where you can find the link
which explains to you how you can
activate that developer tools however we
have the developer tools right here so
what we have to do first is we have to
go to insert right there click onto it
and now select the second form control
this one right here if we click that and
now place it for instance right here
like this and now change the size maybe
like this well then we have a second
drop-down list right doesn't help us a
lot because if we click here well we
can't do a lot what we can do is we can
right click it and now select format
control down there like this and now we
are in the control menu and here we have
to define two things first we have to
define the input range well we have an
input range right our range is right
there so if we click here and select
those input ranges right there click
right here again then we got the first
thing so the input range defined and now
we have to define a cell link well we
don't know at the moment what it is but
we will learn the
in a few seconds so the thing we do
right now is we click right here and
select the cell between those two
drop-down lists like this press right
here and press ok now again if we
unselect our drop-down list we can now
select the different ranges to free top
5 and so on but nothing changed right
you probably saw it we now see that
number right here so if I select top 3
so the first value in our range then we
have a 1 if I press surprise is 2
if I press top 10 is 3 and 4 to 20 well
it's 4 so this means we now have a cell
which changes dynamically depending on
the selection in our drop-down list and
now the choose formula comes into play
let's first write the choose formula and
take a look at the syntax to understand
why this might be important right now so
I'm writing choose now it is choose and
press tab and now that you can see that
we have to define an index and values
well and if we now select our index
right here into that cell that changes
depending on the selected range in our
drop-down list that we just created then
we have that index defined and what
choose then does is that is that index
is equal to 1 it will do whatever we
tell choose to do for value 1 if that
changing cell right here is equal to 2
then choose will do whatever we define
in value 2 and so on so the only thing
we have to do right now is we have to
tell choose that in case of EPs n is
equal to 1 so for value 1 this should be
the sum of the first three cities for
value - it should be the sum of the top
5 for value free of the top 10 and value
4 of the top 20 and an even greater
thing is that if we write sum in front
of that choose formula
like this and now go back to the value
one we can simply select top three like
this then write the comma so this is
what's going to happen now if this cell
is equal to two so to go top five in our
range then we select two top five value
free so top 10 should be equal to that
and value 4 should be equal to the top
20 like this if we now close the bracket
and press ENTER then we see that we got
the same result that we had when we used
the is function now if we for instance
right click right here and now position
it right there so that we cannot see
that number we can see that we are now
able to choose the top 3 and can do the
same thing with EF the top 5 and the top
10 of course also and it returns the
same value but only using this smaller
and easy to understand function so
whenever you have a problem like that
don't only think about the if formula
also keep in mind that choose might be a
better way to solve problems like this I
hope you learned something in a video
that might help you when you're facing
problems like that and I can only say
thanks for watching and see you in the
next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
