video about this channel and about you
because in the video where we talk about
the new channel name you could also
leave a comment to tell us which topics
you would like to see on this channel in
the future you could also win some
webstorm keys there finding the winners
is already done and has nothing to do
with this video however we got all your
great comments and before we continue
max and I really want to thank you
because it's just amazing how many
comments you left there and how much you
contribute to this channel however we
saw that comments we read the comments
and we discussed it but then we thought
well wouldn't it be great to
additionally have something like a quick
list or even a visual where we can see
all of the topics that you would like to
have and also see how many times you
requested these topics we thought it
would be great and then we also thought
well why wouldn't we show you how we
created that visual and also show you
the results and this is what we will do
in this video so let's start right now
so in the first column you can see a
list with all your comments and in these
four additional columns we now try to
find the keywords in each comment now
let's start so the first one could be
best practices maybe then the second one
could be well typescript and here we
have UJ s che WT off and here we have
both Excel
well I cannot guarantee your thing but
you might see some more excel videos in
the next month so we got this one then
we have react mindset and both lots of
topics right there really a great
comment but let's maybe see how we can
summarize some of these so maybe maybe
maybe hybrid development would be a good
idea right here and here we have testing
and thanks for that we also like the
name a lot and greetings back or feely
bruiser and we have MGR X right here and
yeah with that we actually finished our
list right here and now we could create
a chart to visualize that in Excel well
or maybe we use another tool and this
other tool is power bi so I am in DQ
editor now and we have to connect power
bi to this list that we just created so
we go to new source right here
then select Excel this is fine and press
connect down here this now we have to
select our comment excel file right
there and open it now we didn't select
anything to preview but if we take this
box right here well then we got that and
we can again press ok right here and
this looks almost fine actually but
first let me increase the column width
oops
like this so that you can see more so
here we have our four columns now and
let's maybe first change the first row
because this should be the header so we
simply click right here now we have the
headers correctly and well what do I
want right now
well actually I only want to have one
single column with all of these values
right here so with all of the topics and
to do this in power bi we can simply
create four new queries so this will be
listed right here based on these four
columns well to do this you can simply
select a column then right click on it
and then select the last option add as
new query like this and as we can see
topic 1 is now a new query now if you go
back to common and select the second
column again right-click it and press
again edit new query then we have the
second topic now this is the process I
will do that now for the other two
columns and we're finishing the fourth
new query we have to convert these lists
because these four new queries are lists
now into tables you will see in a few
seconds why but to turn such a list into
a table you can simply select what may
be the first query first like this then
go to the trends from ribbon where I am
already and then select to table right
here in a click onto that then the
options are fine like this so we can
press ok right here well now you can see
the different symbol and by that we
turned that list into a table now now
again I will do that for the remaining
free list and now that we also finished
this right here well we now want to kind
of combine these four Mutai Buhl's to
create one single column with all of the
topics to do this in power bi we can
simply use the append as new query
function and we can find this function
right here in the home ribbon and then
right there in the combined section if
you now click on to that arrow right
here like this then you have two options
append queries and append queries as new
we will use the second option because we
want to create a new combined Curie and
not change the four queries that we just
created so we click on to append queries
as new idea now we have to select three
or more tables what because we have four
then we can select the first one by
clicking right here nicing add the
second one and the third one and maybe
position the fourth topic at the end
right here like this and if we now press
ok then you see that we created another
query based on the four queries that we
created and we only have one single
column right now which is really awesome
actually the only thing we could do
right now is we could rename that query
by double clicking it and maybe name it
comments topics actually and press Enter
then we can go to the filter and here
load all of these names that we have
right here
maybe scroll down see if we have any
inverse no this looks fine so we can go
up again and select the nulls because we
don't need any blank fields in here and
now press ok and with that we are
actually done with our column right here
and before we load the data into the
data model we should make sure that only
this query is loaded because we don't
need the other queries actually so to
ensure this we simply click on to the
first query right here right click onto
it and unselect the enable load option
like this and with that we make sure
that this query and by that this table
will not be displayed in this data model
in a few seconds now we can do the same
thing for the remaining four topics like
this like that like ad and like that and
if we now go to closing apply right here
and press that then you can see that we
only have our newly created table right
here you can also see this is to go into
the data view right there now this is
nice but we want to visual
information actually so let's go to the
report you then and before we take a
more detailed look at the results I
would like to have a general overview of
how many topics you named actually to do
this we could select a card visual this
one just clicking right here we can
maybe drag that right there and then add
information to it well information is
right here in this column one so we
simply drag that to this field right
here this and now we can see well this
is not displaying what I want because I
would like to have a number right here
so if you click onto that arrow in that
field right here then we can change that
from first to count like that and now we
can see it and this is really impressive
that you named more than 400 topics not
different topics of course so this
includes topics named multiple times we
will take a look at that in a few
seconds but for now I only want to
quickly change the format of this card
right here so if we click right there
onto the symbol now maybe unselect the
category label like this and therefore
add a title and click here and add a
title text maybe topics and also change
the font color right here to white and
maybe a black background like this you
can see this changes let's align the
title in the center and change the size
I don't know maybe to 11 to make this
bigger looks fine and now if we scroll
down let's maybe add a border like this
so if we now click into the report right
here then we see our card that we
created we can simply select it and make
it smaller maybe like this and drag it
right there and with that we got all
your topics but as I said those are not
the unique topics so we have topics
names multiple times in here so if I now
simply copy that visual like this oops
not like that simply wanted to plug it
down like this
and now I selected it and if I now click
again right here onto this arrow like
this and change it from count to count
distinct well then you see that these
are the unique topics you're named so
more than 100 different topics again
this is really awesome actually so let's
maybe quickly rename that now because
the topics so if you click here go to
the title again and maybe name it you
need topics like this actually so it's
not clicking to report again then we see
that we have our general overview but
now it's time to take a look at the
details and to do this we again go to
the visualizations area right here and
now select a chart type maybe this one
and I can drag it right there and make
it bigger for you like this and now to
bring that to life we can simply again
select our field right here drag it to
the axis first not good so far and then
drag it to the value field right here
and now this looks almost great but
maybe we should sort that so that we can
see the topics that you requested most
at the top and to change the sorting you
can simply click on to these three dots
right here yes and now change the
sorting to sort by count of column one
like this and if we now click onto the
format again right here and unselect the
title and then maybe add the data labels
like this and now click right here in to
report to unselect the visual
well then I'm pretty happy with the way
this visual looks right now however if I
look at the topics that you requested
the most there comes another person to
my mind
right hello from my site you so let's
have a look at all the topics you
suggest that and of course these are
only condensed topics we did read
through all the comments and still do
though so I'll take this full screen we
got a lot of topics you saw that on the
left but now let's have a look at the
individual topics now unsurprisingly a
bit I have to say view chest is really
ranking high because I probably did
already do quite a lot of projects or
videos on VHS and there will be more
videos on you chest in the future no
worries I also see that more of you want
for projects for projects and that is
something I want to do too
I had a lot of projects in the past and
there will be full projects in the
future too no worries I got a couple of
great ideas and it won't be that long
until we finally start a new full
project I can say that electrons very
interesting might also cover that as
well as angular level the things we see
here basically will be covered react
native is interesting I don't have any
content on that I did work with it a
little bit not that much I'll first have
to work with it more on my own before I
when I teach other people how to use it
to be honest so not in the near future
probably but we'll see currently working
a bit with react so not impossible mean
stack fire base all very interesting
here let's scroll down a little bit now
we got testing a talker so like an on
development tasks more like the or still
related to development but not the
development of the app at the testing or
the deployment of it interesting I might
cover that we'll have to come up with a
good idea though a lot of our technology
certainly these things a will lock a
look into you from from time to time
more on deployment and build tools and I
produce in the same bucket as testing
that is definitely something I'll keep
in mind I'll see what I can do there to
to help you with that I basically
already did create their AWS series to
go more into the deployment area and
there are more videos to come and I also
try to cover things outside of AWS so
that's interesting now if we scroll down
even more what else do we see
get things like d3.js or more on JWT off
socket IO and these are topics I also
will probably show and I might simply
mix them into full projects which I
already mentioned that there are more
projects to come in the future again and
if we go all the way to the bottom two
the only ones mentioned topics here like
Axel great obviously just because
they're ranking at the bottom doesn't
mean I won't create any content on that
there are very interesting topics
between all these rarely mentioned ones
which I personally are very interested
in and that is always what I wanted to
do and what I did on this channel
anyways I'm listening to your feedback I
want to provide content you enjoy but I
don't enjoy it doesn't make that much
sense and there definitely are some
interesting mentions here mentioning
here at the bottom for this only
mentioned one topics which I'll cover so
great feedback from your sites and very
helpful to see what's ranking high
what's rank below and also get some
ideas some topics which I didn't think
about before where I saw ok you guys who
are interested in that and with all the
metadata you also provided in the
details comments which again we did read
we got some very nice ideas on what to
create in the future time always is the
issue can't do it all on day 2 after
reading this there is more to come next
bigger thing it will probably be read
the full project and of course the
ongoing things like AWS and still
individual video snippets on react on
view what else we got there so
interesting stuff thanks so much for
your feedback I hope you continue to
watch and enjoy this channel and all the
best to you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
