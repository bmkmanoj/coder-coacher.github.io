we had a look at how we could change the
appearance of our editor of the IDE and
this video I want to well talk about not
a very important thing
navigating around in the IDE there are a
couple of ways to do this and of course
there are quicker ones and slower ones
and generally when coding you want to be
as quick as possible
and not lose much time on searching for
a file or a function declaration so
which options does peach peach Toto
storm offer you well if you have a look
at the navigate menu item here you can
see quite a lot we have quite a lot of
options available though of course some
of them will be used more often some of
them not as often one of the most useful
ones is command shift o which allows you
to type a file name so let's say I want
to access some controller and then you
get all these matching file names in
your project now since this is not very
specific let's let's open the light file
the light modifier this will refer to
this light file on the left now if I hit
enter I open this file and I'm already
there so this is a very quick way to
access this and you get to certain files
if you don't want to load search for a
file but for a certain class you would
press almost the same combination but
not command shift o but just commando
and now you may enter whichever class
name you're looking for so if it's the
post class you can open up the file
which is the post file in this case but
it is opened because it has to post
class inside of course you can also
navigate around here in this tree folder
or this file file tree and well pick
whichever file you want to open and does
this find you but keep in mind the outer
way is faster and when working on a real
project you want to train this it will
save you some time if you are in a file
like this post controller which has
lot of code or more code and fits on one
line on one page at least you can get a
list of all the functions for example in
or all the items generally in this file
by pressing command f12 and here you can
see all the methods this controller has
and you can of course quickly jump to a
method by just single clicking on it so
this is also a very quick way to
navigate within a file and to find
something in that file another way to
quickly enter a file or create a new
file for example is to press command up
this will also open this file free but
navigatable with your arrow keys right
inside your editor here and now let's
say I want to create a new controller I
could just select controllers folder and
then press ctrl n to create a new file
and this will allow me to quickly create
a new file inside as well see you know
not at this insiders controllers folder
the same could be done by pressing ctrl
+ here or of course right-click new file
and you may choose whichever way you
prefer but I really recommend practice
with it you will be faster you will
really be faster if you try to use the
command or the keyboard commands as
often as possible now what is if you
like to use a certain keyboard command
but you don't like the shortcut while
you can't change this so command-comma
brings you into the preferences and
there you get the key map item here you
can change every single shortcut which
exists in phpstorm
and you cannot only change each shortcut
you assign can assign a shortcut to
pretty much each actions you are able to
do in this IDE now as before you are
also able to search for specific actions
here so if you want to change something
with navigate inside you might type
navigate here however this is
so hard to find probably so if you know
you want to change a certain shortcut
let's say command f12 is too difficult
to reach you might click the smack
magnifying glass here and then here you
can enter the shortcut you want to
change come out of 12 for example and
this will search for the item which is
brought up with the shortcut and then
you can just remove this to remove the
shortcut and then add a new shortcut
whichever fits your needs more now of
course if you use one which is already
assigned to something else you will get
this warning here and you may of course
overwrite this and this will work which
has removed us from the a ver items or
actions and you of course you should set
the shortcut you want and if this
overrides the shorter of another action
you have to decide as just act an
important to you if yes pick an average
shortcut for it if no well then no
damages cost and with these shortcuts
and the possibility to change them and
to adjust them to your needs you are
able to quickly navigate between files
classes inside a file create new files
between the different folder structures
and that really are the most important
things here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
