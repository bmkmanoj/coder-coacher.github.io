part in our beginners guide in this
short video we'll have a look at the
website we created once again and see
what we have to adjust for example this
contact page right here I think this
looks kind of wrong right now and we'll
have a look at pseudo classes
so let's directly start right here with
that contact page we see that home works
fine but contact well we didn't apply
our styles so far to this part of our
website so let's go back to the code and
let's simply have a look at the contact
or the index.html file in the contact
folder because this is the old file that
we created in the beginning of the
series and in the meanwhile well we
changed a lot
for example we added this viewport meta
tag right here so let's also edit right
there to this file let's also see what
else we have our fonts that we of course
have to add right here so let's also
copy that to our 2nd index.html file
right here and now we can actually
simply copy in the content right here so
I'm starting in the header until the nav
because the plan is actually to just
safety home in contacts or this
navigation part on this contact page
will work on the contact page later when
we work with JavaScript throughout the
series but for now if CSS will just keep
it like that so I selected that and I
will now simply paste it right here into
the body so let's get rid of that
initial content paste it and now
important we need to change it right
here because the link right here should
now be for home because we want to be
navigated to home right here this should
only be a list item where it says
contact because if we click on to that
nothing should happen because we are
already on the contact page then and
important we need to change the hyper
reference right here to dot dot
index.html like this because you want to
navigate from the contact folder into
our main index.html file with that let's
save that and I think it should be fine
so let's go back and reload the page
yeah and with that as you can see it
looks different right here because I
zoomed in a little bit let's do it the
same way right here yeah I think now you
can see
the home empty contact page have the
same general styling as I said more
content to come on this contact page in
the next videos when we talk about
JavaScript and with that I'm now
actually quite happy with the look of
our website if we go to home we can see
that the text looks fine I fought in the
last video that we might have to change
the font size of specific elements but
actually it looks totally fine it also
switches to the mobile view because of
the media queries we added in the last
video and if we have a look at a mobile
phone it's maybe increased at a little
bit like that so the iPhone X it looks
fine in the portrait mode and if we
rotate our device it also looks good in
the landscape mode if we use a smaller
device on iPhone 7 for example we can
see that in both modes the well mobile
view is displayed so this looks quite
good actually and because of that there
is only one less thing that I would like
to show you or that I would like to add
and these are pseudo classes pseudo
classes simply allow us to show a
specific state of an element this means
we can add such a pseudo class to a
selector and if the studio class added
we can define what happens to an element
for example if we hover the mouse over
an image or if we click on to contact or
home and that's exactly what I would
like to do I would like to change the
way our website is displayed in a way
that if we hover over this or that image
or over Mac's or my head that the mouse
cursor becomes a pointer and if we click
on to contact right here or home right
there I would like to change the color
of contact or home once we click onto it
so these are two things that we can do
with pseudo classes more information
about pseudo classes as always can be
found in the MDM and also as always you
can find a link to the corresponding
site on the MDM in the video description
so let's start with the pseudo class
that turns the mouse cursor into a
pointer once we hover over an image so
let's go back to our code to the CSS
file
and let's add it maybe up here as kind
of a general rule so you write the
selector in our case the images now a
colon and now you're right
hover that's one of the pseudo selectors
available and now you're right to crawly
braces as always and now we simply say
that if we hover over an image then we
want the cursor to be a pointer or to
turn into a pointer this can of course
be difficult on mobile devices so this
is rather a pseudo selector you probably
use if you want to have it on a desktop
or on a normal computer screen for
mobile devices probably not the best
option nevertheless I would like to show
you how it works so let's save this and
let's reload the page and if we not
hover over the image you can see that
the mouse turns into a pointer right
here right there and if we go over next
image and over my image so this was the
first pseudo class that I wanted to show
you and the second one is the class that
allows us to change the color once we
click on tan element specifically I
would like to be able to change the
color once we click these and these are
links so let's go back and let's also
add a pseudo class for links so for the
anchor tag right here and this time it's
not hover but its active because we
click on to it so it's active so let's
do that and let's not change the color
to our normal you know that already
fa9 to 3f so our Academy and orange
basically and if we now save that and go
back to the page and reload it you can
see that nothing changed but if we now
click on to contact can you see it or on
to home it becomes orange for the amount
of time where it's active so basically
whenever I click it so if I hold the
left mouse button you can see it stays
orange if I release the left mouse
button then it gets back to its initial
color the black right here well and with
that we did it actually we finish the
CSS part of our beginners guide
think this was a lot of work and I'm
totally aware of the fact that this is
not the most complicated website
probably but if we think back about what
we applied so far we used a lot of
important concepts of CSS in this rather
simple website the thing that's missing
right here of course is logic and if we
need logic on our website then it's time
for JavaScript so in the next video of
this series we will finally have a look
at JavaScript of course I hope to also
see you in this video I hope that you
enjoyed this year's s part so far and as
always I can only say thanks a lot for
watching hope to see you in the next
videos and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
