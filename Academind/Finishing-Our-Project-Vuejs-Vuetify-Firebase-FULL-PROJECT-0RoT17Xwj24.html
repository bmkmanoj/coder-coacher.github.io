series about beautifying firebase we
achieved a lot we built a whole
application with sign up sign in the
ability to create meetups register for
them to edit them date and time Pickers
so much stuff now
our store file also grew quite a bit
it's really long and it's already a bit
unmaintainable to be honest now it would
make sense to split it up into modules
and this is exactly what we'll do in
this video
so let's split our store fall into
modules now let's first analyze which
modules would make sense well in my
opinion we got mainly two topics in this
application we got user related stuff
sign up sign in and so on and we got
meetup related stuff now of course there
are some overlapping but in general this
is how I see it
so it would make sense to probably
create these two modules the question of
course always is what is something like
registering is that user or is that
meetup related because the user
registers for a media not really either
of the two right so maybe we need a
fourth third module deregistration
module let's go with that I'll create
three new folders in the store user
registration and of course meetup and in
these folders there I want to store my
modules now you could go super granular
and outsource your actions and your
rotations in two different files now
I'll see if I do that I'll start by
creating different pieces so a file with
all actions and mutations for the user
part a file with all actions and
mutations for the meetup part and so on
so I'll create new index.js file in all
of these folders like that here in the
user and now let's split it up no
splitting it up can be yeah not really
difficult but you have to be careful
that you don't mess things up because
handling or working with the state can
differ from how you did it before
depending on how interweaved your
different parts are but we'll see how it
goes so I'll take the cheap approach
here and copy everything in my main
index.js fault and copy it into the
meetup file and now I'll simply start
removing stuff so let's start at the top
in this state loaded meetups make sense
to have it here user not so much
loading probably yes err
or yeah do we even use that I don't
think so so still let's leave it in
there ah
we'll see if we use it here register
user for Meetup and unregister
definitely can't get rid of these
mutations loaded meetups make sense
create meetup and update meetup these
are all mutations which makes sense in a
meetup store set user doesn't make sense
said loading make sense at error well
let's see if we use it but make sense
clear error as well
now here actions register user for
meetup and unregister definitely don't
need that here load meetups make sense
to have it here create me that makes
sense and update meetup also makes sense
sign user up nope that definitely
doesn't belong here the same for a sign
user in and for auto sign in fetch user
data all the sounds like a user later
tasks to me so why don't we get rid of
that too
the same with log out clear error I'll
leave it here seems like we use it
somewhere I must have forgotten where so
I'll leave it here so dad is now my my
setup here much leaner already the
gathers of course also need to be
cleaned up loaded meetups make sense
feature loaded makes all sense the user
doesn't make sense here so now I get my
meetup store set up here though in the
end it will all be merged into one
central store so it's not really
different stores it's just one part let
me continue I'll copy everything from
the main index file again and go to
registrations now there again what's
inside the state here now one thing we
have is that in mutation for the
register user meetup
we of course access the user so that is
something which makes me lean towards
using this in our users module because
it is connected to it we need access to
the users state here so maybe we don't
really need a registration module
maybe that robber belongs to the user
module because we change the user when
we do register or unregistered we don't
change the meetups
so I'll get rid of registration and
instead copy everything into the user
index.js file now there let's move
through it noted meetups we don't need
that here the user we need it a loading
an error yeah let's leave it here
registering we need that loaded meetups
create meetup update meetup we don't
need that here in the user file set user
that makes sense set loading probably
same for the errors actions create a
registry users make sense load meetups
we don't need that create we don't need
that an update we also don't need that
so now oops we have just as a next
method sign user up and in and all the
sign-in and fetch user data so quite a
lot of user related actions here but now
we at least focus on that in this file
and as I said you could go more granular
and even outsource the actions into
their own file and so do for the
mutations with that let's go down to the
gathers loaded meetups we don't need add
featured and loaded we also do any debt
we need the user and I'll leave loading
an error here so now we get cue state
felt in the two different modules of
course we now need to merge them
together we did it in the main index
chase fall now in the main index.js fall
let's remove everything in this view X
store constructor everything so that we
only pass an empty object to it and we
don't need firebase in this file now
here we now instead add modules as a key
and this is a JavaScript object where we
now merge these modules you can now a
define any names you want maybe meetup
for your meetup module and the value now
needs to be of course a reference to
your exported meetup module so there
I'll import meetup from / Meetup and
that's not that will automatically pull
the index.js file scientists as a value
and the same for user there are import
user
from user and store it here and this
will map it into this now one problem
we'll have is that in these files we
export stores and that is wrong
we shouldn't export stores in these
files we should export JavaScript files
objects like this export may be a
default object which then has state and
so on that is okay but not new view X
story for that reason we can get rid of
view X in here and also of view we don't
need to register that that's simply a
empty file where we just registered or
export a JavaScript object so that's all
just a JavaScript object we export the
same for the user fault get rid of all
the imports and off the initialization
not all the imports we need firebase but
off the initialization and then simply
export a default JavaScript object not
more
now we merge these objects into our
store together here the question just is
does it now work like this let's save it
and see if it works it compiled but now
we get an error duplicate Keter gallery
loading and error the problem we have is
that in both index and user we have a
getter named loading and error and that
of course is suboptimal now the question
is which of these do we really use well
we need it actually in both we want to
show a loading bar or a loading spinner
whilst you are signing in signing up and
we also want to show one when we're
fetching meetups or creating meetups so
just splitting up like this will
generate new problems what we will have
to do is be clear about which gathers we
want to access and how we use them now
to fix that issue with loading an error
we can basically create like a shared
state so let's create shared because
loading an error are basically not
really connected to either a user or a
meet-up we have operations in both
modules which can make this relevant so
here I'll copy this code from the meetup
in XJS fault and add it to a new
index.js file which is stored in the
shared folder now here I'll paste it in
and now I want to get rid of all this
state except for loading an error and
I'll get rid of all new mutations except
for the mutations setting loading and
error and you guessed it the same for
the actions only the actions relating to
errors and so on should be set so I
think we have no action which is called
set loading or stuff like that so we
only have clear error as action like
that and finally in the gathers we also
only have loading and error and I can
now go to the user actually to both to
the meetup module to you and get rid of
error and loading there make sure to get
rid of all the actions and all the
getters and so on all the mutations
related to loading an error so
everything here in the mutations as well
as well as in this state because we will
now manage this in a shared folder the
same for the user get rid of user and
excuse me of error and loading of clear
error and in mutations clear error set
error set loading and of our two states
now let's add it to our store shared
here should be imported from the shared
folder so I'll assign it here and let's
now save it and see if this works well I
got an error let's see which it is
linting problem firebase is never used
in the shared index.js file which makes
sense because there are just copied
everything in but of course the firebase
import is needed there we don't reach
out to firebase in there that's wrong
file shared index here we never reach
out to firebase so with that let's save
it and let's reload our application and
now this should work really fine Farage
stur confirm this seems to work the
reason for this is that view che s view
X exposes our state we merge together
here your whole application so we can
still commit to set loading and so on
even though that's in a different view X
module because again it's merged
together globally so if in the index
Ches fault in the meetup folder we call
it set loading or we commit this we're
actually committing this to set loading
in these shared in X J's file because
again view X behind-the-scenes merges it
all together into one global store we
only split it up for readability reasons
in the end you could merge that all
together into one file again and have
the same result as before so now with
that we got a finished application we
cleaned up our store as I said you could
split it up even more by splitting these
files into different files where you
have just the actions just mutations but
then in the end you would just have
JavaScript objects with for example this
content in an extra file import it and
assign your import as a value for
mutations here this is the finished
project feel free to enhance it to
continue working on it to practice with
it it's not perfect there are things you
can improve there are things you can add
but I hope it was a great practice and I
hope you enjoyed working with it we
added a lot of features I hope you
learned a lot about beautiful view KS
and firebase and there will be more
projects in the future I'm really
looking forward to dead and I can't wait
to see you again bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
