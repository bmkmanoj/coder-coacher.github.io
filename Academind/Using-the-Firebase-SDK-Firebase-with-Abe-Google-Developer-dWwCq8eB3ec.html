firebase together with Abe and he walked
us through firebase here through the
most important features for us which are
authentication database storage and
hosting as well as cloud functions now
of course you can dive much deeper into
firebase and the official documentation
is certainly a great place to do so just
as the average serious I have on this
channel about view beautifying firebase
there we will all use some of these
firebase features for example the
database storage and authentication now
in the previous video however we had a
look at a project this project here
where we were able to sign in and sign
up so we did sign up in the last we
already therefore I can use these
credentials to sign in and we see some
messages here you can add new messages I
want to quickly have a look at what goes
on behind the scenes and with that I
mostly mean the code so it's a basic
angular Apple link can be found in the
video description and if we have a look
at the firebase service there which is
where all the interaction with firebase
happens here we can see that I got a
couple of methods interacting with
firebase through the firebase SDK and
here's an important thing if you check
out the documentation which you can find
by clicking on go to Doc's on the top
right here if you go there you click on
guides and there you expand real time
database you will see that there is a
web guide using the JavaScript SDK and
you could also target rest endpoints
with Ajax requests so there are
different ways of interacting with the
database though if you want to use the
real time part of it using the
WebSockets and taking easily advantage
of them you've used JavaScript SDK as I
do here so what's going on here well for
example we sign the user in I'm reaching
out to the firebase object which I am or
it from the firebase NPM packet which is
just the SDK I installed so a JavaScript
package I installed there I then call
the off method which basically gives me
access to all the authentication related
helpers the JavaScript SDK provides
was signed in with email and password
very descriptive method name in my
opinion we can easily pass an email and
a password which I fetched from my
angular form and you just dead sign in
and then firebase will either return a
success case which we handled the ban
block where we get the user which was
signed in or we get an error which we
can simply output and here error next
simply pushes this error to a subject
and the error given back by firebase
actually already contains an error
message which we also saw in the
previous video where we can basically
well see something like this email and
password is not valid or something like
that so same for signing user up we get
out reach out to the firebase SDK we
then basically just activate the
authentication like the features or we
dig into those by calling the off method
and then here's the create user with
email and password method which allows
us to do just that so this what we use
the SDK and this is what we used behind
the scenes in the last video we also get
the listen to messages and send message
method send messages called whenever I
click send here on this button now send
message just just what the name implies
again I use the firebase SDK I then do
not call off as a function but database
that's a function call here and just as
off gave me access to all the
authentication related methods database
gives me access to all the database
related methods now here's an
interesting function I call their after
rest we have a look at the firebase
database by clicking on database in our
firebase console we basically see here
we get our messages messages are pushed
on to an array but it's this messages
node which is interesting we get a
reference to this node with the ref call
the interesting thing is if we add a
node here which doesn't exist yet so if
I would add an S here and change that it
would create
newnode so you don't have to create that
note on the back and before you access
it it works the other way around so
that's what we do with rap we either
create a note or use an existing one and
then pushes one of the ways you can
write data voice yes the name suggests
pushes a new JavaScript object onto this
node and push basically means it adds it
to a list this list then automatically
gets populated with items which receive
well this lexical ID here where we have
a clear unique identifier for each item
which then contains whichever data our
object here contain content and a user
ID here it's a hard-coded user ID
because I'm recording this video after
we made some other changes but that's
the only change I made here in the end
what we do here is we push the
JavaScript object firebase will convert
it into Chasen and store it in our
database and again we get back success
result or potential errors now
interesting is how we listen to you
changes thereafter we again reach out to
the firebase SDK to the database method
and then to the node we want to listen
for changes and saying a listen and not
fetch because firebase is all about
being a real time database now
theoretically you can all just fetch a
snapshot and go with that there is
another method you can use it's called
once here are using on and not once
because I just don't just want to fetch
data once I want to react to changes I
want to listen to changes and since
firebase basically uses WebSockets
behind the scenes it informs me whenever
my day that changes so here I listen to
a certain event and value is not any
random word I entered here value is the
event you want to listen to because it
means whenever the value of this node of
the messages node changes now here we
got our messages stored whenever I add a
new message and whenever I push a new
message on to that node
clearly the value of the node of the
messages node changes because we added a
new element so then this well trigger
here basically is
so the value then fires and fire base
will automatically execute this map that
this anonymous method here where we get
the new data and data is just our array
of messages because you just get the
data of the messages node and the
messages node happens to be a list of
messages so that's what we get with data
and then all that you hear is just
transform the data in a way that I can
use it so I basically loop through all
the messages and push the elements which
you can access with the well helper
method that just gives us access to the
values of the individual node items so
the list items so it gives us access to
content the user ID in this case I push
these objects onto my messages array I
found it important to highlight that and
of course you will see this in action in
my view beautifying firebase series
where we set this up from ground where
we basically built this all from ground
and why don't you highlight how it works
though right now because we did use it
in the previous video now with that
let's move on and let's take a closer
look at how we should actually structure
our data here in the data base and how
we may use rules to control who's able
to write what into our database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
