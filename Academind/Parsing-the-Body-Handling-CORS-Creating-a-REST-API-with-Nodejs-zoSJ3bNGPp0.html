create a restful api with nodejs serious
in this video will do two things we'll
have a look at how we can extract the
request body of an incoming request like
let's say for a post request and we'll
also have a look at how we can handle a
course errors now for that will also see
what course actually means and then how
we can handle such errors so let's dive
into both topics in this video
let's start by extracting request bodies
for that I quit note Mon for a second
and I will install another package with
NPM install - - save - all the story
entry in package Jason and the name of
the package is called body - parser now
as the name suggests we can use this
package to parse the body of incoming
requests because it's not nicely
formatted and easily readable by default
in nodejs and we can then use that data
and body parser does not support files
for example but it does support URL
encoded bodies and it also supports json
data so if we receive a post request
that contains json data now to use that
URL at that body parser we should go to
app j s and there at the top lists
first of all import it I'll name this
body parser and I will require it from
body - parser like this then I will
apply it to my incoming requests we
already used the logger middleware
Morgan right after it I'll use my body
parser middleware and now the body parse
or middleware there actually need some
additional information which kind of
bodies do you want to parse first I want
to parse URL encoded bodies and there we
should pass a JavaScript object where we
configured this type of parsing and
there we should set extended to either
true or false true allows you to parse
extended bodies with rich data in it I
will set it to false to only support
simple bodies for URL encoded data more
interesting to us here however is the
following body parser which will apply
there after Jason as a method but
without arguments and a link to this
package with more information on it and
all the configuration you can pass can
also be found in the video description
so this will now extract JSON data and
makes it easily readable to us the same
for URL encoded data we can now use this
in our routes like here for
that's when we post a new router a new
product excuse me we could create a new
product as a JavaScript object maybe
with a name and I want to get that name
from the incoming requests and with body
parser there will be a body property
where I then can extract different
properties depending on which data I
received so let's say I expect to get a
request body which has a name property
then I could extract it like this and
how do I know if I have such a property
on the incoming request well we as a API
creator either are the user of the API
anyways or if we intend to publish our
API to four parties we should set up a
documentation where we clearly state
which data our different API endpoints
need to work correctly and this is also
what you will see for public API so they
always have a documentation where they
say hey for a post request to this
resource we need this data and you will
get back a response with this data so
here let's say we expect a name and
let's say we expect a price request body
price and to confirm that I got this I
will add a created product property to
my response Jason and simply pass this
product object along so that is my data
for creating a product now for trading
order I'll do the same I'll create my
new order object and there let's say we
would have a product ID and I would get
this - from request body product ID and
then maybe we have a quantity request
body quantity something like that and
here I will also return my order in the
order property of the response JSON data
now with that let's first of all run NPM
start to bring up that server again and
then let's try it out by posting two
products and two orders so here first of
all I'll post to slash
products and now we need to send body to
see something so in postman you can go
to body here then you can simply switch
between different types of body I will
choose raw and now with raw I can go to
the drop-down and pick Jason so now here
we can create a JavaScript object which
should be our JSON data I want to send
there I want to set a name like Harry
Potter five and keep in mind for
products we also extract the price so I
also get the price here and we can
discuss if it makes sense to receive the
price from the user who may alter the
request but this is not the final state
of the API no worries
so here the price could G be $12.99
let's now hit send and we get this
strange error now what's wrong here well
what I'm sending here is not valid JSON
data for valid JSON data we must only
send string data so we should enclose
the property names between double
quotation marks and also the price and
now if we try this again we indeed get
back handling post requests to slash
products and to create a product with
the data we submit it now let's try the
same for orders there I if you have a
look at the URL or at the router I
should say we extract Product ID and
quantity so let's pass these two
parameters or these two information
pieces product ID can be this ID and the
quantity quantity could be let's say 10
and now if I had send we see that this
was successfully created
and we get back that data so parsing the
body does work so we made sure that we
can parse our request body let's now
work on something else
fixing course errors we haven't seen any
but you if you've worked on any single
page application anything like that you
might already have seen
these course errors they look like this
simply search for course error on image
search no access control allow original
header is present on the requested
resource this is what you typically see
that now what does this mean what our
course errors about what is course to
begin with course stands for
cross-origin resource sharing and the
idea behind it is pretty good it's a
security concept we have a client and a
server and if both are coming from the
same server so if the client if the page
you're on is served by the server you
are sending a request to let's say you
have a traditional web app where you get
back HTML pages and on one page you use
jQuery HX or some other Ajax library to
send some date or get some data there on
the same server then this will just
succeed because then you're trying to
access resources on your server from
that server now for a restful api this
is never the case instead client and
server typically have different URLs
different origins and even the port
number on localhost is considered a
different origin if it's not the same in
this case trying to make a request to a
resource on the server will fail because
as a default the browser is saying it
doesn't make that much sense for you to
get something from that server it's not
the server you are coming from now
that's a security concept but for
restful api s-- we want to allow this
axis because restful api s-- are meant
to be consumed by our clients by our
servers and not just by the server the
api runs on that wouldn't make it dead
useful because keep in mind we don't
serve an application from that api we
just serve data therefore we can
overcome this we can basically disable
this mechanism by sending some headers
from the server to the client that
essentially tell the browser which is
running our client application which
tell the client yeah
it's okay you can have access and then
the browser says okay
so here you go so what we have to do now
is we have to ensure that we send the
right headers back and how do these
headers look like let's go to the App
J's file and there I want to basically
append the headers to any response we
sent back so we should do it before we
reach our routes here because there we
do sent back a response so before the
routes I'll add another a middleware
with app use to funnel every request
through it and there I'll use my arrow
function which receives the request
response and this next object and in
there I now want to add some headers to
the response this will not send the
response it will just adjust it so that
wherever I do send a response it has
these headers so with response header I
add a new header and then the first
header I need to set as access - control
- allow - or wretched remember that
course error message it said no access
control allow error origin header is
present well now we set it so it will be
present this header also needs a value
and the value can be start to give
access to any origin
you could also restrict it you could say
only HTTP my cool page comm should have
access but typically for restful api as
you give access to any client because
you really want to narrow it down to one
now the next header or one more header
we need to add is access - control -
allow - headers
to essentially define which kind of
headers we want to accept
so which headers may be sent along with
the request you can also set this to a
star to allow anything you could also
set this to a rich in X requested with
and maybe content type and maybe accept
and maybe also authorization so that all
these headers can be appended to an
incoming request I will now also check
if the incoming request method method is
a property which gives us access to the
HTTP method used on the request is equal
to options browser will always send an
options request first when you send a
post request or a put request this is
basically something you can't avoid
where the browser sees if you can't make
this request if he's allowed to do so so
you send the options request first for
this case I also want to add an
additional header where I tell the
browser what he may send so I will add
access - control - allow - methods and
set this to put post patch delete oops
patch delete
exiting out of the string so like this
get
basically all the requests or the HTTP
words you want to support with your API
now if we have such an options request I
also already want to return response
status 200 with a JSON data load or
payload but that actually is an empty
object because here I don't need to go
to my routes because the options request
is just for finding out which options we
have and by sending back a response
where we add all these course headers we
do provide such an answer for our
methods only the first two headers are
attached and that's all we need and
thereafter the request may continue so
that's the idea behind this setup it
ensures that we prevent course errors
now one question remains
why did we never encounter course errors
when we use postman the answer is
postman is just a testing tool it's not
a browser and keep in mind that I said
that course arrows are a security
mechanism and forced by the browser
that's why you can override them with
headers the browser then knows to ignore
that
well postman just doesn't care stare for
testing this also has a whenever
important application if you ever
thought about protecting your API
against unwanted access by restricting
the allow origin to maybe your own
domain only this will work for webpages
our web pages won't be able to use your
API with that but you can still get
access with tools like that so it's not
really a protection mechanism when it
comes to debt but you can ensure that
our webpages contacts is your API still
here I provide access to everyone and
with that setup we shouldn't encounter
any course errors when we connect a
single page application or some average
client to our API now with that we added
course error handling but right now we
would always block our incoming requests
we also need to call next
the end of our middleware if we're not
returning immediately due to us getting
options requests so that the apparatus
can take over so with that let's make
sure to also start node Mon and it
should then automatically restart you
can still send requests and you could
now also send them from single page
applications and so on now with that we
added body parser we're handling course
errors now I'd say in the next video
it's time to finally add a database and
then do some more useful things on our
server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
