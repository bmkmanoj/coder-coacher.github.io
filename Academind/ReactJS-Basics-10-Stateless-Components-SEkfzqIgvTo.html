components there's another thing I have
to add due to that our home component
here uses the state in several places
here any set timeout function and here
and you own make older method when we
click the button the header component
doesn't use state it's a component where
it is safe never changes for such
components we can create them in a
different way in a more efficient way
efficient seen from a performance
standpoint so since this is a component
without state we can create it as
something which is known as a stateless
component that's just a react.js term
for a component which well only has
props or maybe this component doesn't
even have props right now but only has
the chance of getting props it has no
chance of setting its state because it
doesn't have a state because it doesn't
need one why do we have such components
well generally it's a good practice to
use state carefully to take this even
further when using read acts which is
something I'll come to in my next series
you don't use set State at all because
state management can really get tricky
and react.js in more complex
applications for sure and therefore
having as many stateless components as
possible will make your application
perform better and be more manageable by
you because changing states in all kinds
of components really makes your app
unpredictable and therefore stateless
components are the key to making it more
predictable more testable and perform
better again so if you have a component
like this one which doesn't need to
state well don't use it we have to
rewrite it though I'll change class to
Const so I'll create a constant which
gets exported and then of course I will
no longer have my extents keyword here
instead I have to assign a value to my
Const
and this value will be a fat arrow
function where the input I get by chair
react.js is the props argument here
because props are available in a
stateless component then this is the
function body therefore of course there
is no render function anymore and just
returning something now and I got too
many curly braces so remove one Attica
semicolon here and that is a stateless
component as you saw wasn't that
difficult to refactor it it's just a fat
arrow function the end exported as a
constant in this case you could export
it as a variable but constant makes
sense since I'm changing this and that
is my state last component now as we get
props I can also use them and let's say
output props dot Homelink here and then
go to my index chairs file and pass home
link to it and just gives us a value of
home now here I'm passing a string
because well if I only pass a string
item meaty curly braces and back in the
application we see aid works as it did
before nothing changed by the looks of
it but behind the scenes something
changed the header now is a stateless
component and no longer uses the state
and again remember the reasons I listed
a few minutes ago
really think about refactoring
components to stateless components if
you don't need to state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
