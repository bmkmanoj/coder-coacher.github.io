project here we already achieved a lot
and over the last videos we implemented
authentication we're now able to sign
users app and in the one problem we
still have there is we don't really
communicate the current state of our
authentication though so click sign up
here well I get this automatically
generated html5 error but we don't get
any error besides debt if I sign up with
a valid form data but a password which
actually is not long enough I don't get
any feedback at all so that is not the
best way of handling this form what be
nice to see when something is happening
would be nice to get some authentication
errors for example let's implement that
in this video
so I want to basically display the
current state or information about the
current state of indication to the user
for that we of course will use UX
instance our state management system and
there I want to track two things I want
to track if we're currently loading data
so if I want to display like a spinner
because we're currently sending data to
the server and waiting for a response
and I want to display if we get any
authentication errors now for that I'll
simply go up in my state and here
besides my loaded meetups on the user
I'll add cue other things I'll add a new
field which is called loading which will
set to false initially because initially
we are loading and then I'll also have a
field of error which I'll set to null
because initially I also don't assume to
have an off error now we could of course
also just name this error for now and
later see if we can reuse that on
different components because we might
have different areas in our application
where we reach out to a server and then
it might be nice to have a reusable
error state we can use so with these two
new state fields here I need new
mutations to change them for example I
want to have a set loading mutation
where I of course mutates the state and
when I get a payload to either set it to
loading or to well to not loading
because we are done we got everything we
want so here I will simply set state
loading equal to payload so payload
should be true or false depending on
whether we are loading or not so thatís
what I'll set up here and then I also
want to have a set error commit mutation
that is what's called here I also
receive a payload and that of course
will be my error so we'll set state
error equal to payload that would be a
fitting mutation we could also add a
clear error mutation and of course you
could all just pass a payload of null
here clear
error but I think it is a bit more
explicit about what we do here if we
have a mutation really focusing on this
sole purpose where I said state error
equal to null so with that we got new
mutations to work with loading and error
states now we can use them for example
in signing a user up right at the start
of course once it's said loading to true
because no matter if it succeeds or not
we are loading we are reaching out to
the web so here it is action I
definitely want to commit set loading
and I want to set this to true because I
am loading on the other hand whenever we
reach the better block here where we got
a user we certainly are not loading any
more so here we can again commit set
loading but here set it to false and of
course I also want to set loading to
false if we get an error because even
though we got an error the loading
process is finished there's no more data
to come on the other hand if we do get
an error there's one other thing I want
to commit I want to set set error queue
error and this specific error here
thrown by firebase happens to have a
message property we could see that in
one of the earlier videos and you can
confirm that if you assembly run
authentication open the console each our
script console because we are logging
the error here and then have a look at
the error so there we have a message
property the following one here let me
show this to you if we enter valid data
by the password which is not long enough
and I click sign up here we got a
message object as you can see password
should at least be 6 characters so this
is the property we can access there and
that's the one we'll then use so that's
something we have to rely on so with
that I'm also saving the error on the
other hand right at the start when we
start loading we probably want to also
run clear error so this mutation here
because if you're sending a new request
we want you
here any previous barrows probably so
that looks like a good a decent setup
here of course I'll repeat it for
designing process are all the commit
loading and clear errors here at the
beginning all set
loading to false once we have well
either a success or an error case but I
will also set the air or here like that
with that we're managing all that in
view X we're managing our state here now
we have to take advantage of the state
in our views for example to show a
spinner whilst we are loading or to show
an error if we got one let's start with
the error and for that let's go back to
beautify chess and here under components
this alert component looks alright we
can add such an alert at the top of our
page to show it whenever we got an error
actually I want to have a closeable
alert though so that we can dismiss it
as a user and we can simply have a look
at the code here as always we see the
alert is the component this mis'able has
to be added so that we get this X symbol
to close it and then we bind it either
to the model to open close it's
triggered by a property or since we
model it's just a wrapper for an input
event which is emitted and a valuable
property you can pass in we might also
just listen to the input event to clear
our errors but I'll come back to that
let me copy that code here and I want to
add it in my signup W file here at the
very top I want to do the same in my
sign-in file so why don't we create a
utility component for that stored in a
new directory maybe all name is shared
because will hold some shared components
and here I'll name it alert that view
was the file name and here I'll add a
template like that and injured it like
that so now we got the alert here now
with that I want to set this from info
to let's have a look
maybe yeah the error alert so that has
the error property then on it so that
you error dismissible and I don't want
to use the model instead I want you just
listen to the event and bind it through
a different source
so here I'll add a script and on this
script here or in this script
I'll now export my default object as
always and here I'll simply add a method
on clothes where I will omit a new event
with this dollar sign eMED emit using
this built-in event emitter you chase
offers and I will name it dismissed you
can choose any name you want here and
that's actually all I won't pass any
data with that now here I don't use the
model therefore but I just mind you add
input and here I then execute on clothes
like that now let's see if that works
like that if I go to the signup to view
file here I'll add and UV layout row at
very top where I will hold this alert
later on with a reflex element X as 12
and on smaller screens it should also be
a bit smaller and in there and I want to
include that alert component I will make
it a global component so in the main dot
JS file I'll first of all import it so
I'll alert import the alert component
from dot slash components shared and
then the alert stop you file like that
and with that being imported I can now
register it here with view component and
then I'll name it app alert the alert
component like that so that's the
component registered we can now use that
selector here and you sign up as view
file to import it like this and here I
now want to listen to the dismissed
event that's the custom event we're
emitting here like this happens or this
is emitted if we actually do
miss the alert so here I want to listen
to that and I want to execute on
dismissed a method which I of course
have to implement here and yes you could
do that differently I'm just using this
setup because theoretically with that
you could use that alert component here
to not just display errors but anything
which can be dismissed and if I were to
handle on clothes in here in the alert
component and reach out to view X to
clear errors then this alert would be
bound to only handle errors because it
manipulates the state instead this is a
dump component it doesn't know what I
use it for and yes you will have to
adjust your text view output here but
with that this also means you can use it
by simply adding or omitting this
dismissed event and then we handle on
this mist in the component where we know
what we actually want to display so here
I'll add a new method on dismissed and
for now I will simply log it to see if
that works
dismissed alert now right now if we go
to the signup page again and we load
this we should always see the alert we
don't I'm including Yeller here well yes
make sense by default it's not showing
so here we have to sum a binary value
property either to true or false so bind
with a colon in front of it to bind it
to a dynamic value and it should always
be true here though because I always
want to show it now we see the error
here now if I click on that we see this
missed alert whenever I click it so
that's working with that we got the
logic we need to now also control when
we show it and I won't trigger that here
through value even though I could do
that but I can simply decide if I want
to attach this whole row here with vs
and there I now need to track we have an
error or not so for that let's go back
to the store and add a gather and here
I'll name this error I'll of course
X
state here and I will return state error
just like that whilst of already here I
can also return load in here because
that's the other news state we added an
L needed is to return state loading like
that so now I'm returning the error back
can you sign up a view file I can now
add a new computed property which I'll
also name error because here I will
return this store gathers error so the
error we just added with that error
property here this is now what I want to
bind here if that is no it will not be
displayed if it's anything but now we
will see the error now in on this missed
I therefore here one to dispatch a new
action this store dispatch clear error
of course because I want to get rid of
the error if I get rid of the error the
error getter will return null again and
that will then trigger we if to remove
this road and therefore the alert and it
will reappear if we get a new error now
of course I want to pass the error text
into that alert component so I will bind
with call and text to a text property
and pass error that message keep in mind
error has to be object which has a
message that's just something I define
in my application it's even now in which
case the thousand get executed because
the whole row isn't attached or it is
not object and in this case it needs to
have a message property now of course
the problem is that app alert doesn't
know a text property we could bind to so
we have to go to alert and add it why
are the props property here I want to
bind to a text property which I then
output here inside of my alert like this
with this setup let's save this and
let's see if it works let's open the
console enter something here like an
invalid password and let's click signup
and we do get the error here password
should be at least 6 characters close
this
then we get an error unknown action-type
clear error let's see did I miss type
that the action is named the action
doesn't exist we only have the mutation
right
so I obviously need to add it as action
to clear error because I'm dispatching
it as action and I want you to do that
so here all extract commit again and
here I will then commit clear error like
that I didn't have to do that for set
error because right now I'm only
committing set error here as part of
other actions which is fine so now we
have a clear error action let's try it
again let's maybe try a valid password
for the email address which is already
taken and we see the email address is
already in use by another account so
it's really nice that firebase gives us
this nicely formatted error messages now
closing also works they submit again I
get it again so that's nice as a last
piece in this video I want to disable
the button and show a spinner inside the
button whilst we are waiting for the
response and the cool thing is beautify
actually makes that simple if you check
out the button configuration here and
you scroll down a little bit you will
see that you have loaders which are
buttons you can click queue for example
see a spinner here here the icon loader
jitter looks pretty good so let's
inspect that code and you see that I can
loader your uses disks and with a loader
icon side of it and then also simply
gets disabled when it is loading and
binds to loading property when it is
loading so that is what I need to
implement I'll do that you signup to
view file here in my button where I have
sign up right now I'll add something
after sign up this span I copied here so
this span which will actually display DD
spinning circle whenever it is loading
so like that
I also now of course need to bind to
disable and to loading when it is
loading and for that I will bind to a
loading property so loading will be
bound to loading and loading here is
just a property made available by the V
button element whilst loading here is a
property I have to define and I will
define it as a computed property because
where will I get loading where will I
get this information if it's loading
from from my view X state right because
here we have that state or use the
mutation here's the loading state and we
set it to loading or to not loading in
our actions depending on whether we're
just starting or finishing so I can use
that information extracted here from the
Gator we also defined this store gathers
loading that's now referring to that
Gator we define down here to get that
loading state and with that we got
everything we need now let's try it out
let's go back to the application here
let's reload it maybe and let's try this
again let's submit a valid value here
click sign up yeah we saw it but let's
try it invalid one again it's not
spinning whoops let me quickly enter
some invalid values it's not spinning
the reason for this is that we didn't
copy all the code here just loading the
HTML code isn't enough notice the custom
loader class that isn't provided by
beautify by default instead you see the
style tab here here if you CSS code you
rarely have to do that but some
component examples here use as CSS code
so always check all the tabs here if
something isn't working so in this case
I'll just copy the style here and I
could copy it into my signup the view
file but I actually want to use the same
logic and logic in different places so
all instead use my main dot stylist file
where I change the theme
and here you cannot actually just copy
in normal CSS code you don't have to use
stylus syntax that will work so I'm now
I'm defining the custom loaded class
globally and with dead if we now let it
compile we try this again now you see
spend firebase is just so super quick
that you don't really see but if you
watch closely it does spin before we get
the error so that's nice let's now do
the same for these sign-in page that
should of course be simple we got the
logic in this signup page I'll first of
all copy the whole button here go over
to sign in and replace the button here
just make sure to rename it to sign-in
and what else did we change
well we added that alert at the top so
let's add the layout that row with the
alert at the top of that form too so
right after the initial container the
missing thing now is that we need to get
the computed properties so loading and
error and that we'll need to add the on
dismiss method so I'll do that
in sign in got view here first of all
add my Q computed properties and all the
copied on dismissed method from the
signup to view file and add it here in
on sign in the sign in to view file I
can get rid of the console log with the
dismissed error I guess so let's save
this and let's try it out that should be
all and that shows how reusable that
alert component already is here on the
sign-in page if we reload this and we
well try to sign in with something which
doesn't exist like test for didn't
create that there isn't a user that's
that's great and if we use a valid email
address but a wrong password well either
the user is invalid or the password so
we get an error message here Q and we
can dismiss it now let's try a valid
login data attempt here that's still
working so with that we enhance the the
off process we're using this space now
we're giving a better feedback to the
user
super important any application because
you obviously want to allow the user to
know where he is and what's happening I
hope this was helpful
can't wait to see you the other videos
