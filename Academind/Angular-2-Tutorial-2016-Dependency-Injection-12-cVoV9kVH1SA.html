angular 2 and that's where you will have
a look at dependency injection angular 2
and I'll bring out another video where
we will then actually use it in the code
now what is dependency injection well in
a nutshell we can describe like that we
have an object aid which needs an object
B to function correctly
now object a could just create a new
object B to work with that now that is
what we see on the slide in angular 2
well we have two components a and B if
you want to call it like this and both
will need a service which is just
another class which offers some
functionalities both components needs
now one possibility would be to for
example in the constructor to create a
new service object in each of those two
components like you see here on the
slide now doing it this way has some
downsides one disadvantage is that if
our service changes let's say it now the
constructor of the service changes
because the service itself might need
some other objects or whatever well then
we have to change it in both our
components so it's very hard to maintain
especially larger apps because well we
might need to go to several components
to make changes there if we make one
single change in our service which is
used by several components so that is
really not too great additionally it
makes testing a lot harder or even
impossible so not the best way to solve
this problem well what is a better way
well instead of just creating instances
of the service in our components well we
can inject it now injection basically
means that in the Constructors of our
components we tell alert you hey we need
an instance of this service and then we
bind it to a private property in the
components but we don't care how the
constructor looks we don't instantiate
it we just tell our framework or
dependency injection framework which
lives inside and or - so to say we need
an instance of this service you take
care that I get this instance okay so
dad is basically how dependency
injection works we need something to
work properly and we just tell our
framework englert you in this case you
take care that I get an instance of this
object now to actually get an instance
in angular 2 we have for when we're
talking about components here to add the
providers metadata to this components
class to tell alerts you how to create
such a service but telling alerts you
how to create a such a service does not
mean that we have to specify the
constructor of our service or anything
like that there now we just have to list
the service in an array but we will see
this in the next video when we're
actually writing some code showcasing
all of those different concepts now in
the example shown here on the slides we
inject our service in two different
components which are sibling components
in this example because both they are
living next to each other right now the
question is how many instances of our to
be injected object that's angular to
create one is a singleton or one for
each time aid and checks it into an
object because well it matters obviously
in terms of when we let say access or
manipulate a property in our injected
object from two different places and we
only have one instance well then a mini
manipulation by object a will also be
reflected object P if we access this
service on the injected object there
because what we only have one instance
of it and if this instance gets changed
well it gets changed all over the place
whereas whereas
we have different instances multiple
instances we don't have that problem but
we might have unnecessarily many
instances so either way you could argue
well you could argue it both directions
so how many instances does Englert you
create it depends and the case shown
here on the slide we have two components
living next to each other so let's say
there are a sibling components right in
this case and that you will create two
instances because we will have to tell
and let you how to create such a service
which should be injected here in each of
the components unless you use a
hierarchical injector which means if we
inject something on a root component it
is also usable into child components and
those components will then share only
one instance however if we inject it
into several well sibling components so
to say we create a new instance each
time we do this basically we create a
new instance each time we specifically
tell angular to how to create such an
object now that's all the theory behind
dependency injection in a nutshell
obviously you could go much more into
detail there but that is how it works
generally in angle Q and I will have
another video where we will actually try
some of these things in a real well mini
application or with real code so see you
there and have a nice day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
