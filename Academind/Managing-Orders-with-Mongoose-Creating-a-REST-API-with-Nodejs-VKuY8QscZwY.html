where we build a restful api with nodejs
the previous videos we had a look at how
we work on our products and how we store
products in the database and that's all
working now when I work on the orders
and the interesting part here of course
is that orders are connected to products
so let's dive into that in this video
so let's start working on that and the
first thing I want to do is I want to
create a model for my orders so I
ordered J's file now copy the logic from
the product JS file to import non-use
and export a model at the end though the
schema will be named order schema and
I'll name the model order - now how
should that look like do I want to have
an ID and whatever unique ID per order I
also need one important piece of
information I need to know which product
was ordered
now you could of course create a way
more complex setup where you have carts
so shopping carts which comprise a
couple of our products and quantities I
want to start and stick simple here I
want to say okay I got an order and that
order is connected to one product which
I ordered so how does this work then
I'll add a product key and I'll set this
equal to an object now the type here
will actually also be an object ID
because I will store the ID of the
product which is related to this order
now there's something important we're
now creating like a relation and MongoDB
is a non relational database you can
kind of rebuild these relations as we're
about to do that and that is okay to
some degree but if you find yourself
building a lot of relations and sticking
very much in that sequel database world
then you might indeed wanna pick a
sequel database because you might not
need the advantages of a no sequel
database like MongoDB but you will just
get all the disadvantages if you work
with a lot of relations now this one
relation here that's perfectly fine but
I just want to bring this to your
attention so let's set up the relation
here then and as I said first of all
let's assign you type to be an object ID
and then there's an important keyword
ref you need to use ref here to
configure this
type and ref should now hold a string
with the name of the model you want to
connect this model to know if we have a
look at our product JS file we see that
the name is product so it's this name we
assigned here and that's the name I now
always use here I want to connect this
schema with my product and with that I
store my order where I say we ordered
this product now let's say a product or
excuse me an order also knows a quantity
here we could set a type to be number
and we can set required to true because
I want to have a quantity on each order
you could of course also make this
optional and you could also say okay I
might not require it I'll just set a
default which is one that's also an
option now just required and default
together don't make a lot of sense but
in this case you're saying you don't
need to pass me a quantity if you pass
me nothing I'll use that default of one
so we'll always store a quantity in the
database it's just going to be our
default quantity if no data there are no
additional information is passed and
that is a very simple order look at the
product we got the quantity the price as
part of the product so we can calculate
the total price and with that we got a
schema setup for orders now let's use
that scheme and our order J's file
before we fetch all orders let's work on
hosting them now for that I'll import
two things I'll import Mongoose to
create an ID so I'll simply require
Mongoose here and I will of course also
import my order model from the models
file and there from the order J's file
with there we can create a new order so
I'll create an order but I'll treat it
differently with new order so using our
model as a constructor which we can of
course and then passing a JavaScript
object where we will configure it now
I'll set the ID equal to Mongoose types
object ID executed as a function to
automatically generate an idea then I
can set the quantity to request body
quantity though that might not be sad
sodas might be null but it should still
work we'll see if it does and I also
need to set my product and now this
needs to be the idea of the product
we're connected to and I expect to get
this a request body product ID maybe
this also means that back in the order
model we probably want to set this to be
required so that we can't pass null here
so back here in our order J's file the
routes file we're now creating our order
or storing it in the database where
we're trying we're setting it up we
cannot store it by a chaining save and
then on save we can chain then or
actually we can't chain exit to turn it
into a real promise then and catch are
also provided on the return values by
default but that's they're not a real
problems with the ex ecute is so now we
can add them and catch and then we can
use the result we're getting back here
you may be log it to the console and of
course to also resend a status code of
201 where we essentially for now send a
simple results but response we're going
to find you this where a just return the
result and when we catch an error I'm
going to console lock that error here
and I'm going to return a response with
status code 500 where I send an error or
property that holds the error we got and
I'll remove the default damage response
we used previously let's find out if
that works now for that let's go back
and let's first of all get the list of
products and restart our server first of
all so let's get a list of products
maybe this one with that ID let's copy
the ID let's create a new post request
which targets slash orders to send a
post
to that endpoint not send a JSON body
which should be a normal JSON object
where I do set you know this is
important where I do set quantity and
product ID so I'll add product ID as a
key here and past the idea just copied
and I'll set quantity as a key here and
set this to two now if I had sent or I
get an error accident work
yeah true we're saving here so generally
that was true
exit gives you a real promise whereas
normal queries and save is not a curious
this but queries we're used find for
example these give you back a Venn
method but no catch method and then you
can use X Act to turn it into a real
promise for save you actually get a real
promise by default so that out of the
way let's try that again now here we see
we created a new object with its own ID
which is different to the Product ID of
course we store it the product ID and we
got the quantity of two now let's all
try not passing a quantity if I now hit
Send we see we also get this default
quantity of 1 and if I now don't send an
ID so I don't send anything we get an
error that the product is required which
makes sense so now we can successfully
create new orders let's make sure we can
also view all orders by going to our
general get route here and let's use
order here together with fine with no
arguments to find all orders if you pass
an argument to find it would be an
object that describes the object you
want to find just as we use the for
update and delete but here I want to
find all orders and I simply will
execute X X to again turn it into a real
promise here and then chain then and
catch and then let's see what we can do
here let's use all the docs we get back
and for now simply return them with a
status code of 200 Jason Docs like that
and for an error I will send a status
code of
500 where I said Jason to an object were
we store and return the error now if
dad's setup let's save this and let's
try it out by sending a get request to
orders like this for hit Send here I get
all the orders I did create so the two
with quantity two I stored and the one
with quantity one so this is now my get
request
now let's already work on the response
layout so here for example I don't want
to return that the part and I want to
return more information than just the
array of items so I'll add select prior
to exit and just select the product and
the quantity field and the ID let's say
and then again here I'll return an
object where I have count which is Doc's
length and where I then also have my
orders which is now docks and where I
have my request object let's say with a
type of get because I also want to
support details on our individual order
so get to a URL which would be HTTP
localhost 3,000 orders slash and then it
would be our ID of that document now to
get this back I made a mistake
of course shouldn't return orders like
this I should map it here to get the
individual doc and then return a new
object here for that document we got
where I then have my ID that a stock
underscore ID where I have my product
that is dark Product ID so just excuse
me just product what we got here suggest
product and when we didn't got the
quantity which is stock quantity and
where we then pass our request object
and where we now can use dark underscore
ID like this now if we save this we get
the same logic as an hour
product routes I get this more
structured response with more
information the same makes sense for
creating a new object here if we
succeeded I might want to return a
message where I say order stored and
where I then pass a URL where you can
get more information like the type here
you could then set the type to get and
the URL would essentially be the same as
we use up here so I can just copy that
URL down to this return a response here
access it on the result I get this is
the object that was created and of
course also maybe have a created order
object here that holds the information
about the created order and there we
could output the ID from result ID the
product from result product and of
course the quantity from result quantity
and if we tried that out by creating a
new order by sending a post request to
orders with the body we used before but
maybe with a valid product ID so let's
reuse that product ID we already used in
the past if you do it like this product
ID should be the key name here then we
store this and we see that nice a
response by the way if we pass an
invalid ID for a product doesn't exist
we also store debt so this also works
now we're storing a bunch of orders on
products that don't actually exist in
the database so that is something we'll
have to make sure that it doesn't happen
so let's turn or let's add some logic to
control this we want to make sure that
we can't create new orders for products
for products we don't have so here in
our post method in the orders J's file
now first of all check if we actually do
have a product for a given ID now to do
that I'll import product here
by calling required and going to the
models folder and then the product file
and then I can use a static method on
product here call find PID and search
for a request body Product ID and now
what I can do is if this succeeds then I
want to continue with creating the order
otherwise I want to return an error here
I will simply return a response with
status code 500 where I return an object
where I say message product not found
and as always you could all return some
machine readable error code here and
pass the detailed error object now in
the Dan block here I'll actually get my
product or my document but it is a
product let's knit maybe name it like
this and then in here I can execute the
average code here to store that new to
store it that new order however now we
have a nice level of nesting which we
don't want when using promises so what
we can do is I can simply return orders
safe which does return a promise as you
see and then I can use that the ban and
the catch blocks and chain them after
here just means that this catch block
here isn't too useful anymore because
it'll never execute because we have this
outer catch block here so now with that
we got a set up where I check if we do
have a product before I then try to save
it and we then execute all the our steps
for creating the order and for it
returning a response and if we don't
have our product here well then we'll
get into disk catch block where we
return the error anyways
so now with that if we save this and we
try again to create a product which has
an invalid ID it still succeeds do you
know why well remember what we did in
that products jeaious
file there we also check we do find a
product here but we check this in a
success case because remember if you
pass an ID for which no product is found
then you don't get an error
you just get null for product in this
case so actually we want to check that
if product if not product which means if
it's knowledge then we want to return
the response where we set the status
code to 404 and where we then can return
our response where we may be say message
product not found and yeah that's it and
since I returned all subsequent code
won't be executed in this case now with
dad if I send this now I get product not
found here and with that again if I do
get all my products and I dare for fetch
a valid ID of a product and I now create
a post request to orders again and I do
use such a valid ID it again succeeds so
this works but we can't store orders for
products we don't have which of course
is very useful now let's continue let's
get information about the individual
order well there we can't just use
product excuse me not product order and
call find by ID and pass request parents
order ID as an argument because we named
it order ID here call X sector turn it
into a real promise and then use catch
and then again and here we'll get our
document
you couldn't alter name it order because
it is an order whatever you want
and you can return a response with
status code 200 and then there a JSON
object where again we can pass our
information about the object we got so
there we could now return order and that
is equal to the order argument we get
here from Mongoose and add our request
metadata object where we can say yeah
you can
course send us a get request maybe to
the following URL to get all requests so
the URL would be H via local host 3000
slash orders to get all the orders and
that's just one example we could use as
always and that here in the error case I
want to return a response with status
killed 500 where we use Jason to of
course all returned an object where I as
always wrap this error in my error
property now with that finally for all
let's try it out I guess
so let's first of all copy that order ID
we have here and let's try a get request
to this order ID and there we go now we
also get that link to fetch all orders
we can click on that and we see all the
orders we created quite a bit so time
for a delete function and let's work on
that delete function here there again I
can use order and then remove and pass
an object to identify what I want to
remove I want to remove that object that
has an ID that matches my request
parents order ID property because again
I named it order ID here and then I can
chain x''k then and catch and a so often
in catch I just want to return my error
so I'm going to copy that code and you
could of course also outsource this into
some general function you then always
call that returns this response and in
the Dan block I want to return a
response so I get my result here won't
return a response where I essentially
have a message that could be order
deleted and the request could suggest to
create a new order by posting to orders
and there we needed to send an object a
body where we will pass the product ID
which will be an ID whatever type you
want to describe here and then
quantity which is a number something
like that now if we do that let's again
get all orders because we certainly have
too many and then let's fetch one of the
orders maybe this one and let's now try
sending a delete request to this
endpoint if I do that the order was
deleted indeed and if I try to get
information for that order it fails
orders now because we don't find it now
that of course means that in our get
requests here where we find by ID I
should also add a if check if not order
so if it's null as is in the example I
just ran was then I probably want to
return a response where I set the status
code to 404 and return an object where I
say message order not found so that I
avoid having cases like this where I get
order now which you could use if that's
your requirement but I don't want it now
if I try to fetch details for an order
that doesn't exist I get a 404 error and
that again was a lot of work but now we
worked on the orders side queue we're
storing that relation now querying this
relation and in general now working with
all that data and seeing how we can
further evolve our restful api is what
we'll dive into next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
