firebase project the last video we added
the code to be able to add a new meter
well a basic one at least still a couple
things not working but it is a nice
place to start
now what enhanced is page by adding a
date and time picker so that we don't
actually use the hard-coded current date
and time which is never a great choice
for a meetup which probably should be
somewhere in the future but allow the
user who creates a meetup to pick an
appropriate date and time will use the
date and time Pickers beautify gives us
and I say let's dive right into that
as I said unify offers us nice
components to work of data and time
under Pickers here you will find date
and time Pickers and they're really
simple to implement
you can either implement them as a
dialog which pops up or simply as a
component which is always visible in
your form you may choose whichever
approach or whichever style you like
here I'll go to Stahl where it's simply
always visible in the form though I will
later all show the dialog option later
in these in this series when we actually
add a different place in the application
where we can edit existing meetups
so for now this is the code we could use
in a form anywhere we want the date
picker is the date picker V time picker
will be the time picker so in our create
meetup application I'll actually add a
new layout and you will row above the
submit button here this will all be a
row v-flex
and I'll give this excess 12 and there I
will simply say h4 choose a date and
time and it's not just the XS 12 it
should of course be all that sm6 and be
offset q look nice on bigger screens too
with that I'll copy that create a new
row below that and here or actually add
the well the Pickers first of all for
example here I'll add the V date picker
like that V date picker if I just do it
like that and we save this go back to
the application we already see the
picker here now it's missing a prop
value and a little fix this soon this is
how it'll look like now I'll duplicate
this to also add the armed the time
picker below that and now if we save
this whoops without a empty space now if
we save this we get date and time
Pickers sitting here we may ignore these
errors will fix students that them soon
and of course you could also change the
styling take more
within general for your form and squeeze
them next to each other I'll stick with
this style here and I'll add a bottom
margin cue my first row here actually
with the day picker so add class March
to bottom q maybe now with that regard
this margin here below that again feel
free to change the styling if you don't
want to have it the distribute like this
you can always change the form to a
different layout these Pickers don't
work as of now though we get an error
because we're not passing a value in
there and they expect to get or to be
bound to a property so here I'll
actually add a date property and a time
property both a string for now however
here I'm going to use a new date if I
create like that it's going to be today
and if I do the same for time that's all
today of course and now I want to bind
that so on both I'll at bind v-model
for the date bigger a bigger I'll bind
it to date for the time picker to time
so using data and time these new few
properties and I want to see what I
actually pick so below the picker I'll
simply add a paragraph where an output
well here it should be date and time and
that's just for debugging here basically
so that I can see how I get it back so
now you see that is the time string we
created with new date if I now reload
the error also should be gone it picks
the time I'm recording to that now if I
change just to 19th July you see now it
changed to just this string and this is
what you will actually get back you can
change the format of the day you get
back check out the documentation here
for more information about how to
configure the bigger pickers for the
time if I change it to 11:30 maybe now
you see this is what I get back you can
change this to a 24-hour style I'll
stick to a.m. p.m. for now this is what
you get back this is what you probably
want to work with and this is what I
will work with I just want to highlight
or show you what
kind of days you will receive now to
work with that we want to stored it and
I actually want to store it as a normal
date string so like the string we have
here initially once we didn't click or
when we didn't click it is parsed and
understood by the Pickers as you can see
this is what we created with new date
and this is what I want to convert the
date I picked back into the question
just is how do we do that because
especially for the time it's kind of
difficult because we got this am/pm
thing at the end so how can we parse
this will do that in oncreate meetup
when we submit the form however I can
already do in a computed property I'll
maybe name this submit able date/time
very long then you may of course choose
a different one what I want to do here
is I want to return a day time which is
formatted and I will first create it I
will create a new date which uses this
state and even though that will be
something like 2000 17-0 7-17 and
nothing else once we clicked in the date
picker that is parsable by new date
constructor and should give us a valid
date I can simply lock that here so we
see it whenever it recalculates and
return date here at the end so if I now
output this maybe below
arm my button here like here and it's
just 3/4 for debugging some outputting
the submittal date time do that here and
then I click there you now see a login a
console can also confirm it down there
this is what it creates for us the time
is lost because they don't use that
right now but the date that should work
so the date was simple now I want you
all to store the hours and minutes now
it's super simple as long as we haven't
clicked yet because then you also have a
date object there remember we do pass a
date object into the V time picker time
those properties and we hold a new date
so if we haven't touched a picker yet
it's super simple to actually get the
real date
on the date I created here which doesn't
have to correct
minutes and hours I can simply call set
hours and set this - well - what -
actually this time get ours and this
time refers to this time property which
is unchanged as long as you didn't click
in the time picker and the same for the
minutes so here I can set this minutes
to well get minutes so if we do that you
will see that if I reload this page we
actually get the correct time output
there that's the exact same time we did
select here as soon as we click on a
different time it breaks though because
now get our skip minutes doesn't work
anymore because this time now it's just
as a normal string that is what your
time picker gives us back just a string
so now for that we need to do we need to
handle that case - so here I'll first of
all check which type we have with the
type of keyword I can check what this
time actually is is it a string string
is a JavaScript type even though we
don't explicitly assign types JavaScript
still knows types it's an weakly type
language a dynamic typed language if it
is a string then I need a different
method for retrieving and setting the
hours else I assume it's a date then we
can easily set hours and minutes like
this now it's a string portion which we
need to handle in this case I need to
retrieve the hours from the string and
I'll use a regular expression for that
the match function I can get a certain
part of that string and the regular
expression I'll use and you can always
Google regular expressions like this
like for retrieve hours in hours :
minutes format that should give you a
regular expression so here I'll actually
retrieve the digits and I get back an
array where I'm interested in the second
off check with index one this will be my
hours the minutes use almost the same
regular expression however here I'm not
using the digits at the beginning of the
string
instead I'll use the digits after the :
then again it's all the digits after the
colon and use the first at the second
element of the array you get back and
you can always log the result of this
time match to see if that is what you're
looking for
so that's hours and minutes now let's
try using date set hours and set the
hours here and date set minutes and set
the minutes here now if we do that we
lock the day here still and reload the
page don't get an error and now click on
one year you see that this actually sets
it to 149 which is what I see here if I
change this to 0 1 0 that's looking fine
it's using my time zone here as a Seidel
which is exactly what I want and it's
fine because the time zone gets stored
here too however they switch to p.m.
that doesn't change that's still 1
so we're not encoding the a.m. p.m.
portion here yet we're just storing that
it's 1 but it doesn't matter if with
that a.m. or p.m.
so for asked that of course does matter
so we should use the 24-hour format here
instead q well get the correct value for
a.m. or p.m.
so how do we do that now to fix the
issue of a.m. p.m. there are two ways
you can either also use a regex
expression to retrieve it if it's a.m.
or p.m. and simply add 12 to the hour if
it's p.m. that should do the trick
or also to make sure that this picker
gets used correctly across all cultures
and to make this crystal clear you can
also use a different setup or
configuration for the time picker which
you can find on the beautify
configuration you can change the format
from AM PM to 24-hour so if you simply
add the format property in zetas to
24-hour like that
now what this does is you've got 24-hour
picker you're obviously and now you
reload the page so you can really see
this
you see that clearly is Q am here but if
I go back to the hours and pick QP M
which is 14 o clock you see that's
correct - and this is the alternative
now all later in the series come back to
the am/pm picker to also show that once
we added an event
- well I'll show you can work with a and
p.m. but for now if this is how we'll
use this and with that we added the date
pickers now let's make sure that we also
store this once this get submitted so
after you submit able date time I'm
retrieving here can't get rid of the
console log statement and I'm now
getting a date which actually is the
format I wanted to be now all I need to
do is here for date I don't use new date
anymore instead I use my this submit
able date time computed property which
is always up to date whenever I type so
this is what I will submit this is what
I will use and restore therefore it now
of course what I also want to do with
that is that I output all the
information I have so on the single
meetup page right now here that's G that
I don't like that the place here I can
of course use meetup location and I can
also output the description here so
meetup description as a side note since
I use string interpolation there's no
room for cross-site scripting attacks
that's really good too
now missing thing is in the store I also
want to fine-tune the damming meetups I
have here I want to give them a location
and description to user that that works
on our updated single miga page - so
your location that would be New York and
obviously you might enter more precise
location like we're in New York
sounds helpful if you want to meet and
here I'll add a description to it
Paris and let's also add one here
description New York New York so that
it's a set of I want to work with back
in our application all picked a picture
from the for again enter that here give
it a title Munich Helles meet up at
marienplatz Munich awesome let's pick up
date 20 July
let's pick 17 o'clock so 5:00 p.m. here
and let's click create meet up we
redirected you see here that's 2017 22
July dime is wrong you could say it's 15
but it's not really wrong different time
zone I was GMT +2
this is GMT so if you add to your back
to 5 clocks that is fine it's normalized
you could say and if you view any of
these meetups at your work locations
display it descriptions display it the
same for our own meetup now again we
have to work on date probably that's not
100% in the state I want it to be but we
will do so and we'll do so in the next
videos so hope to see you there
