video on this channel where I show how
to use rx shares in a view chess project
and as you learnt there you don't need
anything else than these two things view
and RX shares however there is a special
package created by the view chess
creators which makes implementing rxjs
or this react functionality into AB UF
even easier I'm talking about view Rx
and I'm on the official get up page here
a link can be found in the video
description now this isn't required as
you saw in the other video but it can
make it a bit easier to work with
observables a bit more convenient
actually the documentation on the scaler
page is pretty good as is the case for
most beauteous talks but I will still
walk you through the basics fall back to
this page if you want to learn more
about it though so first of all we
should install view rx so back in my
project and I'm in the project which
actually is in the mentioned last video
you can also find a link to that in the
video description so in this project I
will run NPM install view rx and I'll
add - they're safe to store an entry in
the package store JSON file now as you
know this will now install the package
and we're ready to use it the first
thing we need to do is we need to make
view aware of this new package so in the
main dot JS file I'll import view rx
from view rx now I not only need that I
also need to tell view rx what it should
work with an observable a subject a
couple of things and you can again
consult your official Docs for more info
on that I will use an observable so I
need to import observable from rxjs
observable and only import what you're
planning to add to this base package so
here I can now use view and the use
method to add this plug-in and I will
use view rx and at past a second
argument here that'll be an object
configuring this plug-in and here I
simply pass observable now of course
this is a JavaScript object so we should
have key value pairs I'm using the es6
some text where just will automatically
be expanded to observable observable
like this I'm just taking the shorter
route here so what's that we do have
viewer X configured and being aware of
that observable object so now a view rx
can handle things like subscriptions
because that's part of that observable
object I now want to use it and we can
use it in our component just like the
data method it's actually pretty close
we add a new property to the Drude
object it's called subscription as
subscriptions excuse me and it's called
as a method just like data is to make
sure that each component has its own
object therefore subscriptions returns
and objects just like data again we can
actually get rid of data now and instead
in subscriptions add this count property
which were outputting in the template
and this time however we're not
assigning a value like 0 we're assigning
and observable so I can simply copy that
code observable interval and add it here
as a value for account please note that
I'm not subscribing to it
data stand by view rx that is the reason
why we made it aware of how observables
work by passing it here so that it knows
how to subscribe and it will obscure
I've automatically so right now count
without put this incrementing number and
I can prove this by commenting out
everything in the created method and
running our development server with NPM
run death make sure that you still have
that observable import here though
because even though you did add it in
main dot j s that is only for the view
RX plugin to be aware of it we are using
it here q here so if we use a certain
object we need to have it available in
that file where we use it so we need to
import it here otherwise Java Script
won't find it so with that and the
development server started let's go back
to our view rx application and there you
will see that indeed we have our
incrementing number and the nice thing
is we're using this like data we simply
set up our property without putting this
property in the template and we simply
find a reactive value and observable
instead of our hard-coded or a
synchronous value like a number that is
pretty cool of course we're not limited
to that we can still use our filter here
so I can simply copy that filter and
chain it also chain it the new line of
course make sure that you all the import
filter as you do with interval because
we're still using it and s tile that's
important and once that I can also get
rid of created because I'm not using it
anymore and now if I hit save and go
back to my application reload it you see
we start at zero then we see two then we
will see four and six only the even
numbers so the same functionality as in
my other video but now achieved with the
viewer X package which automatically
subscribes now the viewer X package
offers a bit more features than just
that though that is one of the most
important features if you want to see
more let me know I hope this was helpful
and if you want to type people right now
have a look at the official Docs for
that urx package also link in the video
description which are Bridget rate on
the github page these talks I mean so
have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
