I get asked about quite often in the
comments
I'm Maximilian and in this video I'll
dive into the question single page
applications versus multi-page
applications or MVC Model View
controller applications which approach
should you choose and when should you
choose it let's have a look
so that's a question I get quite a lot
should you create a single page
application use a framework like angular
for that or should you create a
multi-page application for example with
node express or with laravel for PHP and
I often sometimes see the comparison
single page application versus MVC Model
View controller now that comparison to
begin with that isn't super accurate
because model D controller is more is a
pattern where you basically get a get a
clear approach on how to structure your
files structure your project and make
sure that you split the responsibilities
of your app in a certain way now that
it's not necessarily the opposite of a
single page application so I like to
compare single page versus multi page
applications but let's first have a look
at what is each of these two things how
do we see or how do we recognize what is
a single page application and what is a
multi page application let's have a look
here's the website of the New York Times
obviously a news page page living of
presenting news which people read so
articles which people read I can tell
you the New York Times page is a multi
page application how can you see that
let's click an article and watch this
reload I can here in the top left of my
browser you see how it becomes an X data
because my browser is now reaching out
to the server of the New York Times and
fetching that article is all the
resources needed for this article
resources would be images but of course
also CSS or JavaScript because there is
JavaScript on this page too if I expand
this for example that handled by a
Chavez script so one thing which is
sometimes perceived an incorrect way is
that single page applications would use
JavaScript and multi page applications
would not that is incorrect
a multi page application is what we well
the only thing we created a couple of
years ago basically and obviously we did
use javascript there too the interesting
thing about a multi page application is
that if we open the developer tools and
go to the network tab that indeed
every new page we fetch is downloaded
that is why you see if I click on the
main page get a couple downloads all the
images everything but if you closely
watch this section on the right and I
click on this article again well now it
is downloaded again so here we fetch a
brand new page with different assets
this is the interesting part or that is
what happens in the multi page
application every request we send to the
server so whenever we type a new URL or
click on a link leads to a new page
being sent back from the server now that
could be a pure HTML page and a couple
of assets used in a page like CSS and
JavaScript and that would still be a
multi-page application and then we would
get different HTML pages for different
URLs we enter or the server is using
some server-side language like PHP or
node and renders this HTML page on the
server again so for example when using
label it could use the blade templating
engine literal ships with to render HTML
for which it sends back the core
takeaway is that we always get a new
file for every request
that's a multi-page application the
whole website the New York Times website
here consists of multiple pages which we
download when we visit different parts
of the page now the opposite would be
the angle I Oh page the official page of
the angular framework but of course
there are way more single page
applications than just this one now this
is a single page application and the
quickest way to tell is if you click on
something let's say on the dog's watch
again this real icon you see that it
didn't spin at all
same for resources no matter what I
click here most links or probably all
links here will not trigger a page
reload or will not trigger a new page
being fresh a pet from the server
instead we can see what happens if in
Spector's page - and go to the elements
tab now let's expand this and let's not
expand this AIO shell here if i now go
back to getting started you see a bunch
of the parts here was rear-ended a bunch
of the web page was rear-ended and
if I go to tutorial here in click on
introduction again parts of the page
were rear-ended and that is what a
single page application does we only get
one page one from the server only one
there will never be a second page we
fetched no matter where we click instead
this one page also downloads a bunch of
asset CSS images but typically also a
lot of JavaScript because it's then this
JavaScript code which will listen to you
RL changes to clicks on links and will
then rerender parts of the Dom in the
loaded page whenever we need to do
something whenever we for example switch
the page by clicking a link keep in mind
we don't switch it we just change parts
off the page so javascript listens to
that for example and then re renders
parts of the dom now you could write all
the logic on your own typically though
you use a framework like angular react
view to do that so that you have some
helpers in this task of rerender in the
dom listening to route changes and so on
that is a single page application and
one big advantage you can already see
here is that it's super fast whenever we
click somewhere things have to instantly
were instantly taken there that's like
the feeling we know from mobile or
desktop apps there also when we click
somewhere things happen super fast
because even if we need to load some
data from the server again and that
certainly is also the case for single
page applications if we need to fetch
some user or some article data that
happens behind the scenes so the
application test website still reaches
out to the server more than once that is
not the thing but it will never get a
new HTML file back it will only get some
typically JSON data which JavaScript and
again can handle to parse it and well
render something on the page and was the
disturbing so we might see a spinner so
that is how it works we never load new
pages only data and therefore for the
user it always feels like the page is
instantly change even if we need to wait
for data then we present some nice
spinner and that is the
user experience of a single page
application now with that leads us to
the question is a single page
application always better than a
multi-page application the answer is no
let's compare some advantages and
disadvantages of both approaches let's
start with the single page application
there we have two highly reactive
behavior as a huge advantage is behavior
which feels like a mobile or a desktop
app when we click somewhere things
happen instantly
we never have to wait or it doesn't feel
like waiting that is a huge advantage
and the reason the major reason or a
single page applications are so popular
these days a lot of the typical business
applications running the browser like
slack or Google Adsense for example use
single page applications because even
though it runs in the browser it is like
a desktop app right if you use slack for
example it really feels like a desktop
app and yes there is a desktop after
well up to but the thing is in the
browser it is a single page application
because things happen super fast and we
want that behavior in a lot of the apps
we also have a decoupled front end
that's another advantage if you're
creating a single page application you
don't need to write any server-side code
typically in bigger developer teams you
have some guys focusing on the back end
on the server-side code and they will
create an API to which you can reach out
from your single page application from
your front-end so in angular for example
you have the angular HTTP service to
send requests to the backend and you
don't need to worry about the back edge
you will know where to send requests to
in which kind of data you can expect to
get back you can focus on the front-end
on the on the JavaScript code obviously
on writing your logic on the front that
but also on the styling restructure you
have a decoupled front-end and that can
make it much easier to work on that page
there are of course some other
advantages you could list a bigger
disadvantage though is that search
engine optimization can be challenging
there are tools and actually innovation
there is rapid so a lot of new things
are coming up every day actually when it
comes to this but right now it still is
kind of complicated or at least takes
quite some advanced knowledge to make
your single page application
supera SEO friendly because crawlers
like the Googlebot can parse JavaScript
and can understand your page even if you
render it with JavaScript but they have
big problems if you're loading the
content asynchronously and that happens
a lot on single page applications that's
this spinner
thing right we visit a page and that
page loads instantly keep in mind we
don't really visit a new page just some
parts of the Dom change and to the
crawler everything is done at this point
the crawler doesn't know there is more
data to arrive and that this data will
eventually be rendered on the page so to
the crawler if you're loading a list of
blog articles the crawler might just see
the spinner and that of course does
really miss the point of search engine
optimization so that's challenging there
are tools but it requires advanced
knowledge most of the time now an hour
disadvantage could be that you
absolutely require JavaScript now
obviously most people have that turned
on but a single page application just
can't run without JavaScript everything
happens through JavaScript everything
gets rear-ended fruit JavaScript if it's
turned off your page won't work at all
another thing which is not necessarily a
disadvantage but also important to
mention is that single page applications
tend to favor more modern browsers now
support for older browsers isn't that
bad typically you won't see Internet
Explorer 8 support in a single page
application if you need that as a
different story
but if you want to optimize for as many
browsers as possible you can also hit
limits when creating a single page
application on the other hand to focus
on at least a little bit more modern
browsers gives you way more tools and
things you can do with your application
that's why it's not necessarily a
disadvantage what about a multi page
application then their search engine
optimization is a big advantage
obviously since you get a brand new page
which already holds the finished content
for every request the user sees what the
crawler sees
and therefore your your search engine
crawlers will really fetch what is on
your page and that make search engine
optimization way easier another
advantage in my opinion is that well we
only both multi page applications until
a couple of years ago and still today
the majority of the web pages are multi
page applications hence there are a lot
of best practices approaches examples
tutorial solutions frameworks which
embrace that concept right which allow
you to create multi page applications
and therefore it might be much easier
especially as a new developer to get
into creating web pages when working
with this multi page application
approach there are things which are
simply easier because you got more
resources to learn them that shouldn't
of course not be the final criterion
which you decide what you want to build
but it is a criteria in the end because
if things are easier to learn use and
well create crates and secure
applications with that is definitely
noteworthy there are disadvantages to
basically the opposite of the advantages
of the single page application you could
say we have slower pages in that we need
to fetch new pages for every request
with wait for that now if your server
slow your application is slow and even
though you still would have to wait for
data to be fetched in a single page
application to there you at least see a
spinner and the majority of the page was
loaded on a multi page application
nothing is loaded if you winter the new
page and that can lead to a worse user
experience because you constantly have
to wait for the whole page to load not
an absolute nightmare of course but
definitely a worse user experience than
in single page applications and we have
a tighter coupling of front-end and
back-end since your server is the one
sending the HTML pages or the
server-side rendered pages you
typically we'll have one process or one
bigger project where you have to service
I logic for example in your controllers
and your models and then you have two
views and yes obviously the views would
be created by front-end developers but
they still need to be aware of the
server-side environment you're working
in the server-side language which will
render the views in the end and that is
certainly not impossible to handle but
might be a disadvantage might be easier
in a single-page application you can
just hire an angular expert and let him
create a application for you and you can
use your PHP level back-end and your
angular expert doesn't have to think
about the connection of the two at all
now on the other hand or just like on
the single page application case there
is one neutral point in my opinion
multi-page applications tend to have a
better support for legacy browsers
because they not depend on JavaScript as
much they certainly use it to enhance
the individual pages to add some
reactive elements to them but they're
not as dependent as single page
applications and for that reason they
typically support more browsers which
you might matter to you too so that's my
competition of course basically my
opinion or what I find to be important
please let me know in the comment
section what you think about it which
other things matter to you which are
advantages to you see for single page or
multi page applications in case you're
now wondering well what should I choose
it really depends on your project here
at some point probably more points to be
found in the comment section there is no
super right or super wrong here
typically its search engine optimization
super important to you right now you
still might want to pick a multi page
application if you're creating more like
an in-browser business application like
slack or something like that a single
page application might be a great
solution for you I hope this video was
helpful and hopefully see you in future
