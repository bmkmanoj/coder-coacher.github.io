Max and I'm excited to get started with
this series I already show you where I
showed you the final project and the
first video of this playlist together
with you in this video we're going to
create the concept behind our
application so we're going to draw a
little bit and see which components we
actually meet before we dive into the
technical implementation in the next
video so let's get started
so let's get started and as I show you
in the first video of this playlist the
application we're going to build is like
a meet-up organizing application where
people are able to create new meetups
and register or unregister for me depth
of course for that will also have an
authentication flow because we need of
medicated users to register for meters
or create new meetups and whilst this
application does sound simple I guess it
covers a lot of features from the view
universe we're going to use to be router
UX it's going to cover a third party
package beautify which gives us a nice
set of components we can use which look
nice and which work knives and we're
going to use firebase on the backend to
have some place where we store our users
where we store the meetups where we
store files associated with the meetups
and where we can then actually work with
all of that so let's get started with
the drawing part though as I said I'm in
this video I want to start by
conceptualizing this application so see
which building blocks we need and how it
should actually look like now typically
of course you don't have the advantage I
have that you already start with a rough
concept of course I already built the
application to prepare it
that was the app I showed you in the
teaser video but still a typical process
is that you know which product you want
to build and there's the thought of
which we're going to start now
for that let me draw a little bit we're
going to build our dev meet-up
application I hope you can read this I'm
drawing this life so if it's not super
pretty I'm sorry about that
so that's our def meetup application
let's start with the starting screen I
like to start from the visuals so by
starting to draw what the end product
should look like of course I have two
features in mind prior to death but by
starting to draw it and starting to
design or create or come up with an user
interface it's pretty clear how all
these pieces should be connected and how
the flow of X should be in our
application and that is what I want to
highlight here so that
see starting page here and on this
starting page let's maybe make this
navigation bar a little bit wider so
that we have some flat place writer I
want to have two well a brand on the
left and if you click this it should
chest take us back to that starting page
here I guess so maybe we draw this in
here too just takes us back the more
interesting part is going to be on the
right here there I want to have three
items I want to go to a list of meetups
so your meet ups I want to be able to
create a new one and I want to be able
to well visit my user profile basically
and we're only going to create a dummy
profile here but of course it's easy to
come up with a more complex profile or
you could change your settings and so on
so these are the free navigation icons
or the free navigation items now from a
visual perspective we're going to make
that more beautiful in the real app
we're going to use icons here and so on
but that is the general idea behind it
now on the starting page of course we
don't just have the navigation we're
going to have the navigation on each
page actually on the starting page what
we'll also have is let's say a caruso
step pronounced correctly I don't know
so basically an image which gets
replaced automatically which flips
through a couple of images and the image
is taken here are actually images from
meetups so here I basically want to flip
through existing featured meetups and
for that we need to grab a set of
featured meetups will implement the
color to do so - of course and if we
click on one of these cards I want to be
taken to the individual meetup page then
we don't have that page yet but that is
the idea have this caruso which flips
through our meetups and maybe below and
we have some dummy text so you say well
telling our awesome page or something
like that so that looks like a good
starting page to me let's continue with
the list of meetups here so with this
link here it should take us to a page
which well gives us such a list of
existing meetups
difference to the Karoo so of course let
me make a little bit more prettier the
dip
to the Caruso of course is that the list
of meetups we're going to have all the
me that's not just a feature set so here
on this page we're still going to have
our navigation and I'm not going to
write all these items again but it's the
stealth same item that's on the first
page and then here why don't we simply
have some cards some list items
basically which represent our me dad's
on an equator aggregated view of course
we could have some thumbnails here on
the left to the actual images we're
using could be here on the left then
maybe the title here maybe the date so
that we can quickly see when this meetup
is and then I'll link to the individual
meetup page so here whatever would be
our links taking out three individual
meters now these links here these links
here would actually take us to the very
same page I click on the caruso will
take us so wait don't we combined it
here here of course we have our single
meetup page so for the individual meetup
we open here we want to see some details
about it so for that let's quickly give
us this wireframe here again um same
navigation as before but now on this
page I want to display information about
the selected Rita because we had a list
of meters you were able to see which
meetups are available now I picked one
and we want to see more details like the
description which should also probably
contain a clue about where it is and a
link to register for the meetup of
course so here we could have like a
central card which has a header with
well maybe the title again but then also
a big image of the Rita the same we had
for the Caruso and we had here as a
thumbnail now maybe here as well also as
an image to add some nice visuals to
this page then here we could have the
date again and then here the the
gription where the creator of the meter
is free to write anything you want like
for example where this meetup actually
is very important at the bottom I want
to have an action bar where I able to
register or unregister if we already are
registered I also want to have something
else I want to have added link here and
all the one next to the date and the
time will we're going to have here and
these links should allow us to well edit
this meter but of course only if we are
the creator of the meetup so we'll have
to check this to make sure that no a lot
dedicated user or no unauthorized user
actually is able to edit this so here
with that I want you implement this edit
feature here through a dialog so through
edit dialogues so we're not going to
leave that page here we're actually
going to stay on that page but a dialog
should open which allows us to add a
title and description or the date a date
or the time and the same for the
registration here I want to open a
register or unregister dialog that would
be altered to so that is the plan here
that we have that open now with that
that looks nice for the meetup flow
we're able to see a list of meetups to
go to an individual meetup and then to
register or unregister or edit up if
we're added edited if we're ready
creator now we're not done of course
because of what's missing we also have
when our link here the new meetup right
so why don't we also have a look at that
and here Glantz go over there where we
still have some space
whoops here I want you be able to create
a new meter like that now the new is a
page
of course also has the navigation we
already know and love but here I want
you well be able to create a new Meetup
and before that we obviously need a
couple of things so we need an input
field for for the title for the
description and very important I want to
be able to upload an image here so that
is something we'll definitely also run
an honest page image upload and preview
feature so that people are able to add
their own images which are associated
with the media now we'll also add date
and time Pickers here because obviously
we want to be able to do that and then
basically a button too well save this so
that would be our new meetup page here
of course in the end it will look nicer
from a visual perspective but these are
the core features someone I have title
description upload and date and time
picker and this allows us to them well
create this meetup and add a new one all
this meat up management over the place
where the meetups are going to be stored
of course is not our front end for that
we're going to use firebase so in the
end what we'll have is will have which
maybe put it here we'll have fire base
sitting behind the scenes as our back
end where we manage our meetups well
that's pretty ugly right so let me
rewrite this
where we manage our meetups and where we
also manage our users and debts
something I haven't talked about yet
obviously this whole flow I draw here so
all these things which are related to
meetups creating meetups and so on are
restricted to authenticated users only
well the list of me that does point be
viewed by an offer on open ahead users
to but you should only be able to create
new me dozens on if you are
authenticated so that's a thing which is
totally missing in our setup here we of
course also need to add a new page here
we have our navigation but on this page
we should be able to sign up or sign in
so maybe have a card with email field
here a password field and then we can
sign in and the same for the signup
process of course we also are able to
create a new account that sign us some
sign ourselves up with firebase because
firebase is to bacchanal use for this
application the open dication status um
let's put it here all status
therefore changes 1/3 sign in through
firebase so that is the flow here and
the status also affects our navigation
bar
so effects navigation because I want to
display different items on the bar
depending on the user authentication
status of course obviously it will also
affect to which pages we grant the user
access we will control this through
navigation guards implemented in the
view router that is basically it from a
application page perspective now as you
can see we only get about five or to be
precise because with more secure about
signup pages on but not that many pages
but they're packed with features
actually we have a really complex
application here we have a back-end
which helps us with manage NIC where we
can authenticate users where we can
reach out to the database and store data
where we can also store images don't
forget that and as I mentioned the
multiple times I'm going to use firebase
as a back-end and I'm going to use two
native firebase SDK actually to interact
with it so that should be interesting
too because I never did this on this
channel and firebase is a great tool as
you will learn in this series which
might be pretty interesting to you in
your next project queue and it really
got it really got banner over the last
months which is why I find it very
interesting but of course you could also
implement this with any other back and
of your choice you're obviously free to
build as a friend back and then use that
I'll just use firebase but as I
mentioned a lot of features we're going
to cover here in this series really
looking forward today what else could we
plan now we could also plan our data
models right because we have like the
visual representation here we have like
a glue how our application should look
like how the user is able to navigate in
this application and we can also see
which components were probably going to
well for them and which components we
need we also want to know what we're
actually storing in the backend right so
why don't we have a look at firebase
here and have a look at the user and the
Meetup now the meetup definitely needs
an ID and firebase actually assigns one
automatically so we can note this here
auto assigned by firebase
we besides an ID we also of course want
to have a title for our meetup
description a date because obviously we
need to know when this meter is we could
also add a place here in this app I'll
just do it like that that it's listed in
the description because it's really
flexible app you're free to well
describe the location however you want
it doesn't just have to be one
coordinate set on Google Maps so that's
well put it in the description but you
can could of course add a location here
tube title description date what else do
we need well we definitely also want to
store the ID of the creator so the user
who created this user who created the
meetup because that of course the
crucial information for us to control
who's able to access order to change the
meter and we also want to store
something else we need to store a
reference to our image so the image URL
we're going to upload this image also on
firebase and there it will get stored on
their file storage service and what we
actually receive once we did upload it
is an URL and this URL is actually
actually what we want to save in this
meetup so that once we fetch the meetup
and use it in our application we know
where to look for the image which you
want to display to you so that is where
we also save the image URL and it's this
set of data fields here I want to use as
a data model in this application for the
media now of course you're free to
enhance this in whichever way you want
you can certainly get more complex than
that
for me this set of rules will do though
the user is super simple we're going to
use two default email passwords sign up
process fire rates provides and
therefore the user really just has an ID
which is automatically generated by
firebase the user then also has an email
and of course the password so that is
what the user has that is how the user
mall looks like it has
everything it needs for our application
purposes here therefore and this is
really looking great to me so there is
the general structure of our application
from a visual perspective or from a
hello a user interaction perspective and
from a data perspective now of course
you could go into much more detail here
make this more complex feel free should
you so I hope this helps you understand
this now in the video description you'll
find a link where you can actually
download this document I drew here I
hope you can read it and in the next
video we're going to start with the
actual implementation this is not going
to be a short series but it's going to
be an interesting one I believe so let's
get started with the technical
implementation in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
