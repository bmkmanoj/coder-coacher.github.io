firebase meet up project we added a lot
of features already we're nearing the
end of the project but some things are
still missing in this video I want to
make our meetups editable right now we
can create them we can view them but
what if we wanted to change them after
they've been created let's take a closer
look at that in this video
let's have a look at where I would want
to edit a meet-up for that I'll first of
all sign in with t account I created
earlier and then I can obviously
organize a meet-up but if I view meetups
and I wizard an individual meetup it
would be nice if I could have some
buttons here which allow me to edit the
meet up and now that I see it there
seems to be a bug the location is
missing there okay so little change of
plan let's edit this or let's fix this
by going to the meetup dot view fall and
here meetup location that's not working
why is it not working let's have a look
at our meetup here in the database we do
have the location location looks right
to me
meet up so that should really work in my
opinion though the issue probably is in
the store there when we allow it to
meetups I simply don't store the
location locally so we fetch it but if I
don't store it in the store we can't use
in our views so let's set location equal
to object key location here because we
do have it in the data so we'd probably
also use it and then here we'll get an
error I'll come back to that error too
but here we see location is displayed
now the error here on the right is
stemming from the fact that data needs
to be fetched and when it first wants to
load or render this page the data isn't
there yet by the way that's the same
reason why under the meetups if you
reload the page you see the original to
meetups first before they get replaced
with San Francisco because we have to
the loading period now we can get rid of
that by showing a spinner same is true
you're on the front page where we
already do show one but I don't really
want to add this spinner for now we'll
do this later for now what I want to do
is I want to make a meetup editable so
here the San Francisco meetup would be
nice to have some buttons to add it and
for that I'll create new components in
the meetup folder we have to create
meetup component meetup and meetups now
I'll create a new subfolder in there and
I will name it add it now of course you
can choose any name you like in there
I'll trade a new file the Edit
meetup details dialog dot view file you
can give it any other name this will be
my component name because it should open
as a dialog so as a modal basically
where the user is able to edit the
details off the Meetup now with details
I mean things like title or description
I'll make the time and date also
editable but I want to show these in a
separate modal which should open on a
different button which I want to have
place maybe next to the time and date
somewhere down here so let's go with the
general details first I opened this new
dot view file and there I of course need
a template to have something to work
with now in the template I will use a
special beautify component let's open
the beautify documentation to find out
which one this is they're under
documentation you see that under
components we actually have dialogues
now dialogs are looking like that there
are different versions of it so
basically these are modal's we can use
I'm gonna use such a dialogue a little
bit of a more complex one and of course
feel free to dive into the documentation
to find out how you may find unity your
needs I'll go back to my template here
and I'll add V dialogue which actually
is the selector for that component on
that I'll set a width and I'll set it to
350 pixels which should look good on all
devices of course you could also style
this and make a real responsive design
where the width of this dialog changes
with the device width I'll take the
cheap way here and I'll set it to
persistent this will basically influence
how it is displayed and how we may
dismiss it now with that added the first
thing we actually add is the button
which will open it
that is how beautified dialogs work you
have a so-called activator that is a wee
button oops with - in between though so
normal beautiful button I'll make it a
floating button give it the X on color
and here in port we have to assign a
slot where this should go in now keep in
mind
nesting this Envy dialogue so by
assigning a slot here beautify knows
where to place this button inside of the
dialogue which is actually not inside of
the dialogue because their dialogue is
the modal so we nested into into this
Videla component but behind the scenes
that actually consists of two parts the
modal you see and a different part where
you can place the button on the normal
page so outside of the modal this is
where the button will go in and I mark
this button as please put it in there
with the slot which I said to activator
don't miss type here because activator
is understood by beautify and which will
place the button correctly now on the
button here I'll add a V icon
so maybe the added icon sounds
appropriate
now let's already see how it looks even
though no dialogue was added so for dead
I'll go to the meetup table you fall
which is wearing what I use it at the
end and here I of course want to
register it and use it in my template
for that I could register it as a local
component in that file which would be
fine because I only add it there or to
see that again in the main dot JS file I
can register it as a global component
which I can use application wide
I'll give it a selector of app added
meat details dialog a relatively long
selector but it's fine for me here and
of course I should import it so I will
import the Edit meetup details dialog
from slash components meetup edit and
then this newly traded top view file we
created a few seconds ago like that so
that's the import that is what I want to
store here in this newly created
component woops without semicolons of
course and with that added here I can go
back to the meetup dot view file and add
it here to there I want to add it next
to the title
so offer my h6 tag here so to say
I can do this by adding a template tag
here because I only want to show this if
the user who is locked in is the creator
of that specific meetup here so for now
I'll quickly said we if you're - true -
always show it but later I'll exchange
this to make sure that only the creator
of that meetup can see that button
because of course no one else should be
able to edit it then I'll add V spacer
in there
that's a placeholder provided by
beautify which will nicely distribute it
so that the title sets on the left and
the button goes on the right so after we
spacer I'll actually add my component
app added meetup details dialog was the
selector and that actually is all for
now now let me save this and see if it
works like that if we go back to the
application we see the button here now
the style of the button isn't exactly
what I wanted though I don't want to
have a button like that so let's quickly
have a look at it again having a look at
the documentation helps turns out this
change to fab so it's not floating it's
fab what I want here so now if I reload
this is the button I want now I got this
edit button here on the right and now of
course I want to make sure that I only
see it if I am the creator of that
meetup I can easily point this out
because if we have a look at the store
or a view chess story that our gathers
we see we can add a user here and the
user of course will have an ID you can
see this in the sign user in method here
we store the user ID on the user object
now estate
now each meetup also has a creator ID
here here also for the ones we fetched
so I only have to match of creator ID
matches user ID
therefore I'll go back to that meetup to
the view file and I'll add a new
computer property actually I'll add two
the first one is user is authenticated
because I also want to check this - if
the user is authenticated
then this will change if we can register
later on so I can already add this since
I'll also need it in my other check and
here in user is authenticated I simply
return this store gathers user and chef
check if it's not equal to null and if
this store gathers user is not equal to
undefined which basically means the user
is set so we are authenticated otherwise
it wouldn't be set in our store now I'll
add the other computed property which we
need to make sure that we only show the
button to the creator of that meetup
here I'll name it user is Creator so
that's the name of my computer property
and here I'll first of all check if
we're not authenticated so if user is
authenticated as false don't execute
this as a method
I'm simply referring to this computed
property if it is false
I'll return false because if the user
user is not Fennec ated I certainly
don't want to show this this button but
then I'll also return this store gathers
user ID so getting the idea of the
currently authenticated user and I'll
check if this is equal to this meetup
creator ID this meetup refers to the
meetup computed property so the Twitter
loaded meetup and get rid of these
semicolons we don't need them do a have
one here to know so that should work now
we can use the user is creator check in
bf I only show this if the user is the
Creator if that returns true cell let's
now reload this and we still see the
button now let's check if it works
correctly if I sign up another user who
clearly won't be the Creator then if I
now explore the meetups we don't see the
edit button so this is working now I'll
sign in with the average user again
because now I want to work on the actual
model we open because right now if I
click this nothing is happening well
almost nothing we see the backdrop
already but of course the modal content
is missing because we haven't
figure out anything about it you also
see I can't dismiss it by clicking on
the backdrop because I set the style too
persistent here this derive directive
here this property so now let's work on
the dialogue again for that below the
button I'll add a big hard
so the button goes into the activator
slot it's kind of a special thing the
rest of this video log content here
basically will be what actually gets
displayed in the modal and I want to
show a card now there I simply want to
have a title to begin with but to stay
aligned with my other cards like to sign
up here I'll also use V layout in that
card to structure it the container and
so on so let's start with that let's add
V container here and then that lets add
we layout and this shall be a row which
wraps if necessary which shouldn't be
necessary in there we can then use v
flex and just like we did before in the
other components we flex also needs to
get a property defining when this should
be shown here i want to use access 12
should be one layout for all sizes now
in there I'll add weak hard title and on
title I'll set say added meetup I then
once you add a new row we lay out all
the row and wrap with the Flex x12 to
use the grid here where I want to show
the text of the actual content in
between when we add a we the wider here
will have the content let's see how that
looks like if I save this we already see
it this is roughly what it will look
like not that pretty yet but we'll get
there we'll get there by now working on
the content in there here I'll add weak
hard text inside this row here we
created with the grid and in Ricard's
text I now want to have text fields
which allow me to edit the title and the
description for that of course we can go
to create
meet up and get inspired from there at
least here we already have text fields
for the description and for the title so
why don't we pick the text field for the
title here go back to dialog and enter
that and do the same whoops here from
create meetup for the description which
is a multi-line text field so I picked
these two and I add them right below
each other beneath each other here in my
vCard text element now we model is bound
to title and description here that won't
work for now so I'll get rid of it and
now let's see how that looks like in our
model what doesn't look too bad to me
added meetup title description that
doesn't look too bad now of course this
is not really editable yet though so
before we take care about these values
actually being used somewhere I also
want to have actions in the modal so
below 0 here which holds my input fields
I'll add another V divider simply a
horizontal line add another layout which
should be a row and wrap and we flex in
there X is 12 where I now want to add my
actions now we can have a look at the
card component here to find out how we
add actions you see we got a weak hard
actions here basically so the code can
be seen here with card actions with
buttons in there so let's add we card
actions here just like that just using
this component and in there let's add
buttons one maybe for canceling that
changes and one for accepting them so
add a button and now it's totally up to
you how you style it I want to use the
flat style but I want to use my own
class I want to give it a blue text with
the darken one well modification
basically and of course choose any
styling any color you want I'll see if I
stick to that but for now I want to go
with that a gift is the name of clothes
duplicate it and add a Save button too
now I'll add click listener soon let's
have a look at the modal first
pretty good to me close and safe now
it's time to make sure that we actually
handle these inputs and that we do
something with that for that I'll add a
script tag here to my component and
there I'll export a default object where
first of all I want to set up my data in
the data property or in the object
return there to be precise I want to
have my edited title which is an empty
string initially and my edited
description which is an empty string
initially so this is what I want to get
back now actually it would be nice if we
could pre populate the text fields with
the actual values of that meet up
because we're editing it so there are
existing values to do that we of course
need to get the me that we want to add
it I expect to get this wire props so
props here should give me the meet up
and then we could try to set edited
title equal to this meetup title and the
description equal to this meetup
description let's see if that works as
we want it to work now for that of
course you need to pass a meet-up we do
this from the meetup top you fall which
is where I use the edit dialog and there
I can bind Meetup
the prop we just configured do the
meetup we have here so to the loaded
meet up in the middle of you file just
like that so meetup here in front of the
equal sign refers to the prop name we
assigned here let's save this and see if
it works as expected the click test
button
maybe reload the app before we do so we
see it does not work
now the reason for this is that at the
point of time we're assigning this the
meetup hasn't been loaded yet so a
different way for us to to handle this
is to ensure that we only load this
dialogue this component here I should
say when's the meetup has been loaded
this goes back to the same problem we
had before that when I reload this we
get the the error here initially
now to avoid that all we have to do is
we have to basically add a loader and
only render the demet up if the data is
there now we can easily do that we
already do it in the home component
there we have a loader here in we layout
where I check if we're loading and if
we're loading we actually display the D
loader here so I'll copy that code over
to the meetup W fault and I'll add it
right at the top we container this is a
row wrapping now I won't add it here
I'll add we have to the whole V layout
instead and I'll check is loading now
clearly I don't have a is loading
property in the meetup dot view file yet
but in the home that you follow we
already use this we simply have loading
and we get it from the store now
obviously we can do the same in our
meetup W file so I'll copy the computed
property from the home that you felt the
loading one and I'll add it here loading
so now I can use loading not as loading
loading up here and I only load to be
layout here in DB Al's case I can use V
else here because I have we have on the
same type of element on the same level
of nesting so here B layout with three
we have here we layout with the else so
now we should see the loader as long as
we are loading let's see if that works
indeed dead works now if we open the
dialog still no title and description
the reason for that is simple we have
added the title and description but
we're not binding to it here so we
should add V model on the title input
field and bind the two edited title and
for the other one the multi-line input
field for the description I should find
V model two edited description like that
now with that if I reload that and now
click this button we see it's
pre-populated with the values we already
had that's awesome now the only thing we
have to do is make these buttons work
and actually take these changes and do
something with them with
of course is a big step we'll have to
reach out to the web for that again so
to make sure that we can submit this we
need click listeners on these buttons on
the close button I want to listen to a
click listener and simply set simply
close that modal and on the save
listener I also want to close the modal
but of course I then also want to save
the data so here I will say unsaved
changes should get executed for closing
the modal I have an easier way though I
can create a new data property so
storing in an object I returning data
and I'll name it added dialog referring
to that whole dialogue also the default
initially and I will assign it to my
overall V dialogue element this is
supported by the V dialogue component by
vilifying
we can bind it to a boolean to determine
whoever to show it or not deactivator
will automatically show it automatically
set this to true but we can always
disable it by setting it back to false
so here I can set V modal a modal it
will equal to edit edit dialogue yeah
add a dialogue again this will be turned
to true by the activator button but if
we set it back to false the modal will
disappear and I do just that here in the
close click event edit dialog will be
set to false here let me split this over
multiple lines to make this a bit easier
to read now if a safe doesn't go back
and reload the application here
yeah we get that unsaved changes is of
course not a method we'll add it soon
but we also get that if I click on close
we close the model so that works now
let's take care about this error and add
on Save Changes we're executing it here
when we click Save so we need to add it
here as a method so let's add the
methods key and add on Save Changes like
that now in unsaved changes I obviously
want to close the modal which I can do
by setting this edit dialog equal to
false following the same logic we use on
the close button here I also want to
make sure that I don't take the changes
if they're invalid though so if I have
like an empty like an empty string in
either of the two so here we'll check if
this added the title trim to remove any
excess whitespace if that is equal to an
empty space or if this edited
description trimmed by excess white
space is empty if Eva is the case I want
to return so we don't continue then I
don't want to do anything with invalid
values let's check if that works click
the button empty that and click Save
can't submit it type something I can now
of course this is not stored or it's not
doing anything yet but this is the next
step I want to do I want you to submit
to changed values to the server now for
that we need a new method a new action
in our store and by the way I will also
in a later video optimize everything and
split the store into multiple modules so
there I now want to update a module it's
maybe add that code below create I'll
name it update meetup data there we'll
get the object where we can extract
commit and we'll get a payload basically
an object which holds the new data we
want to store now first of all I want to
commit set loading to true because I am
loading if I use that or not I want to
set it to true here
then I wants to create a new constant
and update object which is an empty new
JavaScript object initially we'll use it
soon I don't want to check if we have a
title in that payload if we do have that
on the update object I'll set the title
equal to the payload title I don't want
to do that without any check because if
the payload title is not present for
some reason because we're not changing
it I don't want to overwrite the
existing valid title with an invalid one
so therefore I'll also check the same
for the description which is another
thing we could check change if we have a
description I want to set the
description description property on that
update object equal to payload
description and finally for the date
because that will be the last thing we
can add it not right now but in the
future if the payload date is existing I
want to set update object date equal to
payload date so now we have a configured
update object it could be empty if we
somehow commit this or dispatch this
action without any payload or a payload
which does have Nibiru title nor a
description nor a date but in most cases
we will probably set some of these
properties with that I can reach out to
firebase and there to meetups so the
same path we use when creating meetups
of course you can by the way add these
slashes or not so since I didn't use the
material remove them down here too then
I want to access a specific meetup of
course can do this with child and access
payload ID now I expect to get the ID as
an argument in the payload to wear as a
property to be precise and with dad we
can call update now the cool thing about
update is it will not overwrite the
existing object it will only override
the properties which need to be
overwritten and it decides which these
are depending on the data we pass to it
in this case the update object so if the
update object has a title proper
it will overwrite the existing title
property but leave the other properties
unchanged which is why I do the update
like this have an empty object initially
if it would pass that nothing would
change on the server but if we for
example have a title because the payload
held a title then we will change it on
the server too this is what update does
here and of course it's firebase
database
oops data base ref like that or to add
that now as before this gives us a
promise where we can listen to the
success case in this case I want to set
loading to to false because we're not
loading anymore
and I want to commit this this change I
want to also change it in my local store
so for that I'll create a new mutation
because right now we only have the
action I'll add it below create Meetup
I'll name it update meetup data or just
update meetup to be in line with create
meter there I'll get my state and a
payload payload will be the new meetup
data and now in there I will basically
update my meet up with that meetup data
so first of all I need to fetch the
meetup which should be changed I'll get
it from my state there I have my loaded
meetups and there I want to find a given
meetup I'll find it by ID so the arrow
function here which will return me a
meetup should simply check if the idea
of the meetup I'm currently looking at
in that array of meetups matches my
payload ID this is the ID of the meetup
which should get updated so that will
give me the meetup I wanna
well I want to change I want to update
their I don't want to check if we have a
title following the same logic as before
then I want to change meetup title to be
the payload title and I'll repeat this
for description date if we have
description here in the payload I want
to update payload the score
a meet-up description and set it equal
to payload description lastly all the
for the date if we have a date in the
payload then I want to set meetup date
equal to payload date to update that so
this is the logic in my mutation I'll
fetch a meter and then I'll change only
what I need to change for that I check
if that's a title description or date if
any of these is present in the payload
with that I'm updating that I have my
mutation it's named update Meetup
so down in the update meetup action I
can commit this to commit this newly
created armed mutation update meetup and
of course I need to pass the pail out
there because the payload contains the
data and we want to edit data so it
makes sense to pass a to it finally I
also want to catch any errors here in
that case I will console lock the error
so that we get any insights and of
course I still want to commit something
I want to set loading to false because
even if we've gotten an error the
loading still is done so that was a lot
of work now we get this update meetup
data-action setup back to the update
meetup details dialog we can now a
dispatch this here so there I will reach
out to my store and call this patch and
dispatch this newly created action now
we need to pass some data there and what
do we expect to get let's have a look at
that store again in the action we're
using the title description date and the
ID these are the things we try to access
on the payload now it's okay if some of
them are missing that's why I have two
checks here DF checks the ID is needed
in all cases though so let's make sure
to pass the ID the ID can simply be
retrieved of course from the loaded
meetup the loaded meetup ID that's the
ID stored in firebase already and that
obviously is the ID by which we can
identify it
now we'll also have a title here this
editable edited title and of course we
can also pass the
because even if we didn't change it it's
still the original one so we can safely
overwrite it
so here I'll set description equal to
this edited description like that with
that I'm dispatching reaction and I'm
passing this object now let's say if
that was let's see if that works I'm
reloading this and I'm opening up in
firebase so here that's this meet up
with awesome as a description let's
change the description to really awesome
and let's it safe let's have a look at
the Meetup really awesome as a
description let's change to titled hue
just to see if that works
maybe it's the San Francisco meetup
let's it safe and let's switch to
firebase here and we see the San
Francisco media so this is working let's
all try something else if I empty this
and I hit say if it doesn't get closed
and here nothing changed if I close it
like that nothing changes and if I
reload that and I actually don't change
anything but hit save it gets submitted
but here you see nothing changed so this
is how we can edit the meetup of course
thus far only the title and description
