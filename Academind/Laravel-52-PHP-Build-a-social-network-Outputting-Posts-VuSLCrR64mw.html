part of our level series here so in the
last part we fix the validation and in
general we're now able to create posts
and you can see them in the database if
you remember that so if I have a look at
my database here are the posts I already
created well that is good but it would
be nice to actually see them in our or
on our dashboard here we're going to
take care about this in this video so
the place to start is the user
controller here is where we're getting
our dashboard now we might load it in
the user controller but in my opinion it
would better fit in the post controller
because our dashboard is really all
about posts therefore I'm going to cut
this function here and insert it in the
post controller obviously I then have to
adjust my route here in the routes file
where I no longer route to user
controller but instead to the post
controller now this should work again
and we can try this by just reloading
this page yeah so this is working next
thing is I want to be able to render the
real posts here where I have my dummy
posts as a fan I know in order to be
able to do that I need to load or to get
the posts first I do this in a post
controller and in my well.get dashboard
function here before I'm returning a few
I somehow have to fetch my posts now
that is really easy I'll just create a
variable which I could post and then I
will access my post model which I'm
already using in this file here and I
will just call the old method now let me
zoom in a bit
what this old method does on this post
model is well basically fetch all posts
this is how we can build queries through
our our model so to say it was a very
simple query obviously where we just get
well all the elements in the database
now we can create much more complicated
queries and we will see this later in
the series but for now fetching all the
post is just fine
now that I got my posts here I just want
you pass them to the few I do this by
adding a second argument to this return
few function here and the second
argument takes an array now in this
array I'm able to specify all the
variables which I want to pass into the
view so that I'm able to use them in the
view in this case I want to have a posts
variable in the view where it can access
all my posts and what will have pass to
that variable
well my posts variable I got here which
well contains all my posts so now I'm
making the posts I'm fetching here
available in my view therefore in my
view in my dashboard uplight file here
I'm now able to use this posts variable
as if it while were created in this file
here so here where I do have my dummy
posts I will no longer output the stabby
post but I will enter and for each loop
here so at for each and here I will just
loop through all the posts and remember
I said you can use it like a variable we
declared in this file so here just write
dollar sign posts as post to loop
through online posts now it's very
important that this name here dollar
sign posts equals the name you specify
here when creating this variable now
obviously here the dollar sign is
missing that is automatically added
because that as well how variables are
defined in PHP but the name has to be
equal to the one here in the array now
in my dashboard father can now loop
through all those posts and I will close
this for each loop here and inside this
for YouTube
I want to out post output my article
element here so I'm going to get rid of
the second one here which wasn't a me
anyway and now let me save this and
reload the few here now as you can see
we got free dummy articles even though
well we only have one here that is
because the looping works now obviously
we're not seeing our post content
because
all the content here in this article is
still the tamp dummy text but the fact
that we're seeing it three times here
and that we're having free posts in our
database in this case here means that it
is working that it successfully looping
through all this
oops navigate back so it seems to work
that it fetches suppose enter the loop
through the post
now let's output the content of the post
shall we well this is a very easy indeed
here I will just output the body of the
post so let me just have a look at my
migration file I think I call it body
yeah so therefore I will enter my blade
expression here with double curly braces
and then just exit post body so
accessing the database field body like a
property of well the post object this is
all the magic level tasks for us we can
access data at this easy so I think that
is really awesome and I might also
access the offer and now back in our
database
remember we got our posts here and our
users in a number table so I want to
output the first name that I specified
here now to be able to do that I will
again enter my blade expression and then
post but now what in my posts table here
I don't have the offer name I just have
the ID of the user now we set up this
relation and therefore I can access my
users or my user like a property over
this post this user property here is
defined in our post PHP file in the
model file here here we're creating this
user function and we can access this
well the same name like a property to
fetch the actual user so not use we're
not using the function here which would
hand us back part of the query builder
which would allow us to query the
database and make a more complex
transaction but instead we're directly
querying the user which is stored as a
property of or opposed also
automatically by level
therefore I can't just XC user here and
then access well the first name field
let me save this and reload and as you
can see this is working I'm now seeing
all my post bodies here and those happen
to be test tests and another test and
post by Max now I've have a look at my
database we see all posts were created
by user with the ID 4 and if I look in
the users table well we see that 4 is
indeed max now the date is obviously
still wrong so let's fix that I can
output this in my blade expression your
cube by just accessing post created at
save this and reload and now we're
seeing the date now this is a bit ugly
formatted right and you can reformat
that but I'm not going to focus on that
right now the main point is that we're
now successfully outputting all our
posts with all the data we have attached
to your post and you saw how easy that
was right so that is a really powerful
thing we got here going and we will
continue in the next video with being
able to well delete post through these
buttons here
see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
