webpack in the previous videos we
learned what web neg is and how to set
up the development server now I want to
dive into the core concept behind WebEx
super important to understand we have
four core concepts when using webpack or
on which web page builds up on you could
say web site always needs an entry point
where should it start looking for
dependencies and that can be multiple
entry points as you will learn but it
needs to have some entry point some clue
on where it should start its journey it
also needs to have an output and we use
both entry and output here in our very
basic usage where should it store the
bundle or if you have multiple entry
points the bundles then it will create
multiple bundles one for each entry
point and then you have two other things
we don't see here which you will see in
this video here though we have modules
with loaders which allow us to transform
our code and we have plugins which do
kind of the same but on a different
different level and you will understand
the difference in this video let's get
started by creating a config file thus
far we ran all our website commands
directly in the command line and it was
fine until now but for a more detailed
configuration we need a config file we
added in the root folder the web pack
config dot J's file and you can name it
anything you like you will then have to
specify the name of your config file in
the command line though or if you use
exactly this file name and website will
pick it up automatically so if you added
this file needs to have a certain
structure it needs to export a
JavaScript object which holds the web
pack configuration and you use the node
J as export syntax for this so you
define a module and then use the exports
keyword which you assign a JavaScript
object the configuration object as a
value
now this JavaScript object has some
basic things it needs to contain first
of all we need to have
entry where should we start the journey
and as I said the entry you can have
multiple formats it could be an array of
multiple entry points it can be a
JavaScript object where you map aliases
to different entry points or here to
start simple you simply reference one
single file as a string though so here
you could say dot slash source slash
JavaScript slash app such as is my entry
point here the same path as we use here
in the package.json file and of course
this path specified here in the config
file has to be seen relative from the
config file from the root of your
project so now we tell web pack where to
start
we now need to tell it where to finish
what you produce so in X as the output
here output is a JavaScript object where
we configure what the output should look
like
here again we do have different levels
of detail the most basic form of
defining the output is to tell webmix
where to store it and then what to name
it so we can add the path property here
and these property names here of course
are all kind of reserved these are names
webpack will recognize and to make super
clear that website it identifies us
correctly we can use a node.js feature
we can import the path package with
required path this is available since
you install node chairs on your machine
and the path package a core node.js
package simply gives you some utility
functions which help you resolve the
correct path so here you can now call
the resolve method on this path package
and as a first parameter you can pass
underscore underscore dur name that is a
reserved variable name you didn't define
it anywhere right but it is available it
is made available to you which simply
indicates hey the current directory and
then the second argument is the
subdirectory you want to go to like gist
a folder which should get created we
don't have it yet and now why do we use
this path results method because the
output power
needs to be an absolute pause so we
can't define it like in the entry
property whether you have a relative pop
seen from our weapon context file on
here we really need to have a an
absolute path because webpack needs to
write something there it needs to create
a file for us there and the path result
method resolve such an absolute top gift
as an absolute path with the given
inputs so that is where to store it now
we also need to define the file name so
how it should web nickname this file it
creates and oftentimes you'll see
bundled chess here though you're not
limited to the names you can use any
name you like of course but bandolce is
clearly indicates that your code got
bundled which is why it is a popular
name so these are the two basic features
we already used now before going into
loaders and modules and plugins let me
adjust our scripts I will remove entry
and output file name here on the web
pack - server and do the same for the
website command I will leave the - P
here though so now let's test both let's
run npm run build prod first and see if
that's the works looks good it's still
created - this bundle chase file now I'm
going to delete this file and I'll run
NPM run build our development server
also seems to work if we now revisit our
webpage and reload it well somehow we
now get an error here that is something
we'll have to look at you but our main
script the production script is working
so it seems to have picked up where to
get the files and the web pick dev
server kind of seems to have picked it
up but but not entirely there is
something wrong with it why does our
development server not like this setup
well before where you pass the full
filename with output filename remember
that there if I temporarily revert this
we specify the full path well now in our
config file we split this up into a
separate path and file name declaration
so now
out the webpack development server will
only look for the file name and some who
ignore the past year so to tell the web
pack development server where this lives
we have to add another property to our
output here the public path which
basically specifies well where are the
assets to be found at and by default
this is just slash but this is not
correct because we know it will be in
the dist folder and it doesn't pick this
up automatically so we simply add this
here slash dist
and if we now restart the web pack dev
server and reload our project you see
the error message is gone and if I click
the button it works again so now we fix
this queue now the output is finished
and both our normal web pack command as
well as you set web server like it
that's entry and output and again you
can go into more detail here we will see
more configurations throughout this
series but let's first dive into the
next core feature modules and loaders
that is one feature area what is that
modules and loaders allow us to
transform our files and a good example
with the our CSS files which we have
used right now we still import them the
conventional way here in our index.html
file now you could say it would be nice
if you could for one import the CSS file
into the JavaScript file which sounds
really weird but keep in mind it's only
about informing web tech that we want to
import this file we're not really mixing
it with JavaScript we only want to make
sure that it also gets loaded by web
pack so that would be one thing and the
second interesting thing would be to
then while when website has this
information that it should load these
files well it can't add CSS to our
JavaScript code so it would be nice if
it could simply output it for us in the
head section of our index.html file here
and for that we need loaders we need
modules which Judith transformation for
us which enable us to load CSS in
JavaScript and which then automatically
added to the index.html
now to get such loaders I will quit quit
this process with ctrl C and then with
npm install' we can install them now
there are loads of modules and loaders
you can use in web pack and you can
simply google for the feature you're
looking for typescript compilation yeah
six compilation plus web pack and you
should find the appropriate loader for
DCSS use case here what we need is we
need the CSS loader and the style loader
these are also development dependencies
so let's mark them as such and now it
will get downloaded and added to our
project you can see now in the package
to JSON file here and now we can add
them to our config and we have to tell
weapon please take these loaders into
account when analyzing our files now dis
is super easy to do we have to add a
module property here which is a
JavaScript object and here you can
simply configure how weapons should
treat your modules now what is a module
a module basically is every import you
have like here the Dom loader file here
these two variables these are modules
because we export them and we import
them here and our CSS files all the
cookie modules that we want to import
them so it would be nice if in our app
such as file let's say right at the
start we could write import go up one
folder CSS and then main dot CSS that
would be awesome
and thereafter we also want to import
the input element CSS file and of course
you could even add more loaders which
allow you to write fast code and nest
your CSS code in each other and much
more but it would be nice if you could
use this basic syntax to begin with and
with that added now these two are all
the modules so that is what we configure
here and now first of all we want to set
up the rules for these modules so how
should they be treated rules is in array
of rules you guessed it and each rule
complete the JavaScript object
now each rule has a certain structure
there are some properties you can set up
but some
you will need to set up for example to
test property which means how does
webpack know if this rules with this
rule here the specific rule applies it
tests the file extension because you
probably have the same rules for the
same files so for example if we and this
is a regular expression here if we have
a JavaScript file and your regular
expression for this is backslash dot J
as dollar to indicate it's any file name
but it should end with JavaScript if we
have a JavaScript file then we want to
apply a certain loader that's the next
property we're here
we tested something now we add loader
now the loader for the JavaScript file
here is no loader because we don't
transform our JavaScript code as of now
so we probably don't need a rule for
JavaScript but one for CSS file so let's
change the extension to CSS and here I
actually want to apply more than one
loader now loader would simply take the
loader as a name like CSS loader but
that would only enable us to add the CSS
code to to import it in JavaScript now
if we run it like this
let's run our build script the WebP egg
dev server you see that this works but
if I reload it here you see that this
works but if I now go to the index.html
file and comment out these two
conventional imports here and I now
rerun the server and load my file again
you see all the Styles are gone because
we didn't get an error so somehow it was
able to handle our import statements
here but it also didn't add these styles
and of course it's cons because it can't
add them to the JavaScript file so we
need an average the Styles weapon is
aware of an atom to the index.html file
this is why one loader alone won't do
here instead won't use loader like this
we will use the use property which
allows us to simply add multiple loaders
here we add an array therefore
and now we specify all the loaders you
want to use and additionally you can
also specify options here but that is
something more advanced let's pick two
loaders no important is the order here
you could think that you start with the
loader you want to apply first CSS
loader and then the other one style
loader which is responsible for taking
the CSS code and adding it to the Dom a
to your head section to be precise if we
run those now you see we get an error
the reason for this is that it's not
able to handle these CSS imports it's
the same error you would get if you
comment out all that module part and run
it right now but it's not able to handle
up these imports in the apt of chance
file instead what we should do here is
we should reverse the order here
so first lo - style outer den CSS
because that super important actually
web pack will execute your loaders in
reverse order so the last element in
this array gets loaded or gets gets
applied you could say first so it will
first use the CSS loader which is the
loader we need to make it understand
these imports and then it will add this
style loader so now with this setup if I
now run this command you see now it's
working fine and if we go back to our
running web page you see now I can
reload it and I do see a working set up
again with the code working or DB
styling working the way it should work
this is how you add loaders and how you
configure how epics should treat your
modules one of the cool features and
super important and one of the main
reasons why why Pegg is so popular
because there are loaders for all kinds
of things compiling typescript es6 code
says as CSS much much more simply google
around a bit and you will find a lot of
use cases now let's dive into the last
chord feature plugin
what are plugins plugins are almost the
same as loaders you could say and then
again they are really there
red loaders are applied on a per file
basis so here we check for CSS files and
then on every CSS file we use we apply
these loaders to transform the code or
load it correctly
a plugin is then applied on your bundle
before it is output you could say so if
you have some transformation you want to
apply to your whole code a plug-in is
what you're looking for and a typical
plug-in you would use is the
minification plugin now of course we
already can mini 5 by adding - p here
and that uses this plugin indeed behind
the scenes but if you want to really
configure this specific plugin in all
detail possible or add another plugin
you will need to add the plug-in array
here because you can add multiple
plugins obviously now which plugin can
be used here I will deal with that
minification plug-in so I will simply
need to import web tag for this so what
do you require syntax here from web pack
and any plugins array here I can now
simply add new new keyword is important
we need to instantiate it web pack
whoops not like a method list though
optimize so call optimize here and then
the ugly 5ks
plugin here you can pass options in a
JavaScript object and this is why this
might be preferable to executing it with
- P you can now dive deeper into this
and simply Google this plugin if you
want you know all these options you have
for example we could disable warnings we
could turn mangling on or off which is a
more aggressive form of manipulation and
so on here I won't pass any but of
course you could do that if I now
restart my web site development server
we should see a difference though if we
reload the page it still does work but
now if we inspect the source code you
see it's minified here q and it wasn't
before when we use the development
server you can also see it on the
network if you reload this you see that
the bundles now shrank before it was
around 300 kilobytes now
smaller because we minified it so this
is how we can add plugins the fourth and
loss of the cool features of webpage so
that is our finished configuration file
now and that were the four core concepts
of web pack the entry point where to
start the output where to end what you
create and in between during this
journey we also have modules and what
you do with them and module rules so
what should you do with each individual
file you load and then we have plugins
right before we create the bundle
what should you do with the prepared
code with the overall code should you
minify it should you do something else
with it for example there are plugins
which allow you to outsource your CSS
code into separate style sheets things
like these these are the core concepts
that is how web pack works and in the
next which is off this series we're
going to have a closer look at some
default use cases what you do with web
pack using different loaders some common
setups and things like these all right
into the comment section what you would
like to see a con promise that I will
cover it all but definitely interesting
to read that and I'll do my best to show
some of the things you request there so
see you in the other videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
