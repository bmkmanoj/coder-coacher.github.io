new year and a brand new face since the
bird is gone and you can find out where
it went in the Christmas video I
released in the last year so in this
series we're going to have a look at
something which was requested a lot how
can we connect level with angular 2 or
with you che s both was in high demand
and in the next videos I will show you
how to do that now there are two
different ways of connecting level to
angular 2 or view che s you could either
simply add some widgets to your level
application that means your level
application still renders a couple of
views like you know it from all my
lateral projects on this channel and in
the views we might use some widgets some
tabs we can click which then share
different content or some drop down or
whatever and those widgets are obviously
powered by JavaScript because they need
to edit the Dom at runtime and instead
of building them with vanilla JavaScript
or jQuery we could use angular 2 or view
che as to build those widgets now this
is a valid use case especially for you
chest though because angular 2 really
isn't that great at building widgets
it's just not what it's meant for it's
just not where it really excels angular
Q is great at building single page
applications so applications which are
completely powered by angular 2
it is great at building enterprise level
large applications of that type but when
it comes to building just widgets it's
technically possible
you can bootstrap multiple pages excuse
me multiple angular apps on the same
page and each widget would be a separate
app you could say but it's really not
fun when you look at the tooling you
can't use the c l-- i there because the
sea lion integrate well into your
lateral workflow you can create your own
workflow but it's not that much fun and
also what you get a lot of over
yes you can only import what you need
from the world of angular 2 tools and
features but still it's the fully
fledged angular 2 framework you're using
and there are a lot of things you just
won't need there it's just not the best
option to be honest so building widgets
with angular tube is probably not what
you wanted you it's perfectly fine to do
that with UJS though because UJS unlike
angular 2 scales in both directions it
scales up you can build big enterprise
level large applications with vue.js
single page applications that would be
and you can also scale down and build
simple tiny widgets you drop into pages
it works with both so that's something
we'll have a look at in this series it's
not with which we're starting though
instead I want to focus on the main
tasks or the main usage of those
frameworks creating single page
applications in that case view chess or
englert you will create and power the
full application they will provide their
own routers which allow the user to
switch between pages but technically no
new pages are loaded from the server
instead only the URL changes and parts
of your page are re-rendered those
single page applications can be served
by any server and typically are not
served by your lateral application
though that would be possible you could
serve like an index top plate or PHP
file which simply holds your index dot
HTML content which starts your angular 2
or view Chase application and that's
nothing else
the important thing here is Larry will
won't render any views or maybe just
that one view but not multiple views
instead you have a single page
application where does lateral come into
play then lateral is your back-end and
you connect to it via HTTP Ajax calls so
you basically call your level back end
from your angular 2
or a view chess application to store
some data in the database because
database access is something which only
your server-side language can do so you
need your back-end here or to fetch some
data do some calculations to anything
which needs to be done on a server in
that case you would use level and level
would basically just expose some API
endpoints some URLs to which your
front-end your angle to or view chess
applications can connect and can send
the requests this is what I will start
with in a series and actually this is
what we're going to build it's not the
most awesome application ever but it
covers all the crud methods so creating
reading updating and deleting content we
can create a new quote here and we can
also fetch quotes now already created
once if we click get quotes well we see
the quote I did create we can then also
go in there and edit it for example add
multiple exclamation marks since
multiple exclamation marks always make a
message more meaningful so if we then
hit save it updates and well we could
also of course delete it now it's gone
and if I reload this and click get
quotes again well we don't get any
quotes because I deleted it so we can
also add a new quote here hit save and
see well it was created let's go there
and get quotes again here it is so that
is what we're going to build it's not
super awesome but it covers all the
excess types we typically have when
reaching out to the backend so this is
what I will start with and specifically
in the next video of this series I'm
going to start with building the backend
with lateral building all those API
endpoints I was talking about and
walking you through that process before
we then in the further videos dive into
building the angular 2 and view chase
applications and make them able to well
reach out to our back-end and use it so
let's start with building the back-end
