channel you can find a lot of videos
about web development but you can find
so far is a beginner's guide so a guide
that helps you if you just started web
development or if you never code it
before that's the purpose of this
miniseries because in this series we'll
take a look at the basics of web
development specifically we will take a
look at front-end web development so
HTML CSS and JavaScript so let's start
right now and have a look at the first
steps in HTML together
so how do we start such a miniseries how
do we get the easiest entry into the
complex area of web development well I
think a good starting point is the
answer to this question how does the web
actually work because the starting point
could be you or me we are sitting there
as users or a so called clients and we
could enter a URL into our browser now
talking about browsers the browser could
be chrome could be Firefox could be edge
could be Safari whatever you want the
important thing is that with entering
this URL we are sending a get request
why are we sending this obviously
because we want to display information
in our browser we want to display the
web page in this case apple.com so we
need information specifically we are
sending a HTTP request HTTP stands for
hypertext Transfer Protocol and this
simply means that we want to fetch
information to display it in the browser
now the question is what type of
information are we requesting well the
browser could respect different types of
information for example it could also
request zip files or something like that
but let's assume for the moment that the
browser requests information in the HTML
format so HTML code now why are we
assuming that well because every web
page is based on HTML so without HTML
code you can't display your web page and
that's the reason why we request HTML
code from the server not from which
server well we enter this URL and in
this URL we enter the domain Apple com
and because of that we're requesting
information HTML code from the apple
server now let's assume another thing
let's assume that this request was
successful what happens then is that we
would get a response from the server and
what would that response look like well
we requested HTML so because of that we
would get HTML code back
from the server and this HTML code is
really important because this HTML code
includes the content and the structure
of our web page and that's why we need
HTML code for each web page that we have
because without content and structure
well there is nothing to display now is
there anything more that we could get
back as a response from the server and
just to be precise I am referring to
additional information that is part of
that HTML file because we only get back
one HTML file from the server so is
there anything more that we could get
back now the answer is yes we can
another thing we could get back is CSS
CSS stands for cascading style sheets
and CSS is required to add some styling
to our web page so for example to change
the colors of specific areas of the web
page to make it look more beautiful or
better now do we need CSS no we don't
need CSS at all because as I said HTML
by the way HTML stands for hypertext
markup language I didn't mention it
before so now we know that so HTML is
the content in the structure and if we
have the content and the course
structure then the web page will be
totally fine but ugly and we don't want
ugly pages we want our web pages to look
good and therefore we need CSS we'll
talk about CSS in detail throughout this
miniseries now is there more to come it
is we could also get JavaScript now
what's that now
well JavaScript is basically responsible
to add logic to our web page what do you
mean by logic
well logic is necessary if we have
something where a condition is required
so let's assume if we enter an email
into a specific field we want to display
valid or invalid in this case we need a
conditional function and this is based
on JavaScript
not at summarize that the response from
the server is always HTML if it works of
course so if the request was successful
in this HTML code we get the basic
structure and the content of the web
age an optional additional response
could be CSS to add some styling and
JavaScript to add some logic to our
webpage now as soon as we got this
responses or this response we can
display a web page in our browser and
that's actually how the web generally
works of course there is a lot more
because as I said in the beginning of
this video in this series we will take a
look at front and web development this
means everything that runs in the
browser now as you can imagine there is
more let's assume you are an apple comm
and you want to create a user account by
that Apple needs to save your email and
the corresponding password and this
shouldn't be saved in the browser of
course this should be saved on the
server and for that purpose you need a
back-end so back-end web development for
databases for example this is something
we will not cover throughout this
miniseries
however Mac's created an awesome video
where he gives you a great overview of
web development in general so he shows
you front-end web development back in
web development frameworks and a lot
more so definitely check out this video
if you want to find out more about that
now back to front and web development
though because we saw that now in theory
and this is nice but can we also see
that if we really type apple.com into
our browser well let's find that out
right now so here I am in chrome right
now and I'm in chrome because well I
said that you can use any browser you
want a few minutes ago that's totally
correct but for the purpose of this
miniseries I highly recommend to use
Chrome because Chrome comes with an
integrated tool actually or tool that
the chrome developer tools and with
these tools we can take a look at the
details behind the web page actually so
eight parts of the code for example and
this is really important if you want to
understand how the web works in general
and also when we want to create our own
web page therefore I recommend using
Chrome and I will use Chrome right here
so it would be awesome if you could
the same because then it's easy to
follow this video however I'm in Chrome
right now as I said and I talked about
these developer tools where can we find
these developer tools actually well the
developer tools can be found either here
if you click onto these three dots
appear and now go to more tools and the
developer tools or so I'm on the Mac
right here so on the Mac you can type
command option so old
and I to open the developer tools that's
what they look like if you're using a
Windows machine you can simply press f12
to access the developer tools with the
shortcut however now we see these
developer tools maybe make them a little
bit bigger for you and a P we see
different tabs actually now I'm in
network tab already and that's also a
tab you should go to as soon as we did
that we can all enter apple.com and then
let's see what happens right here in
this network tab so now apple.com
finished loading and as you can see in
our network tab a lot of information was
loaded into the browser chronologically
by the way so you see the chronological
loading order here in this network tab
now let's have a look at what we got
right here what you can see but here are
some images for example here we can see
is that stands for JavaScript you
remember that was that part of the
response that was responsible for the
logic on our web page we can also see
CSS so cascading style sheets that's the
part that makes our web page look more
beautiful also something people talk
about later throughout this miniseries
but if we scroll to the beginning we can
see this apple.com by the way the
statues 200 simply means well as you can
see right here the request was okay so
our response was delivered actually now
what happens if we click on to apple.com
let's do that now and increase the size
a little bit maybe oops like that well
as you can see here in this headers tab
we have the request URL so we wanted to
go to apple.com
you can see the request method you
remember on the slide we talked about
that get requests that we sent we can
see the status quo to hunt
we talked about that it's okay and we
can also get some other information like
the response headers we will not talk
about that right now
that's something we will cover later the
important thing right now is that our
request was successful and that we
received an HTML file how do I know that
this is HTML well if you look at preview
right here there then you can see that
we have this doctype HTML thing and then
we have HTML written right here so
that's pure HTML code you will see right
here and which we received from Apple
com based on our request that we sent
now let's have a quick look at this code
without going to the details because you
can see HTML right here if we scroll to
the right you can see this bigger than
sign so we see that this kind of wraps
HTML then we see head also with the
smaller than and bigger than signs then
we have some meta data right here also
something we will not talk about now in
detail just for you to see that there is
really a lot of code in here interesting
part now is that head is again mention
right there you remember we had head up
here but without the slash just head and
down there we have had now again with
the smaller and bigger sign but also
with a slash that's interesting let's
keep that in mind after head we got the
body there is some class attached to it
we can ignore it for the moment but
again body is kind of opened apparently
then we have a lot of information in
here so let's scroll to the end right
now of this HTML code so here I am now
in the last lines and as you can see
body is now mentioned again now with
that slash and the same thing is true
for HTML you remember that was written
at the beginning when the whole HTML
code started actually now apparently
this HTML code can somehow be
interpreted by the browser and display
the page as I said before to this bit of
page the way it is right here it
a lot more like CSS and JavaScript but
generally hTML is a code that can be
interpreted by the browser now this is a
really big file and we can't dive into
all the details but why can't we just
create an HTML file on our own and then
add some content to our web page is that
possible and the answer is yes the only
thing we need to write basic HTML code
is a text editor and as we got a text
editor on our computer why don't we just
create an index.html file and see how we
can write code and how it is displayed
in the browser let's do this right now
as I said before I'm working on a neck
book right here and therefore I opened
an empty file in TextEdit if you work on
a Windows machine you can do the same
thing by only using notepad now for
notepad you don't have to adjust
anything if you're using TextEdit on the
macbook you need to make sure that this
is displayed as plain text not as rich
text because rich text will add some
additional information to the file and
because of that it will be displayed
wrong or it can be displayed wrong in
the browser later therefore make sure
that this is plain text you can quickly
check that by going to format up here
and now see that this is not rich text
so if you click on to make rich text
this is rich text this is wrong so go
back to format and change it to make
plain text this is correct now we have
the text editor right here and we will
create this HTML file but before we do
that let's add some content the content
could be hello I and a web page really
creative now let's save this to create
an HTML file so right here I selected a
folder you can leave the plain text
encoding to Unicode utf-8 that's correct
the important thing is that you don't
save this file as text but as index dot
HTML like that now we save that
and if we now navigate to the folder
where you saved the file to in my case
this is right here this is the
index.html file that we created then
well how can we now displayed in the
browser actually there are two options
the first option and this is the option
you should always use if you create your
own web page is using a development
server because you remember back the
slide we had that actually we enter a
URL into the browser then we send a
request to a server and then get a
response now the problem is that this
file is located on our computer and we
can't send a request to our own computer
with a development server we can do that
we will not talk about the details how
to set up a development server right now
because as I said before we have two
options we have this development server
and we can simply open that file with a
double-click then the file will be open
in the browser and then we can also
display our web page the important thing
though as I said before is that this
approach should not be used if you
really want to create your own web page
because there might be certain features
of your page which are not working
correctly if you just open the HTML file
by a double-click in the browser so to
summarise that the option you should
follow normally when you create your own
web pages is the development server in
our case right here as we just apply
some basic HTML right now
we can simply double click onto the HTML
file just see what happens just keep
that in mind however as I said we can
simply double click right now this and
now we see that a new tab opens and in
this tab we can now see hello I am a web
page now what does this mean well this
basically means that the browser was
able to interpret the HTML file we
created
that's quite awesome but not really
impressive probably but the starting
point let's go back to our text editor
now and see what else we can add right
here because right here we have hello
and a web page now what if I add
something like and this is line 2 maybe
like that and let's say this should be a
paragraph because it's line two
let's save that always important save
any changes otherwise it can't be
displayed in the browser now let's
switch back to the browser and press
reload right here well now you see that
and this is line 2 is displayed but it's
displayed in the same line as hello and
a web page and that's not the way it
should be right because obviously HTML
and the browser cannot understand the
paragraph we typed in the text editor so
we need to add something and this
something is a tag you remember this
text we had at apple.com
this HTML and body tags for example
let's go back to a text editor and add
such a tag let's add a tag and a
potential attack or a good tag right
here could be P for paragraph of course
I'm not randomly choosing the paragraph
right here there are specific given tags
available in HTML which can be
interpreted by the browser we'll have a
look at these tags that are available in
the next videos of this series
the important thing for now is that we
use the paragraph because it's an
available tag and it's a tag that makes
sense right here in this example so
let's add the paragraph right now so
let's add the smaller sign P and the
larger sign then after our content
that's the content we add another
smaller sign now a slash P and the
larger than symbol now what did we
create right here we created an element
right here so this is an element and
this element has an opening tag right
here and a closing tag right there and
the content oops
and the content that should be displayed
like that now let's save this and see if
we now created a paragraph let's reload
the browser right here and indeed we did
so that's interesting right
HTML and the browser understand this
Peter
as a paragraph and by that we now
created that second text as a new line
so here can already see that tags are
really important in HTML because as I
said before hTML is responsible for the
content and the general structure of the
web page and how should the browser know
that it should make a paragraph right
here and because of that it's really
important that we always add text to our
content in an HTML file and this also
means that hello I'm a webpage right
here although display correctly is not
best practice code because if we go back
to the text editor we can see that we
only have the text right here but no
opening and closing tag therefore we
should change that and we could easily
change it by adding also a paragraph to
it like this and like that maybe it
saved us and if we go back right now and
reload the page we can see nothing
changed but we credit the code in a best
practice manner so keep that in mind
always use tags when you create content
in your HTML file another thing we saw
is that HTML actually forgives a lot of
mistakes because if you think back about
the HTML file we saw on apple.com we saw
that this file included things like
doctype on top and we had this HTML this
head and these body tags now all these
tags are not part of our HTML file right
here and the browser still could
interpret it nevertheless it's always
important to write best practice code as
said before because otherwise your code
is not really efficient or might be slow
and additionally it's hard to read and
understand by other people let's maybe
have a look at one additional tag so for
the purpose let's go back to the text
editor let's maybe add something like I
am the header something like this now as
you can imagine right here if I save
this and go back the header is added up
there
let's go back again now what if I add
another tag an h1 tag maybe and close it
right here save it
let's see what happens now after I go
back right here and we load the page
well then we can see him that we applied
some styling to our header how can that
be
didn't I tell you before that for
styling purposes we use CSS that's
totally true and that's also important
to keep in mind because although h1 add
some styling right here this styling
could be easily changed by CSS so we
could for example easily change and this
is line 2 - the same format like this
header up here that's easy to do and
because of that always keep in mind that
styling is related to CSS additionally
this h1 starting right here is
interpreted by the browser
therefore this might look different if
you don't use chrome but use Firefox for
example therefore that's not the way to
style your content but why do we have
these tags then well imagine a newspaper
in a newspaper you also have the header
section and then you have a Content
section and that's actually the logic
that you can follow right here with this
h1 tag you simply make it easy to
identify which part should be the header
in your HTML document we will talk about
more text of course throughout the next
videos but that's actually the main
thing you should keep in mind regarding
the opening and closing tags it's always
important to use these tags to add
structure to your HTML file you can also
think about a blind person right here
because this person obviously cannot see
you a page so the person might use a
screen reader and this screen reader
needs information about the content of
the page so we need clear tags and by
that elements with a clear meaning to
make sure that the page can be
interpreted correctly and with that we
are not actually done with the first
part of this miniseries we know at a
basic look at how the web in general
works we saw that we create get requests
by enter
in a browser we also started to get
responses which always should include
HTML and optionally CSS and JavaScript
we saw how this works in the chrome
developer tools on apple.com and we
created our own index.html file with
some basic content which we can now
display in the browser so that's a
really huge step for the beginning
actually but in the next video we will
change the perspective because right now
we had a look at how the web works but
actually we are web developers we want
to know how web developers work so let's
have a look at that in the next video
then hope to see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
