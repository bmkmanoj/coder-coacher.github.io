back in this miniseries in the last
videos to learn what firebase cloud
functions are and how to create a cloud
function that listens to changes in our
firebase storage in this video we'll
listen to http events hence actually
creating our own API let's dive into
that
so let's add a new cloud function here's
the cloud function I created in the last
video the one which reacts on storage
events now I'll export a new function
here with exports and then the function
name and I will name this one here
upload file I'll use the functions
object here which we get from the
firefight fire base functions package
and I will use the HTTP realm to listen
to HTTP events there we have on request
and on request then also takes a
function that gets executed and this
gets executed whenever an HTTP request
reaches this endpoint and you'll get the
exact URL once you deployed it this
object here actually will hold a request
and a response object as you know it
from Express Apps note Express so in
there we can now do something we should
absolutely send a response that's the
bare minimum so what we can do here is
we can send a status code of 200 with
maybe some JSON data where we output a
message it worked and you could also
send HTML here it doesn't have to be
JSON data and if this is a certain
extent no it's probably worth looking
into some node Express tutorials because
I'll essentially be using the same
syntax and language here so with that
I'm sending a response and now why don't
we just try it out
this is a basic HTTP function cloud
function which we can trigger by sending
a request to it so let me run firebase
deploy in our project here to put this
back into firebase and create a function
with this upload file function we just
define and then let's see how we can
trigger that deployment finished and now
if you expand the console here or scroll
up you will see where your functions are
deployed to and for HTTP functions
you'll get the endpoint you have to send
a request to so I'll copy that URL here
and then I'll simply open postman that
is a tool that allows you to send HTTP
requests well
to any endpoint you want essentially in
there I'll enter the URL and I won't set
any special headers or a body I'll just
send a get request and it's sent and now
this gives me and deep back some JSON
data it worked with status code 200 so
this shows does a dead works and we can
also send a post request to the Zen
point we get back there are the same
response if we only want to handle some
HTTP works and at all of them we have to
do this in this endpoint by default that
handles all incoming requests so now we
could say we just want to handle post
requests so we could check if request
method if this is not equal to post if
it is not equal then I will return a
response with maybe status code 500 and
set jason-2 to pass an object where the
message is not allowed or whatever you
want so with that I updated this now I
can deploy it again and the URL is going
to stay the same and as you already see
I'm using this same syntax used in a
normal node Express project because
firebase cloud functions for HTTP events
use node Express behind the scenes so
you can use the same syntax and the same
packages for a node express project so
that's pretty cool so this is something
to keep in mind you can really build
your node Express project in a restful
way and on a per endpoint basis with
cloud functions you can simply write any
logic here which you would normally put
in one of your routes in the node
Express project you might be building so
it's wait for this to finish in let's
then try this out deployment finished
it's worth waiting a couple of
milliseconds or half a minute or
something like that to really make sure
that the function change propagated and
you really reach the right endpoint and
then if you try again and you send a
post request you should get it worked
and if you send a get request you get
not allowed so now we make sure only
post requests trigger this now the idea
behind the functions not just to send
back some dummy data I actually want to
accept some data some form data let's
say so a mixture of
file and some fields which I can put
onto cloud storage for this I first of
all want to ensure that course is
enabled so cross-site origin resource
sharing to make sure that also apps that
do not live on the same server as this
function will be hosted on so basically
all apps but also these apps are able to
send HTTP requests to this back-end now
for postman this is not important
because postman is not a browser it
doesn't check for weather course is
allowing this access but in a browser if
you send some Ajax requests you
typically have the issue that the server
has to enable course so basically has to
allow you to access the resource even
though your web app might not be running
on the same origin not on the same
server so I want to allow that and for
that I will install a new package so
navigate into the functions folder and
with the npm install - - save all in
store let's install the course package
now this is a node express package we
can use to conveniently set some headers
we need to send back to the client to
allow this crossorigin access and with
that installed all imported here course
require course this is executed as a
function and I pass an object to that
function where I set origin to true to
setup this these course headers for this
origin correctly and then it will
actually wrap my entire code here with
this course middleware so I will execute
course as a function here and this
function takes three arguments request
response and then the function should
execute after it basically added its own
headers to the request and response so I
will forward request and response here
and then execute a function where I also
get requests and response and where I
then will simply put the code I
previously had well in my cloud function
itself so now it's wrapped by this
course middleware and therefore it sends
the right headers to allow crossorigin
access since i renamed this in this
anonymous function here to request and
respond
I should all return response status in
both cases now to have this work
correctly again with that we added
course we still don't really accept form
data we're not able to do anything with
incoming files so that's the next step I
want to take and Q accept such file
uploads and then store them on fire by
storage I need two things I need one
package that parses the incoming request
body for foreign data and then gives me
convenient access to the files and the
fields I might have added and I need
access to my firebase storage which I
already can do or can access with my
Google Cloud storage package there so we
already got this at least now for
parsing that incoming request body I'll
use a package name busboys which is a
package that is able to handle incoming
foreign data so again navigate into that
functions folder and run npm install - -
save busboys like that and then once
this is installed we'll never get back
into the main directory and I'll import
busboy from the busboy package like this
and then I'll go into my course wrapper
and after I checked the method off the
request I'll create a new busboy
instance with new busboy and I'll pass
an object to it where I simply forward
the headers so set the headers property
to request headers does require - well
allow bass boy to find out whoever the
incoming request is of type form data or
not so if it should parse it or not with
that I'll use this bass boy object and
add the on listener and I'll listen to
file events these will be triggered
whenever pass boys successfully parses a
file from the incoming request in this
case we would get an event a method that
gets executed a function which receives
the field name in which the fall was
stored the file itself the name of the
file the encoding of the file and the
mime type
funky gets executed for every foul
detected India requests reaching this
endpoint now I'm only interested in
false if you wanted to also get fields
you would have add a busboy on field
listener no fields is anything but a
file so extra information you add with
the request since we're sending foreign
data it can be a mixture of a file and
extra fields I'm only interested in the
file though so once we got a file what's
what's the plan
the plan is to store it in firebase
storage right so what I'll do here is
I'll construct a path to the file by
using half join which already used in
the last video where I get the temporary
directory of this cloud function there
is a little temporary cloud storage
attached to the cloud function it will
be cleaned up whenever the execution is
done essentially but during the
execution you can use it to store files
and busboys will store it in some temp
directory will store that incoming file
there so I'll access the temp directory
and get my file there so I'm
constructing a path to the file which
pass by extract it and then I will
create some variable here which will
name upload data which initially is now
I do this out set of paths boy on
instead of pass by on file I'll then set
upload data to an object a JavaScript
object where I will set my file to
default path I created here and where I
set the type to the mime type bus boy
detected now why do I set it up like
this in a variable because now I will
leave this path boy on function here and
add an a verb or one pass boy on finish
bass boy on simply triggers whenever it
found a file but finished triggers
wanted to stunt parsing the entire
request this is when I want to upload
the data so here in this handler
function and I want to use Google Cloud
Storage to upload so I'll create a
bucket object here and use GCS bucket to
do that to get a reference to
a bucket and now I want to get my
default bucket for this firebase account
you can get this easily by visiting your
storage and there it's basically this
name without the GS colon slash slash at
the beginning this is what I'll pass
here this is my default bucket this is
the bucket into which I want to store
the file now if dead reference created I
can trigger bucket upload call that
method pass my file and that is why I
got this upload data object here where I
have a file property which holds a path
to the file so now I can pass upload
data file here which is that path to the
file I want to upload then I can pass a
JavaScript object where I will set the
upload type to media and set the
metadata field Q hold another metadata
field where I will set the content type
to the upload data type so the content
type we originally detected you could
add more metadata to the uploaded file
of course now at some point of time
upload will be done and it even returns
us an error or some information about
the uploaded file now if we got an error
I want to return a response with status
code 500 and some JSON object where I
essentially pass on the error object but
if we don't make it into the safe
statement so if we don't have an error
then I know that we successfully
uploaded the file and then I will take
my original response and remove it from
the end of that file and put it into
this then block here and with that we
should have a setup where we can upload
a file through HTTP request so let's try
it out let's go into the root project
folder and run firebase deploy and let's
then see if we can successfully send
foreign data requests with a file in it
cue our back in here and then store that
in firebase cloud storage
and then it should actually all to
trigger our resize function which we
wrote in the last video so let's see if
that both is the case the deployment is
done here again don't rush this it takes
some time to propagate that new endpoint
to the web so I'll go back to postman
and now I will go to body of my post
requests make sure to set this to
foreign data and then add a file here
gif does any name you want like image
and choose a file of course I'll take
that the winter image we used before now
this is the request I want to send so
let me hit Send here and I actually get
back an error could not handle the
request let's have a look at our
firebase functions log here so on
firebase cloud functions I'll have a
look at my upload file log here and
there I can treat headers of undefined
at course hmm
yeah because I got an error here the
course middleware does execute a
function here but actually the original
request and response object are just
edited so that is my mistake here also I
never changed this we're just correct
because I should keep the original
request not renamed us to requests just
keep a direct we're here and the same
for a response use response arrests and
not the response we used before
everywhere because course just appends
to this original data it does replace
this so this is my mistake sorry for
that so let's quickly rebuild deploy
this and then test us again so now the
updated function redeployed let me try
this again
and again let's not rush this it can
take a while so let's try sending this
again and now it's taking really really
long here then you can see in the lock
that it started a function execution but
somehow it's not finishing here now it
will timeout after 60 seconds that's the
default timeout so you got no infinite
running function costing you thousands
of dollars by
way the basic execution so a couple of
executions which are clearly defined in
the official Docs actually with more
than just a couple are free so you can
run your function quite a lot without
paying anything only if you exceed that
limit you will have to pay but again you
can find this in the official Docs and
there on the pricing pages it is
described how often you can run your
function in the free tier and from which
point on it will cost you money so here
you can see it timed out after this one
minute the question of course is why did
it timeout what what's wrong here why
doesn't this work it actually has two
issues our function one is here when we
parse file requests when we get incoming
files there we get the file path but
actually this is not a file path that's
why we'll automatically store the fallen
itself all puffs we can use to store the
fallen so first of all let's import and
now we're dependency the file system
package which is a default node package
so we don't need to install it
separately and then in the file listener
here I will use that file busboys
detected and add the pipe method to do
something to that file and then I will
use FS create right stream you basically
stream the file content into a new file
and pass file path as an argument this
will actually write this file to the
system now that's one thing another
thing is that Google Cloud Storage
whilst we could use it in our cloud
storage trigger in the HVP trigger it's
not available it's not initialized we
need to initialize it manually with the
credentials of our firebase project that
we can do it as easily by going to our
firebase project and then to the
settings project settings and there to
service accounts there you can now
download under firebase sta admin SDK
you can download a private key which you
need to initialize cloud storage so you
can click generate new private key
and then stored it in your project
folder so here in the functions folder
so now I added this file which holds my
private key and now in your firebase
cloud function you actually need to
initialize your Google Cloud storage a
bit differently
you need to initialize it such that you
can use it in every function so I'll put
it a bit further down because before we
import it I'll add a new constant which
we'll name GC config for a Google Cloud
config where I will just specify the
project ID woops like that make sure the
casing is correct project ID which is
just your firebase project ID I'll add
it in a second and a key file name
property which is just the name of that
JSON file make sure to add dot J's and
you just generated and download it and
store it in your project so the project
ID is something you can find in the
firebase RC file for example so I'll add
this here also as a string and this
Google Cloud Connect has to be passed to
that function we execute here when we
import the Google Cloud Storage package
I'll just pass this GC config object to
it to initialize that and with that I
now make sure that Google Cloud Storage
all the works in this HTTP trigger
function and not just in the storage
related cloud function that is something
you have to keep in mind if you want to
use the Cloud Storage package in a non
storage related trigger function then
you have to initialize it with your
private key you download it from the
firebase console now if then we're
almost there but there's one more thing
we have to do to kick off this whole
busboys thing after all our on listeners
and so on I also have to call Busboys
and and pass the request raw body Hewitt
raw bodies a property provided to us by
a cloud function itself so to say on the
request object and this simply well is
required for Busboys to work correctly
and to start parsing or to to parse all
the requests and trigger
on events now with that we're almost
there one more thing though here in the
upload then block that's of course a
mistake here we just get a function here
if we are successful and if we would
have an error then we would actually end
up here in the catch block so that is
where we then received the error then we
then in turn want to handle we don't
need an if step in here we would just
return our error response here so just
like this this is the adjustment need to
make this syntax where you get the error
or the uploaded file reference which you
also could use here that would only be
relevant if you were to pass you see an
alternative way of using the upload
function by passing a callback function
where you then indeed have your error or
the uploaded file but if you use the
promised approach as I do you work with
then and catch of course so sorry about
that and with that let's deploy this
firebase function and let's see if with
all these changes it works as it should
now let's already do something else
let's go to storage and I already got
some files in there which actually are
defaults I will upload so I will delete
them to make sure that we really can see
if that works so that I got an empty
storage now if that I'll wait for this
to finish and then we'll try out sending
the same act request again and hopefully
with that storing a file on cloud
storage through our firebase HTTP
triggered cloud function pretty advanced
I guess deployment finished and as
always let's give this a few seconds
before we send the request and then in
postman all sent the same request again
queue firebase and I get back it worked
which is looking good
now on storage I'll reload this and
actually there we should see two files
now we see the uploaded file and the
resized one because our other cloud
function which triggers upon file
changes and of course this is a file
change it's uploaded so this triggers
the cloud function
the average cloud function also runs so
the resizing cloud functions all the
runs and here I can confer and by the
date and time
this is today so this works as it should
and with dad with some errors we made it
to the end of that we have our upload
file HTTP endpoint which is triggered by
an incoming request we check the request
method we make sure that we would all to
be able to reach this from some web app
which uses a browser which therefore
make sure that course is enabled we do
enable it here we use bass voice you
parse the foreign data and parse any
files store them in a temporary folder
and then once we parse the hold request
upload it through the initialize Google
Cloud Storage package and then we will
kick off this whole parsing essentially
here by calling end and saying we're
done reading in the request here's the
raw body please do something with it
this is what's happening here and they
hope that despite the few errors we
faced which also might have been helpful
seeing some things to avoid you learned
how to set up HTTP endpoints through
firebase cloud functions and which extra
flexibility just gives you now you can
build your own restful api on top of
firebase you can use all the other
features you can integrate this API with
the other features like we do for
storage and you can add extra
functionality that previously you
couldn't add easily at least</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
