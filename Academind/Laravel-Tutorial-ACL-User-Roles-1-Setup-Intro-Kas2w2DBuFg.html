video I read all the comments under my
last playground with you and I'm really
amazed how many great ideas I've read
there
I haven't replied to most of them but I
read it all and that really is the sense
of the serious that you post comments I
read it and I give my very best to will
make videos about this I'm going to
start with one thing that I've read the
most often implementing some kind of
user roles model so like an access
control list ACL where we can have a
middleware or some kind of protection
which SAS this route is only accessible
by let's say administrators whereas this
route is accessible by everyone and so
on so that's exactly what I'm going to
do in this video or probably depending
on time the next few videos here I will
implement such an ACL such an X control
list we're not actually starting from
scratch I have a simple application here
which has free routes here which are
accessible even though we're not locked
in however I still can log in and I have
free users set up for this a normal user
an admin and an offer however at the
moment all these users are equal because
no rules have been implemented that what
we're going to do in this video however
I can log in the login functionality is
fully implemented as you can see I now
get to logout but here so I am actually
logged in and I can still access all the
routes I Clint click on generate here
which doesn't actually do anything but
says hey article generated great so this
is the app we're working with and what I
want to do is as I said I have a user
and offer and an admin user and I want
the admin deal to be the only one who
may access this admin panel here and
well later once we have implemented
rolls to the free users I created these
are the free users I have as a seed in
this project I also want you offer and
the admin to be able to access this
offer out however the offer should be
the only one who is able to click this
link and actually generate a new article
all users including the normal user
who's never an admin Lauren offer may
access this main page here so that is
what I want to achieve
now the code with which I'm going to
start which creates this application
will be available in a github repository
to which you will find a link in the
description of course so this is the
actual project I'm starting with as you
can see I already guessed get some fuse
here these are the views we just saw in
the application I get a migration from
file the users migration file which just
creates users with the first last name
email address which is unique and
password and I should get rid of this
we're going to create this together and
I also got this user table seeder here
which creates my free well users I start
off with so that is where we started and
in well the next part we'll have a look
at how we start implementing our roles
functionality
see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
