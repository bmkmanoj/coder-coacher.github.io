back if you watch the last video of this
series you know why we might want to use
regular expressions in this video we'll
now dive into how we create patterns and
how they actually work so let's start
and we will start on regex 101.com a
picture i don't own I don't get any
money for mentioning it it's just a
great page for working and testing and
playing around with regular expressions
so let's dive into that
so as mentioned I'm on regex 101.com
and the page is very simple to
understand but very powerful and a great
playing ground you have an input line
where you can insert your regular
expression pattern without these slashes
so you can just start typing your
pattern like ll and then you have the
string below it which you want to check
like hello there and you immediately see
that it marks all occurrences of your
pattern it finds now this pattern also
has one flag enabled by default
flags are basically just additional
configurations you can set up on your
patterns here it's the global flag which
makes sure that it doesn't stop after
finding one hit it'll match all
occurrences of this pattern so if I have
hello there it'll be awesome it also
matches the seconds ii ll if I were to
disable global only the first one was
matched this is how it works with the
pattern and the string and on the right
here you even get explanation of the
given pattern you entered it basically
explains why it matched something and
here it simply we explains that ll
matches the characters ll and only these
two characters following each other and
in a case sensitive way then you get
some detailed information about the
match where it found the match and then
at the bottom you give a quick reference
of all the commands and special
characters you can use in regular
expression patterns of course we will
walk through many of them over the next
videos so this is a very basic match
here ll not too exciting let's say we
want to match the hello world at word
and of course we can do this by simply
entering hello there maybe don't miss
type it now let's say we would have
hello hello but the second hello starts
with a lowercase character it's not
matched because our matching strategy is
case sensitive there are two ways of
still getting a hit on the second hello
- if we wanted to
that first we could add an additional
flag di flag for insensitive insensitive
as the name suggests simply means it
doesn't care for the casing you set this
flag
now the second hello is also matched
because it's done in an insensitive a
case insensitive way now let me turn
this off though because I want to make
this or have this work in a different
way you can also do something else and
create an alternative to the capital age
you can wrap the capital H and
parentheses to create a group basically
and then add the pipe symbol and then
the alternative like a lowercase H and
now you see both strings are matched the
H is marked as green because it's in our
group but the match is the full word and
you get the explanation on the right we
have a capturing group that capturing
part is something I'll come back to in a
later video and then we have our two
alternatives in a group uppercase and a
lowercase H this already's are first a
little more complex pattern because we
have more flexibility there it's
especially useful if you think about the
alternative if you were not to use
regular expressions if you had to check
this with normal if conditions you would
have to check if a given string contains
hello with a capital H or if a given
string contains hello with a lowercase H
certainly doable but as you got more and
more conditions you have to add more and
more if statements whereas here you just
have to add more and more logic to your
pattern which is definitely an
improvement and makes it much easier the
more complex your pattern grows and you
start to feel the effects very early now
let's say when I would take it even
further and we also wanted to match ello
now clearly it's not matched right now
because we match hello with a lowercase
or uppercase H so what we would need to
do to also match ello is we would have
to make something optional D H now we do
this by adding a quest
mark after our group this simply means
the part immediately prior to the
question mark is optional so the Apple
case or lowercase H isn't the end
optional it doesn't matter
that's why ello is also matched now
important if I were to add the question
mark after de ello is not matched so the
question mark does not mean everything
in front of it is optional just the
direct character in front of it so in
this case only the e would be optional
if you want to make everything in front
of it optional you would have to group
it again
so now LLO is also matched but that's of
course not the goal here
I want you make the H optional this is
how we build these patterns we think
about what we want to achieve and then
we got a rich feature set of rules we
can pick off or pick from to construct
this now we only started with groups
alternatives and optional characters we
already got some nice tools though now
in the next video I also want to dive
into how we can match for words if a
part of the word fulfills a certain
criteria and how we can add more cool
rules to get really powerful matchings
and checks with regular expressions
can't wait to see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
