next video of our WordPress series in
this video we're going to set up our own
custom theme and yeah take our very
first steps in the development of our
own theme and why don't we just get into
it so let me start by opening our
WordPress workspace which we set up on
cloud 9 in the last video and once we're
taken there yeah okay ignore that error
message purchase wrong okay so how do we
set up our own theme it's actually very
easy what we do is go to the wp-content
folder expand it go to the themes
subfolder and here we see all our
currently installed or available themes
and these free themes are just you have
the basic themes which come with every
wordpress installation as of now so to
create our own theme the first thing we
do is create a new folder by right click
new folder and I'm just calling this
folder my theme inside this folder we
need need two files to get started so
I'll create a new file and the first
file we need is a style not CSS so
that's a file which will on one end hold
the the styling we will apply to our
theme but we might use our style files
as well so that's left to us but the
other thing this file does is it
provides some information for WordPress
about our theme so without this file our
WordPress theme wouldn't show up in the
theme selection part of our website and
which I will show you right in there
very soon so it's very important
the other file we need is a PHP file
namely the index dot PHP and that is
just our starting file where our content
will will be structured will be provided
because our theme needs some kind of
file where it knows ok every site you
load every blog post everything within
our website needs to be displayed in a
certain way right that's what makes our
theme up and we will actually do this by
combining several files but we need that
one at least one file to start with it
so let me do some basic setup in a style
of CSS file there we need to provide
some information and please note that I
provide this information within comments
so it is just a simple comment which
won't be interpreted as CSS code by ya
just typing forward slash star and then
star forward slash to end the comment
section within the comment section I
need to provide just a little bit of
information so first thing I will need
to provide is the theme name and I do
this by just typing theme name colon and
then the name of our of you might just
call it my my my fee I'll also provide
an offer
max you obviously can put in your name
there and a version of our theme 1.0
actually there are more fields we can
and we really should provide if we were
to market our theme things like the
description of theme URL maybe a URL of
our own website but that's just to get
us started and for now that's everything
we have to put into this file so save it
by hitting ctrl s close it and open the
index dot PHP
Alice said this file will show the
actual content of our blog and I will
demonstrate this just by adding
something like hello maybe in h1 tags
hello world save it and now let me open
our WordPress site the front-end ok so
now to be able to see our changes we
have to actually activate our theme we
do this in our admin dashboard and here
we go to appearance themes over there we
will find our theme with the name we
provided in the style.css file and can
click activate and once this done we
were able to view our theme when we go
to the front end of our website actually
didn't we have some posts to show yeah
we do have two posts so why aren't they
showing up there well obviously that's
the case because everything we provide
with him index dot PHP is HelloWorld
we don't tap any source data source at
all we we can't show any posts because
we don't get them in this file and we
don't have any other file where we would
get it so that's the reason why at the
moment the only thing which shows up is
hello world as this is obviously not
very exciting let's tune it a little bit
I start by providing just a standard
html5 Dutchman skeleton so let me start
by just entering HTML and you do this in
cloud 9 by just basically typing HTML
and then hitting the tab key and this
will create this very very very very
basic skeleton so inside our HTML text
we have a hat section obviously and we
have our body section within our head
section we get also something to specify
specify
so for one we get a title for our
document I'll just leave it at hallo
world for a moment and we might also
provide our meta tag regarding the char
set we use on this page utf-8
I also have to add one additional thing
which which actually comes from
WordPress and this is a PHP function
call so it's just wrap it into PHP tags
and what we need to call is WP hat now
what does WP hat do the thing is in our
WordPress installation we might have
developed different plugins and
obviously we have our standard WordPress
functions functionality and WordPress as
well some plugins might have to add
their own things at the hat of our
document so things like links to style
sheets to JavaScript maybe some meta
tags stuff like that and so we need to
provide a hook for those plugins and for
WordPress to stick that stuff in there
and that's what we're doing with this WP
add function we will need something
similar at the bottom of our page in the
footer actually and that is the WPE
footer function and it basically does a
similar thing like the WP head function
it's a hook for plugins and for
WordPress to inject stuff into our
framework our skeleton we put up here so
if we now visit our website we see the
hello world as gone
we see that it has a title of hello
world and that's exactly what we
provided here right
Tyler follower
no content as of now if you were to add
a content back to it hello world for the
moment we got it here right now if you
are seeing this navigation bar at the
top of your page as well that is
something to deal with some settings you
need to change or you might need to
change in your administration panel so
you do this by go down we're going down
to users your profile and here you got
this thing show toolbar when viewing
site after you update it it will be gone
in the front end and only be available
in the back end so you might want to do
this to really view your site the way
ever non logged in users would see it I
find this very handy okay so now we got
our basic skeleton and just to round
this video up let's at least at our
posts or show our posts in the skeleton
so just replace this by writing our
posts and then I want to show our posts
here and we do this by using the
WordPress loop which is just a way of
yeah outputting all our posts in a
document so we need PHP tags for that
so we add the word press loop by writing
wild have posts
the post and for a moment we just ended
with and well so if you are website now
nothing changes hmm so no posts are
displayed as of yet and that's because
WordPress doesn't automatically output
or output all the information has
regarding a post because that's not just
a post content that's also titled we
offer the category maybe some tags and
so on and so on so we are free to define
which information we want to output as
well as how we want to style it and for
that we got a much more granular control
than just writing okay the highest
output everything so we do this by
closing our PHP tags here and reopening
reopening them here oops and between the
beginning and the ending of our wire
statement we can now really output
information one so let's just add an
ad-free tag to the short form PHP tag
for out for echoing some information for
information out the title is the post
title as you might guess and the
paragraph in are you kidding okay so in
a paragraph handwritten because cloud9
actually wants to fool me we write the
content save it and go back to our
website right we got our post title and
our post content and well that might not
seem super mega awesome that's really a
cool thing we achieved here because
we're now dynamically outputting the
content we provide for our own website
and in the next video we will continue
by styling it a little bit adding a
first dummy navigation bar
and also show how we can differentiate
between index site which lists all posts
and a deetle site which will share one
complete post with its whole content
compared to just an excerpt or a shorter
version of its content so please leave
your feedback and tune in to the next
view as well
bye this is Max and I will see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
