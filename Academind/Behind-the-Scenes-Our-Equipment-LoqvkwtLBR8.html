screen right now you can see that
something is different I'm not sitting
in front of the green screen
I'm just sitting here in the middle of
the room actually and the reason for
that is that in this video I would like
to show you our equipment because so
much you guys wrote us that you want to
know more about that so we want to show
you which camera we use which microphone
and some more stuff and before we start
you can also find some links to their
equipment down there in the video
description but if you click onto that
these are not affiliate links so we
don't earn any money if you click onto
these we just want to make sure that if
you want to buy some of our equipment
but you can do that and with that let's
start right now
so let's start a little Home Shopping
Channel right here with the first thing
because in our videos you can see our
places well in the sea the places we
need a camera and for this purpose we
use this one
that's the Sony camcorder it's called
HDR DX 6 to 5 as I said you can find a
link to that little camera in the
description
the important thing is actually this we
don't use any fancy settings on that we
simply use 1080p and record in 50 frames
per second we render the video stand
later in 720p and 25 frames per second
audio we are experimenting with that and
we might also produce computers in 1080p
in the future but as I said we try to
find the right compromise between the
qualities and how good we can handle the
data and actually the file size the
camera is about to think about $500 for
example so not really cheap but
considering what it can do I think it's
good value for the money actually well
that's the camera but as you can imagine
VMs sitting like this and film ourselves
because in either end and for this
purpose you need two things the first
thing is we need a tripod and of course
Android prepared so I got this chair and
on this chair we can see this tripod
right now that's a common Alpha mm
another thing it's a release basic fiber
actually but totally sufficient for our
purposes and well you know the
subscribers but we have to mount the
camera on Chris and for the purpose you
have this mount rings like this comes
with the try so actually and the only
thing is to do is you have to well kind
of put that thing on to the camera like
that welcome then you can simply plug it
right here with like this yes and then
you need to serve on with the camera and
make sure that well the place is
correctly in the camera and with that
they actually has our of tapes now at
least at one step to it and actually the
audio because this camcorder has an
integrated microphone to be honest
quality is not the best one and if you
can hopefully here in the videos we have
a relatively good audio quality painting
in oil and
the reason for that is that you're not
using this audio but they're using an
external microphone and which one do we
use well we use this one
that's a roadie role processor again
check the description for the exact
details about that this is great things
as you can please come to this beautiful
back by the way really awesome and the
amazing thing is that well it's simply
work because in the beginning of the
channel and actually until two months
ago
Max and I we experiment sit around with
microphones and we found in the end that
this is actually the best microphone
that you can get for your money it's
about $200
so not really achieve but ever set is
really worth it because I think for you
guys it's really important that you
understand what we're saying
so a good microphone is important now
this microphone is nice but as you can
see right here we don't have anything to
adjust in it and that's an important
thing because to use the slide perform
you needs and other things you need a
mixer we also got something at that of
course and let me fetch that right here
that the mixer that we used
hope you can see it is a simple bearing
our low the expect I'm Phoenix 302 USB
mixer as you can see we are not really
into details about this technique to be
honest because the important thing for
us is that is basically work and that's
what it should do so we also didn't play
around lots of settings you can play
around with the game and the phones
maybe but that's the main thing with
this and if you use it on your own body
has to find the right settings for your
room or depending on the size of the
room you have to play around with that
but the only thing if you do is actually
you meet that mixer which you can plug
into your computer them and reset you're
almost done regarding these audio
problems de list that again I'm holding
a microphone and well that's not kind of
a set of views so we need another things
let me test it quickly back in business
but this time with my son again this is
a really basic mics and actually because
the only thing I have to do it well it
has to kind of hold the mic and to do
this you've got the mic and you've got
this little thing right here and then
you can simply adjust this like that
oops maybe put it down a little bit
hitting this this maybe whoops like that
and if you then slap your mixer so this
cable you get right here into the
microphone like that and then as a set
connect some mixer to the computer well
then you're ready to go there is one
important thing missing and that's the
green screen because as you see in the
videos we have our faces in our audio
but the main thing you see is with us
it's the screen we do on a computer and
for the purpose we need a green screen
behind us your ever white bowl but
normally I got the screen screen and I
will not build up the green screen right
now because to be honest it's quite big
and it takes a minute so this is the
greens can be used actually so check it
over here and as you can see it comes
with a lot of stuff yes the green screen
and all the stands that you need to
build up in your room and you also got
the labs which are really important
because you need to make sure that the
illumination of the green screen
is as well equal as possible in each
part of the green screen because
otherwise it becomes really hard to get
rid of the green screen later on in the
video editing so to talk about the
glands let me just show you how this can
look like and how they work so the mic
is gone but now we got this little thing
right here that's all included in that
green screen package data to show you
and we have set stand of course for the
land and we have that well thing to
mount the lamp in and students now to
choice whiskers so all we got things and
now we got these lamps so these are
really big lamp actually and you can pin
all the way to this thing like that you
can see that well not really good let me
maybe make this smaller I don't know
it's not really I hope you can see it so
here we go the lab it down a little bit
like that right so you think these plus
the lamb but that's what all they need
you also need something else and this
something else is this thing an umbrella
and no worries different to raining in
here but you need that because
just if you look at it it's the lack and
rely on the outside but inside it has a
reflecting thing right here and that
allows you to kind of reflect the life
and by that get the best illumination of
the crude elimination of the green
screen as I said before to make sure the
illumination of the green screen is kind
of equal in each spot of the green
screen now he has two different
umbrellas that come with the package the
black one and it's the white one like
that now what's the difference well as I
said the black one is black on the
outside and hazard with selecting things
on the inside this one is white inside
and outside so difference is that if you
use the right one just looking like this
we're not crashing a lot like here let
me so you could know it like that and
work hard to see is not a lot of space
in here like that so you would turn it
into your direction right so this is not
that close of course but basically
that's the idea behind it so you guys
are doing screen behind you then you've
got the length one or left one to the
right and well then you turn the light
on which is something I'm doing a few
seconds but before we do that I just
unmount that umbrella like that because
we don't use this white one because you
also play around with it and we found
out that from a lighting perspective at
least in our case this is like much
better and as I said if you set one then
you simply have to put it right here you
cannot see me right now so you use like
that and maybe an important thing that's
not the spot that normally record my
videos so don't worry we had a little
bit more space when we record the video
but that's at work as you can see I'm
now turning it around because it has to
reflect elimination well and as I want
to make sure to get some insights if
you'd enter an orbital life then it
looks like this and this is really well
white actually and now you can imagine
how this basicly works you have one to
the right one to left the green screen
behind you then the camera and the
microphone and that actually is let me
just switch that off because it's
beautiful but it's kind of not the
atmosphere people like to have all day
with that we are actually done with our
equipment to basically the hardware that
we need but there is one more thing that
need actually radio and this one more
thing is of course the software that we
use to record our screens because again
it's nice to hear oh it might be nice to
see us I don't know but the most
important thing is that you see what
we're doing on the screen and for the
Purple's we use both two different
software's on the Mac's we use
ScreenFlow ScreenFlow is not for free
you have to pay for it I think an annual
subscription is about 130 US dollars and
on the windows computer we use OBS it's
open broadcast software open broadcast
software and this also works quite nice
to be honest next and I we prefer
ScreenFlow and be more record on the Mac
but the Nell videos we know to protect
obvious all the work perfectly and that
it actually that's what we used for our
recordings and if you have any question
or something like that just hold them in
the comments and also we certainly like
this kind of performance if you want to
have more insights into the channel how
it work what we do and how we do it so
yes I hope you kind of enjoyed this
different video and sorry if it's not as
well structured as the lore videos
because it's kind of well a different
style of video but nevertheless I hope
you enjoyed it and well as always I can
only say thanks a lot for watching and
hope to see you in the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
