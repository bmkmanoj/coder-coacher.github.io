we're going to do something where I will
say straight at the beginning be careful
when doing it we're having a look at how
we can use jQuery in an angular 2
application now it is possible and there
are some use cases where you actually
need that or it might be that but be
aware that it kind of goes against
nature of using framework like angular 2
to then mess around with jQuery because
anyone who kind of is responsible for
rendering and manipulating the DOM and
if you're interfering with jQuery you
might get some unwanted results
nonetheless as I said there might be
some use cases where you actually need
shape wearing or where it really helps
you or more it's a little workaround and
it is fine to use jQuery and therefore I
once you show you how easy this use
jQuery in an angular 2 application but
again when using it be careful and think
about it if there isn't a number
possibility without jQuery so enough of
the warnings what are we going to do or
how are we going to do that actually
implementing jQuery in an angular 2
application is pretty pretty simple
first step is as you can see I get my
running empty boilerplate here first
step is to head over to what you Shea
query to the website and here I just
want to grab those links here not going
to download it right now
and my index.html file I'll copy them in
right above all the aberrant voice now
obviously
inserting them at the body or
downloading them first place would be
better but that's just how you integrate
right so not going to mess around with
all the important stuff here now what
I'm going to do is I will create a new
component which which is called
Woori component and in this file and is
newly created file well I will as always
create the class micro point which will
the call jQuery component and now to
actually make it a component I will add
my my decorator my component decorator
and as always make sure you got this
import of component from angular 2 core
it's automatically done for me in my IDE
and that what I want to do here is I'm
just select ER and it will just call it
my shake worried kind of using that my
prefix to make sure that I'm not
interfering with any other third party
packages or might exclude or anything
like that so that's a good behavior to
use a prefix and then um well I need a
template and this template all I want to
do is just to show how to use jQuery I
let a button when we clicked its button
I want to show an alert and now yes I'm
aware I could just do this with pure
angular 2 but it's just to show how to
use jQuery now there is one thing I have
to do to use jQuery in this file without
getting all kinds of compilation or
typescript errors and as I declare a
variable up here called jQuery type 1
and what this does is it no type water
type any excuse me what this does is it
basically tells typescript
hey I'm using this shake where you are
and even though it's not initialized in
this file it is existing that's kind of
the translation of it and now what I can
do in my in my class I will inject a
reference to to my Dom so to say
in this template here I can do this in a
chip in a in an angular 2 component by
just binding it to this private property
here and I'm injecting a reference to
this element so to this component in the
Dom to HTML code it's able to say by
using element ref here in my constructor
this will give me such a reference and
now I can for example in the on in it
lifecycle hook which I'm implementing
here or an implementing their interface
and then the respective method ng on in
it and in this method what I will do is
I'll use my T Shea query
umm.yeah variable kind of a grid here so
that's like the dollar sign you can
think of of it like this so if you're
used to using the dollar sign then you
would specify here your selector like an
element which has a ID now in this case
what we're going to do is we're going to
select our element reference and they're
the native element which stands behind
it so to say so this expression here
will give us our component in the HTML
code so an HTML element so to say and
then I just want to find my button here
and attach a click event to it where I
open alert box where I say it works yay
okay let's see this in action
oh let's see it in action when I
actually implemented here so here on I'm
batting my my jQuery component I just
created add of course I'm also adding it
here to the directives array jQuery
oops jQuery Poland also make sure you
got that import now I get this button
and if I click it I get it works okay so
that's how easy it is to use jQuery in
an angular application I'm not
to repeat all the warnings said at the
beginning just be careful or think about
it when you use it and if you're
deciding you need check very well this
is how you can interact with it in an
English replication I hope this video
was helpful if you liked it
obviously please follow me on Facebook
or Twitter subscribe to this channel or
since today also if you want to go
deeper into angular 2 deeper than it is
possible for me in this channel here be
