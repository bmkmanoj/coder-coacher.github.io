video in this video we will take a look
at the preview features in power bi
desktop
this means features you can already use
but which are not final yet so I will
show you where you can find this preview
features and how you can activate them
and additionally we will take a look at
one specific preview feature in a little
example and throughout this example I
will also show you how you can sort your
weekdays correctly in power bi desktop
and this is it actually so let's start
now
so before we can really start with that
preview feature we should make sure that
we had installed the latest version of
power bi desktop so if you open power bi
desktop and find the following message
in the right lower part of the screen so
updates available well then you should
click that first then you arrive right
here this is the official Microsoft
power bi block and by the way a really
great page because right here you can
make sure that you're always up to date
regarding the latest features of power
bi so if you want to take a closer look
at that so you can scroll down right
here and check out the different
articles for the different months for
example but for the moment we only want
to make sure that we install the latest
version of power bi desktop so to do
this we can scroll up again and click
right here now if you do this and follow
the installation guides and then update
power of your desktop well then you can
reopen power of your desktop after this
then you will arrive right here in an
empty power bi desktop project now where
can we find these preview features now
in here well that's quite easy because
you simply have to go to file up here
now go to options and settings right
there so you don't have to click it just
move the mouse right here and then
select the options right there and if
you look at the global options now and
go down to preview features here well
then you can see that you have a lot of
different preview features that you can
activate in power of your desktop of
course the type of preview features
available changes throughout the months
for example these are the preview
features available in June 2017 however
in this video I want to show you one
specific preview function and this is
the one I already activated right here
the new table at metrics visual function
so the only thing is right here is if
it's not ticked on ticket right now pick
this right here like that
and press ok like this now you might
have to restart power of your desktop as
I said in my case it's already activated
and if you just activated it right now
just restart power of your desktop one
more time and as soon as we are right
here we can now finally start well and
to start we need some data right this is
true so let's quickly find some data
that we can use to take a look at this
preview function and for this example we
will just use some New York City Taxi
data you can find the data right here
and the link is of course also provided
down there in the video description
however if you scroll down right here
then you can see different trip sheet
data in CSV format for this example I
simply downloaded the yellow cab right
here for January 2014 so make sure to
download this file right now it's quite
big it's about 2 gigabytes of things so
it might take a few seconds but as soon
as you downloaded that file you can go
back to power of your desktop and then
simply go to get data right here and
select text CSV by double clicking it
and now simply select the file that we
just downloaded as you can see yellow
trip data January 2014 so we click on to
open right here this
and this is fine actually but now we
don't want to load the data into the
data model we want to go to the query
editor first so to prepare the data so
this means to make sure that we only
load the data into the data model that
we really want to analyze so this means
you should press edit right here down
there and now we are in the query editor
and right here well we can see that the
first row is kind of well not correct so
let's quickly get rid of that right now
by simply going to the home ribbon right
here now go to remove rows right there
and now remove the top row if you click
right here and simply type one because
you only want to remove the first row
and press ok so now the rows are fine so
let's take a quick look at the columns
because if you scroll to the right right
here well you can see we have a lot of
columns and for a little preview example
right here I don't think we need all
that information that we can see right
here so let's go to the home ribbon
again and now present to choose columns
in the lower part and select choose
columns once again now we click right
here on to select all columns too well
unselect all columns first and now we
can specify which columns we want to
keep in our power bi desktop project so
this could be for example well I don't
know you pick update I may be the
passenger count and you tryptophans
may be the raid code and I don't know
the tip and the total amount I think
this is fine so this means we will only
keep these selected columns right here
so if you press ok right now this then
you can see that the amount of columns
reduced and this looks fine right now
actually
there is only one less thing that we
could take a quick look at right now so
if you go to the passenger count column
right here and press included arrow to
open the filter and then press load more
this might take a few seconds because
well it's kind of a big file data set
yes you can see that we have 0
passengers in here I don't think it
makes a lot of sense so maybe let's
unselect that to exclude that data from
our beta model in the
stab and press okay right here and then
let's maybe ought to take a look at the
trip distance right here yes and you can
see if we also have zero right here so
let's maybe also unselect this right now
so we did that
so we uncheck that box and press ok and
we won't take a closer look at the data
right now because it's not about the
data it's more about the preview feature
so let's press closing apply right now
right here to load that data now into
our data model so let's press that and
again this will take a few seconds
because as I said the file size is quite
big but it shouldn't take too long
actually and here we are now we now
loaded the data into our data model
right here we under report you so this
is the area where we will create our
table in a few minutes but before we do
that let's take a look at the underlying
data now in the data model so we can
simply click right here to open the data
view and right here the columns right
there are alright but the first column
is not because what I actually would
like to have as we only have data for
January I would like to have the
different weekdays in here and if you
look right here well we have a date and
a time but we cannot see the week there
right now and if you select that column
now and go to the modeling ribbon then
you can change the formatting so we can
change the data type by clicking right
here and change it to date for example
like this yeah we can see the weekday
this is fine but not only the weekday so
let's maybe see the format right here
like this and select daytime and again
yeah we have kind of what we want but
not the weekday only so we cannot select
it by a predefined function the great
thing is we can change the quickly in
power of your desktop by adding a new
column so let's unselect that by
clicking right here and now select well
new column as I just said right here and
now you can see this formula bar and if
we select the first part right here so
that column and name it week they may be
like that and
now we have to write a formula and this
formula is called formats like that and
now we press tab to complete the formula
now we need to write the square bracket
like this and now we can select the
different columns right here as you can
see I'm moving it with the keyboard and
the up and down arrow keys and we need
to pick up daytime so our first column
right here so we can press tab again and
now it's important to write a comma and
now specify the format that should be
retrieved
out of that information in that pickup
date and column and that format should
be well a quotation mark and for example
3 these like that and now write the
second quotation mark and if you now
press ENTER like this well then you can
see in that new column right here that
we now have the weekdays or the first
three letters of each weekday in that
new column so this is almost what we
want to have but there is one problem if
you would now create our table in the
report view then the weekdays would be
sorted alphabetically and actually I
don't want that I would like them to be
sorted like Monday Tuesday Wednesday and
so on and the good thing is that we can
also change the quickly in power bi
desktop to do this we simply have to add
another column by clicking new column
right here
now maybe name that weekday again but
this time week a number like this and
now simply write well weekday like that
press tab again again the square
brackets and again refer to the pickup
daytime so the first column right here
press tab now write another comma and
now we can specify how the weekday or
the week the number should be returned
this means here we would see that the
Sunday is still number one and Saturday
is number seven but I don't like that I
would like to have the second option
this means Monday is the first day and
so on Sunday is the seventh day this is
fine so we can press tab once again and
press ENTER and now we see that we have
a number for the corresponding weekday
so as we defined it Thursdays for
five and so on so now we got that week
the number column but actually we wanted
to sort the weekdays right so we want to
sort it from Monday Tuesday Wednesday
and so on well and if you now select the
weekdays for example like this well and
then go to the modeling ribbon right
there and then go to sort by column then
we can see that the weekday is selected
at the moment and this is not the way
the data should be sorted because it
should be sorted according to the
weekday number because then it would
start with one which would be Monday
continue with two Tuesday and so on so
if we change it now to week the number
here then this should work correctly so
we have to try that now
by going back to report view to finally
create our table so let's go to report
view right here and if we go to the
visualizations column right now well
then we see that we have the table
visual right here and the matrix visual
but we have the same symbols down there
yes because if we look at it you can see
that this is the table preview and this
is the metrics preview so these are the
preview functions that we just activated
so let's not select maybe the table
preview right here and maybe make it big
for you so I clicked right here sorry
okay well and now we can actually start
by dragging and dropping our weekday
here well and as you can see the weekday
is automatically sorted as we find it
you remember this is just due to the
fact that our weekdays are sorted
according to the week ten numbers that
we find so one two seven four one is
Monday Tuesday's two and so on so this
worked fine this means we can now
finally focus onto the functions of that
preview feature now we have the weekdays
right here but what else could we add
well maybe the passenger count so I
simply selected right here in the fields
column and drag it right there and we
could also add the total amount sort of
total money that was paid you can see
I'm simply dragging it again right here
now this is nice
but this doesn't look really good so we
need to a great our data well and we can
also do the easy
leave by simply going back to the
visualization column now click on to
this arrow next to the passenger count
right here and change it from don't
summarize to well the average maybe this
makes sense so we have the average
passenger count of each day so if you go
to average for you yeah it looks better
but still we also have to adjust the
total amount so let's also take them to
the arrow right there and now change
that
well not three average but to the sum
maybe so we can see how much money was
paid in total like this and now you see
that we have our new table created with
the different weekdays the average
passenger count and the total amount
paid on that days in January so this is
all fine actually but that's not the
preview feature that I want to show you
because the preview feature has the
great ability to kind of visualize that
in a better way what does this mean well
if you now go to the format area right
here so click into the symbol now scroll
down a little bit to open the
conditional formatting there let's go
down again so that you can see
everything well then you can see that if
you click right here you can select the
two different columns that we created so
the passenger count and the total amount
now let's select the passenger count
right here and now this data bars this
is the new preview feature that we
activated because if we click on two on
right here well then you can see that
the average passenger count is now
visualized by that bars right here
which is really great and if you're not
happy with the way the data is this cut
right here then you can simply change
that by going back to the format area
and going to the advanced controls and
as you can see you can now change the
name for example or only show the bar so
if click right here and press ok then
you see that the value is gone but I
think we want the value so we can go
back to the advanced controls and
unselect that then you can define the
minimum and the maximum the color of the
bar and the bar direction so you can
play around with that if you want you
but the great thing is actually that you
have that visual impact now of your
value so we can press ok right here
and now we can simply change that from
the average passenger right here to the
total amount there and if you know also
take the data bars from off to on like
that well then we can see that we have
the same visual or the same indication
by the bar chart for the total amount
and this is actually the preview feature
for the table visual but of course
that's not only available for the table
it's also available for a matrix so
let's also take a look at that quickly
so we can simply press back to report
and here and now unselect that visual we
created and now select the matrix right
there and we can position it right here
it's fine because we will press again
that maximized window right here to make
it bigger and now we can define what
should be displayed in the rows the
columns and the values before we only
had the values to remember in that table
visual however we can again use the week
they may be as the rows I think this is
fine like this you can see again the
sorting is correct and then we can use
for the columns maybe the I don't know
the rate code for example that select
that and then we can select maybe TTIP
as the value like that as you can see
you now create that metrics and we will
talk about the details of that metrics
now the only thing I want to show you is
that you can also add that great bars
that we just saw by going to the tip
amount right here pressing through the
arrow now go to conditional formatting
and now also select the data bars as we
just saw it in the format area so we
present to the data bars and we keep it
the way it is you know that menu already
and if you know press ok well then you
see that the data bars are also added to
our matrix right here and this is it
actually this is what I wanted to show
you so take a look at the official power
bi blog to learn more about the latest
features and about the latest preview
features that porgy offers
additionally I hope you saw that it's
quite easy to sort your weekdays
correctly in power bi desktop the way we
did it right here
and with that I can only say thanks for
watching and see you in the next videos
