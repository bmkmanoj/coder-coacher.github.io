angular 2 tutorial series in this part I
want to focus on something which I kind
of have touched in some of my previous
videos words especially in my what the
 or components data flow and so on
with you which is not actually a part of
this tutorial series and that is why I
wanted to get back to that topic in this
video inputs and outputs so ways to pass
data from one component to an hour
because it really is a core concept in
angular 2 and outputs is something we
haven't touched in this tutorial series
and we could also refer to that as cast
of events how we write custom events
which you can then trigger or fire in
our application and catch in some
component and pass data with those
command this events so I think that's
quite an important part of any angular 2
app because it's a part which will allow
us to let data flow up in the hierarchy
of components instead of only from top
to bottom so very important concept
let's get into it so I prepared a new
app here and by the way very important
the source code for this tutorial series
is now available on github you'll find a
link in the description below and there
I will have two branches at the moment
one for the app as we have built it
until now in all the past videos and now
for this video I created a new branch
because I don't really need my contact
list app which was at already getting a
bit cluttered with the HTTP and pipe
stuff so I wanted to start fresh and
don't have that messy first page where
we really focus on one part so therefore
at the moment two branches as I said one
for the past and one for this video
and I know I don't have my github repo
moment in a state where I would have the
source code for each video in the state
it was in this video but it's more the
latest source code but still you should
be able to follow my thoughts a little
bit clearer there may be if there are
some issues or some topics you're not
sure and you should also be able to read
the code in case you had problems with
that in the videos even though I'm now
always taking care about the font size
or at least try
so here brand new application where I
got a parent component and a child
component nested inside it and now let's
think how can we pass data which we
enter here in a parent component here to
our child component well this actually
is very easy and something we already
did a lot so I'll not talk too much
about that
we'll use input in our child which will
allow us to use property binding on our
child component here in our app
component to pass in a value to our
child so let's do that I'll first go to
my child component here and I will
create AB new property here which I will
just call parent value and this parent
value will be a string then I will
create a input here or I use the inputs
metadata which takes an array to specify
that parent value will be a input which
can be bound to this child component and
as always set this value has to match
this value and that then has to match
the value I use here my app component
where I use square brackets
parent value so the same name as in my
child component and I pass whatever
value I want to pass so in this case
whatever I entered into my input field
here so let me just assign a local
variable here
parent input and then I can pass
parent input value and now to actually
update the UI so that angular 2 updates
DUI I will have to bind a kind of a
dummy event to my input field here
whereas I out every key up yeah
basically do nothing that is why I set
the action to two mal to zero if it
doesn't do anything on key up but it
triggers a and UI update so that's
working and now let me go back to my
child component here and here I just
want to use string interpolation to
output parent
oops parent value now let's try if this
works yeah seems seems to work pretty
fine here good now actually I don't need
to click Me button here at all in in my
parent component at least so let me get
rid of this so this is how we bind it to
our to our child component now I want to
have the same thing here that right if I
enter something here it would be great
if this would then update it here in my
parent component so let me go to my
child component get rid of the button to
don't need it
and then I want to find a way yeah to
basically have the same behavior I have
from parent to child up from child to
parent right now I can't use input if I
try to specify inputs here on my parent
component and say like child value and
then I have here my property called
child child value which would also be a
string and then I have my string
interpolation here child
well you okay so then I get my input 0
this should be a string by the way so I
got this set up and in my child
component I would have like here my
input field a local variable
loud input and also on key up do nothing
um yeah how do we now pass it because my
app component I was able to use property
binding square brackets to access my
pass it to my child component but now I
don't have the possibility because well
I don't have my parent component here I
can't bind to it right so we will have
to find another way and what we will use
is output and output because from parent
to child we can use it input we pass
something into our child and now we want
to get something back from our child or
parent and that's why that's why we use
an output we're getting something out of
our child that's the way to think about
it putting something in getting
something out so we need an output now
let me get rid of this input here my
parent component we're not doing
anything there and my child component
I'll created outputs or at the outputs
metadata which is also an array where I
will have yell outside I call this well
this will be an event kind of put that
way this will fire and then I want to
catch it in my parent component so we'll
just set it to the name child changed so
events styled name um this will be a
custom event will create here and an
event we will have to fire by ourselves
and therefore we use the event emitter
so we have to import it from our angular
2 core package here too and now I can
create a property child changed which is
a new event emitter and this event will
pass a string therefore this is a
generic type I will set you type string
and what I can do now is when this
changes here on key
I'm not executing a dummy function or
I'm not setting the to zero instead I'll
execute on change method which it will
create here my child on change and here
I will get the current let's say the
value of my input passed into it so I'll
pass my child input value into this
method and here I can do it's very easy
I'll execute or l access my child change
properties on my custom event and I call
the emit function on it emit is a
function defined in my event emitter and
this will basically fire the event and I
can pass whatever value I want to pass
in this case just the value of my input
field so this fires the event ad in my
app component I can now go to my child
kamon where I'm currently binding my
parent input and I will catch this event
by using parentheses like we always do
when we're using events just that key up
is a bolt and it went and now we're
catching our child changed you end which
hasn't built in but defined by ourselves
and now what I want to do if a child
changed is catched where it's fired in
my child and I'll catch here in my
parent well I wanna execute a function
and I can't just do the following
I can't just set child value equals
event dollar sign event that's very
important don't forget the dollar sign
that is the the argument angular two
will use two to store the data we're
passing through our custom we went so
this name is not something we can we can
change or we can choose here it's just
given the value we enter here when we
omit every event this value will always
be accessible through dollar sign event
don't forget this so dollar sign events
too
the value we enter into our input field
and then we just set it to child value
which is the property we defined here
they're really really simple in the end
now let's try this
I again enter something in my parent
component this works we saw that before
and now I will enter something in my
child component and as you can see this
work too and this is all the magic that
is to it
this is how we can pass data from the
parent child back from the child
prepared and more importantly work
equally importantly this is how we
define custom events and how we fire
them and now obviously custom events can
be used for much more than just
transferring some strings if we enter
something in a input field in our child
component we can use custom events to
yeah basically react on all kind of
things that might change and that we
want to catch in another component which
will be updated depending on the change
in another component right so maybe a
bit complicated but in the end just as I
said think of it like think of it like
this custom events are outputs our way
to get something out of a component so
something is emitted by the component
and inputs are something to to transfer
it into the component that is the cord
it is to it and now one more thing I
want to show you my child component I
got this parent value and I got this
child changed here now if we say ok
parent value is the name of the property
we want to use in our child component
but maybe it doesn't feel right to use
parent value here because we aren't
apparent maybe once you call this like
let's say just just the pass value or
any other name doesn't really matter so
let's call it pass passed value don't
know if that's better but just for the
sake of exercise we want to use passed
value here but we want to keep parent
value here very easy to do
which just use a colon here and we
specify the Elias which is used for our
input so if you save this and test it
again it still works even though we're
using past value here instead of parent
value and this is because I'm setting up
an elias with my colon here which says
okay it is the property parent value in
this component but it is accessed
through my elias past value in our
components now obviously the same would
be possible for output you could specify
an LS the same way here another way to
specify an output would by de we be that
don't use the outputs metadata here just
use at output here but in this case i
don't know : but parentheses in this
case you will have to to import it so
you will have to import output from
angular 2 core and now it still works
it still works but now we get an output
here so whatever way you spell you you
prefer this way I guess you pretty fast
see which property is bound to 2 into an
output or which property is an input or
an event using it this way you don't
have to use all that metadata here or
those decorators here so it's really up
to you both ways work currently I don't
know of any best practice that is out
there so you're free to use whatever we
like see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
