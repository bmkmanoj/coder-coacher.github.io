were building a RESTful API with node.js
we added so many features now want to
add a number crucial one uploading files
to be precise uploading images here and
of course I will show you the server
side of it how can we accept and store
files that is what I want to do in this
video so let's start with it
so let's implement file uploading and
let's say we want to do this for
products so in the product routes here
for posting a new product it might make
sense to be able to accept an image a
product image which would then store on
our server and when we then also store
an entry in the database with the
location of that stored image so that we
can send it back with a get request so
we like when we get all products so that
we have that data on the client
available to so the first step is to
accept images here in this post route
and now there are two different
approaches you could take here the first
approach is that you build an additional
end point where you accept binary data
only so where you don't try to get
request body because request body has
views it here won't be available because
the binary body will not be parsed by
our body parser package since that only
parses URL encoded or JSON bodies
instead we could read out the raw
request body and you will find a link in
the video description where you can see
this approach in action and how you
would parse that incoming data one
problem we have with that approaches
that we also somehow need to find out to
which product this file belongs and
certainly there are ways to pass that
information along with the file itself
but an easier approach is to change the
way this post route here works right now
we're getting request body here which is
coming from our body parser plugin which
parses the incoming JSON body now if we
accept a different kind of body namely
form data to be precise multi-part form
data then this changes then we can use
this form data object javascript offers
us or you automatically get when you
submit a form to submit both fields
where we have data like names or email
addresses and files where we have well
the file and this is the approach I want
to use here
now to be able to read such incoming
requests which hold form data data which
is just a different content type
I need a separate package so I will
install it with NPM install - - safe and
the name of the packages Malter now
Malter is simply a package that
Lightbody parser is able to parse
incoming bodies but here we're talking
about form data bodies so it's
essentially an alternative to body
parser for well bodies that can't be
handled by body parses which is the case
for foreign data their author I'll
restart my server and now we can start
implementing Malter you can find
detailed instructions about how to use
Malter in the video description it's
actually not a difficult though in the
products JS file - where i want to get a
file I will create a new constant which
whole name Malter where require well
Malter so the package we just installed
there after all create a new constant
upload where I execute Malter like this
this will basically initialize it and we
can pass a configuration to Malter here
and I will do so I will pass a
configuration which is destination
uploads for example now this specifies a
folder where Malter will try to store
all incoming files this folder of course
isn't publicly accessible by default so
we'll probably have to turn it to a
static folder so what we can do is we
can go to our app J's where we
initialize our whole app or Express app
and set this folder up to be statically
accessible we'll do this in a second
step though for now let's stick to
implementing the upload functional here
and see if that works as it should so we
initialized Malter and we're saying hey
store all files in this place now we
want to use it on this post route here
how do we do that you actually can pass
an argument prior to the function where
we handle the incoming request
you can pass as many handlers as you
want here and each handler is just a
middleware that is executed before the
next one runs and turns out that this
upload object we created by initializing
Malter here gives us a couple of
middlewares we can put in front of our
main handler whoops we are here so here
we can execute upload and then there are
a couple of methods for us single as
interesting single means that here we
will get one file only so it will only
try to parse one file and by just
passing upload single here in front of
this handler it will parse that file you
here also need to specify the name of
the field that will hold the file I'll
name it product image here like this now
whether we should be able to use that
file in here and let's start simply by
simply outputting it so console.log and
now you can access request file this is
a new object that will be available to
you due to this middleware being
executed first now let's save this and
I'm getting an error we get a permission
problem here with the uploads folder the
reason for this is a typo here where I
set up the destination uploads the
leading slash turns this into an
absolute path so now it would try to
create this in my root node marshals
folder which I of course don't want
so let's now restart NPM start and now
it's working so turn isn't a relative
path by not specifying a little leading
slash here with that let's simply try it
out let's post a new product here let's
go to body and now this will fail I can
already prepare you for dead because
will now also still try to parse our
JSON data which won't be available but
still let's see if we at least get that
image up there so I will switch that to
form data here the body of the post
request and now we basically ignore the
body down there the JSON body we just
add key value pairs here so what we can
try
is that we will also pass name and price
maybe request body still works because
multi handles this let's see so we will
have name and we will have a price key
here the price could be $12.99 and the
name could be Harry Potter five and then
we have an additional key which is of
type file here which should be name
product image because that's what we're
trying to extract here and now I can
choose a file
no I prepared a fitting file here for
Christmas let's open that and now let's
try sending this and now I get an
unexpected token in JSON position zero
now it makes sense because in the
headers I said they can't type to
application JSON so let's remove that
here and let's try sending this again
now we get message not found the reason
for this is because it should be slash
products here a little mistake on my
site so let's try again and now I
created a product successfully so no
failure and we also get a uploads folder
with a file in there with some cryptic
file name which if you were to open it
in your Explorer or finder will actually
be the image you store it the file name
and file extension is missing but we'll
take care about this later but the file
is getting stored and that's pretty huge
you also saw that unlike expected it
didn't crash because that's the second
thing Malter does it doesn't just give
you request file it also gives you
request body and since we passed name
and price with the request this works
and if you're wondering why we didn't
have to set the header well this is set
automatically here when we choose form
data as a body then the header sent was
actually the right one to be parsed by
Malter you also see that we locked
information about the file here on the
back end YouTube this line here and
there you see it got the field name it
also found the filename the encoding the
mime type and where it stored it the
file name it created here and therefore
the path where it uploaded it here and
that of course is all pretty great now
let's use that knowledge here that we
have all the information in the file to
change the way it is stored right now
we're storing this cryptic name here in
uploads we can also change the
configuration up here when we initialize
Malter though we can be more detailed
here and to find how we want to store
that file we can also make sure that we
only store certain types of files so
let's implement both let me first
implement
storage strategy for that I'll add a new
constant which will name storage and
there I will use the Malter package and
there the disk storage function you can
pass a JavaScript object to it to
configure it and this basically allows
you to adjust how files get stored
it's a therefore more detailed way of
storing files than just setting up tests
there you have to provide two properties
a destination property which is a
function that defines where the incoming
file should be stored and you get access
to the full request in this function to
the file at your callback so all of that
is passed into the function
automatically by Malter and we also have
a file named function here which defines
how the file well should be named you
get a request to file in a callback here
to Malter will execute these functions
whenever a new file is received in the
destination you execute the callback in
the end and queue it you pass a
potential error here now because we got
none and then the path where you want to
store the file and this could be a
relative path where we just again use
uploads so the file we already specified
before now in the file name function
define how the file should be named and
there you could choose file dot file
name we saw in the lock that this
property is available or you choose the
original name of you want if you want to
keep this you could also do something
like get new date to ISO string to get
the current date and ISO string for and
concatenate this with the original name
something like that or read general name
whoops all lowercase well let's see if
that works as expected we now have to
pass this to Malter here so now in this
object we passed Malter we set storage
to our storage constant which holds our
own strategy then we save this and then
let's send the same request a
again maybe with Harry Potter 6 so that
we can see a difference if we do send
this let's have a look at the uploads
folder now we see we got the file named
with the date and thereafter also with
your original file name and we can see
the image here because it has the right
extension now at you let me delete the
other file there for so this is how we
can find you Malter when it comes to
this now you might also be interested in
filtering out certain files for one you
can set some limits to for example not
accept files that are bigger than a
certain size you do this by passing the
limits property to that configuration
object you pass to Malter and there you
can set file size whoops that first of
all takes another object and then in
that object you can set file size cue a
number in bytes so you could choose 1024
x 1024 so now you would have one
megabyte here may be times five to only
accept files up to five megabytes now
that is one additional check you can
implement but maybe you need a more
precise filter to accept only certain
mime types for that you can also set up
your own filter so I'll create a new
constant which I'll name file filter now
that is a function where you get a
request to file an a callback here I'll
write it as a arrow function you could
use it as a normal function with the
function keyword two and in there you
can either reject or accept an incoming
file you reject a file by passing
callback null false this will simply
ignore the file will not store it you
accept that by executing callback null
true this will store the file or you can
also throw an error so if you don't set
null it will return with an error
ignoring it or not saving it with false
does not throw an error it just doesn't
save the file now what you can do is you
can access some file information here to
filter out certain files you don't want
for example we can add a if check here
where we say if file and then there is a
mime type property automatically
populated by Malter you could see this
in the log earlier
your mime type so if all mine type is
image / JPEG or if the file mime type is
image / PNG then let's say you want to
store it so then you'll take that
callback where you pass true as the
second argument this will store the file
else so for all other incoming mime
types like zip files but all the gifts
and so on
you could execute callback false to not
save it now with that let's see that in
action and to see it we have to pass it
to our mulcher options so here where we
have storage in limits I'll now add an
additional property so we have storage
we have limits here let's now add
additional property which is filefilter
and I'll set this equal to file filter
to my constant now if I save this and I
sent this request again I get a success
message and it does store the file
because I accept JPEG files and that's
what I'm sending if I temporarily remove
that though and save everything now if
you're safe to say I sent the same
request it succeeds here but the file
isn't stored it's right that it succeeds
because I don't throw an error I could
do this here I could return a new error
here with some message so I could do
that and not hear about any second
second callback so down there but I
actually don't want to do that I just
want to not store the file let's say and
of course the exact behavior is up to
you now I'll riad image here image JPEG
as a valid form I'm type and now sending
this again will also store it again so
this is now storing the files correctly
now what about getting the files now we
store the files on our back end here
that's nice but we also want to store an
entry in the database so that when we
get a list of all the files we actually
can can see them there so we can access
them for that let's work on our model on
the product model besides name and price
we also need a product image field or
something like that the type will just
be a string because it's just a URL and
you might also set required to true
that's up to you if you want to make an
image required or not so if I save this
and I go back to products when we store
a product in the post route we now also
need to set up this product image
property now so this one which should
hold a URL to the image now how do we
get that image URL well we can get it
from alter
if we have a look at our console and we
scroll up to the point of time when we
locked everything you see we had a path
property here and that is what we're
interested in so what I will send here
or what I what I a store here is
actually my path so file path and with
that oh this should be request file here
so request file will be default huff so
with that we're getting that we're
storing that information now when we
retrieve files here for example when we
get all files we just retrieved the name
the price and the ID now we should also
add product image here to make sure we
get this - and the same for the route
where we get a single product here we
also should retrieve that from the
database now we're not done yet though
just adding this here doesn't do the
trick here for a single product we do
output this here so that is okay but for
all the products selecting all the
fields is one step but then here we
return our own object anyways so there
we should also return a product image
which should be dark product image now
if we save this and we send another post
request to products with our file the
file gets stored if we now get all
products we will see that if we scroll
through the list of products here we get
some with a product image because I
tested this between cuts a little bit
now if I pick for example the last one
here and I copy that product image and I
go to the browser and add that path
after localhost 3000 I'm getting an
error and not found error so this isn't
found this route isn't found and it
makes sense because there is no such
route in our project we got route for
posting and get it getting our products
but we have no route to handle requests
at a slash uploads URL and by default
that folder isn't publicly accessible
either so this all doesn't work now
there are two possible approaches you
can take here
you can either implement a route for
example here in the products routing
file where you parse all requests coming
to slash uploads and where you then look
up the image file name and see if you
got such an image and return it manually
or you make the uploads folder publicly
available that's what I'll do and I'll
do does an app j/s for this I'll add a
new Miller where you're right at the
start and it's a middleware shipping
with Express the static function ears to
what I'm looking for it makes a folder
statically so publicly available here I
can pass uploads and this will make the
uploads folder available to everyone if
we now save this and therefore the
server restarts and i refresh this page
still doesn't work the reason for this
is that if i make it available publicly
i actually have to remove the route so
the folder name and just access the file
name and then it does work as you can
see now would be better if we also have
to folder name still that is why I will
use the different syntax of app use I'll
pass slash uploads at the beginning to
parse only requests at targeted at slash
uploads and then apply this middleware
and this will then ignore this part we
parsed so now with that change I can
reload this page and also see the image
and the URL stitches still is uploads
and then the filename so this is how we
can now also get our false a huge
advancement of course because now we can
store files and get the information
where they are stored and access them
now feel free to pull up on that and
find you this to your needs and with
that let's move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
