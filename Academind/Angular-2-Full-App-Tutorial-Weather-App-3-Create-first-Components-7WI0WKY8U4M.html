something new here by adding some dummy
data or some dummy entries which we
output as a list of well lever data like
you saw in the completed app at the
beginning now for this to to happen for
this to to show something we first need
to create a couple of components or two
components to be precise we need our
list component which holds your world
list of Webber items and of course each
Webber item is a separate component so
we have this Webber item component to
store all this I will create a new
folder in my dev folder which I call
bevor and that's a good practice to
separate parts of your application by
their function so we're not having a
folder components interfaces and
whatever but we're having all these
parts in a single folder and
restructured if necessary there but in a
single folder which is named by a
function which was grouped by the
function so here a weber folder and the
first thing i want to do here is i'll
create a new file which will be called
weber item dot component dot TS and this
file will hold my webber item component
the file naming convention here is to
first have well
the name of our component or whatever
we're holding in this file and that a
dot and then what did what type of class
or what what we actually have in this
file in this case a component so that
we're going to transform this class into
a component with the component metadata
and we're indicating that this file will
hold a component by naming it webber
item dot component dot well TS is just
the extension for typescript so this is
my webber item component file and i will
create a new class by and writing export
class whether
item component and this syntax here is
well a class is just a keyword type
script to create in your class and
export makes it available outside of
this file and of course we need this
functionality because we don't only want
to use this component in this file but
we want to use it in other files and
we're writing export we're making this
component or this class available
outside of this file to you then I will
add my metadata and I do this by writing
app compat component then parentheses
and then curly braces now I could also
import this here in my IDE webstorm by
the way but I will for now do it
manually so that you can follow along
nicely I will import component in curly
braces does the name of the module I'm
going to import from angular 2 slash
core this is the import I need to be
able to use this add component metadata
because this metadata is defined in our
angular 2 package then the first thing
I'm going to set up here is my selector
and I'm going to call this weather item
now you should make sure to choose a
selector which is not only unique within
your app but probably unique with it
well the world so that it doesn't
interfere with a default HTML tag of
course and that admirer doesn't
interfere with any possible third party
package you might add to your
application in the future so that it is
really unique therefore a great way to
ensure this is - well prefix it with my
for example in this case I'm not going
to because well Weber item should be
fairly unique I'm not including any
third party packages should so this
should be fine the next thing I set up
here or the next thing I configure in
this metadata is the template so the
HTML code which will actually get
rendered to the screen notice that I use
double back takes
here to be able to write a string over
multiple lines this is a es6 feature but
it's also available in typescript and
will be compiled to run fine in what
older browsers or in current browsers -
inside this template well I will output
my component by Matt Weber item and this
should be well an article article
default HTML element and inside this
article I will have two columns and I
already created the styles here and of
course you will find these styles and
the github repository - basically I do
have two columns as a sad I set them up
like this and it's currently is just a
little bug here in webstorm that I have
to re indent this manually and in the
first column I will have the well the
city name and then I want to have you
know a paragraph where I kind of have
like the weber like let's say cloud this
will get a CSS class of info and I'm
writing normal HTML code here so if
you're coming from react for example
does this not chase acts I don't have to
write class name here this is really
normal HTML code next thing is here in
my second column I want to be to the
right of my weather items will be the
temperature and here I want to have a
span which well say is like 39 degrees
Celsius or 32 maybe and I should also
get a class which will call temperature
and as I said I already defined these
CSS classes and the appropriate styling
in my s CSS files here for now this is
everything all do here this is my lover
item next I will create a new component
my list
I will call this Weber list component TS
and oops you seem in a bit and I will
again export my class which will called
will be called Weber list component
again I will add the component metadata
this time I will use my auto import here
as you can see my import was added at
the top by Web Store and I will use or
will add a selector here too which will
be called Weber list and of course also
a template every component needs a
template because components are there to
display stuff here I will have a section
again we indent this this section will
also get a class Weber List which I
already defined and here I will use my
Weber item component inside the section
and now we're almost ready but this
won't work because now I let you would
well see this tag here and yes we have
define it as selector here but it by
default doesn't scan all our components
if it finds a selector which matches
this but we have to tell it which
directives and components are directives
remember it is they are just directives
with a view so if we use any directives
in this template we have to define here
to tell I got you hey we are using some
directives in this code be aware of that
and then scan these directives which we
specify for their selectors and
transform this code appropriately so
here we'll add a new metadata
configuration directives which is an
array and here I just specify the types
of directives I'm using so here
whoever item component which is just a
name of this class whether litem
component I'm just using this not as a
string just as a type and also I have to
add import at the top where I import my
Weber item component module which I
exported here from well my Weber item
component file without the file
extension so just wherever item
component and it's in the same directory
as this file therefore I have dot slash
to indicate well that it is in the same
directory now in let you is able to find
the swimmer item and render the template
when you find here if we have a look at
our application we don't see anything
though because well we're not loading it
here my app component I still only have
my header here of course I want to have
my it's my Weber list and I will again
add this to my directives area here
where we're list component again also at
the import and now if I save this you
can see we get this working now what you
also see is that the styling is not
really applied here this is because I
style my Weber item in this Weber item a
CSS file but in my index.html file
I've only importing my app CSS or a stay
compile to just the same files my AB CSS
a CSS file here so well sidebar is not
imported anywhere and the Weber item is
not imported anymore well sidebar is
needed as of now but Weber item holds
the styling I want to apply to my work
item here therefore I will add import
here by adding a new metadata which is
called style not styles style you are
else this takes an array of strings and
here we just set up all the URLs leading
to style sheets which should which hole
styles which should be applied to this
code to this component and that's
important the styling by default in
English you will only be applied to this
component so if we style articles and we
have our article tags and other
components they won't take the styles we
set up here because again these Styles
only apply to elements or to code inside
template of this item of this component
so here I have to provide a path to my
CSS file which will be weather item CSS
source SCS source CSS wherever item CSS
you can see this here source CSS Weber
item CSS so now if I save this and it
reloads you can see that now we get to
styling you want the last thing I'm
missing here is a CSS class here which
is called Weber element which now
finishes the styling so this is how we
create our custom components how we make
them how we nest them in each other make
them work together in this way and how
we add some styling to them now in the
next video we will have a look at how we
can output multiple such Weber items see
you there
