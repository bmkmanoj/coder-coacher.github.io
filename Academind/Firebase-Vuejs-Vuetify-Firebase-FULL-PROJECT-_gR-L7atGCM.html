functional he's already to this
application and it's really taking shape
now there's one thing missing we created
at the beginning but we never used it
then to sign up and sign-in pages now to
continue with this project we definitely
need users and for that we definitely
need firebase so time to dive into
firebase now for that I'll visit
firebase google.com this is simply where
you can well create a new fire rates
project and for that you'll need a
Google account so make sure to create
one if you want to follow along actively
and build your own project now I already
do have one year so I can now go to my
console to the firebase console where I
can manage all my firebase projects now
I only have one project here but I'm not
going to use that one instead I'll
create a new project here add project
now you can give it any name here and
we'll free to choose what you want I'll
simply name it
YouTube dad Meetup and then you can
choose a region and here I simply choose
Germany because that's where I live that
the region you would choose here does
not decide and you can read it here it
does not determine where your data will
be stored right so that is a different
thing so this is Regis um the region
where you or your company sits well with
that set up you can click create project
to create this new firebase project
which I want to use it'll take a couple
of seconds once it's finished it'll take
you to the firebase console which is
where you can manage the project now
this is no firebase course but I will
quickly walk you through the features
you see here before we then start
implementing authentication firebase in
general is a platform which offers you
loads of features you typically need in
back-end for mobile apps or single page
applications as we're building one year
so a single page web applications that
would be the features it offers you are
a database actually a real-time database
using WebSockets so that if you update
the database from let's say one users
device you also see that update on our
you
devices at least if that's an update
interesting to these devices and that is
very convenient obviously so you got a
database without you needing to
configure anything on the server and
that's generally the purpose of firebase
you get a back-end which is very easy to
use where you can focus on your core
business logic and where you don't have
to write all the code you typically have
to write when setting up your own server
side you don't have to configure your
database you don't have to write the
code for accessing it you don't have to
care about security here
that's all managed for you of course at
the price of giving up some freedom
regarding configuration you can't
configure everything here it is
configured and created for you but you
got a lot of features to work with and
that's why services like firebase are a
nice choice as a back-end for projects
if you want to focus on the front-end
now another nice thing is that you don't
have to worry about server capacity here
it just runs and if you check out the
pricing the features we're going to use
here are available for free as you can
see here at the bottom but if you click
on upgrade easy there are a couple of
models available now we're in the spark
model and the spark plan that's the free
one and you can see the full plan
details to see the quote as you actually
have they are sufficient for our project
here for a production project you
probably don't want to use that because
for example you can only have 100
connections to your database at a time
and that might quickly be exceeded so in
such cases you might either juice the
plain plan which cost $25 per month
where you have way more capacities or
the blaze plan where you only pay what
you need so if you got no traffic at all
you're paying very little to nothing but
it scales up infinitely that is again
that nice thing which was also true for
AWS lambda and so on but you only pay
for what you need at least in a place
plan here and that is an hour advantage
of firebase you not only don't have to
write any server-side code you also
don't have to manage your servers and
now our advantage so whichever features
decides database do we have we got off
education it's very easy to add user
authentication
pure f:v that through a social provider
like Facebook or Google or your own
authentication here with passwords and
email you get storage for storing files
and we will use that for storing the
images users upload in this application
hosting to host your application will
also use that in the end to ship our
application once we're done cloud
functions allows you to run any code
whenever a certain event triggers like
for example when the file was uploaded
this is great for example for creating
thumbnails of images which were uploaded
automatically and that's not something
I'm going to cover in this series but
likely something I'll cover in a future
standalone video and then you get a
couple of other services for testing
your application on different mobile
devices getting crash reporting on
mobile devices testing your performance
in general using analytics to see how
users interact with your application
sending push notifications especially
interesting for mobile apps of course or
progressive web apps and yeah couple of
other stuff we will focus on
authentication the database and storage
and hosting in this series which are the
core features from a business logic
perspective I'd say and what's that
enough talking about firebase let's set
up authentication now I will do this in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
