video is the starting point of a service
project serverless next already talked
about that right yes she did but she
talked about serverless solutions in the
area of web development in this project
we will take a look at a service service
AWS offers for big data topics so we
will take a look at Amazon Athena now
what is at FINA actually well Athena is
simply a service that allows you to
query data of your source files invited
access that information in it by simply
using some sequel now why is this
amazing well if you think about big
source files so this means file sizes
amounting to multiple gigabytes and you
want to access the data and as I said
get information out of it then you might
soon have problems if you use Excel or a
text editor but if you use Athena you
can do that really easy so we will take
a look at the sinner but if you never
worked with that or if you are not
really familiar with big data it might
not be totally clear for you at this
stage why we need that actually and
that's the reason why this project will
be split into four different parts the
first part is this video right now so
the project start so we talked about the
background of the project and in a few
minutes we will also take a look at two
different Big Data workflows in AWS and
by that understand why we need Athena or
why we might need a feeling actually and
after that we will take a look at Amazon
s3 in the next video now what is as free
now well as free is simply a cloud
storage AWS offers where you can load
your data too so we will take a look at
s3 learn how to create a bucket and a
folder for example and understand what
it is and also take a look at the
settings that you can make in s3 now and
why do we need is free actually well we
need as free because we can only use a
Phenom with files loaded into s3 and
this brings us to the next video
actually the third part of the project
will finally focus on to Athena and by
that this is going to be the core video
of this pro
of course so we will understand well
what Athena is and how it works
this means we will take a look at how to
create tables how to create databases
and how to use sequel to create data in
our source file after we finish that
what most important video actually there
is one last thing that I would like to
show you and this last thing is related
to quick side quick side is also
something we talked about on this
channel but this time I want to show you
how you can con a quick side to Athena
and by that visualize the data you cure
it in Athena and that's it actually
that's the project structure and that's
what you're going to do in the next
videos but I think now it's the time to
take a closer look at the Phenom and to
understand how it fits into a potential
AWS Big Data workflow so let's take a
look at that right now well each Big
Data workflow actually starts with this
with the creation of data of course now
this can be data in any kind of format
and any type of data so log data for
example the important thing is that
after this data is created you could
store this data in as free as I said as
three is this Amazon Cloud service we
will take a look at that in the next
video well you have to stay there now in
s3 but this is raw and untamed data so
it might be necessary to work on the
data well to clean them and to bring
them into different structure or format
to do this you could use another AWS
service the service is called Amazon EMR
elastic MapReduce you can find it right
here again the important thing is that
after you finish that processing and
cleaning of your data you can store them
again and what you use well you can even
use add three now you have that store
data in s3 but actually if you have
really big data from multiple sources
you might not want to store them right
here but you might want to load them
into a data warehouse right now and a
possible data warehouse in AWS is
redshift right here and with that you
not your basic workflow from the initial
source that that you rate up to the
clean data that is stored now in your
data warehouse and by that well ready to
be analyzed and for this analysis you
can use of course quick side as I said
we also talked about that already in
another video so this is the structure
process that you can use to work on your
data but what is you want to access your
raw data so data in this stage
immediately well then you won't use all
these steps because you only want to get
a quick insight into it actually well
then we can skip these steps and then we
need another tool because what you want
to do is we want to query data that we
stored in a tree again this could be
simple raw data well and as you probably
can imagine this is where Athena comes
into play so with Athena we can directly
access the data stored of the raw data
stored in as free and additionally we
can also visualize the data in quick
side and that's the focus of this
project this workflow I showed you right
here well and with that you now have a
basic overview of what you want to do in
this project and about what service you
want to take a look at and with that I
now want to start the project actually I
hope the same thing is true for you so
let's start in the next video by taking
a closer look at s3 hope to see you
there bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
