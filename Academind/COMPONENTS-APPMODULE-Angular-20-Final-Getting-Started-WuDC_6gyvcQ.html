you with this project created and with
our running application i roughly
explained what these folders view that
we create our app in the App subfolder
of the source folder and that many of
these files here our files we won't work
in now it's time to take a bit deeper
and learn what actually happens when we
visit the index.html file again the
important thing to know is even though
we don't see it here there are some
script imports in the running
application they just get added
automatically by web pack we can't see
this if we simply inspect our source
code here do you see that we got some
scripts in there we reference free
script imports inline styles and main
well the inline and style script tag
here basically bundles some polyfill
webpack styling related code code we
barely work on the interesting part for
us is the main bundle which holds our
application code and the angular 2 code
how does this bundle get created or what
does it actually do how is our
application starting well as you just
explained we do have two scripts in the
index.html file and then we recognize
this strange element in the index.html a
prude nowadays clearly is not a default
HTML element it's not a built-in one we
don't have that by default instead this
seems to have something to do with our
angle to application and deaths because
you build up your any allure to
applications with components this is a
topic or design idea you might know from
react chess where you're all to build
components you do the same an angular
tube though angular 2 is a bit of a more
all-in-one framework than react chess is
just as a side note but here we
reference such a component app root and
in our app folder well it looks like
this might be the component we're
looking for this app component we
structure our components in separate
files and it is a naming convention
to get the file which holds the
component a name of name of the
component dot component dot TS TS for
typescript so if we have a look at this
here we see that we have a typescript
class which again is yet all compiled to
JavaScript and to this class we get this
add component thing here now this thing
here is a decorator which behind the
scenes at hatch a some metadata to
disclose and this actually transforms
this class into something else so by
default it's just a normal class but
with this decorator to angular 2 it's
more than that it becomes a component
with a couple of extra features the
extra features I'm talking about are
configured in the object we passed to
this component decorator we specify a
selector and this selector app root is
exactly what we see here in the
index.html so here we specify how we can
use this component how we can add it to
our HTML code the interesting part here
is this selector here works like a CSS
selector which means as it is written
like this it selects any element which
looks like this but we're not limited to
this I could also add a hash tag and now
we would select any element let's say a
div which has an idea of a brute so just
like a CSS selector works you could also
use a dot to select by class name I'm
going to revert this since the
convention is to use this element style
here for components but I just want you
to realize that you could use any other
style here too so this is the selector
the next thing template URL is pretty
self-explanatory it points to the HTML
code we want to render when this
component is loaded so the template off
this component in the end to component
something to display on the page and we
can only display something if we got
some HTML code this code is held in this
app component HTML file to which this
template URL property points and here
again we see
what we're seeing on this page page one
tagged with some kind of dynamic data in
between I'll come back to this these
style URLs is the same but for styles
and here notice we also have an array
because we may reference multiple style
sheets the important thing to realize
here is by default these Styles will
only be applied to this component not
application white so if we style h1 tags
in this CSS file only the h1 tags in
this template will get stalled not at
any our templates well I'm going to
remove these style URLs here since I
don't want to apply any specific styles
and I'm also going to remove the app
component dots back to TS file since
this file is used for unit tests and I
won't cover that here ok so we get the
basics this is our component this is
what we see the question seems to be
answered we have a brute here we load
our angular 2 application we have a
prude here we load this component it's
not that simple
by default angle 2 doesn't scan all your
components for their selectors and then
whenever it finds a selector use it and
it's good that it doesn't do this
because this would really be a
performance hit in a bigger applications
instead we have to be explicit and tell
angular 2 hey which component should you
have a look at when this application
starts because what does starts mean it
means that of course as a shop before we
have this main bundle chairs file which
gets injected here but the thing which
actually gets executed first and that's
just something to keep in mind is to
code in this main dot ts file this is
the bootstrap code of an angular 2
application this is the code which gets
run first which actually starts our
Inglot to application which gets it to
run and here we get a couple of imports
including some polyfills which are
managed in this polyfills file but the
important part is the last line here
here we bootstrap a module which means
we start our angular 2 up
and we pass a module to it and we hadn't
look at this module yet but we will have
no second for now it's important to
understand this starts the application
and we started with an argument the
module we pass here with that let's have
a look at this module it's the last file
in our app folder app module ts Anglet
who uses modules to structure more
complex applications in simpler
applications like this one you may very
well only use one module this app module
but a more complex ones you might have
multiple modules now this module
basically tells engli to which parts
does my application have and with Parts
I mean which components which directives
which is another feature of angle to
which pipes yet another feature which
services which other modules might I use
that could be built in modules or if I
were to structure my app with multiple
modules my own modules so this is how
you structure your application and this
is why we load this file when we start
the application because we have to tell
and what you hey which parts does my
application actually have now here you
will realize in the module file here we
also get a class which has no content in
itself but which also has a decorator
here the ng module decorator the energy
module decorator also takes a javascript
object as an argument and here we
configure this root module again the
kind of description of our application
we have our declarations error here
which basically holds all directives
components and pipes our application
uses this is why we can see the app
component here it's the only component
or application has thus far but as soon
as we add our components we will also
register them here in the declarations
array the imports array imports our
modules not just said we're only going
to use one module but there are a couple
of built-in ones for example the browser
module is definitely needed it gives
some core functionality Zangla to offers
us four browser applications the forms
an HTTP module may be removed though as
you might imagine the forms module is
neither been working with forms HD and
the HTTP module is needed when working
with HTTP both will not be things I'll
cover here the providers array is empty
here we would and later on we will add
services we want to have in our
application what our services I'll come
back to that bootstrap is the last array
here and this is an important one it
specifies most of the time only one
component which actually gets loaded
first remember I told you Anglet uu does
not scan all components for their
selectors automatically now it does scan
the components we add to declarations
but it would still not find the selector
we use here in the index.html this is
the one part where we have to be
explicit and tell Anglet you hey please
when you start the application first
have a look at app component it's the
root component of our application and
this is important take away your angular
2 application will have a root component
which will then hold all other
components you may add as nested as you
want but you have this one single root
component which is added here to the
bootstrap array so that egg what you
knows okay this is my root component
I'll have a look at it
I find a selector it's the same selector
as here I load the component in this
place and this is how an angler to
application starts okay you're probably
now totally shocked what an F word for
this here this single output yep the
startup and the creation of angular 2
application really can be a daunting
task and really can be overwhelming but
these are the basics and I promise you
from now on if you get the basics set if
you understand how the application
starts how you manage your application
if that is set the rest will be very
easy to
all along and it allows us to create
very powerful applications in a very
simple way and I mean simple because the
setup is a bit more complex the rest is
indeed very simple so let's dive deeper
into creating new components and
actually editing our application in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
