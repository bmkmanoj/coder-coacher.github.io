video of the new serious style and
around in this video we're going to
create this layout you're seeing here or
specifically not this layout but this
navigation bar we can see here with this
little button here on the left
squit links in the middle and the login
and sign up button on the right and a
little extra twist for this navigation
bar is that if you scroll down it will
stick to the top and have this little
border at the bottom so nothing too
fancy but nonetheless neat little
exercise where you can learn a lot about
yeah
positioning different objects that were
interacting between them and general CSS
stuff and this at the end is what the
series is for so let's dive into it so I
got my plank of work space created here
and if you don't know plunker it's
basically online workspace where you can
develop HTML CSS JavaScript stuff and
have a live preview of your work there
are similar services like code pen I
think it's really neat because you don't
have to set up this whole workflow
workspace on your local machine and you
can share it easily so that's a really
great thing so let's start it first
thing I want to do is set up a basic
html5 skeleton in my index dot dot HTML
file and I do this by writing HTML
hitting control space and then I get
this little preview and if I hit enter
planker will provide me with a basic
skeleton so while that bitch has
replaced this title by navigation fun
needs a meta tag and delete a body tag
here and what we'll need for this
project is
jQuery for one part and we can add it
directly in plonker if you search for
jQuery and then here more let's take one
point eleven point three ad and we
should now have it added to did this
work now no it's down to edit okay so
now we go to jQuery added to our project
and we will need something else because
we got this hamburger icon here and this
comes from the phone awesome I can
collect and therefore we have to
implement for awesome so let me do this
by just going to their website photo
awesome and down I don't want to
download it get started here I need this
link go back to the plunker tab and add
it to the top and I will also add our
style of CSS and at the bottom of our
body I will add our script dot chess
okay so now we're ready to go and I will
start by creating the layout here in the
body tags and first things first I will
provide us with some dummy content so
basically a headline headline and a
paragraph with some lorem oops if some
text inside it and I will basically just
copy that
it beautify your code so that we have it
well organized nicely structured and if
we go to the preview here with the I
button live preview we see this dummy
content here right so above the dummy
content we will have our navigation and
set a header tag inside the navigation
we will have three sections so to say we
will have left section which will be
this button a right section which will
be comprised of these two buttons and
the middle we will have our Quick Links
so like the ad left div the right div
and in the middle we will have an
unordered list with the list items of
the links nested inside them and let's
create six of them here so I will just
quickly fill those out
okay so I got decide these items we need
a button here the oops not sex the sex
section button and here I will have a
span with the hamburger icon oops
didn't mean to do that classes every
five bars I guess yes this is correct
and here we will have two buttons the
login and to sign up button okay
so yeah this is our basic navigation
doesn't look at all like it does here
but this is next point in our agenda so
let's go into this style of CSS file
here and I will start with the body tag
and under just add some basic styling to
it or respectively removed standard
margin and padding it provides give it a
four family of Roboto
fallback of son serif and a font size of
16 pixels okay so looks a bit better I'd
say next
I want my forgot this here I want my
dummy content to live inside a main
container so copy off that oops
cut it and paste it inside my main
container here and here whoops let me
design this main container with a width
of 80% and the margin of all so that is
nicely centered like though so
and with this we can start working on
our navigation so let's give it a class
of top nav say over top nav we'll have
let's give it up a little bit of a
padding 16 pixel
let's give it margin of audit so that it
will be centered to give it a background
color white so that when later we attach
it to the to the top of our window when
we scroll it is above the text and
that's all planned with it we also
wanted to have with 50% like the content
has and we want text to a line in the
center because you want exactly just
that these links Quick Links will be
centered and that's also give it a line
height of 35 pixels so that in the end
everything will be nicely vertically
aligned so right now that doesn't look
at all the way we want so let's work on
this unordered list next so therefore we
have to remove telus style of our yeah
listen we want to display it inline
block we also want to remove the padding
and margin that it has by default we
also need to edit a list items now
because those should be inline block too
so that they line up looks a lot better
if you ask me both links could certainly
yeah get some styling I'd say so let's
work on that why like giving them some
different styles I want a dark gray
color I don't want the underlining I
also want them to change their color
when they're hovered over or active so
let's give them one color of light gray
looks good to me and I think yeah I
think this is good so we should work on
this buttons next for this and we'll
just give them on one hand
basic class of button I could also just
select the button tag itself but I'm
going to do it this way just as it's
more yeah generic I guess so your button
and this will be button section because
we need a different styling for this
button than we need for these and here
we will also provide a buck metal with
button user
button user okay that's one day these
styles so I will have a button style
here and we'll have a petting of eight
pixels we will have border-radius of
free pixels we will have I guess no
border
I'm we also want the form family to be
the same as the rest of the document and
the font size should also be the sexting
pixels we provided in the body and if we
hover over it we see that our cursor
doesn't change
so let's provide a pointer cursor here
okay now for the section button
I want background color to be inference
parent and I want it to
we have difficut differently if we hover
over it because then I wants the
background color to be this light grey
excellent and for the user button but
user I'll have a background color of
light gray oops
and I will have a hover effect of my
moves background color white and color
will be no dark gray and color will be
white so excellent that's what I want
now we need to line this up therefore we
have this left and does right class here
so let's work on this left class will
bus just be float:left and you probably
guess that the right class will be
float:right okay looks pretty good now
the only thing we're missing is the part
where this navigation will be attached
to our top of the window when we scroll
down and I will show you how this is
done in the next video so stay tuned and
leave your people feedback if you like
see you see you this is max</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
