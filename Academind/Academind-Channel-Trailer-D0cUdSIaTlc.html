learning becomes more and more complex
with there are more topics to grasp and
understand our mission is channel is to
make this a bit easier by breaking it
down into understandable pieces and
topics that are fun to learn for that we
provide the fear you have to understand
but then of course also the practical
examples which allow you to apply to
things in reality sometimes though it
can be hard to just follow along by
seeing slides or seeing us code and that
is why we put our face into the videos
we believe it's easier to understand and
to follow along if someone is
communicating directly with you and it's
also the way we enjoy creating our
videos the most and no worries your ears
are still alright it's not just one
person creating the content for you on
this channel we are two person so if
you're looking for content in the area
of development web development or data
science you will find videos for all
these topics right here and of course we
continuously add topics each month and
this is it
I'm LAN you and I met this is a camera
and you never videos why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
