great introduction into AWS so what AWS
is how you can create your account and a
lot more now I would like to take this
chance and show you one specific service
or tool of AWS and this tool is quick
side this is the business intelligence
or data analysis tool of AWS now if you
have an AWS account right now you can
simply go to this page right here and
press until sign up for free you would
then need to enter some information to
arrive at this page right here here can
simply select the standard edition of
quick side which is totally enough for
the purpose of this video and then you
can also see that you have the first
user well for free actually and that
this user also gets one gigabyte of spy
space spy system VD internal storage of
quick side which allows you to well save
your data to that now as always when
working with AWS if you want to dive
deeper and to play around more make sure
to take a look at the pricing again you
can find the quick set pricing options
or details right here now then you can
continue with your registration or with
the creation of your account and then
you arrive at this screen right here
this might look slightly different in
your case because you probably have some
sample data right here I deleted those
that's why they are not visible right
there but the important thing is that
right now we have our starting point and
we can begin with our little project
so we are in quick sight right now and
what do we see right here well as I said
not a lot in my case in your case
probably some sample files so you can
take a look at them if you want to but
in our case we want to create a new
analysis because in this screen you see
all the analysis that you have any quick
side the analysis is of course kind of
the last step so the steps where you
created all your visuals to display your
data now we want to create our own
analysis and to be able to visualize
data we need data so if you now go to a
new analysis right here then you might
again see some sample data sets in your
case in my case there is nothing so
let's go to a new data set right here
and right here we can see that we can
connect quick site to a lot of different
data sources
before we continue one quick note if you
want to find out more about this or
about quick-set in general I would be
really happy to welcome you in my udemy
course in this course I will give you an
overview of quick site and a lot of
different functions it offers you can
find the link to this course down there
in the video description and a special
discount price now enough of the
commercial for now I think let's
continue right here because we saw that
we can connect quick set to a lot of
data sources but we will simply use the
upload of file option right here and
well to upload a file we need a file
first
so next find one and you can simply use
this source file that you can find on
this page the link to that is of course
also provided down there in the video
description now you can see that this
file refers to crime incidents in the
City of Hartford well maybe a city not
everybody knows but it's not about the
city it's about the data so this is
perfectly fine actually now if you
scroll down right here to this section
right there then we can simply press
download at D CSV because we should use
tthe file for this little project so
press download we're here and now that
the download is finished we can simply
click on to upload a file right here now
select the file which is downloaded and
press open and again wait a few seconds
because well still the file is quite big
with 90 megabytes so this might take a
few seconds depending on the internet
connection that you have
we finish the upload so we can now
decide what we want to do next and we
basically have two options we can press
on to Next to continue there and by that
start our analysis but actually that's
not the best idea because as I said we
have two different steps and quick side
the analysis which is the last step
where we visualize our data but before
we analyze the data we should take a
look at our data and by that create our
data set based on the information we can
see right here now to enter this data
preparation section of fixed side we
simply have to press edit settings and
prepare data right here and now we are
in the data preparation section of quick
side as I said we have the preparation
and the analysis in the preparation so
right here we specify what information
we really want to have to be imported
into a quick side and by that to be
available in the analysis later and if
you look to the right right here we can
see that we have a lot of columns and if
we scroll down we have a lot of rows
also but these are not all of the rows
that you have in your source data and by
that in your later data set this is just
a preview that should give you an
impression of the structure of the data
that you have keep that in mind however
if we scroll up again right here and
maybe to the left to see the first
column again oops and like this so this
is fine well then we can see that we
have some column names right here I can
increase the width if you want you so
you can creat the better and we have ski
formats automatically being detected by
quick side so if you click right here
you can see that the second column is
formatted as a date
which is correct and if you click right
there then you can see that the first
column is formatted as an integer which
is also totally fine and this is it
actually I don't want to change the
column names or the format's right here
the only thing that I don't like is the
amount of columns that we have because
actually we want to create one single
visual and for the purpose I only need
two kinds of information we need the
date which we have add here and we need
the crime type as I said this data set
is about crime statistics so we
only need two columns actually well and
we cannot delete or hide a column right
here but if you look at the left part
right now well you can see that case
number is right here date is right there
and so on and this is important because
right here we have the different columns
but if you want to work with that
columns and quick side then these
columns are referred to as fields right
there so working with columns and quick
side means working with fields well and
if I look into this field segment right
here then we can select none
so unselect all of the fields basically
then we can see if well nothing to
display this is not good but now we can
simply click onto this box right here
next to date like this and now we see
that we have our date column back which
is really good but we also need a second
column with the well crime type actually
and this could be this one here
so category so let's take that also oops
this didn't work at the drug so it's
grade is fine well and now we see that
we only have these two columns now and
this is important because unselecting
the columns or the views right here
means that the remaining fields will not
be imported into the analysis and by
that not be available right there so
keep that in mind
however this looks pretty good right now
we have the date topic right here and
don't worry about the formatting right
there the important thing is that this
symbol indicates that this is recognized
as a date and we can take care about the
way this state will be displayed in the
analysis well in the analysis itself so
no need to change that right here well
and as we are already we can simply
press on to save and visualize right
there now it again takes a few seconds
because as you can see now the data is
imported into spice you remember back
then this one gigabyte spice base you
got for free as the first user of quick
side and we can also see if that our
import is complete which is nice but the
main thing is that zero rows per script
this means our entire data set that we
now created
was imported into this analysis section
of quick side or into spice actually now
we can close this window actually right
here and well now we want to create as
visual and you can select the different
visual types in quick size down here I
will simply select the heat map
so only one visual so after clicking
right here on to this heat map you can
see that the field worlds are displayed
this is basically the area where you can
define what type of information should
be displayed in this chart and if you
look at these field wells well you can
see that we have dimensions so these
blue fields right here you can find the
right there our datum category and this
green fields the measures which well you
would normally find right there but we
didn't include any measure into our data
set so we cannot select any measure
right here in the analysis now what's
the difference well basically as I
mention is a category this could be a
product type for example or in our case
the category of a specific crime and
measure then is the value behind that so
something that can be aggregated for
example this could be the revenue now we
don't have any measuring here but this
is not a problem because if we now
simply take the category and drag it to
the rows right here and then take the
date and drag it to the columns area
right there and if we now close these
field wells maybe well then we can see
that the values are displayed based on
the count this means simply counts how
many times a specific crime took place
on a specific date and this is the
reason why you normally need these
measures in quick side but for our
purposes the account options is totally
fine so we have this heat map right now
and this heat map now indicates well the
dark of the color is the more crimes
happened at that day but there are two
problems that I can see right here the
first thing is that well I think we have
way too many dates in here so we should
limit that maybe and additionally well
we cannot read what type of crime we
have right there additionally we have
way too much crime types right here so
we should apply some filters to that
maybe well
you can do this easily in quick side by
simply going to refer the area right
there now press on to create one right
here and now you can select the filter
type or what you want to base the
children we said you want to filter the
date first
so we click on to date right here now we
click on to this between none option
right there well and now we can simply
define a time range so we click on to
the start date and let's say we start in
I don't know January maybe 2012 for
example and the 1st of January and it
should end in December 2014 and the 31st
like this if we now press apply right
here well then we see that our visual
changed immediately it looks better now
but still as I said I think we have way
too much categories so crime categories
in here let's maybe select just some of
the darker ones so maybe this one here
oops
this is larceny then maybe that one D
crimes against the public and the
property damage accident so we now know
that you want to have these three
categories only so we can apply another
filter by simply pressing right here and
now click on to this symbol right the
arrow to this filter symbol actually
like that and now we won't filter for
the date but for the category right here
now again click onto this message right
there and now we can find a filter list
down here now let's first unselect all
because we only want to select three of
them so let's press here and now select
larceny and what else do you say crimes
against the public and I think the last
one was property damage accident this
one right here and if we now go back to
our visualizing area right here well
then we see that our heat map looks kind
of interesting right now because as you
can see we have an indication that you
probably damage accident in 2014 well
this happened a lot where as crimes
against the public for example
decreased in 2014 so we are almost done
with that visual but I want to show you
one last thing because if you now go to
that field Wells again by clicking onto
this arrow right here and now change the
date by clicking right here so the
aggregation of the date actually from a
year to a month like this and now
minimize the field wells well then you
can see that you get a more detailed
view so we now have a monthly overview
of these three crime categories that we
selected and for example we can see now
that property damage accidents happened
a lot in February 2014 and this is it
actually I only wanted to show you how
easy it is to import data to quick side
to then create your own data set and to
then visualize the data as I said before
if you want to dive deeper into quick
side I would be really happy to see you
in Miami course otherwise I can only say
thanks for watching and see you in the
next videos bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
