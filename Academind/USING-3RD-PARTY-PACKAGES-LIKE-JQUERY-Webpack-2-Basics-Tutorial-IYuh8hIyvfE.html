created a couple of videos on webpack
and how you may set it up how it works I
also do Blanqui create for videos on it
and for example to also show how you may
set up web peg with UJS or react so I
already have a video on the latter one
on this channel but in this video I want
to start with the basics of using
third-party packages because that of
course is a common use case you don't
only have your code you also use a
third-party package and it's important
to understand how you may import such a
package with web paper with WebEx queue
to be precise so I will start with that
project we already created web pack in
one of my last videos and if you haven't
watch these you can just find the link
in the video description now with this
project I want to add jQuery now I
already do use NPM to manage my project
and then the package.json file thus far
we only have a couple of development
dependencies now I want to install a
production dependency jQuery so I can
use NPM and run NPM install - - save -
mark it as a normal dependency not a
development dependency and of course
it's jQuery which I want to install so
by heading enter it will be downloaded
and put into my node modules folder and
as you can see it also added this
dependency to the package of chases well
that's the first step but not the only
step now how can we use jQuery now we
can go to the app dot JS file and we
could start using jQuery by adding the
dollar selector here and then using
jQuery like output paragraph now is
controlled by jQuery it's a jQuery
object so we should be able to use the
text function here and of course all the
down here text like that and this should
just work shouldn't it now we could also
expect that we couldn't use jQuery like
this like right with instead of the
dollar sign jQuery to get this random in
button and then instead of using add
eventlistener click we could just listen
or just add the click method and then
execute that whenever a click happens
if we restart npm run builds our
development server now we will see that
it doesn't work like that so now it
compiles and on the first look it looks
like everything works but on our page we
see that we get an error the dollar sign
is not defined now what's wrong we
install it's jQuery and we know that
Jake rigged exposes this dollar sign
function so why is it not found because
we never include jQuery we install it
yes but we install a lot of things we do
have a lot of files in our project just
because we have a file in the node
modules folder doesn't mean that we use
it here so what we could do is we could
go to the top of our app dot J's fault
and we could simply import jQuery like
that maybe
so basically use the package name we
have here to pull in the full package
and as a side note this syntax is
correct since it's a package managed
wire NPM we don't need to add the
relative part to the javascript file
here we can just specify the package
name as a pop and NPM or web pack in the
end we'll figure out where that sits so
if we now while we start the server or
just save would have been enough we will
see that as soon as this has restarted
here and we go back to a web page we
still get the same error however what
you also see is if you have a look at
the network tab our bundle increased in
size you might have not noticed this
before but it was smaller and you can
see this in the sources tab if you have
a look at the bundle here bundled up
shares and actually if you in their
search for jQuery you'll find a lot of
jQuery references in there so besides
our own code this here looks pretty much
like we did included so it should be
available and yet we can't use it the
reason for this is that what gets added
to the overall bundle web pack doesn't
create the connection between the jQuery
code which was added to the bundle and
our code where we use it
so this is why we were not able to use
it however we're very close to making
this work we only need to adjust our web
config file here in the plugins area I
now need to use a special plugin web
heck ships with since web peg ships with
that I'll add web pack here as a import
in my config file now so require web
pack here and down on the plugins and I
want to add a new plug-in position
doesn't really matter but I'll add it as
a first plug-in here and I will use
webpack and there another function there
the provide plug-in like this now the
provide plug-in takes JavaScript object
as an argument and here we can basically
map variables or functions or objects we
use in our code two packages which
provide the actual function the actual
code we want to use so here we can
basically say map dollar sign to jQuery
like this and all the map jQuery should
shake reserve that we can use both ways
if we now reload or restart this process
with the change configuration file we
should see that if we reload this one
more time here the error is gone and it
works as before but keep in mind we're
using jQuery code here and the reason
why it works as before is because we
added this plug-in our config file and
this plug-in basically tells web pack
whenever you encounter the dollar sign
or the jQuery function the plug-in we
specify here where the package I should
say the package we specify here is
providing the actual code and indeed the
check we package provides the jQuery
function which is all the el es with the
dollar sign here so that is where we
built this connection and why this will
now work and this is how you can add a
plug-in or excuse me package like jQuery
to your existing web pack workflow I
hope this was helpful see you in the
other videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
