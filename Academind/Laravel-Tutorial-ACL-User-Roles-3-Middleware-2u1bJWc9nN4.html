our database we created two roles the
users there and our first while
connections or we assign the first roles
now it's time to do the remaining work
to create the actual middleware which
protects our route I start in the user
model here where I will define two new
methods and this is one of the rare
times see what you say where we actually
define more than just well the
relationships in the user model but here
I really need these extra methods first
method I will need is a public function
which says or which is called has any
role and with this method I want to have
a way to check if a user later in the
middle where the authenticated user has
a certain role and I need this method
once you find out if he has this role
and to be able to determine if the user
should be granted access to a certain
resource or not I will pass an argument
called roles which will contain the
roles I want to check for so this will
work in a way that and when we're in the
middle where and we know that a certain
route is only accessible by let's say
roles admin and offer what pass admin
had offered to this function and check
if the user has one of the two roles and
only if he has one of those roles he's
allowed to access this resource in this
function here I will first check if
roles is an actual array because we are
also allowed to pass a single role
instead of an array of roles like the
convenience here you could of course
also pass a single role in an array but
we were provided with convenience here
so if we're in an array of roles then I
want to loop through this array through
all the roles in this area with a no-no
for each loop and I will check if
this current user this of course refers
to the currently locked in user or on
whatever user object or calling this has
any role later if this user has a role
this function doesn't exist yet I'm
going to create it in a minute if he has
this role the roles role if he has this
role I will return true because then I
want you to tell well return both the
method then the user actually has this
role which is exactly the check I'm
running here and if I'm check him if he
has any of these roles I don't need to
continue in this loop because I know
yeah he has any of the roles I he needs
to access this resource so we may just
finish it as matter if he has all the
roles
this is the one part of this function
the other is well just if we're not
getting an array of floats but a single
role well then of course the only thing
we do is basically we repeat this but
here we have roles because in though
it's called roles it's only one role as
we're not having an array so then we
would also return true in all other
cases though we would return false
because user does not have the role or
any of the roles we're checking this
leads to the second function the has
role function which we're calling here
and here this has no function well well
check if user has a specific role and I
do this by running or checking if this
the user roles which is the relation to
all the roles again using parentheses to
stay in the query bowler so to say to
say ok I'm going to add some arguments
to this database call I'm making Europe
I want and here where well the name of
the role is role
and then the first element now what this
does is it accesses the roles of this
user and then sees if in these roles the
user has assigned to it the roller
checking for appears if this is not the
case then the user does not have this
role so here I can return true otherwise
we're returning false so does that we
prepare our user model to be able to
check if the user has a certain role and
with this we're well prepared to write
our actual middleware before I do this I
want to do one other thing in my admin
blade view view here I want to populate
this admin view page so that we can
actually see the check marks here
because we all got all the functionality
we need to show the check marks to do
this I'm going to create an input
element here which is of type checkbox
and if it is checked or not depends on
well the case if this user the current
row we're in has this role or not so
here I'm entering the plate template
expression and I check if the current
user we're looping through all users
here to output them in a table if the
current user has a role in this case
well it's just the usual I'm doing this
hard-coded here of course you could come
up with a dynamic way but this is
already split up over several videos I
didn't want to make this too long and
it's not a core thing to this ACL system
I'm showing so this is how we check if
user has a role that's just a function
we implement it a few minutes ago
and if he has this role well then I'm
going to set check attribute otherwise
I'll not now we'll just copy this for
all three roles
here I have the offer and here I have
the admin and I also want to set a name
attribute here this is needed later
whether actually it change the roles
this will be called role user this input
here this input will be called role
offered and the last input will of
course be called role admin now these
changes in place if I reload this page
you can see the actual role assignments
we have due to our seeding and this
looks looks alright to me offer as the
offer all admin the admin role and or a
normal user the user role so doesn't
works now back to the middle of where
we're going to create a new middleware
and here again we can use our teaching
to help us set up as file but just clone
PHP rotation make : middleware and then
the name of the middleware which I will
coach is called check role now in my
malware folder under App HTTP I have
this check role PHP file which is
conveniently already set up in a way
that we don't have to do that much and
let us have a function I first want to
check if well we actually have a user in
our request so if this is not null so
this means if we're trying to access
this not locked in then we'll always be
well sent back on all the routes where
we are checking for roles because well
no matter which role you theoretically
have if you're not logged in or
certainly in the wrong place so then I
will return our spawns and this will
just be a text response whereas a
insufficient permissions with a record
400 401 unauthorized I have to do this
because if I did not do this I'll try to
access this use
of the requests in the next steps and
the switch throw an error if the user is
not set therefore I will need to check
before I actually do this next thing is
I need to retrieve some actions and I
will come back to this in a second I do
this by accessing my router to router
currently trying to access here when the
smooth wear kicks in and here the get
action method now this is a little bit
difficult to understand I imagine it
will be clearer in a few seconds
basically with get action we can access
these key value pairs we're setting up
in our routes array here all these are
actions of this route and we can define
our own ranch actions and we'll do so
later so these actions were manually
defining them will be the actual roles
which are allowed to access a route and
in a check role middleware I'm basically
retrieving these roles here by getting
the actions however actions is well this
array this is the action variable or
this is what we store in this action
variable later we'll have like roles and
then an array which says offer admin for
example and then we want to retrieve
this roles key in our actions to do this
back in my check role I will add a new
variable which basically first we'll
check if action stars have this roles
key because not all our routes needed
were also having routes which are not
protected which may be accessed by
everyone where we don't use this role
middleware or where we set up this role
middleware but don't you find any roles
so first we check if we actually do have
any role setup
and if this if this is the case well
then all we do is restore them the roles
we set up for this rod are stored in
those roles variable otherwise well the
variables variable will be null
so next step is queue access to user in
the request and that's again it's the
reason where we have to check if the
user is in now before we do this here
and use D has any role method we created
early in this video to check if he has
any of the roles we retrieved here or if
roles is not set if roles is not set
well then also we want to allow the user
to proceed and we do this by calling
return next request the statement that
was at the end of this default handle
method created for us by the artisan
command this basically says everything
is fine you may go on with the next
model or whatever so we're done we're
then checking everything's fine
you may continue you may continue if you
either have one of the roles or if no
roles are set up otherwise your while
trying to access the resource you're not
allowed to and we will one let's just
copy this will return the exact same
response this is how you create the
middleware now the last step in this
video is to register this middleware and
we do this in the kernel PHP file at the
very bottom of this file in the route
middleware area here at the end I will
trade in you middleware and I will just
call it roles to name is up to you and
this will point to app HTTP middleware
and then check role and here it's
important to add this class keyword or
access your property so that we refer
the actual class with this the
middleware is created it is registered
and the net
SAP in the next video will actually
protect some routes with it and do all
the final touches with still get to you
see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
