a video tutorial is awesome but it also
requires some crucial steps to make well
the video as good as possible of course
there is the knowledge of the subject
and the video preparation then you also
have to record your video that's clear
but after that you are not done because
you only got the raw footage on your
computer and you want to present to your
audience the best possible result
therefore you need to cut and edit your
videos and in this video we will take a
look at this cutting and editing process
basically I will show you how we cut and
edit our videos so the basic steps
required to make sure that you get the
best possible video experience let's
start with that right now
so which software do we use to cut the
videos well we use Adobe's Creative
Cloud now there are lots of other
alternatives available on the market
also free alternatives because well the
Creative Cloud is not for free however
we started with the Creative Cloud
initially and we are still happy with it
and that's the reason why we still use
it and why this tutorial or this video
will also be based on the Creative Cloud
however the Creative Cloud depending on
the package that you purchase comes with
a lot of different apps or tools
included now let's have a look at which
tools we actually use in our video
editing process because once you
purchased and downloaded the Creative
Cloud as I said depending on a package
that you purchased you have all the apps
available right here which are a lot of
awesome apps but we don't need all of
them if you look at the installed apps
right here well then you can see that we
don't use that many apps actually for
our video editing process we actually
only use audition right here that's a
tool that we use to record the audio so
what I'm doing right now actually and to
edit the audio this means to change the
volume for example then we use Premiere
Pro this is our main cutting and editing
tool so we used it to cut all the
different video clips correctly
something we will do throughout this
video then we use After Effects well as
the name says this is used to apply some
effects to our videos in this video we
will use After Effects to get rid of the
green screen so the green screen behind
me which you cannot see right now
because it's already cleaned but you
will learn how we did that and the last
two we use is the media encoder this
will start automatically and it just
helps us to well kind of cue the
different videos we have because if you
create a course with a module having
like 30 different videos then you want
to make sure that you render the videos
in the correct order or in the order
that you want you have however these are
the tools we will use so audition for
the audio Premiere Pro for the editing
and After Effects for
effects so let's leave the creative
cloud now and let's have a look at the
files that we actually need to well edit
our video because as you can imagine I
prepared some files for you to show you
how to edit the video and these files
can be seen right here the first file is
the video file this mp4 this is
basically well my face which you see in
the video right now then we have this
screen file right here this is basically
the recording of the screen so what you
can see behind me now and then we have
these two audio files the waffle and the
PKF now where do these files come from
well the mp4 file comes from the
camcorder I talked about that in another
video you can find a link to that video
up here right now the same thing is true
for this screen right here we use the
tool ScreenFlow to record our screen so
also check out the other video I just
mentioned to see how this works but what
about these two files so the two audio
files the swath and the PAF well both
files are created in audition as I said
before audition is the tool that we use
to record our audio so the wall file is
the audio file and the PKF file is the
file that is required by audition there
for audition creates it now talking
about audition how does it actually work
how does the audio recording Berg well
let's have a look so I put the program
start here on the desktop so we can
simply open additional and that's the
first thing you see when you open
audition and it's actually quite easy to
use there is just one important thing
that you have to keep in mind before you
start recording go to edit right here
now go to preferences and now check the
audio Hardware that's really important
because if you click onto that then you
see that as default input and now got
the microphone which is not working
because I'm not recording on this
computer right now however if you record
always make sure that the microphone is
selected correctly right here otherwise
you might record your audio from the
laptop for example or from the
integrated laptop microphone and the
quality is not good normally however you
can also define
the default output which in my case is
the in my case are the integrated
speakers in my screen and with that you
can press ok right here now how do you
start such a recording now well you
simply go to file right here go to new
and select the audio file now you can
give it a name as you want let's name it
test now we always set the sample rate
to 48,000 Hertz that's just what we
tried out and what turned out to be a
good quality and the channel is mono of
course because well we only have two
microphone and the bit depth is 32 these
are the settings that we use I will
press cancel now because well I don't
have any microphone plugged in now right
here and if you then press record down
here then the recording would start
after you finish the recording you can
just press stop right here and then save
the file and with that you got the audio
file created the way we did it right
here so that's the creation of the audio
file but how do we edit it in audition
now well what we normally do is we
simply drag it to left maybe we simply
take the wah file and drag and drop it
right here into the center screen like
that let's maximize that again so what
we see right here is basically the audio
recording that we have we will listen to
that later and the first thing we always
do is we choose a part of the audio file
which is actually quiet here for example
so you don't see any noise in here but
it might be the case that you have some
kind of well really slight background
noise in here and this is the noise that
you want to eliminate because you want
to make sure that your audio is as clean
and as crisp as possible so for the
purpose you simply select a part in the
video which appears to be silent
actually right here for example and now
you go to effects appear and now you go
to noise reduction and select capture
noise print like that now you can scroll
out again or zoom out again and now
press ctrl-a to select the entire audio
file or you enter audio clip actually
and now you go back to effects once
again go to noise reduction restoration
and now select noise reduction process
right here
and what will happen now is that
audition will try to eliminate this
noise that you previously identified
with that capture noise print function
now you can play around with the
different settings of the noise
reduction down here we will not talk
about that in detail in this video but
normally the basic settings should be
quite good so if you now press apply
right here then you see that the noise
reduction is applied and then if you had
some background noise it should be
eliminated now so this really improves
your audio quality so that's the first
step that we do the second step that we
apply is that we change to volume
actually because normally it's too quiet
so the pure recording is too quiet so
what you can do is you can simply press
and hold the left mouse button right
here in this area and then well increase
the volume we always try to be within
-12 + - 6 let's do it like this maybe
and you can see the decibel right here
so we try to be within that range of
course we have some Peaks but that's
normally not a problem as soon as you're
done with your work in audition then so
the noise canceling and the increase of
the volume you can simply save that and
well now it's time to start the actual
video editing and for that purpose we
need the video editing app and as I said
before this is Premiere Pro in our case
so let's switch to Premiere Pro now so
this is Premiere Pro over here and as
you can see right there I already
prepared two files this is just an MTU
primary profile and this is an empty
after effects file so this program right
here we will need After Effects as I
said to eliminate the green-screen later
but for the purpose we need both files
to be created so let's open the Premiere
Pro file first right here
so now we are in Premiere Pro and before
we continue let me make one important
note we are no professional video
editors so we learned all that on our
own with the goal to edit our video
tutorials as good as possible so in case
you find anything that might not be best
practice feel free to leave us a comment
below the video because we're always
happy to get some nice advice from
people who might have more experience
regarding video editing however all the
things are shown right here
generally work of course because
otherwise we couldn't cut our videos so
if you followed this guidance your video
should be quite ok actually in the end
so having said that here we are in
Premiere Pro and the important thing
right here is that you have different
workspaces you can also see the
different workspaces up here so assembly
editing color and so on
and if you go to window right there and
two workspaces you can also select them
right here as I said I'm now in the
assembly workspace and actually I will
only work in the assembly and editing
workspace in this video however let's
maybe drag that to the left a little bit
like this and now go back to our source
folder right here because here we have
two files so I will now select the mp4
file so the phase the audio file and the
screen right here and now we can simply
drag that over here into this area you
can see import media to start like that
and now maximize Premiere Pro again and
now you see that we have these free
files in here this is nice you can also
see that we recorded the phase with 50
frames and the screen with 25 frames per
second for the final video we want to
have 25 frames and an easy way how to
achieve that now is to well create a new
so-called sequence you will see that in
a few seconds by double-clicking onto
the screen and now you see the screen
appearing right here that's interesting
but what is more interesting is that
down here you have two symbol and it
says it actually you can drag the video
only or the audio only well as
we record the audio separately we don't
need the audio from our screen of course
we only need the screen and therefore I
simply take the screen right here and
drag it down here as it says to create a
new sequence like that well and as you
can see we now have that new sequence
created with the example screen in there
and if I now move the mouse you can see
that it goes through the sequence like
that well with that we got our first
clip in here
let's now also add the face so I'm
simply clicking it and now I'm gonna
drag it over here but I will drag it
down there directly into the sequence
and as you can see Premera
automatically creates the two different
clips so we got regular here we got the
video appear the example mp4 and the
corresponding audio down there let's
maybe increase the size a little bit so
that you can see it better like that and
up there you can also see my face so you
now see my face right here and right
there well I think you have to deal with
that for the moment however we now have
this file down here and with that there
is only one last thing missing and
that's our audio file we got it right
here and I will simply drag it again and
put it right there with that we got all
our clips in our sequence so let's maybe
change it oops right here as you can see
you can arrange that workspace just the
way you prefer so I will put it over
here and well how does this work now how
do we continue because now it's
basically in here but well that's not
the way it should be in the end because
if i zoom in so I'm pressing alt and now
I use the mouse wheel to zoom in like
that scroll to the left well then you
can see that the audio here is not
synchronized zoom out a little bit
because you can see these two peaks
right here what are these Peaks well
these two peaks are two claps like that
because what we normally do is we start
our audio recording then we start the
camcorder so this one right here and
then we clap two times because this
allows us to synchronize the audio of
the integrated camcorder
microphone and the audio of this
microphone right here because we will
get rid of the audio of the camcorder as
soon as we finish that synchronization
process because this has a way better
audio quality however how do we do this
synchronizing process then well the
first thing I do is now I click onto the
audio clip so the green one is the audio
clip from the microphone and if I now go
to left you can see that this symbol
appears and if I now click right here I
can simply decrease the size of that
clip and now I can drag it so I'm simply
doing it with the mouse right here but
that's not correct so let's zoom in a
little bit and let's now put it right
here let's zoom it further still not
working so we should go a frame to the
right how can we do that well we can
simply use the left arrow key and the
right arrow key on the keyboard to
navigate between the frames and as you
can see up here this goes through it
frame by frame if you hold shift and the
arrow keys this goes five frames to the
left and five frames to the right now
I'm talking about these shortcuts
already how does this work and how do I
know these shortcuts well of course you
can google them but another really good
alternative is if you go to edit right
here and now go to the keyboard
shortcuts down there if you click onto
that you can see all the different
keyboard commands that you have and even
better
down here you can overview of all the
different shortcuts and commands that
you have and in addition to that you can
also click right here to search for a
specific shortcut for example now what I
will use in a few seconds is ctrl + B
and as you can see with this shortcut I
will basically add an edit which means I
will set a cut basically so that's
important because at the moment I am
working on a Windows PC so if you're
using Premiere Pro on a Mac this can be
slightly different but with this
keyboard shortcuts it should always be
easy to find the right command on the
keyboard that you need however let's go
back to our sequence now by pressing
cancel down here so we set this marker
and that's the important thing right
here that we moved before to the left
and now to the right and we are exactly
at the beginning of the clap in the
microphone of the camcorder now we see
that it's not equal so I selected that
microphone clip and if I now press alt
and now the right arrow key you can see
that I can again move the clip
frame-by-frame but now I'm not moving
that marker up here see now without alt
and moving the marker and right here I'm
only moving the clip now this doesn't
work perfectly but let's maybe align it
like that and if we now play it yes this
sounds quite correct so with that we did
our first step we now aligned the audio
this means we can get rid of that audio
off the camcorder so I'm simply
selecting it and I'm pressing delete on
a keyboard with that it's gone but there
is one more thing that we have to
synchronize and that's the screen
because the screen does not start right
here when the recording of the camcorder
starts we do that with a second well
trick and this trick is if you go to
right here you see I'm saying action you
could say anything you want of course
but we use action so we will again set
this marker and not selected right here
to this position when I say action now
I'll zoom out again so with old and the
mouse wheel and now I place the screen
exactly right here so if you let it play
again then the screen starts problem is
however that you cannot see the screen
at the moment right because the only
thing you see is basically well again
myself and this is maybe not the only
thing that you want to see in such a
video so the third step before we can
start the actual cutting is to decrease
the size of that clip because it should
only be in the lower right part of the
screen so but I'm sitting right now to
do that we will now change the workspace
and leave the assembly workspace and go
to editing right here now as you can see
the workspace looks kind of different
now this big assembly part right here is
gone therefore we have now the effect
controls right there and if I now select
that clip up here so the clip of myself
on it
then you can see that you can change
lots of different things up here and the
thing that we have to change right here
is the position and the scale the scale
we normally use is 33.3 percent so like
that and as you can see now I'm smaller
but kind of in the middle of the screen
this means we need to position myself
differently and as you can see right
here I'm always sitting in the right
lower part of the screen and the right
position for that is one oops one six
zero one like that and nine zero one
like that and now you see suddenly I'm
sitting down here in the right lower
corner of the screen which is nice
however there is still this green screen
around me but we will come back to that
in a few minutes when we talk about
After Effects so before we continue let
me maybe increase the size right here I
hope you can see everything but I think
it should be fine basically I can also
change that a little bit again as you
can see you can arrange the workspace
just as you want you however we got the
basic set we got the right format up
here and we synchronize the audio and
the screen with our actual recording so
let's now start with the cutting process
and the cutting starts actually at the
beginning so let's see here looking into
the camera and let's try it out now so
this is our small example video so
that's a start so let's maybe zoom in
again as I said I'm pressing alt and the
mouse wheel now I can again press the
right key
on the right arrow key on the keyboard
and now I want to set a cut right here
so how do I set this cut now at this
position well actually before that if
you go to edit and keyboard shortcuts
that if I type ctrl + B that this will
add an edit right here the important
finger is that if you double click right
there and now press B for example you
now see that B would also do the same
thing so that's also important you can
manually change the shortcuts with the
corresponding functions though just the
way you prefer
to work now in my case I will get rid of
that B and keep control B as the
shortcut but that's again important if
you're cutting on your own just find out
the right functions you need and define
the shortcuts as you want you however we
will use control B to cut that so let's
press cancel and if I now select the
first clip and press control B then you
see that I set the cut in this first
clip however that's not good because we
want to cut all hips of course otherwise
the video wouldn't make any sense after
that so let's press control Z and now
select all three clips at the same time
if I now press control B well then we
got the cut set perfectly perfectly yes
but if I now press delete right here
well then the clip a zoom out is gone
which is nice but the starting point
should be zero actually
so we should get rid of that distance
right here and we can do that by
pressing shift and delete like that
hmm shift and delete what was that
actually because as I said these
commands might be different at your
computer so if we go to edit once again
keyboard shortcuts and type shift +
delete then you can see that this was
the ripple delete that I applied also a
really important function that we use
quite often in our videos so let's press
cancel and well the ripple delete worked
quite well but let me undo that once and
twice and now we select all the clips
that we want relate and now press shift
and delete so ripple delete once again
because now you can see that we now
start at zero with just one keyboard
command which is quite nice actually
so with that let's now continue and
listen to this clip as I said it's just
30 seconds so it won't take very long so
let's go to the beginning and start
again so this is our small example video
that we will use to see how we can cut
our
have to stop right here shortly you can
also see right here that the D stable
level is kind of between minus 12 and
minus 6 this is the thing that I told
you when we worked on the file in
addition so let's continue right now
videos now let's assume now let's assume
that I mean now lets us and here you can
see that I made a mistake so this means
we need to cut out this part right here
so what I simply can do is I can click
right here to set the marker well just a
few frames before the actual mistake
happens now I select all the clips press
control B as we learned before and now
simply go right there
and now again select all the clips again
set a cut and now use the ripple delete
so in my case shift and delete to get
rid of these two wrong sentences like
that woman let's see how it looks like
our videos now let's assume that I made
a mistake right here that this looks
fine so now we made our first cut let's
continue and see if there is anything
else that we have to change right here
but we have to cut out and after this
first mistake and after this first
mistake we now have the second mistake
that's the second mistake so we follow
the same pattern we simply go right here
and set the cut and now go to the
beginning where it started right here
and set the second cut now select the
free clips that you want to delete and
use the ripple delete again to get rid
of that part let's see if it looks good
but we have to cut out and after this
first mistake we now have the second
mistake that's fine actually so let's
see if there is anything else that we
should cut in here and with that we now
edit it or cut our video and we can now
continue with our basics in video
editing bye
and with that bye we can now stop the
video and again select all three clips
as you can see the markers set right
here add a cut select the freelance
clips and simply delete them and if we
now zoom out a little bit again old and
the mouse wheel then you can see that
this is now our entire clip actually and
as you can imagine in a longer video
there are a lot more fing
to cut and so on but that's just the
basic process that you need to
understand to be able to cut your videos
however we are not done yet because well
if you look right here well you can see
that this green screen is still in that
screen and that doesn't look good
because if you look around me well then
there is not any kind of green screen
visible so how do we get rid of this
green screen now well the good thing is
that this is quite easy actually the
only thing we should do first is we
should start after-effects
let's do that quickly by simply dragging
this to the left again and going back to
previous folder and now start this after
effects file I created as I said before
this is just an empty after effects file
there is nothing in it so let's do that
and now we are in after-effects now if
you go to window and workspace you can
see that we are in this standard
workspace in here just in case this
looks different on your computer so how
do we now get the connection between
these two files because as I said I
would like to get rid of the green
screen using After Effects now let's
switch back to Premiere Pro here it is
let's maximize it and what we now do is
we will just select this tool right here
the track select forward tool and I know
this one we just press and hold the left
mouse button and now you see that the
arrow indicates the direction you want
to select it from so we will use the
second one and if we now click right
here so after our Clips then you see we
select everything this is not good
because we only want to select our first
clip so let me go back to the selection
tool right here again that's what we
always used normally and we only want to
select this first clip because that's
the clip with the face so let's again
select the track forward tool and if I
now press shift right here then you see
that we only have one arrow and if I now
click right here then you see that we
selected only the first clip and by that
only the clip with the face and the
green screen behind me so if we now
right-click on to that clip and now
select up here replace with After
Effects composition then either
and you after effects file will be
opened but as we opened an after effects
file already it will just work kind of
import that into this after effects file
and that's exactly what we want to do so
let's press replace with After Effects
composition and here you can see my face
again and now we have a new composition
you saw we talked about sequences in
Premiere Pro and we talked about
compositions in After Effects and in
this composition I can now again
navigate through it frame by frame and
as you can see my face is always there
and so is the green-screen
now how do we get rid of this green
screen now well for that purpose we need
an effect and the effects can be found
right here the effect that we use is
called key light key light one two
actually and this is this effect so if
we simply select that effect and drag it
to the first clip right here in the
sequence in the composition scene
compositions in After Effects then you
can see that this effect is now here if
you click onto that arrow and open
effects and you can see key light and
here you can adjust it that's one option
but we will not use that right here but
you also have the effect controls appear
and that's the important part
that we will use because we will now
select a color that should be eliminated
by clicking right here and now simply
search for a good spot this should be
kind of an average screen color that you
have so not the brightest one not the
darkest one so let's really click right
here and as you can see the screen is
already gone but let's zoom in again I'm
using the mouse wheel and now we can
select the hand tool right here and go
down and now go back to the selection
tool like this and well is this perfect
already we are normally not sure and
therefore we should change from final
result up here to screen mate but I
don't know how it's pronounced to be
honest let's call it mate I don't know
like that and as you can see it's not
perfect because we still have these
white spots in here and we don't want it
so the whole green screen or the former
green screen should be black actually in
this screen made much of you whatever so
how can we change that well we can
simply go to screen mate again this word
and now we can play around with clip
black and clip white so we can for
example choose clip black right here
with 50 as you can see looks a lot
better now but I'm not really white the
background should be black and the
person you want to display should be
white in this view so to change that we
have to reduce clip white right here so
we can press 7 here for example like
this and now it looks quite good
actually
as you can imagine these values are not
guessed by myself we use these values in
our videos so the important thing is
that you just know that you can change
the settings right here but that you
have to play around with these settings
on your own if you want to clean your
green screen that you have behind
yourself because it always depends on
the green screen and on the lighting and
generally their conditions you have in
your room but in our case this works
quite fine if we do it like this another
thing we normally adjust is the screen
softness we use 0.6 right here and the
screen despot wide down there we set it
to 2 again these are settings we use
feel free to play around with them
however if we now select the marker and
press space then we see it's kind of
working it looks good actually so let's
change it up here back to final result
like that and start in the beginning
maybe let's have a look yes it looks
fine but there is one more thing that
you can do to make sure that you really
eliminated all the green spots of your
green screen how does this work
well you can simply go to layer up here
go to new and now select a solid layer
right there if you do that then you can
name it as you prefer that's not a
problem the important thing is that you
set the color to white down here if you
click right here you can change the
color as you want you we will keep it
white a
nice okay well then we don't see a thing
actually but if we drag it down right
here as you can see and now dragging it
to the second position this white solid
layer well then you can see that if we
play the video again yeah it looks
really good so that's kind of a second
test that you can do to really make sure
that the cleaning worked fine you can
now select the layer again and press
delete to get rid of it so that's the
cleaning now we need to apply this
effect to the remaining two Clips
because right here well the green screen
is still present so how can we do this
well of course we don't have to readjust
the effect again and again the only
thing we have to do is we have to select
the key light so the effect of that
first clip where we already eliminated
the green screen now press ctrl Z to
copy it now select both clips or all the
other clips where you want this effect
to be applied and now paste the effect
and as you can see now the green screen
is gone in the other two clips also
let's now save this and go back to
Premiere Pro to see how it worked and
let me quickly change the selection tool
right here well and as you can see this
work but we can still still to the green
screen now it works so it took quite a
few seconds to load it and with that you
can now see that the green screen is
gone and if we go to the beginning you
can also see that this looks fine right
there so with that we are now done with
After Effects of course there are a lot
of more things that you can do in After
Effects but getting rid of the green
screen is an important one if you create
video tutorials with a green screen
behind you now before we continue and
finish the last steps one important
thing if you look right here into our
project let me increase that maybe you
can see that we now have five files but
in the beginning we only had free we had
two screen we had my face and we had the
audio so why do we have five files now
well the reason is simple the first file
we added is this one this is the
sequence you can identify that by this
logo so if I rename that by clicking it
right here too
like that to seq maybe click right here
then you can see that this is the actual
sequence that we created this means that
this sequence now includes our screen
right here the first pub we had in the
beginning then my face the second file
and the audio file these free files and
the four file we have done here is the
link composition that we created in
After Effects so far we got rid of the
green screen that's just important to
know for you to see how your project
structure changes if you create new
sequences or if you work in After
Effects
however this now is almost fun there are
only two more things that I would like
to adjust and for their purpose I would
like to mute the audio first because
otherwise you would hear the audio all
the time when we have a look at the
video and this could be quite annoying
so to mute that audio channel you simply
press that M right here so we mute the
track and now if you play the video you
only can see me but you can't hear me
which is quite ok for a moment as I
think so let's go back to the beginning
of that clip let me scroll in go to left
and now go right here because you might
have seen that our videos
don't start well like that with an image
you normally have two seconds for you
just see the background and then our
faces
fade in how do we do that well we can
simply go to the beginning again like
that now select the screen so that's the
background image right here and if I now
right click onto that and press insert
frame hold segment like that then you
can see that Premiere automatically adds
two seconds you can see this right here
of the counter so that's the frame
that's the second so we have one second
and 24 frames and then the face comes in
well still that's not good so we should
also change that maybe so let's select
that composition and go to the right
again with the right arrow key on the
keyboard and now selected that and now
you can see that opacity setting right
here and that's set to 100% now if I
change to zero
press Enter then you see that my face is
gone and if you now press shift and hold
shift and press the right arrow key two
times then we learned before just
pressing the arrow key will move frame
by frame holding pressing and holding
shift and then pressing the arrow key
will move five frames each time you
press the arrow key
this means we now moved ten frames to
the right now with that we can click
right here again and press 100 and with
that my face is back now how did that
work now without talking about too much
details if you look at this area right
here and you can change it right there a
little bit yeah I think it's hard to see
but you can see it then you see that we
have these symbols right here these
symbols are keyframes so these frames
basically say at this stage I want
something to happen now at this keyframe
right here we want the opacity to be at
100% and at the first frame right here
the clip into is arrow you can see this
frame we want the opacity to have 0% and
that's why my face is now fading in step
by step because between these two
keyframes Premiere Pro automatically
increases the opacity to make sure that
when we start you're positive zero but
at the frame that we define where it
should be 100% that it is well kind of
smoothly increasing now talking about
keyframes in detail and what you can do
of them is not covered in this video
it's just important to know that concept
because it helps you a lot when you want
to edit and cut your videos however
let's have a look at the beginning now
of our video if it looks fine let's see
so we have the two seconds now it starts
so you can see a smooth transition now
that's nice but let's now go to the
ending of the video right here because
here we have the same issue the first
thing is that we want to have this two
seconds in the end with this frame hold
so what we can do is we go to the last
frame that's not correct you need to be
careful right here now
select the clip as we did right here and
now press insert frame hold segment like
that and as you can see again we added
this frame hold right there without any
change in the screen now the last thing
you have to do is of course we also have
to well kind of change the opacity
because we want the face to fade out in
the end
smoothly now to do this we can again
click right here change the opacity to
zero right there and as you can see
right here we created that keyframe
again and now press shift and press the
left arrow key two times and change it
back to 100 right here press Enter you
see the second keyframe was added and
with that we can see that the face
smoothly fades out now you can also add
these transitions with a shortcut it's
ctrl D and then it will automatically
add these transitions at the beginning
and at the end of the video but I just
wanted to make sure that you saw this
concept of the keyframes that we use in
our videos however with that we are now
actually done with our clip the only
thing we have to do right now is we only
have to export this media now well to
create a new rendered video that you
then see in the end on YouTube and to do
that you can simply select the sequence
right here you remember we named it oops
maybe squeeze it we named it sequence so
this sequence you're working in right
click right here and now press export
media like that and here you can now
specify the export settings now I will
again not talk about the details right
here the important thing is actually
that you change the format to h.264
that's the format we use and you can
leave the preset to match source high
bitrate this means it will export the
video with the preset or if the settings
you have in your sequence so in our case
1080p and 25 frames per second now
without diving into the details the only
thing you have to do right now is you
only have to press export if you want to
immediately render the video or
you press Q what we always do to start
the media encoder and with that to be
able to queue all the different videos
that we have let's have a look at that
how this works so I pressed Q right now
now the media encoder starts as I said
in the beginning that's also an app that
we use takes a few seconds to load of
course and with that we can now see that
our video is right here with our
settings that we made we cannot specify
a folder where it should be render to
and if you now press play well then it
will take a few well seconds to hours
depending on the quality and the size of
your video and with that you are done
with cutting editing and rendering your
video and that's it actually this is the
basic approach that we follow when we
create our videos now as I said in the
beginning this is how we do it in the
Creative Cloud and there are lots of
more functions and things you can do in
there which I couldn't cover in this
video however I hope this gave you a
good and quick introduction into the
basic knowledge that you need to cut and
edit your videos and maybe this helps
you also in your own videos so as always
thanks a lot for watching hope to see
you in the next videos and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
