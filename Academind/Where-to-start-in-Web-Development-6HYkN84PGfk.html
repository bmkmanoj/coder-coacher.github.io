on board if you dive into web
development or if you work in web
development today's landscape looks like
this we get tons and tons and tons of
technologies you can learn you can dive
into you might feel the need to learn
them and for some of them you don't even
know what they do now how did we get
into this state and more importantly how
do we get out of that state let me
explain what all these technologies mean
and how we work with them and how you
make your way through that jungle in
this video so this is how today's web
development landscape looks like we got
tons of languages libraries technologies
we got front on the back end we got
different browsers
we got mobile and desktop development we
should optimize our code and ship as
small code as possible
and so on now if you're just starting
off with app development this is
extremely intimidating there are so many
technologies how do you know with which
to start how do you keep up with the
rapid development we're experiencing
here well that rapid development
actually is a thing things have
extremely accelerated but that also
means you don't have to keep up all the
time it's of course always good to stay
up-to-date to dive into new trends to
have open eyes for them but it's also
important to understand that it's not
about always adopting a new technology
as one of the first because and that's a
good thing probably browser support for
such new technologies probably isn't
that good anyways but let's take a step
back let's say you're starting off or
you started off but you're not super
advanced how do you navigate through
that jungle then let's first of all
split this up a little bit we first will
have to understand that we got three
core web technologies we can think of
and that is HTML CSS and JavaScript
simply put HTML is for the structure of
our
this is why we write the XML like
structure white is like an XML language
then we have CSS which takes that
structure and gives it some styling so
that we don't have the ugly default
styles of the browser and then we have
JavaScript we add some logic so that
something happens when we click button
or that we do some date picker which
opens up or some image picker or
something like that all these things
which often are connected to user
interaction all these things that change
the page add runtime so after it has
been loaded all these things happen
through JavaScript these are the three
core web technologies they have meant I
early in the browser and correctly you
might say but the web is all about the
server and I'll come back to this but
even if these only happen the browser
you gotta learn them you gotta
understand how that works if you wanna
be a web developer even if you do focus
on server-side development even if you
are saying hey I'm a PHP developer you
need to understand how these
technologies work you don't necessarily
need to master them there might then be
better designers using CSS better
developers working with JavaScript and
some JavaScript frameworks but you need
to have the basics set and that is
therefore what you should start with
when becoming a web developer if you're
starting off hey this is your roadmap
learn HTML learn CSS learn JavaScript
and learning it doesn't mean master it
it takes a lot to master a certain
language but it means understand it be
able to write basic code with it be able
to read and understand the code of our
people be able to expand your knowledge
in that area that is what learning means
so there are the core web technologies
but as I mentioned they had all or these
all run in the browser we also got a
server side and there we got an
abundance of languages we can use and
these are only some of them not even all
so we got rails PHP nodejs asp.net and
as I said we got our language is too
now on the server side we don't just
have free language is therefore in the
browser we have a clear limited set of
languages we can use the browser only
understands HTML Javascript and CSS now
on the server that's different because a
server is just a computer and we can run
any code you want on the computer and
the end the thing that makes a server a
server is the fact that it can handle
incoming Network requests and if it is a
web server sent back HTML because again
we have to send something back which is
understood by the browser because the
browser is our client talking to the
server again I'm speaking about web
servers here of course there could be
different servers mail service and so on
but if we focus on web servers then we
have to send back HTML and optionally
also CSS and JavaScript how we generate
this HTML CSS JavaScript is then up to
ask though we can use any server-side
language to output a certain HTML
document and attach to write script
files we prepared and so on and on the
server side we also execute code which
accesses a database for example where we
reach out to of my sequel database to
store and fetch data or a MongoDB
database and these things happen on the
server for two reasons they are
typically performance intensive and you
don't want to run such tasks in the user
browser because this will slow down the
user experience and you don't know which
machine the user is using and obviously
security you want to run code that is
vulnerable that is sensible on the
server if you store some user related
data on the client in the browser not
only can't you access it globally which
is an issue if you really want to
connect different users but it also is
accessible by the user so that is why we
have server-side languages and it makes
sense to also type into these now at
some point of time you might need to
make the decision whether you become
front-end or a back-end
back it means you focus on the server
side you focus on server side languages
a front that means you focus on the HTML
CSS and JavaScript stuff in the browser
now there are also full stack developers
which do both that's also an alternative
but it always depends on the degree of
well how far you want to dive into
something you probably have to pick a
side at some point but that's okay it's
still worth it to understand the basics
of two sides of both sides no matter
which role you want to take and they're
all it's the only way to allow you to
find out what you like the most if
you're just starting off when I started
off I had a look at both sides I started
off with PHP now PHP is still very
popular but not the coolest kid in town
anymore there would be no js' right now
still that doesn't mean that you
shouldn't learn PHP anymore that's just
how it has evolved but still it's
important for you to find out what you
like and of course it's also important
for you to find out what you want if you
want to become a freelancer maybe you
should pick a language which offers you
the broadest client base or you take a
niche so that you haven't got as many
potential clients but yours got less our
freelancers competing with you so these
are all choices you have to make you
want to get a job as an employed
developer you of course should think
about where do I want to work in which
area in which company and which type of
developer do they need these are all
little choices but again if you're
starting off getting a broad vision and
idea of what's available in how it works
is key and super important and once you
made the decision on what you want to
focus on it becomes easier to understand
how all these things relate and which
framework you should learn as the next
step because you will know what your
next goals and steps are and then it's
already less intimidating then if you
look at the whole picture at the start
speaking about that whole picture thus
far I talked about front-end HTML
Javascript CSS and the backend PHP and
so on now the image on the beginning
showed way more logos and it wasn't
actually close to being complete
the next step you will probably make at
some point of time once you learn the
basics and once you've made your
decision what you type into next is to
dive into some libraries and frameworks
for both front-end and back-end
depending on what you want to focus on
or if you are a full stack developer
obviously both so what are libraries and
frameworks then here are some examples
and as always there are tons and tons
and tons of additional libraries and
frameworks now in general a library is a
package a third party package so it's
some packaged code which is distributed
which was created by someone which gives
you some utility functions which focuses
on solving a single problem or just a
small subset of problems for example
jQuery is a library it gives you your
totally functions for working with the
Dom for sending Ajax requests for all
these things react is a library react
gives you utility functions for also
working with the Dom but in a different
way then jQuery dusters react actually
is a special case because it quickly
enters the framework world to which I'll
come back in a second once you add more
packages to it now our libraries would
be rxjs which adds utility functions
when it comes to observables and these
are all JavaScript libraries that talked
about of course there are libraries for
every programming languages some deal
with handling dates better some deal
with converting text or creating safe
passwords libraries have one goal they
take common tests and capsulate them and
give you a function to make it really
simple you can call which then spits out
the desired result so that you don't
have to worry about writing that code on
your own of course the trade-off is that
you have less possibilities of
customizing that solution that you have
the danger of running insecure code if
you don't closely analyzed the DES
plug-in or the library and of course
that you might all have some overhead if
you have a you total
that adds some useful functions and you
only need one of these functions then
you might still import the code for the
other functions too hence you increase
your code base which means you have to
ship more code to your end user which
can be a disadvantage still libraries
are very popular because they make a lot
of things easier and it's always about
making that trade-off in thinking about
it now what are frameworks tent
frameworks and libraries you can really
have a philosophical discussion about
this a framework is basically more than
a library it offers more utility and
besides that it offers a clear set of
rules on how to have how you have to
build your app or a certain part of your
app for example angular and view our
JavaScript frameworks they give you the
full toolset of a router to parse URLs
and load different pages they give you
state management features so that you
can easier manage the application state
and they give you clear rules on how you
have to use these packages frameworks
therefore typically make it easier for
you as a developer to build applications
because you get a lot of utility things
you get clear rules you have less things
you can mess up to put it in simple
words now frameworks may also introduce
new things you can't mess up though and
frameworks obviously bear the danger of
adding a lot of overhead if you had
danger of importing some functions you
don't need when pulling in a library
while that danger multiplies if you have
a whole framework still frameworks like
angular view or react together with
redux and router are very popular these
days because they make one or they do
one important thing they allow you as a
developer to easily build amazing fast
web applications and focus on the core
business logic and these are all just
front-end frameworks we also have server
side frame frameworks of course like
laravel which is a PHP framework letter
wall takes vanilla PHP and pull up on it
giving you a clear way of how you build
PHP MVC applications how you structure
them giving you a lot of utility and
therefore making it easier for you to
build PHP applications expressjs would
be the same for node.js gives you a lot
of utility and some clear rules on how
you may use it how you may build your
node.js application to make that easier
so making things easier for the
developer always is the goal of
frameworks and libraries they come at a
trade-off but they often also allow you
to build things you wouldn't have been
able to build before or which you might
have built in a very inefficient way or
which you might have bought in an
insecure way because as most frameworks
are all the open source they constantly
wolf they become better they are written
in clean and efficient code these are
all good reasons why you wanna pick a
framework add library and these are the
reasons why you want to dive into
libraries and frameworks once you
mastered and understood the basics one
common mistake I see people make though
is that they start off their learning
experience with a library or a framework
and I don't think that's a super good
idea because you never fully understand
the basics you're building a pond you
quickly are lost if your framework or
library doesn't solve a certain problem
for you because you don't know how to
solve it on your own this is something
you should avoid you should always
understand the basics you're building a
pond you should understand how
JavaScript works and how you write
vanilla JavaScript code and sometimes
you might then also be able to make the
decision that you don't need a library
or don't need a framework for a given
problem because the basics are enough so
these are all things you should keep in
mind still diving into frameworks and
libraries is a good next step but don't
do it as your first step and therefore
don't be overwhelmed by the fact that
you've got a lot of libraries and
frameworks learn the basics first and
then think about problems you want to
solve and you will then find the right
framework or library by digging through
their documentation reading through
Stack Overflow
reading through blog posts and finding
out which library or framework solves a
certain problem for you now that was a
lot of talking about libraries and
frameworks we also have to think about
users were targeting the platform's were
targeting frameworks libraries allow us
to solve problems and build in the best
case better applications however the
kind of applications we will also
depends on the target platform we're
building it forward and there we of
course have different browsers we can
target and we also have mobile versus
desktop which is a huge change we
experienced over the last years on
desktop we have vast amounts of power at
our disposal disposal we get a typically
good internet connection and we got an
abundance of space on the screen on
mobile it's the total opposite CPU power
is becoming better but still worse than
on most desktop machines the space we
have available is much smaller and even
worse than that highly unpredictable we
don't know if the user is going to use
our page on landscape mode or portrait
on a tablet on a phablet on a big smart
phone a small smart phone we don't know
these things
and we also might have very bad internet
connections so mobile where's this
desktop that changed a lot and then we
got different browsers and we can't
force our users to use the browser we
want them to use especially in companies
traditional older companies a lot of
people are stuck to older versions of
Internet Explorer now for some web apps
you might be able to ignore these
because they're not your target user
base before our web apps they might be
the core user base so that's what I mean
with think about the target platform
you're building for if you are
essentially building app for big
companies and I don't mean tech
companies but older companies like BMW
or stuff like that then chances are you
need to support older browsers and your
main focus might be on desktop on the
other hand
if you're building the next tinder clone
the next Instagram clone well then it's
typically a mobile focused user base
it's typically using Safari or Chrome
because these are the default browsers
on mobile devices and you've got a
different set off of rules you have to
keep in mind when building your
application so it's always important to
understand what am i building for so
that you're able to understand which
features may I use because the features
I can add to my web app of course depend
on the target browser but also on the
target device if you ship a lot of code
down the wire because you have a
super-big framework and thousands of
libraries it's not that good on a mobile
device you want to keep your codebase
small there these are all things which
make it extremely challenging to develop
great web applications and I'll be super
honest here the journey there never
stops there's always something new to
learn when it comes to optimizing your
code writing leaner code writing code
which works on more browsers and so on
and that doesn't become easier at the
current rate of innovation we have in
web browsers we get more and more cool
features we can use every day but we
always have to keep in mind
hey these features don't run everywhere
we always have to make that decision
which feature do we want to implement do
we have a fitting fallback and how can
we implement it without having our file
size explode that is probably one of the
most challenging parts in web
development focusing on your audience
and making the decision which technology
to use how to optimize it and so on and
as I mentioned this is a part where the
learning never stops and where you
constantly have to stay motivated to
stay up-to-date and to keep on learning
now when we talk about targeting
different browsers and audiences and
devices a very important part is that we
actually build our code in a way that
automatically optimized
is it for us so that we as a developer
have a convenient way of building our
app and still ship code that runs on as
many devices as possible and for that I
got this last section of technologies I
want to talk about build tools and
productivity tools now these are for
example web pack babel sass there's way
more than that obviously as always and
to go of these tools is that we never
ship them to the user they only run on
our local machine whilst we are building
the app these tools transform for
example CSS so that we can use a nicer
CSS syntax and still ship normal CSS at
the end these tools can bundle our many
JavaScript files into just a view they
can make sure we can load them lazily
which means when we need them they can
optimize our JavaScript and CSS code
they can allow us to write JavaScript
with next generation JavaScript features
all these things are handled by such
build and productivity tools and it can
also become overwhelming to understand
which tool to use when this is probably
the reason why we see a lot of CL eyes
command-line interfaces coming up these
days we got one for angular for view for
react essentially so for all these major
frameworks we got tools that generate a
project for us a project which already
uses a lot of these productivity tools
so the good thing is you and often often
times I don't even have to learn these
tools you can get a working project
out-of-the-box and if it isn't your job
in your company to really build up your
own workflow or squeeze out the last bit
of performance you might never need to
dive deeply into these tools it might
still be worth to pick up some basic
knowledge on them so that you understand
what's happening but that definitely
shouldn't be your number one thing to
learn again learn the basics first then
maybe dive into a library or framework
think about your audience to understand
how to choose the right library or
framework and the right feature you want
to use then also use productivity tools
if possible in pre-built projects
possibly generated by a CLI to work on
your projects and then optionally dive
deeper into these productivity tools to
understand what they do and to tweak
them to your needs and with that you
might still feel like this is so much
and it is there is a lot of things there
are a lot of things you can learn when
being a web developer but make it easier
for you
start with T things I outlined in the
order I outlined and then optionally
dive into some of the advanced features
stay up to date keep yourself up to date
about what's happening in the web space
but don't feel too pressured to always
adopt a new feature as one of the first
people because chances are you would be
the only one and this can be an
advantage sometimes but also it doesn't
have to be and it can't just lead to
unlimited pressure instead stay up to
date it but also stay focused learn the
basics keep on learning and eventually
you will reach that point where it's
easier to learn new things to see how
they fit in a bigger picture and you
build web applications that use all
these different tools libraries and
frameworks and you know why you use them
so I hope this video which was mainly me
talking about it was a bit helpful
what's something new I want to try out
because I get this question a lot what
should I learn next what is X Y set so I
hope I could help with that video
definitely share your opinion in the
comments can't wait to read them bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
