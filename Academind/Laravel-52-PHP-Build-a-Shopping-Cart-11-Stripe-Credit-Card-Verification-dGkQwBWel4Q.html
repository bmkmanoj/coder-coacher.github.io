I left with the checkered form being
created and while telling you you might
try implementing stripe on your own now
no matter if you were successful or not
let's do it together now I'm back on the
stripe page here in the documentation
but I also signed in to stripe on the
new another tab so make an account
create an account and sign in make sure
to leave your environment appear being
set to test which basically allows you
to route well send test charges which
won't cost you anything
of course you don't learn anything too
and which also allows you to use any
credit card numbers as long as they have
the right amount of digits but you don't
have to use real credit card data and
that of course is great for testing so
as you see I already did some test
charges here but overall this is a
pretty new account and one important
thing is on this dashboard here here on
this stripe back-end what you want to
have a look at is if you go to your
account and then to account settings you
will have this API is key link here and
here you will see the test Keys which
you will need you also see the live keys
which are blurred out on my machine here
but the test keys are the ones you will
need to place in your JavaScript code
later on the publishable key which you
will need in your JavaScript code in
order to well connect to stripe there
but since everyone will be able to see
this key while this of course is not
secret this is ok of our people see that
key this test secret key which alt is
blurred out here however has to be
secret and will later on be stored in
your PHP code which runs on the server
and therefore is not visible to everyone
this will be the key which finally is
required to make a charge and to make
sure that well not anyone having access
to this key is able to charge well any
credit card he found or anything like
that so you will work with those two
keys and we'll come back to that when we
use them just so that you know where to
find them it's in the your account
settings here so this is the account but
back to the documentation for now as I
already explained in the last video we
have this cue step process where we
first verify the credit card data and so
on with JavaScript and we will send the
request to the stripe servers at the
stripe servers will hopefully tell us
that the data is valid and it will give
us back a token which we then send to
our own level PHP code and with that
token we can then issue a charge or make
a charge but we do that from our PHP
code not for JavaScript because with the
PHP code we will send this secret key
and basically then tell stripe to not
only verify the data but use that
verified data to make a charge so I hope
that is clear how all that works
together now in order to do all that I
navigated to the API libraries arm web
page here on the stripe documentation
and you will find how to implement it on
well all the different server-side
languages including PHP well as you see
it's all about adding this single line
to composer so let's do this I will copy
it head over to my project and then in
the composer dot JSON file here in the
require field here where I basically set
up which packages I require or which I
need in this application I will add the
line I just copied so I need to each
stripe SDK basically now with that I not
only need to well added here I also need
to install it so I will open up my
terminal navigate into this folder which
this automatically did and then I will
run composer update or a composer
install which will basically just update
this version here notice we'll take a
couple of seconds so I'll be back once
this is finished so it's almost finished
here or now it is finished don't worry
if like your it updated a couple of
packages that simple just because I use
the update command but it should still
work it also installed the stripe
package though which of course is what I
needed so with that I have access to be
stripe SDK on the PHP code but I also as
I just said before need to implement
each stripe JavaScript package in order
to have this first step of validating
the user input so let's go back to the
stripe documentation and click on stripe
is where just is front and related
package you will need now here you will
see that we have to include it like this
so I will copy this import here which
leads to a CDN you don't have to
download anything then head over to your
code and then you check out the plated
PHP file at the very bottom after
closing the content section and it will
close my terminal hero since I don't
need it anymore after this section here
I want to enter a new section scripts
and I'll close it here too now if we
have a look at our layout our master
layout you see we have this script hook
here which allows me to add some script
imports to individual pages like you
check out page here so inside of this
scripts section here I will I'll throw
in this import I just grabbed from the
stripe documentation and with that I
have access to the stripe SDK now of
course that isn't enough I need to write
my own JavaScript code to now basically
fetch all the information from this form
and then send it to the stripe server to
validate it now in order to do this I
will go into my public source folder or
create a new folder here which you'll
name js4 javascript and add a new
javascript file and i will name it check
out dot j s and the name of course is up
to you back and you check out later PHP
file after importing these stripe SDK
deist
JavaScript SDK here I will just add a
new import here I will use my templating
syntax then URL helper and the to method
to get a clear and correct link or URL
to my chela script files no matter on
which page of my application I am so
here I want to enter a source /j s dot
check out chess because keep in mind
this path here has always to be seen
from the public folder
not from this resources folder because
in the end on a server your view will be
rendered in the public folder kind of so
therefore it is the deep office source
chess check out chess now of course I'm
not doing anything and it fall yet but
it will show shortly so what do I want
to do here well let's go back to the
stripe documentation it tells me that I
first should set my publishable key this
one here now I need to set the scale by
the way the documentation is really
clever this key here should already be
the correct key here so as it says here
we prefilled this example with your test
API key so therefore this is already the
line you may copy if you are locked in
so I will copy the line and throw it
into my check out file now why do I need
this key well in order to kind of
identify with the stripe servers Santa
credit card data and then they will give
me a token which takes this key into
accounts kind of an encrypted version of
that if you want to put it like this and
later I can use this token on my PHP
code or in my PHP code to make a charge
there I will connect it with my secret
key and with this combination of token
based on this public key and my secret
key well stripe can be sure that nothing
fishy is going on that and that instead
the page and the user who validated the
credit card info is also the one making
the purchase and that were not well kind
of using some cross
it's scripting attacks or anything like
that so therefore we need this
publishable key to make this transaction
secure next as the documentation tells
me I need to collect the card details
here now as you can see they use jQuery
here and I will just copy this code and
also throw it into my file here now that
would work like this though because
right now this would get executed
immediately as soon as this files loaded
which of course happens as soon as this
page here is loaded and that is not
really the behavior I want because if I
would do it like that well then it would
be submitted before a user hit submit
before the user actually click this
button therefore I will go back to the
checkout page and I want to add an event
listener listening to listening to this
form submission and then as I said in
the last video stop the form submission
instead execute this code make sure that
this code is well run that the credit
card number is validated and once we got
an answer from stripe then I want to
continue with the form submission so
that's how the process should look like
and that's how I will set it up here but
first let's make sure that all these IDs
here or all these values we use here are
actually correct and I can already tell
you they are not because in the Striped
as example here we're using class names
however in my view I'm using IDs not
class names so I need to adjust that and
I will adjust it right now so the number
actually has an ID of card number but I
need a hash tag since it is an ID the
CVC code is also hash tag card CBC
expiration month is hash check card
expiry month and again just check out
the ID names being set up here in this
form right just using these the
expiration here is hash tag card expiry
year so well using IDs all over the
place and the address here is not
something we need I won't submit this
here but I will submit the name let's
say
so dollar sign hashtag whoops should be
a string though
hashtag card name of course all the used
eval function here which is a jQuery
function right to get the value of this
input field so that's the information I
will submit and then this will be the
callback being executed once we get back
well an answer from stripe now we don't
have to call back yet and we don't have
this form submission interruption I was
talking of earlier so let's implement
both I will create a new very little
which I will call Doris I'm form but
name of course up to you and I will
serve or well I will select it by ID the
checkout form keep in mind that ste ID I
assign to the overall form here the form
tag so that I'm fetching this overall
form and then I want to use my form here
use the submit method which is just a
jQuery method right this is just a
shortcut to create a on submit went
listener and with the submit method I
will pass a callback or an anonymous
function which should get executed
whenever the user submits the form where
it will pass the form submission event
and now inside here is the place where I
want to execute this stripe code now I
also want to show potential errors
happening throughout this submission
process therefore I will go back to my
shopping cart or to my checkout view
here and right before opening the form
after the total I will add a div which
will give an ID of let's say charge
error which should get a class of alert
alert danger these are just bootstrap
classes I will also add a conditional
class using template expression here to
check if my session does not have
an error
well object or field inside it so if you
don't have an error then I want to add
the hidden class which basically well
will hide this div otherwise I want to
show it and I won't attach an extra
class so all the doing here is just hide
if if I don't have an error because then
of course don't want to show this error
page here now then if we do have an
error then I want to output it here so
session get error like this now I could
show arrows here but I also need to set
them right so back in the check out dot
J's file when submitting the form I want
you take my charge error remember I
assigned this as an ID here charge error
so I'm selecting it with jQuery here and
I want to add a class hidden so I'm
hiding all errors whenever I submit the
form because at this point there can't
be any errors
so it's certainly right to attach this
class then I want to find the button
which submits the form and I want to set
it to being disabled and I'm just using
jQuery code here if you're not familiar
with that that's nothing have a look at
some jQuery tutorials I want to disable
the button because I don't want the user
to hit on it or to click it multiple
times because I'm already sending data
to stripe and I don't want to send it
over and over again that could mess up
the application
therefore I'm disabling the button for
the time it needs for strive to answer
after all that I will just return false
and this is important because this means
once all this code is executed so we
sent the request to stripe and we're
waiting for the response in which case
you would execute the stripe response
handler which we have yet to create well
we execute all that killed but then we
return false which means ok we're done
don't continue with the form submission
because remember we're in the form
submit event
here that is important because otherwise
now we would send a post request to
level and I don't want to do that right
now because right now I haven't
validated to form yet remember this is
an asynchronous task here the response
might not be there yet so I don't want
to continue with the charge because I
haven't validated the credit-card
information yet that is why I returned
false and just tell my code the browser
okay wait a second don't continue a form
submission I'm well we don't need to do
anything here well the place where we do
need to do things is of course the
stripe response handler so I will create
it Russ stripe response Handler and this
handler actually takes two arguments a
status and response now in here I will
check if we do have a response error so
if something went wrong and if that is
the case I want to show the error of
course so then I would will basically
select my charge error like up here T if
I want to show any errors in I would
remove the hidden clause because now I
want to show it and instead I would well
set the text to show my response error
message this is an error message being
sent by stripe by the way this year so
now I would display my error and then I
also want to enable the button of course
because now I'm done I got my response I
know that well we got an error but I
want to enable the user to submit the
form again to fix this error right so
therefore I'm enabling the button again
if we don't have an error though well
then I will be in the else block here
and I know that the while validation was
successful and that stripe will have
sent be a token so I will store this
token in a token variable and I can
access it on the ID field and a response
how do I know that well
if you have a look at the documentation
you see this example response handler
down here and this is what they are
doing here they are getting the top gear
from response ID now I also need to
append this token to my form and I will
just copy their kill here copy both
lines actually to make sure that this
new token is now added to D while HTML
code to the dom as a hidden input field
so let's check apply PHP file will
receive another hidden input field at
the end of the form which holds this
stripe token which again we need to send
to the server to level two there
send it to stripe again when we actually
make the charge we didn't charge yet we
just validated the data so therefore now
I'm sending this token or I'm pending it
so that I can send it and with this last
line here I'm actually submitting the
form
so with get zero I basically just get
the form and with submit I will submit
it because now I do want to send the
post request now I don't want to capture
it with JavaScript now I basically let
the request continue before I stopped it
and I threw in JavaScript and strive to
validate the data now that the data is
validated I want to continue and submit
the form to the server which I do with
this line with that all these stripe
front-end related things are set up and
we should be able to work with this
however to saw this should be slash a
hashtag charge arrow here as should it
be down here little mistake on my side
because I'm selecting by ID here so with
that I'm ready to submit data to strive
to validate it but of course I don't
have any code in place to actually well
send it on the PHP side and make charge
so this will be what we're working on
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
