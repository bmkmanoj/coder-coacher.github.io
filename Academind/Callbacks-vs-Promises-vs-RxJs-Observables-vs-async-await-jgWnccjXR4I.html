on board
my name is Maximilian and in this video
I want to dive into a super important
topic in JavaScript development handling
asynchronous operations with callbacks
promises rxjs or async await when should
we use which tool and how do they
actually differ we'll take a closer look
at these questions in this video
so handling asynchronous operations is a
super important task in JavaScript
you're probably going to write or treat
any application which doesn't use some
asynchronous operation now JavaScript
offers you different ways of handling
asynchronous operations because by
default JavaScript of course is
synchronous executes one line of code
after the other and therefore you need
certain approaches or tools to handle
these asynchronous cases I actually did
a write an article about that too so if
you're more like a reading guy or you
want to read after watching this video
check out this article where I will dive
into the main or the major approaches
offered by JavaScript and outline how
they work and how they differ and when
you might want to choose which of course
I'm also going to take a look at this
question in this article so let's do
this right now for that I created four
examples you can find links in the video
description and I want to start with
callbacks the whole list or simplest way
of handling asynchronous code in
JavaScript now here on the left you see
my JavaScript code on the right you see
a button let's click the button first if
you wanted s click 'add its first
checking authentication fetching a user
and then displaying the user the user
named max my name okay
so what's happening here well in the
code up first of all get access to the
button and then to the div where I want
to render that username nothing
asynchronous thus far then I have three
functions here I'm using arrow functions
the es6 feature but in the end it's just
functions the first one is just a helper
function which will render the text 1
the user name basically could use it for
any text once I got it so here I'm just
accessing text content of the day if I
fetched and output some text then check
off is just a faking asynchronous
function where I use a timeout over Q
seconds q then do something to which
I'll come back and I also call set text
to display checking off here instead of
the username once I am checking the off
now of course in a real application you
would probably reach out to a server
here for example to verify if some token
is valid if user is logged in and here
I'm just faking
that we have to wait for the actual
response whoever it is true or false I'm
doing this what set at the time out as
mentioned the same for fetch user here
I'm always updating the text and then I
use a timeout
to fake the fetching of a user now you
probably already see this CB failure
which I call inside the timeout so once
the timer finished and that is the
argument these arrow functions receive
here so CV is just the argument passed
to the function that leads us to the
question what is the argument and who's
calling these functions the argument
obviously is a function itself because
we execute it like a function passing an
argument to the function then this case
we're executing CB and pass through here
we execute CB and pass a JavaScript
object and the one calling CB is inside
here the event listener on the button
here I call check off then I pass a
function that's just another arrow
function here to check off that's super
important I'm passing an anonymous
function here Q check off and remember
check off did require a function C be
called here you can of course rename the
argument here so I'm passing a function
to check off which check off will
execute once the timer completed and it
will then pass true Q that function is
got as an argument
so basically keep that function of the
argument of that anonymous function will
be true in the end because I pass
through to the function pass to check
off that this anonymous function so this
anonymous function gets called whenever
this timer and check off is done and
then we pass true as an argument to that
function so off will be true and the
next time I do check that and this is
already asynchronous here this code
inside this anonymous function will only
run once the timer completed because
what we do here is we tell JavaScript
hey please don't stop X
fusion it wouldn't do that anyways but
be aware that whenever the timer is done
you should execute this function your
dis anonymous function which then in
turn executes call back true that is
what we tell JavaScript be aware that
you have to do this in the future once
the timer is done so this code here only
runs once it is done once the timer
completed then we checked off the value
the timer gave us and then we execute
another function fetch user so that's
this function here that's user and it
works in the same way we passed an
anonymous function to fetch user this
error function here where we expect to
get a user then and this anonymous
function is now executed inside the
timer of fetch user after two seconds we
execute what fetch user received our
anonymous function we execute it and
pass an object to that function so a
user here will be that JavaScript object
well and then we simply call set text in
there so check off is executed and the
anonymous function for check off will
run after two seconds
so after this timer of check off and
then inside of that code which runs
after two seconds we reach out to
another function which uses a timer so
that after a total of 4 seconds we will
run this code two seconds from check off
in two seconds from inside here from
that user timer and this is what happens
here we click fetch user checking off
for two seconds fetching the user for
two seconds and then seeing the user
these are callbacks and on the first
look there's nothing wrong with that
right we use callbacks looks like a good
solution to that we tell JavaScript to
do something at a later point of time so
that it can continue executing the rest
of the code and then just execute dev
coded remembered once it needs to be
executed the issue is something we can
already see here we're nesting all these
callbacks imagine we would not output
the text in that fetch user but then do
something else
call some sir
that function which transforms the user
then we would have transformed user this
function doesn't exist here but we could
have that and there we would pass not
recall that function where we get the
transformed user back which you can then
handle in there so handle transformed
user and you can already see where this
is leading to you we got a lot of
nesting going on and this is actually
called callback hell because you add
more and more callbacks and it gets
super hard to mention to understand
error handling becomes a pain because if
you handle an error inside a callback
you probably want to call another
callback and that's no fun
hence Java Script gave us a solution to
that with es6 or already earlier if you
used some third-party libraries promises
the general setup here is the same I
still fetch get access to the button and
to the depth and as you can see if I
click this it works the same as before
checking all fetching user outputting
the username but the code inside check
off and fetch user changed here I'm not
calling some callback anymore you can
see these functions don't receive an
argument anymore
instead I'm returning a new promise and
promises are a construct a class
introduced by es6 promises as their name
suggests our classes which promise a
certain value in the future so they're
also a tool for handling asynchronous
code in this case here the promise or
always a promise if you create one on
your own and as a side note oftentimes
you don't create promises on your own
but you use some third-party library
like axioms for making HTTP requests
which will automatically give you a
promise but here we're creating it on
our own we created on your own recalling
new promise and to the promise
constructor I passed an anonymous
function which gets two arguments result
and reject these are actual functions
you can execute inside that anonymous
function here and here and then is again
creating a counter a timer inside my
promise anonymous function
and after the two seconds I call the
result function here which will
basically inform JavaScript this promise
is done we got a value and this is
something you need to do in the promise
man because you do promise a value you
could also call reject to throw an error
but here I'm just using result and then
we result true at the same for the user
here I resolve my JavaScript object
now first look you might say well that
doesn't look that much easier than for
cold X now but again keep in mind
oftentimes you're not the one creating
these promises oftentimes you will use
some library which already gives you
promises the interesting part comes if
we have a look at how we can use
promises down here this is much cleaner
code we listen to the click and then
inside this click handler we call check
off and then we don't pass any function
to check off which gets nested but we
simply call then change to the check off
call now then takes an anonymous
function where we handle this value we
get back from the promise so true in the
case of check off that gets stored here
that gets automatically passed as an
argument and then I simply return a new
function call return fetch user calling
that second function which all returns a
promise keep that in mind now here we're
returning this and in the past we would
then kind of like ever use a call back
in there or with promises you could
think you've now called then their cue
but the cool thing is if you return a
promise inside of then block you can
simply chain another event block after
the first one so you never have this
deep nesting of callbacks or anything
like that you simply have then after
then after then until you're done
like here that's the last then block we
then get a user which we output so if
you got deeper layers of nesting
promises are great because you never get
the same behavior there you just have
then after then after then and it's also
easier to handle errors you could read
more about that in the article I
mentioned at the beginning of the video
so that promises already a great tool do
we need more well there is another
construct named rxjs which gives us
observables
now our XJS observables are not a native
javascript features like promises are
but they are made available through a
third-party library rxjs is the name of
the library same code as before here
when it comes to getting access to the
Dom but then check off and fetch user do
something else something different they
return and observable basically it looks
at bit similar to the promise we create
something here and then we pass a
function to what we created and in there
we call set timeout and object to
seconds we call in this case the
observer and the next function but
that's kind of like resolve for the
promise we basically emit a new value a
core distinction between promises
observables is that promises handle one
value you send the HTTP request you get
a response you resolve your promise
you're done for observable that's
different
you can handle streams of data there you
can wrap and observable around a click
listener you listen to every new click
and emit a new value on every new click
that's not possible like this with
promises here again we're just setting
up our simple observables and then down
there you see this wrapping around an
event in the past we used add event
listener on the button here I'm using an
observable method to create a new
observable from an event an event on the
button the click event and then here
we're using something the rxjs library
offers so called operators and there are
loads of operators
made available I actually do have rxjs
series on this channel in case you want
to dive deeper these operators are great
though because you simply chain them
after each other so likely then calls
for a promise here in this case switch
map basically handles the first
asynchronous value which comes from this
click event so we get to click event
and let me call check off and that's
just a short es6 arrow function keep in
mind that this in the end returns check
off that's important to know so we
return whatever check off gives us and
check off just gives us an average
servable we call another switch map
which will just take the last observable
so the one return if I check off it Maps
it into a new one in this case the one
we get from fetch user so we use the
value from check off and return a new
observable and in the end that that is
something you have to do in every
observable you have to subscribe once
your chain ends so what you want to do
after you went through all your
observables in this case we subscribe we
know that we will get a user in the end
that's just what scheduled gets returned
back that user and we can output it here
and hence if we click this we get the
same behavior as before but now using
rxjs and rxjs can be a little bit more
complicated to learn although due to the
many operators that offers but being
able to handle streams of data again not
that easy with promises and having all
these operators which can be complicated
I'll give you that but which also offer
use so much possibilities and
opportunities to work with your data
streams these are two arguments really
in strong favor of rxjs and personally I
can only recommend trying out rxjs
observables and working with them they
can really enhance your project quite a
lot on the other hand it's of course not
the perfect solution for every project
if you guys very simple asynchronous
operations you don't need to handle data
streams and you don't need all these
operators it doesn't add that much value
to your app to bring in the rxjs library
which of course will also increase your
final bundle size that's something you
have to keep in mind it's not a native
JavaScript feature so it will add to
your bundle size but if you are working
with data streams or if you do will see
that these operators add some benefits
definitely check out observables so
observables are awesome and promises are
good alternative what else do we have
then I think a wait that's a new feature
coming with JavaScript es8 still you can
already use it with some transpilers
like babel for example and adding some
polyfills probably here we get the same
starting set up and then we return
promises just like in the promises
example the code up here for check off
and fetch user is exactly identical
because async await just uses promises
behind the scenes that's super port to
keep in mind async await uses promises
it's not a yet another alternative it
uses promises it gives you a different
way of handling these promises once they
resolve or reject though let's scroll
down here we have our event listener and
if you check this code
it looks very synchronous doesn't it we
create a constant we initialize a user
variable with the if check where we set
the user variable and then we set text
this looks like synchronous code one
command running after the other there is
no nesting with callbacks no then calls
and no subscribe calls from rxjs there
are cue important keywords though async
and a weight async has to go in front of
your function definition so here we're
defining and passing an asynchronous
function excuse me an anonymous function
just a normal anonymous arrow function
and we turn it into an asynchronous
function by adding the async keyword in
front of it now to JavaScript this will
signal that everything inside that
function may use the await keyword to
pause the JavaScript execution you could
say that is what await does here we
assign a constant and we tell JavaScript
the value of the constant should be what
to check off resolves to what the
promised return fight check off resolves
to
keep in mind I said it two seconds ago
async/await
uses promises and only works with
promises check all pro turns a promise
and we can then wait for this promise to
resolve and JavaScript will basically
wait or behind the scenes use then again
wait for check off to to resolve and
then store it here and only then it will
move on and execute the next code line
that is why you can only use it in
especially marked functions because the
default behavior of JavaScript is a
different one each line gets executed
after the first one and it doesn't wait
for some async operation to finish now
here in such async functions it kind of
does and we signal it for to wait with a
wait the same here for fetch user which
held JavaScript don't execute this line
set text before this operation here is
done and we stores the resolved user in
the user variable here that is why if I
click this button we see the same
behavior as before but now without
calling then or using coal bags or
subscribe a thing away therefore it's a
great tool to write easy-to-understand
code which looks like synchronous code
and therefore definitely a tool you
should keep in mind and you should use
when working with promises and when
working with chains of promises where
you have a lot of then blocks after each
other maybe because you can write very
clean code with async await just be
aware it's always the combination of
async and a weight you can only wait in
async functions now again check out this
article I referenced at the start of the
video if you want to learn more I hope
this video gave you a good overview over
these four tools for handling
asynchronous operations in the video
description you can find more links with
more resources to dive into these
different tools and you learn more about
that if you want to do that I hope you
enjoyed the video see you in future
videos hopefully bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
