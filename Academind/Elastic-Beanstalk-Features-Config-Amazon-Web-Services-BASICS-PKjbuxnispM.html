this video great to have you on board
I already traded a couple of videos
where I showed what AWS is and how we
can use elastic Beanstalk to host an
application a lateral application to be
precise this one year now in this video
I want to take a closer look at what
elastic Beanstalk actually depth behind
the scenes and what we can configure
about our environment what environments
actually are and what we generally can
do in this elastic Beanstalk console so
let's get started
so mainly counsel of my project of this
lateral project I deployed in this video
here that's the right side I hope so
so this video and as you see is running
application it is connected to a
database and we already deployed two
different versions of the application in
that mentioned video now if we start
here on that dashboard of this
environment we're already one level
queue deep into dad application then I
want to be so let's instead switch to
all applications where we see not just
the environment but actually all our
applications and there is a difference
an application in elastic Beanstalk may
contain multiple environments as you can
see on this application
lateral simple block is the application
and we could create more applications
and prod here is the one environment in
this application and we could also
create more environments environments
would be something like a testing
environment a production environment may
be a new version of your app in a new
environment these would be environment
and they run separated from each other
each on their own servers you can simply
create a new environment and then again
you have to go through that wizard where
you set it up and assign a server and so
on you can also use the elastic
Beanstalk CLI at which I won't have a
closer look in this video to do all this
to create new applications and new
environments with that out of the way
let's go back to this environment here
we see the dashboard where you see the
current status of our application the
recent events that are successfully
updated the environment because the
shipped new code which operating system
were actually running and so on we can
deploy new version 2 of the upload and
deploy button we could always use to CLI
to automate this and then we have all
these options on the left now before we
go to configuration let's have a look at
logs here we can actually retrieve our
logs and for that we have to request
them so we can request the last hundred
lines here and logging is set up
automatically for us this however now
fetches the latest logs and now we could
download them and have a look at
so if you click this button we see the
latest log files and you will see what
happened on our server that we had a 400
feet free error there and well whatever
happened on the server these are logs
and certainly something which might be
interesting to you in a real application
where you want to well detect any
anomalies detect any errors stuff like
that we also get the Health section this
shows us the overall health of our
application we can see the kind of
requests we gather the responses we send
and since this applications pretty new
most of that is not populated yet but
here we can monitor what's going on and
we can drill down on that and see how
many instances we have running one and
how that is well feeling right now it's
okay as a side note and I did show this
before in another video you can always
switch to ec2 console I'm doing the same
you tab and here under running instances
this instance is the one connected to
our elastic Beanstalk setup or it's the
one managed through elastic Beanstalk so
this is the one instance we're referring
to here and we can see that here this is
the instance ID and as you will see it's
obviously the same ID as here so that is
the ID and here while we could for
example do something with it like reboot
or terminate it if we wanted so this
page allows to track the health of our
instances and therefore the health of
our application under monitoring we can
see how our our F behaves in some charts
so the CPU utilization and so on
so this is a lot it gives you a nice and
quick overview over what's going on in
your application without looking at the
logs and so on under alarms you see any
alarms you might have gotten you can
configure them under monitoring here
here for example you could set an alarm
on environment health and you could
configure when you want to get an alert
for example at the environment health is
below a certain status for 1 minute or
something like that and you could set up
that you get an email when this happens
also very nice for production
applications managed updates is pretty
you can set it up under configuration so
I will come back to this here on this
page you'll then get an overview and
managed updates will allow you to opt
into managed updates through AWS so that
they update critical software on your
instance automatically for you
which of course is important from a
security perspective now under events
you can see which events we had for
example that we updated the environment
and how that went and under text we can
assign some tags or CD assign tags to be
precise which will show up in our
billing for example so that we can track
where our costs are coming from these
are all these options now let's have a
look at configuration that's probably
the most interesting one well here for
example to go from start to end we have
scaling if we open this we see that
right now we have a single instance
scaling and that is because we only have
one instance now of course as your
application grows you might want to have
more instances here which distribute the
load
you could then switch to load balancing
is auto scaling and there you could then
USB built-in tools load balancer and
auto scaling these are services provided
by AWS which will distribute incoming
traffic evenly amongst all your
instances and which even allow you to
spin up new instances to handle certain
traffic spikes and remove them once
they're not needed anymore so that's
really powerful I'll go back to a single
instance but this is something you
definitely want to look into once your
application grows and you need more
servers back to single instance you can
all choose in whichever lab dalek you
zone you want to launch new instances
however I will leave this at the minimum
and for now we only have that one
instance that leads us to the instances
here you can see which type of instance
were using and we could change this to
upgrade our application to a weld pool
more powerful instance for example we
can also see which security group this
instance belongs to security groups are
basically firewalls you could say which
allow or which control which traffic may
reach our instances and which traffic
may leave our instances
here we can set up easy to keep air
which you'll need if we manually want to
connect to the instance through SSH then
we will need this key pair to identify
ourselves and set up our encrypted
access to the key or to the ec2 instance
the instance profile here that is one
will we can't change anything here this
is required by elastic Beanstalk we have
to write permissions to manage the
instance for you it was created
automatically and it basically allows
elastic Beanstalk to spin up incentives
terminate em and so on so what it needs
to do behind the scenes for us how often
should monitor the health of the
instances which ami it uses to which
image this defines the operating system
and software installed on that instance
and then here we can also setup which
kind of volume you want to have like
your the default we could attach an SSD
and define how much space you want to
have so here we can control the server
we're running on and again we can't
after it here vertically choose a
stronger instance or we go back to
scaling and switch from single instance
to load balancing all scaling to launch
multiple instances so when we do that
and click apply and this will now update
our application and as it informs us
replace all our current instances so
let's click Save be aware that switching
from one to multiple instances may occur
cost especially if you leave it run for
a whole month because you only have one
month where 750 hours which is one month
in hours per month of the t2 micro
instance is available so if you spend up
two of them you're going to pay for one
of them if you spend up more powerful
ones you're going to pay more so be
aware of that still I'm going to show
this to you now this may take a couple
of minutes here actually since it's
switching your complete environment and
in the ec2 management console you should
see that from some point on it will
terminate this instance and spin up a
new one
now I did finish and if we go get back
to configuration we see that now under
scaling we can configure more we can
configure all the scaling and here we
can set up how many instances servers we
want to have at a minimum and at a
maximum and also in which availability
zones we want to launch them this now
allows AWS to automatically scale our
instances of add new servers on which
our application will run whenever we hit
a traffic spike for example the scaling
trigger is set up here and there it
configures upon which condition it will
add new servers and how long that
condition has to be true that is a
powerful tool since it allows you to
really react to traffic spikes it's also
a kind of advanced tool not in terms of
setting it up that's what there was easy
but in terms of getting it right for big
applications and I just want to give you
a sneak preview here for your ordinary
normal application the default setup
will should be absolutely fine for
bigger applications though if that is
how our traffic works over a day over 24
hours for example then we could have a
default setup of this we have a constant
amount of service we have no auto
scaling and we have only one server up
but this server is constantly a very
relatively strong server now the problem
with this approach is that we will face
server issues during these spikes
because the server capacity doesn't
suffice so an alternative might be to
set up auto scaling with twice the
amount so now if we have Q's servers up
in each hour here and that is an app
capacity for all the spikes of course
all's a lot of wasted or overhead
capacity so we're paying too much a
better solution would be to use auto
scaling and there we bring up additional
servers when we need to handle these
spikes much better already
but still as you can see there is a lot
of overhead or at least a bit of
overhead so we can do better so the
perfect approach would be to calibrate
all the scaling to launch smaller
instances not such powerful ones
but more of these however in the long
term are overall it will still be
cheaper because the powerful ones are
more expensive and we don't require them
for most of the time so this might be a
perfect auto-scaling setup where we
scale up to four of the not so powerful
instances and we really calibrate our
application to handle these traffic
spikes now that is quite advanced but
that is how all the scaling works
it adds new servers to handle incoming
traffic spikes and it is a lot about
really testing that and seeing what is
best from a cost and server perspective
that was a little advanced topic let's
go back to elastic beanstalk auto
scaling is set up that is what we can
take away from that and not just all the
scaling also load balancing because load
balancing is the other interesting thing
in that equation we might have more than
one instance we are free now all these
instances are doing something so one
instance might not be so much under
stress another one might be very
stressed and might be close to well
being overloaded with an incoming
request and this request might do to our
setup whatever hit instance free which
can handle it by which is not the best
instance instead we should handle it
here and that is exactly what load
balancing will take care of with load
balancing we have two instances and we
have a service called elastic load
balancer also added to our elastic
Beanstalk setup here so both elastic but
two different services and this service
elastic load balancer will route
incoming requests cue different
instances depending on their health
their response time to see how occupied
they are so it may route one request to
instance one and a second one to
instance two we can even combine this
with auto-scaling queue add new servers
where needed auto scaling will for this
all the reuse you set up off the
existing servers to copy our set up in
our application and load balancer will
pick these new servers up and all those
forward requests to them so that is how
both works together and you don't have
to manage anything about that it's all
set up here
by elastic beanstalk you can calibrate
it a bit here you can set up your
scaling triggers and to find how many
instances you want to launch and so on
you can still choose which type of
instances that would be here under
instances so these instances will be
launched by the auto scaling and that is
how these two work together and really
make sure that your application works as
it should as you can see if I waited it
it still works as before but under the
hood it now has a more complex setup
that was a lot of talking about all the
scaling and the instances but it is
important to understand what's happening
here and what elastic Beanstalk can do
for you in bigger applications auto
scaling and distribute incoming traffic
amongst all instances you might have
running what about notifications here
you can get notifications you can set up
an email address where you will be
informed about elastic beanstalk events
like if the health transitions to
degrade it or something like that under
software configuration we already saw
that in another video you can define
things about your server basically from
where your web app is served which how
much memory should be allocated how you
want your outputs errors and then some
stuff about logging also very useful of
course updates and deployments is
interesting because here you can
configure how updates so new code should
be shipped to your servers if you have
more than one instance you can actually
choose rolling if you have only ones
that will not be available because what
will Rowling do if you have more than
one instance it will ship new code to
one instance first and then ship it to
the next one so that you all the time
until all instances have been updated
have instances with old code and new
code and hence your application is
always online because it's the old code
or it already was updated if you only
have one instance there's of course a
short window a short time window where
it will be offline because the code is
getting replaced right now rolling can
prevent this if you have multiple
instances there are some Advanced
Options here and you can always learn
more as you can see but that is
basically what you can configure here
now besides the application deployments
you can also change configuration
updates so whenever you change the
configuration of your server and there
you can also set this to rolling for
example and configure how these changes
should be rolled out because just like
your application code if it changes if
you change the configuration even worse
than your application code there may be
a server restart required so that is
something you also want to handle this
is what you can configure here your game
can also configure all the scaling here
but that could be done under scaling so
that's updates and deployment health
here you can determine or you can setup
how elastic load balancer will find out
if your application if your instances
are healthy you can pass your own URL
where it should send a ping and
depending on the ping he'll pass this
ping response and if it responds at all
it will determine if your application is
healthy the default should be fine here
but you can configure elastic load
balancer here a bit more if you are
interested in that finally managed
updates that's also interesting here you
can configure if AWS elastic beanstalk
should update your server your your
software on the server it will not
install breaking changes or breaking
software changes but it can install mine
or attach updates or just patch if you
read just want to get these security
patches so that's a useful feature to
make sure that your application is
always up to date and that you get the
latest security fixes now this will
update the application we can still move
on to the last thing or to the almost
last config item here the data here the
database we did set this up in a
different video
here you can basically change some of
the configurations for example which
kind of database you use you could
upgrade here our things can't be changed
here you can always use RDS to change
things though then you will also well
remove it from from here so it's
preferable that you change it here in
the elastic Beanstalk console to stay in
that elastic Beanstalk world where
elastic Beanstalk manages everything for
you and finally at the bottom on the
network here you can set up how your
application is
served and how it is reachable it is
important for the load balancer here
here you can configure this elastic load
balancer is a bit more can set up how it
determines the instance help and so on
and that is really something where you
can dive in deeper if you know how it
works as always all the default settings
should be fine these are always things
you can change but for a starting
application you don't need you and as
you work more and more with a tell us
you will get deeper into it and know
what you may change and why so this was
an overview over elastic Beanstalk what
you can view here how it works how you
can upgrade from your simple single
instance application to a multi instance
auto scales
load balanced application I hope this
was helpful and you didn't choice and
that with that and the other videos
using AWS and using Beanstalk is a bit
clearer it might look intimidating if
you see all these options but always
keep in mind you can start it simple and
then add more and more features as you
need them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
