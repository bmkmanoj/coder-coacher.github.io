we made sure that we can all delete our
own posts in this video we'll start with
implementing all the functionality we
need to edit posts now I want to add a
post that in a way there and when you
click on add it well unfortunately don't
have a post here ok that if I have a
post let me create one opposed which I
can add it when I click this button I
want to a modal to appear and in this
modal I want to be able to edit it hit
Save Changes and then save the changes
by using Ajax so we'll start with the
modal and over to bootstrap because good
thing is here under JavaScript well we
get a modal and we're just going to use
this so copy this code and obviously you
could always design it all yourself if
you want to I'm just focusing on the
lateral part here so in my dashboard I'm
just copying this at the very bottom and
I'm renaming this you added post the
modal title here and then the rest can
stay we're going to edit the body here
in a second first I wanted you two more
things which I need to do I need to
import JavaScript here for the modal to
work since modal's use JavaScript so I'm
just fetching this bootstrap JavaScript
CDN import here and I'm pasting this in
my master file at the bottom here just
before my body text tag ends here I'm
pasting the bootstrap JavaScript and
we'll also need to check worried
therefore I'm also fetching the link on
a che query website to their CDN
I'm importing them right above wood
strip here good so now we get that set
up and now let's make sure our bootstrap
actual how our modal actually opens so
in my dashboard and once you open the
modal when I click my edit button here
now in order to do this we need to hook
up this edit button with well an event
listener and think the easiest way to do
this is first let me create a new folder
under public source where we store our
wealth public source files called GS
which will hold our JavaScript files and
yeah we'll create my app.js file so n my
appliques file I'll select this button
now how can we select this button well
let's have a look at our Dom I think I'm
going to take that route where I select
my post class here our source articles
these articles were creating then I'll
find the interaction class in it I'll
access all the children which are these
ala and core tag elements here and then
I'll take the four children that will be
drought I'm taking here now you might
use whatever may be better route you
have I'm just going to get this done
quickly here so let me access my posts
or post all my single posts in this case
then I want to find the interaction
class which will hold our anchor tags
there I will find my anchor tag here I
will select o4 child's who equal to z22
the index which begins at 0 and then I
have my on click method here where I
will execute a function and in this
function here well I want to output it
works to just check if well if it works
let me let me reload my page and open up
my dev tools and now I want to click
Edit and I see it works in the consult
great so
it's working and now I want to open my
model here so back my dashboard I should
give my model a class or an ID to be
precise and I will call it ID edit modal
so this would be the ID of my modal and
then I can use jQuery again q
well-selected
added modal and then I can just call the
modal function you saved us
refresh it added great here's our modal
so that is opening last thing I want to
do is I will just well add this textbox
to this modal and I will do this in my
dashboard here again and then here I'm
just creating a new form don't need the
action doing going to do this with
JavaScript anyway and then here I will
create a new form group which is just a
div with the class home group a
bootstrap class I will my label for a
post body and just be added the post and
then I will have my text area element
which will give a name of post body here
whose body don't need columns
it will give it five rows though and
yeah need to add a class before I forget
us so this class should be form control
bootstrap class again to make it look
nice let me reload at it looks good in
the next video were actually filling in
our post content of the post we're
opening here and then we also have to
make sure that we can actually change
and save those changes so see on the
next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
