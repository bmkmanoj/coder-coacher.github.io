a shopping cart with no chess I left it
well this state where we have our
product page and we could add items to
your shopping cart have a look at the
shopping cart see it here CD total sum
we have to pay and well I got this
checkout button which does nothing well
and this in the next videos I want to
change this and I want to make this
checkout button work so that we can
actually pay our items now as before I
will do this step by step and the first
step is I want to add a check out do so
let's say a view which allows me to
insert my personal data my credit card
data so that in the next step I'm able
to actually make a charge on this credit
card now to make a charge I will use
stripe which is basically just a
third-party service you can visit it at
stripe comm which makes payments very
easy and provides convenient API to work
with too easily
well validate credit card data and then
make charges on these credit cards and
you can learn more about stripe on their
web page stripe comm and I will come
back to this page their documentation
ends on later on in the next videos for
now let's start by while building the
view which we see when we click checkout
here back in a project for that well
I'll bring down a console here I will
create a new view in the shop folder
here and I will name it checkout dot HBS
now I already prepared some code which I
pasted in here and of course you will
find the code and the getup repository
which you'll find in the description and
I know there are some of you who don't
really like this he would love to see me
type every single line of this markup
but there are also a lot of viewers who
say and I'm kind of leaning on their
side who say that they don't want to see
me type while what it says 60 lines of
HTML code since this isn't really that
well difficult and not really what this
series is all about so what I did paste
- here is just some basic markup using
bootstrap classes to create a nicely
formatted form where I fetch the name of
the person purchasing this while the
guts in the shopping cart the address
the cardholder name which of course
might be the same as this name but might
also differ the credit card number the
expiration month of the credit card the
expiration year and the security code on
the back of your credit card this CVC
thing there now all these fields also
have their IDs like card name address so
all the input elements have these ideas
and besides that I only added bootstrap
classes to make them look nice and some
basic validation here with the required
attribute which is html5 attribute
making sure that well these fields are
actually required so that's all this
mark up offers for now notice that the
form action is not finished it's just a
slash here that's not what I want to
have in the end I want to have slash
something else later on and also notice
I have your total which actually isn't
displaying anything here of course I
want to show dollar well whatever the
user has to pay to kind of sum this up
on this page - so where where shall we
start I think a good start is to
actually output this total here and then
hook up this action here to D well
actual route to which I want to hook it
up sewed which I want to trigger upon
while submitting this form so let's
start by output of the total and of
course the place to start is is in the
routes folder in the index dot JSP I
will add a new route and you point out
one thing which I also read in the
comments yes of course it's not
necessarily the best practice to store
all the code in the routes file here you
may also create a new folder which you
call it's a controllers where you then
create your shop controller or whatever
where you then create new functions
which you export that's important export
every
thing with marshal exports so export an
object which has the different functions
and then you would just call these
functions from within the routes file
here that would be a more modular
approach I'm just keeping it all in this
file to find the right balance between
showing the best possible practice but
also keeping the code together and
making it easier to follow along and I
hope you understand this so what I will
do here is I will create a new route
which should be a get route and which P
which apish slash check out now this
will be the route which should load this
check out view I just populated with
HTML markup so here I will have my
default function with request response
and next and inside here what do I want
to do here well first I want to copy
this check here to see if the card
actually exists because if it doesn't
and the user just entered slash check
out in the URL manually well then I
don't want to display this page because
we don't have a shopping cart so in such
a case what I want to do is I want to
basically render another page and when I
do want to render is the shopping cart
page here indeed so that's just fine
just copying all of that check and
rendering another page or even better
would be now that a thing about it to
redirect the user to slash shopping cart
to cleanly load this route then but if
we have a valid shopping cart and we're
not reaching this code well in this case
what I want to do is I of course want to
grab my shopping cart I want to create a
new one that's the pattern we
established right and then I want to
render my shop slash checkout view so
this checkout HPS file in the shop
folder and here I will
then pass a JavaScript object holding
some variables to use in this view one
shall be the total which I can fetch
from my cart the total price and the
other data fields I will later on ad
will have something to do with possible
errors which could occur during charging
or validating the data but for now I
will only go with the total go back to
the checkout view and then here use
handlebars to well simply output the
total like so right when other thing I
will also do is I will adjust this
action here to also point to a checkout
route though this will not be the route
I created here not this ghat route
because remember here I have method post
so this will target a post route with a
path of checkout I haven't created that
yet but I will soon do so now in order
to actually reach this page here I also
need to change something here in my
shopping cart HPS file currently I do
have a button here but actually I want
to make this a link so I will use the
anchor tag and I'm talking about this
checkout button at the bottom I will
therefore also add the wrath attribute
and then of course I want to load my
check out route now this time since this
will be a get request automatically Here
I am referring to the route I created a
few seconds ago so with this I'm
restarting my server to see those
changes and if I reload my shopping cart
page it still looks the same as before
because the session wasn't deleted if I
hit checkout now I'm talking to the
checkout page which looks like that and
where I can now enter my personal data
to fill out this and as a next step to
then make sure or give me the
possibility of validating this credit
card data with stripe with the help of
stripe and as the final step then of
course submitted as well so that will be
what I work on next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
