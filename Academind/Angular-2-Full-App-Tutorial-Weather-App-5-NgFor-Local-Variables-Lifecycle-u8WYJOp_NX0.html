angular 2 series here in the last video
we created our Weber item class and we
created custom I don't know let's say
instance of this class and the output
that data that kind of dynamic data to
our template of string interpolation in
this video what I will do is I will
output an actual class or at least
actual list of Weber items let's do this
to start I will first add a new file
which will act as my data source in this
application which will hold all my Weber
items now there are different ways of
implementing such a thing and the way I
do it here probably it's not the way
we'll do it in a real application but we
will be able to come back to it later
and change it for now what I want to do
here is I will just call this Weber dot
data dot TS on all this file will hold
is it will export a constant so cons is
a type script keyword which is kind of
similar to var in JavaScript but it
doesn't actually create a variable but
we will get an completion compilation
error if you want to change it because
it is assumed to be constant immutable
so I will call this weather items and
this will be of type weather item and an
area of such items and at the beginning
it will just be an empty item and of
course you have to add the import to our
customer item class here at the top so
this will be my data storage and now
first thing is I will in have a variety
of component get rid of my constructor
here this of course means that as of now
we don't have a variety to be output
here we will take care about this in a
second as you can see currently our own
APIs of course broken now in my
Beverly's
and I will add a new property here which
I will call whether I tense plural
because this will be an area of Weber
items and this should just be of type
Weber item an area of these and then I
will add something here I will well I
want to set this equal to my exported
Weber items array now to be honest I
could just to this glamour and this
would work
of course at import to this exported
constant but that is not really the way
I want to do this what I want to do is I
want you well hook this weather items
property here up to my Weber items will
get my Weber items upon component
initialization I could do this in the
constructor but we shouldn't do any
heavy lifting there as a best practice
so I will I use an angle to life cycle
hook now I haven't talked about this
until now except for in very extensive
angles you serious I have on this
channel so to make it brief and what you
components have a certain life cycle
when they are initialized when change
detection runs and so on
now we can use this life cycle to do
some actions on certain moments for
example when in component is initialized
angular 2 well fire a certain method
which we may then use to implement our
own logic so this is the perfect place
here because if the component or when
the component is initialized I want to
do something I want to get the data for
this property now the the method I'm
looking for here is called ng on in it
but if I just implement this method here
this won't do anything because alert you
doesn't know it should call this method
in this component because it can't by
default call all the lifecycle hood
or lifecycle hook methods because most
of them aren't implemented and we would
get an error so it by default it calls
non to change this behavior I have to
implement an interface here now you
might be aware of the concept of
interfaces from other programming
languages basically it's a contract this
class applies or uses which says I
guarantee you that I fulfill all the
things this interface requires me to do
no we implement such an interface by
using the implements keyword here and
then the interface we're looking for is
called on in it this has to be imported
from angular 2 core now this on in an
interface requires only one thing queue
and I just also generates that but it's
really easy to implement the ng on init
method here which returns anything
that's all now we don't have to return
something here because any can also be
nothing so this method will now be
called because now in let you knows that
we're implementing this on init method
and that it is safe to call this ng on
init method this will be called directly
after this web of support has been
constructed and is initialized so for
what I want to do here is I want to set
my weather items now equal to weather
items well that has been a lot about lot
of talking for chest doing that which
could have been done here right but it
really is worth the effort because this
is the normal case that you're reaching
out to let's say some web service or
something which may take a time to get
you the data you want and therefore it's
really a good behavior to do this in
this life cycle hook here and do all the
data initialization you need for this
component to work so while this might
have taken a few minutes longer than it
needs to be in this case it is a good
practice which I would recommend you use
so now I get my Webber items hooked up
here but still we're not
putting anything the first thing is I
want to repeat this Weber item component
as often as we do have lever items in
this area so for each element in this
area I need a Weber item to do this I
use a bolt in angular2 directive the ng4
directive the ng4 directive is a
structural directive which means it
changes the structure of my Dom here and
I implemented by using
ng4 with a star in front of it the star
is important because it adds I got you
that it will call a structural directive
that's the syntax we use here and in the
quotation marks here
I write the actual looping expression so
to say I will write hashtag weather item
of whether I tense and at all and this
will loop through all my weather items
and assign each weber item of each
iteration to this local variable weber
item now a local variable is defined
with a hashtag in front of it and local
variable means we can use it in the
template but nowhere else not only
killed down here not in our components
only in this template can we use local
variables and you can not only define
local variables in loops like here but
we might also assign a local where it
like this to this section now the
section elementary whole element is
bound to this local variable which you
can access them throughout this well
template and we will see this in later
lectures too now at the moment obviously
I don't have any Webber I Tunes so back
and I've ever data I will just populate
this with some dummy data with two
entries let's say so I will create a new
Webber item the first one should again
be London with rainy weather and let's
say yeah sixty trees and then I want to
have New York let's say sunny there and
has refreshing
ten degrees so this is my dummy data and
now if we have a look at our template or
a tour page here you see that we have
two boxes but obviously no data is
displayed because what's happening now
we're looping through all the other
items here and we're creating a weather
item component for each Webber item in
my array which has two items which is
what we see two boxes here but currently
we're not passing the data of the
current well element of each iteration
to this who ever item component because
in our Webber item component while we're
so outputting the data which we find in
our Webber item property R and this is
not set anywhere so this does not work
for destroy we need to somehow pass data
from the parent to child so from our
weather list component to old weather
item component and this awesome
cliffhanger ahead will be done in the
next video see you there
