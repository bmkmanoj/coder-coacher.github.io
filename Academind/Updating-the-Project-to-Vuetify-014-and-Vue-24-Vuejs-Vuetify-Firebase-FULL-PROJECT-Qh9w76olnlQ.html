verified firebase project that's a super
short video and it might not matter to
you if you already created your project
with a later version we'll all unify but
I use two version 0.13 and as I
announced that earlier video from time
to time things are going to change now
if you don't upgrade the version you
don't need to change anything but since
view chase version 2.4 was also released
we can upgrade here so what I'll do is
I'll actually upgrade this to version 2
4.1 for view and 0.14 for a beautiful
now these versions generally don't break
a lot or not nothing at all almost but
for do defi there are two changes we
need to implement now first of all once
you change two versions here in the
package to Jason that alone doesn't do
anything so you actually need to ensure
that you also install these new versions
by rerunning NPM install feel free to
delete the node modules folder before
you run this command in case you're
running into any errors with that
command with that it's now updated to
the latest version so both view and
beautify and now we need to change
something in our source code otherwise
it will not work if I would run NPM run
Def write this without updating its wait
for the development server to start here
now if we're looking at our application
you see well it still does work here
also if they decrease that but actually
there were some changes with the latest
version of beautify which you can read
about in their release notes that
require us to implement queue changes
which will otherwise break our code in
the future the first one were actually
both are in the app dot view file here
with one can now remove the native
modifier because due to some changes
introduced by with butyl you a 2.4 we
now don't need it anymore
so that is now handled differently
behind the scenes we cannot listen to
the click event without that and
additionally
we may now remove the router property
here having the tooling here is all we
need and behind the scenes you beautify
will figure out that we want to use the
router so that router link is neither
anymore
neither on the list style nor on the
button ear now with that if we save that
and let it recompile you will see that
our application we reload it still works
just as it did before so that's all
working and if we expand this empty the
developer tools you see we don't get an
error the drawer is also still working
that's the tiny update just wanted to
bring this to your attention the source
code attached to these videos or shown
in the github repository actually is
updated from now on to that version I
just want to highlight that you are
aware of this now with that let's go
back to a real video where we build
something new instead of just updating
something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
