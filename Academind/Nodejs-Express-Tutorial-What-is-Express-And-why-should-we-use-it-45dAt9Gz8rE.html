you here
so we already played around with node
quite a bit we send responses we render
HTML and we created our own routing
let's have a look at that routing for
example so here in my app touch as file
this is how the routing looks like now
this works fine but as you can see
that's a lot of code for what for
Chester Rally for just getting the path
and sending a response and just would
get even more complicated if we were to
add some some middleware some checks and
so on so when working with no chance on
its own with pure notes yes we have to
write everything on our own like we do
have to do this when we're working with
pure PHP for example without any
framework every logic parsing routes or
passing URLs and creating routing
actions all checks rendering everything
has to be written by ourselves notice
it's not only annoying it's also
error-prone it might be insecure and so
on we should focus on a business logic
and not on the repetitive tasks of well
for example parsing URLs and setting up
routes in this way we're doing it right
here
so therefore it we're using frameworks
in well pretty much all languages right
in PHP we might use wearable which you
can also find in this channel here a
node a very popular framework but not
the only one to say that is Express
Express built upon node and it just
offers us a lot of tools which make
writing node apps more fun easier it
implements a lot functionalities that
will take care about all that
nitty-gritty stuff here and allow us to
focus on a business logic to quickly set
up routes to easily render stuff to
scream and
on so this is what Express does and for
example Express also allows us requires
us to use templating engine to create
our HTML files to dynamically inject
values into these files and so on so it
really covers a lot of things we want to
do on our own I realize and which would
be very annoying and it does so in a
fast and optimized and secure way
therefore using such a framework be it
Express or any other node framework it's
definitely a good idea for the rest of
this course for the next videos we'll
use Express and in the next video we'll
start by setting up Express and going
food basic folder structure we'll have
in Section Express app see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
