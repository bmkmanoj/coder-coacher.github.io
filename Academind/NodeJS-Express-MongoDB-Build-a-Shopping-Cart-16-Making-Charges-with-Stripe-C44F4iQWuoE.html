difficult as before you saw well
stripe has a good documentation and the
same is true for charges on the back end
here we should go on API libraries and
there you will find different languages
and how to implement stripe now as you
see for no js' we should first install
stripe so let's do this
I'll open up my console skip out of my
server here and I will run NPM install
stripe though I will add the save flag
here to also will create an entry new
package.json file with that stripe got
installed and I'm ready to use it in an
order to use that we check out in noches
API Docs now these Doc's here are also
great they provide us detailed
documentation about the different stripe
features and I'm interested in charging
the client here or the customer there
from go-to charges and then I can learn
how to create a charge now as before
here we see our real key not just any
testing he does two key from our API
settings though this time it's the
secret key that's the one we're using on
the server and since the server
unlike the JavaScript on our front-end
isn't accessible by everyone it's safe
to use our public excuse me or a secret
key there so I can simply copy this code
here to make the charge on the server of
course I'll need some adjustment but
I'll come back to this so I'll go back
to my editor go to the routes index file
and first I will create a new route this
should be a post route and I will also
use slash checkout as a path here this
is the route I try to access when
successfully submitting D credit card
data form D checkout form now in here
what I want to do is well I will paste
in the code I copied from the stripe
page but before actually using this I'll
copy this check where I redirect if we
don't have a card so
if we somehow got to this page in a
different way
and thereafter I'm recreating the card
like we did before and then I'm good to
go to use stripe so this is the test
private key to secret key and then here
we're creating our charge now as you can
see this is pretty self descriptive we
get the amount and the amount that's
important to understand sand dollar
sensor or incense basically and always
the smallest now my English is a bit
limited it might be smallest piece each
currency like cents and dollars or in
Euro it will also be cents
so if we have something that costs forty
dollars it would actually have to be
4000 cents here that's important to
understand so therefore the amount we
use will be our card total price
multiplied by 100 since our total price
will be stored in full dollars and the
currency should be US dollars now the
source here this actually is just a
dummy key the source will be the token
created by the stripe JavaScript SDK
which validated the credit card and have
a look at the last video if this is
unclear to you now as you might remember
we're adding this token as a hidden
input field here in our check out chase
file and therefore I can simply access
it here on my request body and then
stripe token stripe token is simply the
name of this hidden input field so that
is my stripe token and you may make any
description here I'm just going to name
it test charge and with that we were
basically making the charge but of
course we also need to handle possible
results of the charge and this will be
called well as the description says here
well whenever this is done so
asynchronously of course I want to check
if we got an error during the charge in
this case I want you flashed as
with the flash package we installed
early and a serious and I will store it
in an error object here and what I want
to store is the message which stripe
will provide for me and then I want to
let say redirect the user to the
checkout page and I'll come back to
displaying this error in a second if we
are successful though I also want to
flash something I want to flash
something into a success object here and
I want to say successfully bought
product something like that I also then
want to set my cart equal to null so
clear the card and I want to redirect to
the index page and I will do something
about displaying this success message in
a second as well but first I want to
talk about something else
you might have noticed that I'm
resetting the cart I might have gotten
my money but I'm not sending my customer
the book he bought right well that's
something which will come in the next
video is because as you might have also
noticed we never request a user to login
the user is able to well charge his own
credit card anonymously so that's a
great business model for us we get money
we don't have to send anything and we
don't even know who bought it besides
the information which gets sent with the
charge to our stripe account so that
certainly may take some improvement but
for now I'm leaving it like this to show
how to make a charge before adding other
pieces to it so first let me get back to
displaying the error and the success
message here let's start with the error
I will display this on a checkout page I
already got my charge error place here
but I need you well adjust this a little
bit for one I only want to attach this
hidden class here if we don't have an
error now since this can now also be
sent from the server I need to change
the way this view is rendered so I will
use
handlebars here a little if statement
and check if I got no errors in which
case I would add the hidden class
otherwise well this will not get
attached and here I conditionally also
want to set a text which should be error
message here for example now currently
I'm not sending this so back in the yet
check out route here I need to add these
two pieces to this function I will first
create a new variable called error
message here which should be request
flash into an error object and then the
first element in the array and why do I
access this like this well the connect
flash package which we're using for that
will basically store multiple items into
this error object or into an array in
this error object here so it will
basically use this error object here as
kind of a map where we have keys and
values to values being the error
messages or the messages in general and
the keys being well like Araki's 0 2
well highest number of messages you
stored there now I know that I will only
store one error here that's the one I'm
flashing here when we got an error and
I'm retrieving it by accessing the first
element or the element with the key of 0
so that gives me the error and with that
I'm able to pass this error message to
my view and I also need to pass the no
error field here or no error variable
which is just a check if error message
is actually anything else or it's not
null so this will be true if we got no
errors otherwise will be false which is
to behavior I want because if we do have
errors that
to hide this hidden class or I don't
want to use this hidden class so that
the error message being out but here is
clearly visible I hope that's clear how
that works and if I do get an error
through my front and credit card
validation here I'm overwriting this
anyways which is the behavior I do want
so that's the error case let's also
handle the success case so in the index
dot HBS file that's the file I will
redirect you if we're successful here at
the end redirect to just slash is the
indexed or HBS file wherever land well
here I want to add new code at the very
top of this file I want to add a
bootstrap class or bootstrap row here
and then just some bootstrap styled def
here which is nicely centered and of
course style is according to your needs
I will add an idea which I will call
success here for example we ran Dave
with an idea of success I mean there
should also get some butcher classes
alert but this time alert success not
alert danger as the air or they've had
and I will also add a bootstrap excuse
me a handlebars if statement here to
only show this or to add this hidden
class here if we have no message because
then of course I don't want to show this
so it is just a similar logic as with
the error case before and I will make
sure to pass no message in a few seconds
ago yeah I had so in a few seconds where
it's been a long day so in the case that
we do have a message well I want to
output it here of course so pretty
similar to the error case just with
success and of course I need a final
adjustment in my routes file now here at
the top route where I load my index page
I want to make sure to show such a
success message message if I do have one
so I will set my success message to be
well the message I get from my flash
storage here I will access the success
object of course the first element as
well and this will be the message I
store in this flash storage right here
success and I only store one element
that's why I only need to fetch one
element here then I can return this here
so I will set my success message equal
to success message of course make sure
that your key names here match the names
of the variables you're using here on
your view and like the four with the
errors I also need my no messages field
here which should be well the inverse of
success message so basically this will
be true if we have no massive chasm it
will be
Falls if we have at least one message so
no messages here there should also be no
messages if I use it as a key name in
the routes file and with that that
should be good too well to work let's
try if everything works as intended by
restarting the server going over here
and reloading the Edie page here and
well one thing doesn't work is that I
see this alert field here that should be
the case let's see what that happens
well the reason is very simple
there should be no error not no errors
since well I have no error as a key name
here I was talking about the importance
of naming this right a few seconds ago
so yeah here you go
so every Lotus now looks much better let
me enter some dummy data here Chris and
I will fetch a valid credit card number
again using the one from the getting
started example here enter this here
enter a valid date in the future and a
free number free digit a code here click
buy now and looks pretty good we are
forwarded to the front and you see
successfully bought product one thing
which is not working is that the card is
still there so we need to work on that
but if we have a look at the stripe back
and now go back to the dashboard refresh
this page we should see that some charge
was made yeah looks good we made a
charge 62 euros which looks a bit too
much if we're charging $50 here to be
honest a total so yeah yeah 43 the yours
that's fine so the only thing that's not
really working is that the shopping cart
isn't cleared so let's have a look at
that yeah the reason for this is that of
course I need to clear my session
card here so request session card so if
I save this and restart my server now
reload my page it's still there of
course so I will just quickly charge
myself again good thing is it's just
testing charge of charges charges right
so whoops that's the wrong year that
won't work so let's try this again bye
now we're getting forwarded and the
shopping cart is gone no items in cart
great so well that really was a lot of
work but we get a working basic shopping
cart now of course important feature is
still missing we're not storing the user
information we're not requesting the
user to log in we're not storing in our
database we couldn't send the products
the user pod but hey we get the money
right we got what we wanted the charges
are working we're able to validate key
payment data the user entered and we're
able to actually make a charge Fu's
stripe as you see it worked instantly
here so that has been a major step in
the next videos of course I'll focus on
actually forcing the user to log in
storing user information so that in a
real application you would be able to
then send whatever the user bought to
the user see you in the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
